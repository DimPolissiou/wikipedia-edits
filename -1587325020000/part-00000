The seventh king of the empire, [[Vijaya Raghunatha Sethupathi]] (also called Kelvan Sethupathy) ruled from 1674 to 1710 and was succeeded by his sister's son Vijia Regunatha Sethupathy. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Sundareswara Regunatha Sethupathy in 1726. Bavani Sankara Thevan, the illegitimate son of Regunatha Sethupathy aligned with the Rajah of Tanjore to attack Ramnad. Though Bavani won, he did not honour the earlier decision to cede some portions of the empire to the King of Tanjore. He quarrelled with Sasivarna Periya Oodaya Thevar and sent him out of his province. Both Sasivarna and Kattaya Thevar, the brother of Sundareswara, aligned with the Rajah of Tanjore. Both of them conquered Bavani in 1730 with the help of the army of Tanjore. Kattaya Thevar divided the kingdom into five provinces and gave two to Sasivarna, who became the first king of Sivaganga. As per legend, Sasivarna built the Teppakulam and fort around the spring \"Sivaganga\", where he met his spiritual guru Sathappier. As per another account, Sasivarna was appointed as the king by the [[Nawab of Carnatic]].<ref>[[#Iyer|Iyer 1899]], pp. i-ii</ref> Sasivarna died at around 1750 and his son Muthuvaduganatha Periya Udaya Thevar took over the reign. He was shot dead in 1780 by Nawab's troops. His widow [[Velu Nachiyar]] and infant [[Vellacci]] fled the region and were aided by the two [[Maruthu Pandiyar|Maruthu brothers]] namely Periya Maruthu and Chinna Maruthu. Velu Nachiyar ruled the region till 1790, when her daughter succeeded her. The brothers still continued the support the new queen. The brothers rebelled against the British East India Company and Nawab of Carnatic, who was supporting the Company. The brothers were later captured and hanged in Tirupathoor. The Company appointed Gowry Vallaba Periya Oodaya Thevar as the Zamindar of Sivaganga in 1801.<ref>[[#Iyer|Iyer 1899]], pp. iii-iv</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Municipality Office-Sivagangai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sivaganga Municipality Office]]\nSivaganga has an average elevation of 102&nbsp;metres (334&nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]]).The town has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]].

Though Bavani won, he did not honour the earlier decision to cede some portions of the empire to the King of Tanjore. He quarrelled with Sasivarna Periya Oodaya Thevar and sent him out of his province. Both Sasivarna and Kattaya Thevar, the brother of Sundareswara, aligned with the Rajah of Tanjore. Both of them conquered Bavani in 1730 with the help of the army of Tanjore. Kattaya Thevar divided the kingdom into five provinces and gave two to Sasivarna, who became the first king of Sivaganga. As per legend, Sasivarna built the Teppakulam and fort around the spring \"Sivaganga\", where he met his spiritual guru Sathappier. As per another account, Sasivarna was appointed as the king by the [[Nawab of Carnatic]].<ref>[[#Iyer|Iyer 1899]], pp. i-ii</ref> Sasivarna died at around 1750 and his son Muthuvaduganatha Periya Udaya Thevar took over the reign. He was shot dead in 1780 by Nawab's troops. His widow [[Velu Nachiyar]] and infant [[Vellacci]] fled the region and were aided by the two [[Maruthu Pandiyar|Maruthu brothers]] namely Periya Maruthu and Chinna Maruthu. Velu Nachiyar ruled the region till 1790, when her daughter succeeded her. The brothers still continued the support the new queen. The brothers rebelled against the British East India Company and Nawab of Carnatic, who was supporting the Company. The brothers were later captured and hanged in Tirupathoor. The Company appointed Gowry Vallaba Periya Oodaya Thevar as the Zamindar of Sivaganga in 1801.<ref>[[#Iyer|Iyer 1899]], pp. iii-iv</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Municipality Office-Sivagangai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sivaganga Municipality Office]]\nSivaganga has an average elevation of 102&nbsp;metres (334&nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]]).The town has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]].

In the mid-1990s the arm control system was redesigned to increase the payload capability to {{convert|3293|kg|abbr=on}} in order to support space station assembly operations. While able to maneuver payloads with the mass of a loaded bus in space, the arm motors cannot lift the arm's own weight when on the ground.<ref name=\"UofAEngMag\" /> NASA therefore developed a model of the arm for use at its training facility within the Johnson Space Center located in Houston, Texas. The Canadarm can also retrieve, repair and deploy satellites, provide a mobile extension ladder for extravehicular activity crew members for work stations or foot restraints, and be used as an inspection aid to allow the flight crew members to view the orbiter's or payload's surfaces through a television camera on the Canadarm.\n\nThe basic Canadarm configuration consists of a manipulator arm, a Canadarm display and control panel, including rotational and translational hand controllers at the orbiter aft flight deck flight crew station, and a manipulator controller interface unit that interfaces with the orbiter computer.\nOne crew member operates the Canadarm from the aft flight deck control station, and a second crew member usually assists with television camera operations. This allows the Canadarm operator to view Canadarm operations through the aft flight deck payload and overhead windows and through the closed-circuit television monitors at the aft flight deck station.\n\nThe Canadarm is outfitted with an explosive-based mechanism to allow the arm to be jettisoned. This safety system would have allowed the Orbiter's payload bay doors to be closed in the event that the arm failed in an extended position and was not able to be retracted.<ref name=UofAEngMag>{{cite news|author=Garry Lindberg|title=Canadarm and its U of A Connections|url=http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/uofaengineer/article.cfm?article=28369&issue=28299|work=U of A Engineer Magazine|publisher=University of Alberta|access-date=7 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041129001731/http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/uofaengineer/article.cfm?article=28369&issue=28299|archivedate=29 November 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadarm is {{convert|15.2|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}} diameter with six [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]].

The Canadarm has six joints that correspond roughly to the joints of the human arm, with shoulder yaw and pitch joints, an elbow pitch joint, and wrist pitch, yaw, and roll joints. The [[Robot end effector|end effector]] is the unit at the end of the wrist that grapples the payload's [[grapple fixture]]. The two lightweight boom segments are called the upper and lower arms.

The Canadarm can also retrieve, repair and deploy satellites, provide a mobile extension ladder for extravehicular activity crew members for work stations or foot restraints, and be used as an inspection aid to allow the flight crew members to view the orbiter's or payload's surfaces through a television camera on the Canadarm.\n\nThe basic Canadarm configuration consists of a manipulator arm, a Canadarm display and control panel, including rotational and translational hand controllers at the orbiter aft flight deck flight crew station, and a manipulator controller interface unit that interfaces with the orbiter computer.\nOne crew member operates the Canadarm from the aft flight deck control station, and a second crew member usually assists with television camera operations. This allows the Canadarm operator to view Canadarm operations through the aft flight deck payload and overhead windows and through the closed-circuit television monitors at the aft flight deck station.\n\nThe Canadarm is outfitted with an explosive-based mechanism to allow the arm to be jettisoned. This safety system would have allowed the Orbiter's payload bay doors to be closed in the event that the arm failed in an extended position and was not able to be retracted.<ref name=UofAEngMag>{{cite news|author=Garry Lindberg|title=Canadarm and its U of A Connections|url=http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/uofaengineer/article.cfm?article=28369&issue=28299|work=U of A Engineer Magazine|publisher=University of Alberta|access-date=7 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041129001731/http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/uofaengineer/article.cfm?article=28369&issue=28299|archivedate=29 November 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadarm is {{convert|15.2|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}} diameter with six [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. It weighs {{convert|410|kg|abbr=on}} by itself, and {{convert|450|kg|abbr=on}} as part of the total system. The Canadarm has six joints that correspond roughly to the joints of the human arm, with shoulder yaw and pitch joints, an elbow pitch joint, and wrist pitch, yaw, and roll joints. The [[Robot end effector|end effector]] is the unit at the end of the wrist that grapples the payload's [[grapple fixture]]. The two lightweight boom segments are called the upper and lower arms. The upper boom connects the shoulder and elbow joints, and the lower boom connects the elbow and wrist joints.\n\n==Service history==\n[[File:Wisoff on the Arm - GPN-2000-001069.jpg|thumb|Astronaut on the end of the arm, 1993.]]\n[[File:STS-116 - P5 Truss hand-off to ISS (NASA S116-E-05765).jpg|thumb|315px|right|The Canadarm2 moves toward a P5 truss section, being held by ''Discovery''{{'}}s Canadarm, in preparation for a hand-off during [[STS-116]].]]\nA simulated Canadarm installed on the {{OV|101}} was seen when the prototype orbiter's payload bay doors were open to test hangar facilities early in the shuttle program.<ref>{{cite news | first=Justin |last=Ray | url=http://spaceflightnow.com/delta/d352/omcf/  | title=Vandenberg's space shuttle hangar | date=5 January 2011 | work=Space Flight Now | access-date=27 October 2012}}</ref> The Canadarm was first tested in orbit in 1981, on {{OV|102}}'s [[STS-2]] mission.

The Flyers were an independent squad for most of their existence, but are remembered mostly for their very brief stint in the American Professional Football Association (later known as the [[National Football League]]). With only three official league games, one in 1920 and two in 1921, the Flyers are the third-shortest-lived team in league history, behind the two games of the [[New York Brickley Giants|original New York Giants]] and the one game of the [[Tonawanda Kardex Lumbermen]], and the shortest by a team not from the state of [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe origins of the team show that it evolved from the Congerville (Muncie) Athletic Club, which dates back to at least 1905.<ref name=\"sye2002-1\">[[#Sye2002|Sye]] (2002), p. 1</ref> Local newspapers provided spotty coverage of the team.

In 1916, the Congerville Athletic Club team and the Congerville Flyers team merged and Muncie was represented by the Congerville Flyers.\n\n===The Flyers===\nThe Congerville Muncie Flyers evolved from a team called the '''Congerville Thirds'''. This team was later renamed the Congerville Flyers. The 1915 edition of the Flyers proved to be a respectable team, finishing with a 5\u20133\u20133 record. Their star player was local player Cooney Checkeye. Playing all its games on the road, the 1916 Flyers had a disappointing year, finishing with a 2\u20136\u20131 record. Also representing Congerville in 1915 and 1916 was the [[Congerville Eagles]]. This lightweight team was closely associated with the Flyers, sometimes lending the heavyweight team a player or two when they were short due to injuries.\n\n===World War I===\nThe Congerville Flyers played briefly in 1917, but they did not field a team in 1918 due to the United States involvement in [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu|influenza epidemic]]. In September 1917, [[Earl Ball]] announced that he had organized a team. Scheduled to be on this team were famous college players: [[Dick Abrel]] of [[Purdue University|Purdue]] and [[Al Feeney]] of [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]]. Also scheduled to play was [[Christian Chambers]], formerly of the [[Fort Wayne Friars]]. The team was to be led by local hero [[Cooney Checkaye]]. Ball invited ten more players to come to practice the next morning. However, a week later, on September 9, Ball announced that he had released all the players he had signed and that he would not be fielding a team due to the war. The local press was convinced that had Muncie fielded this team, it would have no doubt been strong contenders for the state championship.\n\n===The NFL era===\nWith the war ended, football came back to life in eastern Indiana. The Flyers played some strong teams, including the [[Wabash Athletic Association]], [[Fort Wayne War Vets]], and Cincinnati Celts. The 1919 team finished with a 4\u20131\u20131 record. In [[1920 NFL season|1920]], the Flyers were one of the original 14 teams in the [[American Professional Football Association]], which later became the National Football League. In the second ever NFL game, the [[Rock Island Independents]] destroyed the Muncie Flyers 45\u20130. The following week, the [[Decatur Staleys]] canceled their game with the Flyers. Muncie found it difficult to schedule another game. While the team was idle, most of its players signed to play with other local teams. The Flyers did have a game scheduled against the [[Dayton Triangles]] on November 7, 1920, but that game was rained out. The Flyers came back in late November and early December and won three non-APFA games, finishing with a 3\u20131\u20130 overall (0\u20131\u20130 APFA) record. Returning to the APFA in [[1921 NFL season|1921]], the Flyers opened the season by crushing the non-APFA [[Elwood Legion]], then lost league games against the [[Evansville Crimson Giants]], and, at home, against the [[Cincinnati Celts]]. They were scheduled to play on November 13, 1921, against the [[Green Bay Packers]], but that game was canceled, leaving the Flyers with a 1\u20132\u20130 overall (0\u20132\u20130 APFA) record. The Flyers' mark in APFA football was an unimpressive 0\u20133\u20130. But during 1920 and 1921, the Flyers posted a 4\u20130\u20130 mark against non-APFA teams. Including 1919, the Flyers posted an 8\u20131\u20131 record against non-APFA teams.\n\n===Post-NFL===\nAfter leaving the APFA, the Muncie Flyers reverted to their original name of the Congerville Flyers. Due to weak fan support, the Flyers played almost all their [[Traveling team|games on the road]] from in 1922, 1923, and 1924. The Flyers did play one home game, in 1924, that was against the \"Notre Dame Reserves of Brownson Hall\". The Flyers lost 47\u20130. Some speculate that the team they played was not really reserves from Notre Dame, but the strong [[South Bend Arrows]]. During those three years, the road-bound Flyers finished with a respectable 10\u20138\u20133 record. In 1925, the Flyers could not find a home field in Muncie, so they based their team out of neighboring [[Jonesboro, Indiana|Jonesboro]]. The team was referred to as the '''Jonesboro Flyers''' and played 9 of 11 games in Jonesboro, finishing with a 6\u20132\u20133 record.\n\n==Season-by-season==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Including 1919, the Flyers posted an 8\u20131\u20131 record against non-APFA teams.\n\n===Post-NFL===\nAfter leaving the APFA, the Muncie Flyers reverted to their original name of the Congerville Flyers. Due to weak fan support, the Flyers played almost all their [[Traveling team|games on the road]] from in 1922, 1923, and 1924. The Flyers did play one home game, in 1924, that was against the \"Notre Dame Reserves of Brownson Hall\". The Flyers lost 47\u20130. Some speculate that the team they played was not really reserves from Notre Dame, but the strong [[South Bend Arrows]]. During those three years, the road-bound Flyers finished with a respectable 10\u20138\u20133 record. In 1925, the Flyers could not find a home field in Muncie, so they based their team out of neighboring [[Jonesboro, Indiana|Jonesboro]]. The team was referred to as the '''Jonesboro Flyers''' and played 9 of 11 games in Jonesboro, finishing with a 6\u20132\u20133 record.\n\n==Season-by-season==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It stars the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[antihero]] the [[Punisher]] (Frank Castle) and co-stars [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Nick Fury]] as the second player's character as they embark on a mission to kill the crime lord the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] and bring down his organization. While following the same general formula as Capcom's previous beat 'em ups, the game has a range of usable weapons and a comics-style presentation.\n\n''The Punisher'' gained significant popularity in arcades and is widely regarded as one of the best titles in the beat 'em up genre as well as one of the best video game adaptations of comic books. A [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] port was developed by [[Sculptured Software]] and published by Capcom to mixed reviews and commercial failure.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Punisher arcade gameplay.png|thumb|left|[[cooperative gameplay|Co-op gameplay]] in Stage 3 \"Waterfront Warfare\" of the arcade version, with the [[Punisher]] and [[Nick Fury]] facing the [[Pretty Boy (comics)|Pretty Boys]] and ninja women|alt=|300x300px]]\n\n''The Punisher'' follows the same [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[beat'em up]] formula [[Capcom]] established in ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'' and ''[[Captain Commando]]''<ref name=gamepower/> as the protagonists engage ordinary foes and [[Boss (video gaming)|stage bosses]]. As in most beat'em up games of this kind, progression through the game is achieved by systematically dispatching all common enemies and proceeding to the right (or left), and defeating the bosses met at the end of each [[Level (video gaming)|stage]]. Unlike in ''Final Fight'', the size, abilities and tactics of both [[player character]]s (the [[Punisher]] and [[Nick Fury]]) are essentially interchangeable; they both use the same basic moves, such as punches, kicks and throws, which can be chained into [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]]s, as well as similar special attacks.<ref name=if/><ref name=vgc/> Basic attacks can be combined to cause extra damage to enemies.<ref name=allgame/> The game is presented in a comic book-like style, including featuring on-screen onomatopoeias such as \"BLAM!\" for gunshots.<ref name=gamestalker>{{cite web |last=Damen |first=Pepijn |url=http://www.gamestalker.nl/klapper-woensdag-the-punisher/ |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130927134915/http://www.gamestalker.nl/klapper-woensdag-the-punisher/ |archivedate=27 September 2013 |title=Klapper Woensdag The Punisher |work=Gamestalker |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nVarious melee (including baseball bats and Japanese swords) and thrown weapons (including knives and [[shuriken]])<ref name=allgame/> as well as improvised weapons (such as lead pipes, car tires<ref name=gamestalker/> and a crude flamethrower<ref name=heavy/>) can be picked up during regular combat. Weapons can be dropped by killed enemies or obtained from smashing various containers throughout the stages. When the player is armed with a weapon, its durability will be displayed alongside the player's health, showing how much it can be used until it breaks apart. Treasure can also be found in containers, awarding the player with bonus [[Score (game)|score points]] once collected (jewelry also appears after defeating female enemies). Health can be replenished by picking up food, which can also give bonus points.<ref name=allgame/> The game distinguished itself by the relatively high level of violence in a video game of the era,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 1993|title=Quarter Crunchers: The Punisher|url=|journal=GameFan|volume=1-08|pages=90|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> as well by the frequent use of firearms,<ref name=if/><ref name=nerd/> including an [[Ingram MAC-10|Ingram]] and a [[M16 rifle|M16]].<ref name=heavy/> There are several sections of the game when gun-wielding enemies appear to which the characters draw their handguns, enabling the player to shoot them. Player characters can also pick up and collect hand grenades that can be deployed at a moment of choice.<ref name=vgc/><ref name=allgame/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the games intro, U.S. Marine Captain Frank Castle enjoys a picnic with his family in Central Park. The Castle family accidentally discovered a mob killing. Fearing any witnesses, the killers gunned down the family. To avenge them and all others like them Frank becomes The Punisher. The game begins in an illegal casino and the streets of the [[New York City]], with the merciless [[vigilante]] Frank \"the Punisher\" Castle (optionally partnered with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Nick Fury) in pursuit of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] enforcer Bruno Costa who ordered the killing of Castle's family; the chase ends with a fight against Chester Scully (a minor villain from the comics). Frank \"interrogates\" Scully, gets the information he needs, and then promptly shoots him. Still on track of Bruno, the Punisher infiltrates the mob's Pantaberde resort in Florida via a water duct. He breaks into a hotel and corners Bruno, who is suddenly killed by a robot called Guardroid, who tells Frank the Kingpin has programmed him to terminate him, which the Punisher must then take on.\n\nThe Punisher then raids a major drug-smuggling ring at the local harbor, which ends with him confronting [[Bonebreaker]] in a waterfront warehouse. After that, the Punisher attacks the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s poppy field at a cave in [[Arizona]]. The Punisher boards and destroys a freight train which is commanded by [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwhacker]].\n\nAt that point, the Kingpin decides that he has lost enough henchmen and money to the Punisher's actions. He puts a hefty contract out on him, and he is chased by assassins from his hideout and through a forest. After defeating another Guardroid, the Punisher in turn assaults the King Building skyscraper. He fights his way through [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]] and other enemies to the final showdown against the Kingpin himself. After the Kingpin is defeated, the entire tower collapses, but the Kingpin is not found among the many dead criminals in the rubble.\n\n==Development and release==\n===Arcade===\n''The Punisher'' for the arcades was released in April 1993,<ref name=gamestalker/> marking the beginning of the partnership between [[Marvel Comics]] and Capcom, which led to the series ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]''.<ref name=\"MvC:OCW\">{{cite book|title=Marvel vs. Capcom: Official Complete Works|author=UDON Entertainment|year=2012|publisher=Diamond Comics|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9781926778495|page=2}}</ref> The game used a new arcade system, allowing over 10 enemies to appear on screen at the same time without slowdowns.<ref name=\":0\" /> A pre-release version included some cut content such as rocket launchers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1993|title=The Punisher|url=|journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly|volume=46|pages=58|via=}}</ref> Artworks from the game were featured in the 2012 art book ''Marvel vs. Capcom: Official Complete Works'' by [[Udon Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.udonentertainment.com/blog/udon/2012-in-review-marvel-vs-capcom-official-complete-works/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306135025/http://www.udonentertainment.com/blog/news/2012-in-review-marvel-vs-capcom-official-complete-works |archivedate=6 March 2016 |title=Blog Archive \u00bb Marvel vs. Capcom Official Complete Works (UDON 2012 in Review) |work=[[Udon Entertainment]] |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref> In 2019, the game was announced to one of the titles to be includes in the Marvel Arcade1Up arcade cabinet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/classic-marvel-arcade-cabinets-announced-at-e3-2019|title=Classic Marvel Arcade Cabinets Announced at E3 2019 {{!}} News {{!}} Marvel|website=Marvel Entertainment|language=en|access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Genesis===\nA console port of ''The Punisher'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] in North America in 1994 and for the [[PAL region]] Mega Drive in April 1995.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/stream/HobbyConsolas043/Hobby_Consolas_043#page/n55/mode/2up |title=The Punisher |date=April 1995 |work=[[Hobby Consolas]] |issue=43 |pages=56\u201357}}</ref> This version, while published by Capcom, was developed by an independent American company [[Sculptured Software]].<ref name=rank/> In addition to the worse graphics and sound, lesser variety of enemies, and a smaller number of objects on screen than in the original, many of the previously breakable background objects were rendered unbreakable due to the limitations of the Genesis' hardware.<ref name=gamestalker/>\n\nThis version also contains some [[video game censorship|content censorship]], including removing the most explicit violence as well as the animation of Fury smoking his cigar,<ref name=if/> and female ninja enemies with skimpy outfits becoming fully clothed.<ref name=gamestalker/> The port also comes with three difficulty settings,<ref name=vgc>''Video Games & Computer Entertainment'' issue 80 (September 1995), page 26.</ref> but the Easy setting ends after only three stages and the game can be properly completed only on Normal or Hard.

It stars the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[antihero]] the [[Punisher]] (Frank Castle) and co-stars [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Nick Fury]] as the second player's character as they embark on a mission to kill the crime lord the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] and bring down his organization. While following the same general formula as Capcom's previous beat 'em ups, the game has a range of usable weapons and a comics-style presentation.\n\n''The Punisher'' gained significant popularity in arcades and is widely regarded as one of the best titles in the beat 'em up genre as well as one of the best video game adaptations of comic books. A [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] port was developed by [[Sculptured Software]] and published by Capcom to mixed reviews and commercial failure.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Punisher arcade gameplay.png|thumb|left|[[cooperative gameplay|Co-op gameplay]] in Stage 3 \"Waterfront Warfare\" of the arcade version, with the [[Punisher]] and [[Nick Fury]] facing the [[Pretty Boy (comics)|Pretty Boys]] and ninja women|alt=|300x300px]]\n\n''The Punisher'' follows the same [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[beat'em up]] formula [[Capcom]] established in ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'' and ''[[Captain Commando]]''<ref name=gamepower/> as the protagonists engage ordinary foes and [[Boss (video gaming)|stage bosses]]. As in most beat'em up games of this kind, progression through the game is achieved by systematically dispatching all common enemies and proceeding to the right (or left), and defeating the bosses met at the end of each [[Level (video gaming)|stage]]. Unlike in ''Final Fight'', the size, abilities and tactics of both [[player character]]s (the [[Punisher]] and [[Nick Fury]]) are essentially interchangeable; they both use the same basic moves, such as punches, kicks and throws, which can be chained into [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]]s, as well as similar special attacks.<ref name=if/><ref name=vgc/> Basic attacks can be combined to cause extra damage to enemies.<ref name=allgame/> The game is presented in a comic book-like style, including featuring on-screen onomatopoeias such as \"BLAM!\" for gunshots.<ref name=gamestalker>{{cite web |last=Damen |first=Pepijn |url=http://www.gamestalker.nl/klapper-woensdag-the-punisher/ |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130927134915/http://www.gamestalker.nl/klapper-woensdag-the-punisher/ |archivedate=27 September 2013 |title=Klapper Woensdag The Punisher |work=Gamestalker |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nVarious melee (including baseball bats and Japanese swords) and thrown weapons (including knives and [[shuriken]])<ref name=allgame/> as well as improvised weapons (such as lead pipes, car tires<ref name=gamestalker/> and a crude flamethrower<ref name=heavy/>) can be picked up during regular combat. Weapons can be dropped by killed enemies or obtained from smashing various containers throughout the stages. When the player is armed with a weapon, its durability will be displayed alongside the player's health, showing how much it can be used until it breaks apart. Treasure can also be found in containers, awarding the player with bonus [[Score (game)|score points]] once collected (jewelry also appears after defeating female enemies). Health can be replenished by picking up food, which can also give bonus points.<ref name=allgame/> The game distinguished itself by the relatively high level of violence in a video game of the era,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 1993|title=Quarter Crunchers: The Punisher|url=|journal=GameFan|volume=1-08|pages=90|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> as well by the frequent use of firearms,<ref name=if/><ref name=nerd/> including an [[Ingram MAC-10|Ingram]] and a [[M16 rifle|M16]].<ref name=heavy/> There are several sections of the game when gun-wielding enemies appear to which the characters draw their handguns, enabling the player to shoot them. Player characters can also pick up and collect hand grenades that can be deployed at a moment of choice.<ref name=vgc/><ref name=allgame/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the games intro, U.S. Marine Captain Frank Castle enjoys a picnic with his family in Central Park. The Castle family accidentally discovered a mob killing. Fearing any witnesses, the killers gunned down the family. To avenge them and all others like them Frank becomes The Punisher. The game begins in an illegal casino and the streets of the [[New York City]], with the merciless [[vigilante]] Frank \"the Punisher\" Castle (optionally partnered with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Nick Fury) in pursuit of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] enforcer Bruno Costa who ordered the killing of Castle's family; the chase ends with a fight against Chester Scully (a minor villain from the comics). Frank \"interrogates\" Scully, gets the information he needs, and then promptly shoots him. Still on track of Bruno, the Punisher infiltrates the mob's Pantaberde resort in Florida via a water duct. He breaks into a hotel and corners Bruno, who is suddenly killed by a robot called Guardroid, who tells Frank the Kingpin has programmed him to terminate him, which the Punisher must then take on.\n\nThe Punisher then raids a major drug-smuggling ring at the local harbor, which ends with him confronting [[Bonebreaker]] in a waterfront warehouse. After that, the Punisher attacks the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s poppy field at a cave in [[Arizona]]. The Punisher boards and destroys a freight train which is commanded by [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwhacker]].\n\nAt that point, the Kingpin decides that he has lost enough henchmen and money to the Punisher's actions. He puts a hefty contract out on him, and he is chased by assassins from his hideout and through a forest. After defeating another Guardroid, the Punisher in turn assaults the King Building skyscraper. He fights his way through [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]] and other enemies to the final showdown against the Kingpin himself. After the Kingpin is defeated, the entire tower collapses, but the Kingpin is not found among the many dead criminals in the rubble.\n\n==Development and release==\n===Arcade===\n''The Punisher'' for the arcades was released in April 1993,<ref name=gamestalker/> marking the beginning of the partnership between [[Marvel Comics]] and Capcom, which led to the series ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]''.<ref name=\"MvC:OCW\">{{cite book|title=Marvel vs. Capcom: Official Complete Works|author=UDON Entertainment|year=2012|publisher=Diamond Comics|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9781926778495|page=2}}</ref> The game used a new arcade system, allowing over 10 enemies to appear on screen at the same time without slowdowns.<ref name=\":0\" /> A pre-release version included some cut content such as rocket launchers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1993|title=The Punisher|url=|journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly|volume=46|pages=58|via=}}</ref> Artworks from the game were featured in the 2012 art book ''Marvel vs. Capcom: Official Complete Works'' by [[Udon Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.udonentertainment.com/blog/udon/2012-in-review-marvel-vs-capcom-official-complete-works/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306135025/http://www.udonentertainment.com/blog/news/2012-in-review-marvel-vs-capcom-official-complete-works |archivedate=6 March 2016 |title=Blog Archive \u00bb Marvel vs. Capcom Official Complete Works (UDON 2012 in Review) |work=[[Udon Entertainment]] |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref> In 2019, the game was announced to one of the titles to be includes in the Marvel Arcade1Up arcade cabinet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/classic-marvel-arcade-cabinets-announced-at-e3-2019|title=Classic Marvel Arcade Cabinets Announced at E3 2019 {{!}} News {{!}} Marvel|website=Marvel Entertainment|language=en|access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Genesis===\nA console port of ''The Punisher'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] in North America in 1994 and for the [[PAL region]] Mega Drive in April 1995.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/stream/HobbyConsolas043/Hobby_Consolas_043#page/n55/mode/2up |title=The Punisher |date=April 1995 |work=[[Hobby Consolas]] |issue=43 |pages=56\u201357}}</ref> This version, while published by Capcom, was developed by an independent American company [[Sculptured Software]].<ref name=rank/> In addition to the worse graphics and sound, lesser variety of enemies, and a smaller number of objects on screen than in the original, many of the previously breakable background objects were rendered unbreakable due to the limitations of the Genesis' hardware.<ref name=gamestalker/>\n\nThis version also contains some [[video game censorship|content censorship]], including removing the most explicit violence as well as the animation of Fury smoking his cigar,<ref name=if/> and female ninja enemies with skimpy outfits becoming fully clothed.<ref name=gamestalker/> The port also comes with three difficulty settings,<ref name=vgc>''Video Games & Computer Entertainment'' issue 80 (September 1995), page 26.</ref> but the Easy setting ends after only three stages and the game can be properly completed only on Normal or Hard.

Originally, the gang was set up to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other gangs in the Los Angeles area. Over time, the gang grew into a more traditional criminal organization. MS-13 is defined by its cruelty, and its rivalry with the [[18th Street Gang]].\n\nMany MS-13 members were deported to El Salvador after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992, or upon being arrested, facilitating the spread of the gang to Central America. The gang is currently active in many parts of the continental United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Most members are [[Central America]]n, Salvadorans in particular.\n\nAs an international gang, its history is closely tied to [[United States\u2013El Salvador relations]]. In 2018, the gang's US membership of up to 10,000 accounted for less than 1% of the 1.4 million gang members in the United States, and a similar share of gang murders. The gang is often referenced by the United States' [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to advocate for [[Opposition to immigration#United States|anti-immigrant policies]].\n\n== Description ==\n=== Etymology ===\nThere is some dispute about the etymology of the name. Some sources state the gang is named for La Mara, a street in [[San Salvador]], and the Salvatrucha guerrillas who fought in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfn.org/APFN/MS-13.HTM|title=America's Most Dangerous Gang|author=Domash, Shelly Feuer|publisher=apfn.org}}</ref> Additionally, the word ''mara'' means gang in [[Central American Spanish|Caliche slang]] and is taken from ''[[Army ant|marabunta]]'', the name of a fierce type of ant. \"Salvatrucha\" may be a combination of the words ''Salvadoran'' and ''trucha'', a Caliche word for being alert. The term \"Salvatruchas\" has been explained as a reference to Salvadorian peasants trained to become guerrilla fighters, referred to as the \"[[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]].\" The \u201813\u2019 is believed to stand for the letter M, the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, but it is also been rumored to pay homage to a California prison gang, the Mexican Mafia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|title=MS-13: Gangs infiltrating the suburbs of Washington, DC|website=dcspotlight.com|publisher=DC Spotlight Newspaper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614063408/https://dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|archive-date=June 14, 2018|url-status=live|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Characteristics ===\n[[File:Mara_Salvatrucha_MS13.jpg|thumb|An MS [[Gang signal|gang sign]] and tattoos]]\nCentral Americans are the primary targets of violence and threats of violence by MS-13.<ref name=\"Rose\" /> Many of the victims are minors.<ref name=\"Demick\" /> Minors also make up the majority of suspects arrested for killings attributed to MS-13.

As such, Salvadorans began to immigrate without documents in increasing numbers. They mostly settled in cities with large undocumented populations, like Los Angeles. Salvadoran asylum claims were neglected until the 1991 case [[American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh (ABC) Settlement Agreement|American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh]]. The case's settlement agreement required Guatemalan and Salvadoran asylum claims to be reevaluated, as long as they had entered the U.S. by 1990. By this point, the Civil War was already drawing to a close after more than a decade of fighting. Before ABC v. Thornburg and even after, Salvadoran immigrants were left highly vulnerable to exploitation. In the very beginning, MS-13 was a group of young, delinquent, heavy metal fans who lived in Los Angeles. However, the undocumented community in Los Angeles was subject to severe racial prejudices and persecution. Under these conditions, MS-13 began to mutate into a gang. Originally, the gang's main purpose was to protect Salvadoran immigrants from the other, more established gangs of Los Angeles, who were predominantly composed of Mexicans, Asians, and African-Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/06/28/in-nva-gang-a-brutal-sense-of-belonging/3d85a511-9afb-4780-9368-12437e807394/|title=In N.Va.

Deras was a former member of Salvadoran special forces, [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation|trained in Panama by United States Green Berets]]. On gaining leadership of an MS-13 clique in 1990, he used his military training to discipline the gang and improve its logistical operations. It was after this point that the gang began to grow in power. MS-13's rivalry with the [[18th Street gang|18th Street Gang]] also began in this period. MS-13 and 18th Street were initially friendly, since they were some of the only gangs to allow Salvadorans to join. What exactly caused their alliance to fall apart is uncertain. Most versions point to a fight over a girl in 1989. In the incident, an MS-13 gangster was killed, which led to a cycle of vengeance that has escalated into an intense and generalized animosity between the two gangs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://salanegra.elfaro.net/es/201208/cronicas/9301/I-El-origen-del-odio.htm|title=I.

Large-scale deportations began shortly after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992. As a part of the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], the post-war Salvadoran government was required to stop using the standing army as a police force and form a new national police service. However, the ruling political party, [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]], was a descendant of the wartime military government. To favor military allies, it delayed the formation of the [[National Civil Police of El Salvador|Polic\u00eda Nacional Civil]]. When the PNC was finally organized 1993, parts of the police force were created by integrating the armed forces. Some of the members of the nascent police force were known war criminals. The lack of a proper police force meant that deported gangsters faced little opposition when establishing MS-13 in El Salvador. To compound the issue, the post-war period was marked by a large number of uncontrolled arms left over from the conflict, which allowed MS-13 to become a significant arms trafficker. This remains one of its primary revenue sources today, alongside other crimes like extortion and assassination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Captured Peace Elites and Peacebuilding in El Salvador|author=Wade, Christine J.|date=2016|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=9780896802988|oclc=1020654434}}</ref> In addition, the economic struggles of the post-war period, alongside neoliberal trade reforms likely contributed to the growth of MS-13.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cultura y contra-cultura en la posmodernidad : el lenguaje en las maras centroamericanas|author=Maria Eugenia Rojas Rodriguez|date=2008|publisher=Alma Mater|oclc=912767426}}</ref>\n\n=== Opposition ===\nGang violence in El Salvador peaked in the 1990s, then declined in the early 2000s. Even so, they became a key part of political discourse. ARENA presidencies implemented the [[La Mano Dura|Mano Dura and Super Mano Dura]] policies to combat gangs. External observers and gangsters themselves believe these policies increased the power of gangs in El Salvador.\n\nThe Mano Dura policies were followed by a truce between MS-13 and their perpetual rivals, the 18th Street Gang. Under the direction of the president [[Mauricio Funes]], the first Salvadoran President representing the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|FMLN]] party, government and gang representatives negotiated unofficially.  The terms required gangs to lower the homicide rate in exchange for transfers to lower security prisons.  In addition, gangs would receive benefits from the government for every firearm they surrendered. While homicides fell during the truce, gangs no longer had to worry as much about turf wars. Instead, they focused on recruitment, organization, and extortion. The truce did not protect most Salvadorans from extortion. This, along with reports of government leniency towards imprisoned gangsters, led to the truce being highly unpopular and controversial.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFunes's successor as the FMLN presidential candidate, [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]], campaigned on returning to a tough approach on gangs. After S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n took the Presidency in 2014, the truce was understood to be over. Since the gang truce ended, the number of extrajudicial killings by police forces has grown dramatically.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-violence-idUSKBN1FQ0E1|title=U.N. finds possible extrajudicial killings in El Salvador gang...|date=2018-02-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-12-06|language=en}}</ref>  Throughout the truce, Salvadoran gangs were able to focus on expansion and internal regulation instead of inter-gang conflict.  When the truce ended, the gangs had built up their forces significantly. As such, the truce breakdown saw a return to record levels of violence, with the gangs being much stronger and better organized than before. In 2015, El Salvador had the highest national homicide rate per capita in the world, largely due to escalating violence between MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang. Participants in the original truce negotiations have since been prosecuted. The trials revealed significant corruption, such as government negotiators encouraging gangs to increase the homicide rate to keep everyone at the negotiating table.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/08/26/traducing-el-salvadors-truce|title=Traducing El Salvador's truce|date=2017-08-26|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-12-06|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\nOpposition to MS-13 in the U.S. has taken varied forms.

Originally, the gang was set up to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other gangs in the Los Angeles area. Over time, the gang grew into a more traditional criminal organization. MS-13 is defined by its cruelty, and its rivalry with the [[18th Street Gang]].\n\nMany MS-13 members were deported to El Salvador after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992, or upon being arrested, facilitating the spread of the gang to Central America. The gang is currently active in many parts of the continental United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Most members are [[Central America]]n, Salvadorans in particular.\n\nAs an international gang, its history is closely tied to [[United States\u2013El Salvador relations]]. In 2018, the gang's US membership of up to 10,000 accounted for less than 1% of the 1.4 million gang members in the United States, and a similar share of gang murders. The gang is often referenced by the United States' [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to advocate for [[Opposition to immigration#United States|anti-immigrant policies]].\n\n== Description ==\n=== Etymology ===\nThere is some dispute about the etymology of the name.

As such, Salvadorans began to immigrate without documents in increasing numbers. They mostly settled in cities with large undocumented populations, like Los Angeles. Salvadoran asylum claims were neglected until the 1991 case [[American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh (ABC) Settlement Agreement|American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh]]. The case's settlement agreement required Guatemalan and Salvadoran asylum claims to be reevaluated, as long as they had entered the U.S. by 1990. By this point, the Civil War was already drawing to a close after more than a decade of fighting. Before ABC v. Thornburg and even after, Salvadoran immigrants were left highly vulnerable to exploitation. In the very beginning, MS-13 was a group of young, delinquent, heavy metal fans who lived in Los Angeles. However, the undocumented community in Los Angeles was subject to severe racial prejudices and persecution. Under these conditions, MS-13 began to mutate into a gang. Originally, the gang's main purpose was to protect Salvadoran immigrants from the other, more established gangs of Los Angeles, who were predominantly composed of Mexicans, Asians, and African-Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/06/28/in-nva-gang-a-brutal-sense-of-belonging/3d85a511-9afb-4780-9368-12437e807394/|title=In N.Va.

Deras was a former member of Salvadoran special forces, [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation|trained in Panama by United States Green Berets]]. On gaining leadership of an MS-13 clique in 1990, he used his military training to discipline the gang and improve its logistical operations. It was after this point that the gang began to grow in power. MS-13's rivalry with the [[18th Street gang|18th Street Gang]] also began in this period. MS-13 and 18th Street were initially friendly, since they were some of the only gangs to allow Salvadorans to join. What exactly caused their alliance to fall apart is uncertain. Most versions point to a fight over a girl in 1989. In the incident, an MS-13 gangster was killed, which led to a cycle of vengeance that has escalated into an intense and generalized animosity between the two gangs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://salanegra.elfaro.net/es/201208/cronicas/9301/I-El-origen-del-odio.htm|title=I.

Large-scale deportations began shortly after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992. As a part of the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], the post-war Salvadoran government was required to stop using the standing army as a police force and form a new national police service. However, the ruling political party, [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]], was a descendant of the wartime military government. To favor military allies, it delayed the formation of the [[National Civil Police of El Salvador|Polic\u00eda Nacional Civil]]. When the PNC was finally organized 1993, parts of the police force were created by integrating the armed forces. Some of the members of the nascent police force were known war criminals. The lack of a proper police force meant that deported gangsters faced little opposition when establishing MS-13 in El Salvador. To compound the issue, the post-war period was marked by a large number of uncontrolled arms left over from the conflict, which allowed MS-13 to become a significant arms trafficker. This remains one of its primary revenue sources today, alongside other crimes like extortion and assassination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Captured Peace Elites and Peacebuilding in El Salvador|author=Wade, Christine J.|date=2016|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=9780896802988|oclc=1020654434}}</ref> In addition, the economic struggles of the post-war period, alongside neoliberal trade reforms likely contributed to the growth of MS-13.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cultura y contra-cultura en la posmodernidad : el lenguaje en las maras centroamericanas|author=Maria Eugenia Rojas Rodriguez|date=2008|publisher=Alma Mater|oclc=912767426}}</ref>\n\n=== Opposition ===\nGang violence in El Salvador peaked in the 1990s, then declined in the early 2000s. Even so, they became a key part of political discourse. ARENA presidencies implemented the [[La Mano Dura|Mano Dura and Super Mano Dura]] policies to combat gangs. External observers and gangsters themselves believe these policies increased the power of gangs in El Salvador.\n\nThe Mano Dura policies were followed by a truce between MS-13 and their perpetual rivals, the 18th Street Gang. Under the direction of the president [[Mauricio Funes]], the first Salvadoran President representing the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|FMLN]] party, government and gang representatives negotiated unofficially.  The terms required gangs to lower the homicide rate in exchange for transfers to lower security prisons.  In addition, gangs would receive benefits from the government for every firearm they surrendered. While homicides fell during the truce, gangs no longer had to worry as much about turf wars. Instead, they focused on recruitment, organization, and extortion. The truce did not protect most Salvadorans from extortion. This, along with reports of government leniency towards imprisoned gangsters, led to the truce being highly unpopular and controversial.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFunes's successor as the FMLN presidential candidate, [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]], campaigned on returning to a tough approach on gangs. After S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n took the Presidency in 2014, the truce was understood to be over. Since the gang truce ended, the number of extrajudicial killings by police forces has grown dramatically.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-violence-idUSKBN1FQ0E1|title=U.N. finds possible extrajudicial killings in El Salvador gang...|date=2018-02-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-12-06|language=en}}</ref>  Throughout the truce, Salvadoran gangs were able to focus on expansion and internal regulation instead of inter-gang conflict.  When the truce ended, the gangs had built up their forces significantly. As such, the truce breakdown saw a return to record levels of violence, with the gangs being much stronger and better organized than before. In 2015, El Salvador had the highest national homicide rate per capita in the world, largely due to escalating violence between MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang.
