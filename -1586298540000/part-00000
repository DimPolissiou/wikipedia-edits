It is an outskirt of the state capital, [[Kota Kinabalu]], and is under the jurisdiction of [[Kota Kinabalu City Hall]]. It is located along Jalan Tuaran, which is the main road leading north from Kota Kinabalu city centre.  \n\nThe town is notable for being one of few towns in Sabah where wooden pre-[[World War II]] era shophouses still stand.

from the scrap vehicle. The salvage or scrap facility can sell any other component (including the transmission and axles) from the scrap vehicle separately and may dismantle and warehouse the parts. The \"hull\" of the vehicle must be crushed within 180 days. Cut off or unbolted front-end assemblies may be saved and sold at a later date, as well as the \"top and back\" of pickup cabs.\n\nThe outlined procedure says that running the engine at 2,000 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] \"should disable the engine within a few minutes\"; if not, then allow the engine to cool off before repeating the procedure. Hazards associated with the intentional overheating and destruction of the engine include rupturing radiator and hot water/steam, motor oil ejection, toxic fumes, and fire.\n\nBy completely disabling the engine, the CARS program avoids recycling schemes such as the one discovered in Germany, where authorities found that an estimated 50,000 scrapped vehicles have been exported to Africa and Eastern Europe, where newer, safer cars of the type being destroyed in the West are prohibitively expensive,<ref name=NYTGer>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/world/europe/08germany.html?hpw |title=Driving Out of Germany, to Pollute Another Day |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Carter |last=Dougherty |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref> In contrast with the U.S. program, the German program only requires dealers to drop off the scrapped vehicles at junkyards, thus allowing the illegal exports.<ref name=NYTGer/>\n\n[[Vehicle recycling|Auto recyclers]] and [[Wrecking yard|dismantlers]] have criticized the program due to requirements that the engine is to be disabled to prevent re-use of the car.

A particle speed probability distribution indicates which speeds are more likely: a particle will have a speed selected randomly from the distribution, and is more likely to be within one range of speeds than another. The kinetic theory of gases applies to the classical [[ideal gas]], which is an idealization of real gases. In real gases, there are various effects (e.g., [[van der Waals interaction]]s, [[vortex|vortical]] flow, [[special relativity|relativistic]] speed limits, and quantum [[exchange interaction]]s) that can make their speed distribution different from the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann form. However, [[Rarefaction|rarefied]] gases at ordinary temperatures behave very nearly like an ideal gas and the Maxwell speed distribution is an excellent approximation for such gases. Ideal [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]], which are ionized gases of sufficiently low density, frequently also have particle distributions that are partially or entirely Maxwellian.<ref>N.A. Krall and A.W.

The derivations in this section are along the lines of Boltzmann's 1877 derivation, starting with result known as [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics]] (from statistical thermodynamics). Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics gives the average number of particles found in a given single-particle [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]. Under certain assumptions, the logarithm of the fraction of particles in a given microstate is proportional   to the ratio of the energy of that state to the temperature of the system:\n:<math>-\\log \\left(\\frac{N_i}{N}\\right) \\propto \\frac{E_i}{T}.</math>\nThe assumptions of this equation are that the particles do not interact, and that they are classical; this means that each particle's state can be considered independently from the other particles' states. Additionally, the particles are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium.<ref name=\"StatisticalPhysics\" /><ref>McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{isbn|0-07-051400-3}}</ref>\n\nThis relation can be written as an equation by introducing a normalizing factor:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\frac{N_i} N = \\frac{\\exp(-E_i/kT) } { \\sum_j \\exp(-E_j/kT) }</math>\n|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere:\n* {{mvar|N<sub>i</sub>}} is the expected number of particles in the single-particle microstate {{mvar|i}},\n* {{mvar|N}} is the total number of particles in the system,\n* {{mvar|E<sub>i</sub>}}  is the energy of microstate {{mvar|i}},\n* the sum over index {{mvar|j}} takes into account all microstates, \n*{{mvar|T}} is the equilibrium temperature of the system,\n*{{mvar|k}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].\nThe denominator in Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is simply a normalizing factor so that the ratios <math>N_i:N</math>  add up to unity \u2014 in other words it is a kind of [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] (for the single-particle system, not the usual partition function of the entire system).\n\nBecause velocity and speed are related to energy, Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) can be used to derive relationships between temperature and the speeds of gas particles. All that is needed is to discover the density of microstates in energy, which is determined by dividing up momentum space into equal sized regions.\n\n===Distribution for the momentum vector===\n\nThe potential energy is taken to be zero, so that all energy is in the form of kinetic energy.\nThe relationship between [[Kinetic energy#Kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energy and momentum]] for massive non-[[special relativity|relativistic]] particles is\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>E=\\frac{p^2}{2m}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nwhere ''p''<sup>2</sup> is the square of the momentum vector \n'''p'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[''p''<sub>''x''</sub>,&nbsp;''p''<sub>''y''</sub>,&nbsp;''p''<sub>''z''</sub>].

Here ''m'' is the molecular mass of the gas, ''T'' is the thermodynamic temperature and ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]].  This distribution of <math>N_i:N</math> is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[probability density function]] ''f''<sub>'''p'''</sub> for finding a molecule with these values of momentum components, so:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\nf_\\mathbf{p} (p_x, p_y, p_z) \n\\propto\n\\exp \\left[\n-\\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}{2mkT}\n\\right]</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nThe [[normalizing constant]]  can be determined by recognizing that the probability of a molecule having ''some'' momentum must be 1.  \nIntegrating  the exponential in ({{EquationNote|4}}) over all ''p''<sub>''x''</sub>, ''p''<sub>''y''</sub>, and ''p''<sub>''z''</sub> yields a factor of \n:<math>\\iiint_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\exp \\left[ -\\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}{2mkT}\\right] dp_x\\ dp_y\\ dp_z  = {(\\sqrt{\\pi} \\sqrt{2mkT})^3}</math>\n\nSo that the normalized distribution function is:\n{{Equation box 1 |indent=: |equation=\n<math>\nf_\\mathbf{p} (p_x, p_y, p_z) =\n\\left( 2 \\pi mkT \\right)^{-3/2}\n\\exp \\left[\n-\\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}{2mkT}\n\\right]</math>\n|cellpadding |border |border colour = #50C878 |background colour = #ECFCF4|ref=6}}\n\nThe distribution is seen to be the product of three independent [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] variables <math>p_x</math>, <math>p_y</math>, and <math>p_z</math>, with variance <math>mkT</math>.

For example, if the particles are rigid mass dipoles of fixed dipole moment, they will have three translational degrees of freedom and two additional rotational degrees of freedom. The energy in each degree of freedom will be described according to the above chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, and the total energy will be distributed according to a chi-squared distribution with five degrees of freedom. This has implications in the theory of the [[specific heat]] of a gas.\n\nThe Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution can also be obtained by considering the gas to be a type of [[gas in a box|quantum gas]] for which the approximation ''&epsilon; >> k T'' may be made.\n\n===Distribution for the velocity vector===\n\nRecognizing that the velocity probability density ''f''<sub>'''v'''</sub> is proportional to the momentum probability density function by\n\n:<math>\nf_\\mathbf{v} d^3v = f_\\mathbf{p} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dv}\\right)^3 d^3v\n</math>\n\nand using '''p''' = m'''v''' we get\n\n{{Equation box 1 |indent=: |equation=\n<math>\nf_\\mathbf{v} (v_x, v_y, v_z) =\n\\left(\\frac{m}{2 \\pi kT} \\right)^{3/2}\n\\exp \\left[-\n\\frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2kT}\n\\right]\n</math>\n|cellpadding |border |border colour = #50C878 |background colour = #ECFCF4}}\n\nwhich is the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann velocity distribution.

A particle speed probability distribution indicates which speeds are more likely: a particle will have a speed selected randomly from the distribution, and is more likely to be within one range of speeds than another. The kinetic theory of gases applies to the classical [[ideal gas]], which is an idealization of real gases. In real gases, there are various effects (e.g., [[van der Waals interaction]]s, [[vortex|vortical]] flow, [[special relativity|relativistic]] speed limits, and quantum [[exchange interaction]]s) that can make their speed distribution different from the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann form. However, [[Rarefaction|rarefied]] gases at ordinary temperatures behave very nearly like an ideal gas and the Maxwell speed distribution is an excellent approximation for such gases. Ideal [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]], which are ionized gases of sufficiently low density, frequently also have particle distributions that are partially or entirely Maxwellian.<ref>N.A. Krall and A.W.

Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics gives the average number of particles found in a given single-particle [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]. Under certain assumptions, the logarithm of the fraction of particles in a given microstate is proportional   to the ratio of the energy of that state to the temperature of the system:\n:<math>-\\log \\left(\\frac{N_i}{N}\\right) \\propto \\frac{E_i}{T}.</math>\nThe assumptions of this equation are that the particles do not interact, and that they are classical; this means that each particle's state can be considered independently from the other particles' states. Additionally, the particles are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium.<ref name=\"StatisticalPhysics\" /><ref>McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B.

The probability of finding a particle with velocity in the infinitesimal element [''dv''<sub>''x''</sub>,&nbsp;''dv''<sub>''y''</sub>,&nbsp;''dv''<sub>''z''</sub>] about velocity '''v'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[''v''<sub>''x''</sub>,&nbsp;''v''<sub>''y''</sub>,&nbsp;''v''<sub>''z''</sub>] is\n\n:<math>\nf_\\mathbf{v} \\left(v_x, v_y, v_z\\right)\\, dv_x\\, dv_y\\, dv_z.\n</math>\n\nLike the momentum, this distribution is seen to be the product of three independent [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] variables <math>v_x</math>, <math>v_y</math>, and <math>v_z</math>, but with variance <math>\\frac{kT}{m}</math>.  \nIt can also be seen that the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann velocity distribution for the vector velocity\n[''v''<sub>''x''</sub>,&nbsp;''v''<sub>''y''</sub>,&nbsp;''v''<sub>''z''</sub>] is the product of the distributions for each of the three directions:\n\n:<math>\nf_\\mathbf{v} \\left(v_x, v_y, v_z\\right) = f_v (v_x)f_v (v_y)f_v (v_z)\n</math>\n\nwhere the distribution for a single direction is\n\n:<math>\nf_v (v_i) =\n\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2 \\pi kT}}\n\\exp \\left[\n\\frac{-mv_i^2}{2kT}\n\\right].\n</math>\n\nEach component of the velocity vector has a [[normal distribution]] with mean <math>\\mu_{v_x} = \\mu_{v_y} = \\mu_{v_z} = 0</math> and standard deviation <math>\\sigma_{v_x} = \\sigma_{v_y} = \\sigma_{v_z} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kT}{m}}</math>, so the vector has a 3-dimensional normal distribution, a particular kind of [[multivariate normal distribution]], with mean <math> \\mu_{\\mathbf{v}} = {\\mathbf{0}} </math> and covariance <math>\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{v}} = \\left(\\frac{kT}{m}\\right)I</math>, where <math>I</math> is the <math>3\\times3</math> identity matrix.\n\n===Distribution for the speed===\nThe Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution for the speed follows immediately from the distribution of the velocity vector, above.  Note that the speed is\n\n:<math>v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}</math>\n\nand the [[volume element]] in [[spherical coordinates]]\n\n:<math> dv_x\\, dv_y\\, dv_z = v^2 \\sin \\theta\\, dv\\, d\\theta\\, d\\phi = v^2   dv\\,  d\\Omega</math> \nwhere <math>\\phi</math> and <math>\\theta</math> are the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinate]] angles of the velocity vector. [[Spherical coordinate system#Integration and differentiation in spherical coordinates|Integration]] of the probability density function of the velocity  over the solid angles <math>d\\Omega</math> yields an  additional factor of <math>4\\pi</math>.\nThe speed distribution with substitution of the speed for the sum of the squares of the vector components:\n{{Equation box 1 |indent=: |equation=\n<math>\nf (v) =\n\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\left(\\frac{m}{ kT} \\right)^{3/2}\nv^2\n\\exp \\left[-\n\\frac{mv^2}{2kT}\n\\right].\n</math>\n}}\n\n== In n-dimensional space ==\nIn n-dimensional space, Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution becomes:\n\n<math> f(v) ~\\mathrm{d}^nv = \\left(\\frac{m}{2 \\pi kT}\\right)^{n/2}\\,  e^{- \\frac{m|v|^2}{2kT}} ~\\mathrm{d}^nv </math>\n\nSpeed distribution becomes:\n\n<math> f(v) ~\\mathrm{d}v = \\text{const.} \\times  e^{- \\frac{mv^2}{2kT}} \\times v^{n-1} ~\\mathrm{d}v </math>\n\nThe following integral result is useful:\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\n\\int_{0}^{+\\infty} v^a e^{-\\frac{mv^2}{2kT}} dv  \n&= \\left[\\frac{2kT}{m}\\right]^{(a+1)/2} \\int_{0}^{+\\infty} e^{-x}x^{\\frac{a}{2}}dx^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\\n&= \\left[\\frac{2kT}{m}\\right]^{(a+1)/2} \\int_{0}^{+\\infty} e^{-x}x^{\\frac{a}{2}}\\frac{x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}{2}dx\\\\\n&= \\left[\\frac{2kT}{m}\\right]^{(a+1)/2} \\frac{\\Gamma (\\frac{a+1}{2})}{2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math> \\Gamma(z)</math>is the [[Gamma function]].
