On the advice of her father, she went on to study sociology at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]]. graduating in 1968. In 1966, while on an agricultural course in Israel, she met Alberto Herrero, a Spaniard from [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|L\u00e9on]], who became her partner for the next 27 years, fathering her only son Rodrigo.

The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002), which was influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as [[Luchino Visconti]] and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios.\n\nWith a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, ''Gangs of New York'' was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio. Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the [[Dead Rabbits|Irish faction]]. Once DiCaprio was cast, [[Miramax Films]] agreed to finance the project.<ref name=\"tage\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/09/1044725670402.html|title=Scorsese's Gang Of Acting Heavyweights|work=[[The Age]]|date=February 10, 2003|accessdate=August 3, 2010|location=Melbourne}}</ref> The film received positive reviews and was a box office success, bolstering DiCaprio's reputation as one of Hollywood's preeminent talents.

What brief glory. What an enthralling film...There's a match here between Scorsese and his subject, perhaps because the director's own life journey allows him to see Howard Hughes with insight, sympathy \u2013 and, up to a point, with admiration.

The AGS-17 fires 30&nbsp;mm grenades in either direct or indirect fire to provide suppressive and lethal fire support against soft skinned or fortified targets.\n\nThe weapon uses a blowback mechanism to sustain operation.

Most probably its development was inspired by the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] of the late 1960s, as well as initial experience with several US automatic grenade launchers, learned from Vietnamese troops who were often on the receiving end of these weapons.\n\nIt was thought that an automatic grenade launcher would be one of the most effective infantry support weapons against typical Chinese \"human wave\" attacks. This lightweight weapon was to provide infantry with close to medium range fire support against enemy personnel and unarmored targets, like trucks, half-tracks, jeeps and sandbag-protected machine-gun nests. The first prototypes of the new weapon entered trials in 1969, with mass production commencing in 1971.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Never used against the Chinese, the AGS-17 was widely operated and well liked by Soviet troops in [[Afghanistan]] as a ground support weapon or as a vehicle weapon on improvised mounts installed on armored personnel carriers and trucks.<ref name=\"Encyclopedie\"/>\n\nAt the same time, a special airborne version of the AGS-17 was developed for installation on [[Mi-24 Hind]] gunship helicopters.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nIt is still in use with the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian army]] as a direct fire support weapon for infantry troops; it is also installed in several vehicle mounts and turrets along with machine guns, guided rocket launchers and sighting equipment. A special airborne version, the [[AG-17A]], was installed on the door mounts of several [[Mil Mi-8]] Hip combat transport helicopters and on gun pods used in late model Mi-24 Hind gunships; this weapon had a thick aluminium jacket on the barrel and used a special mount and an electric remotely controlled trigger. It is being replaced by the [[AGS-30]] launcher, (using the same ammunition, this weapon weighs only 16&nbsp;kg unloaded on the tripod and has an upgraded blowback action).\n\n==Variants==\n*AGS-17A-remotely controlled aircraft mounted version with electric trigger mechanism.\n*AGS-17D-remotely controlled vehicle mounted version with electric trigger mechanism.\n\n==RGSh-30==\nUkrainian company [[Precision Systems]] developed a [[miniaturized]] [[handheld]] version of AGS-17 called [[RGSh-30]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htweap/20161108.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726170409/https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htweap/20161108.aspx |archive-date=2018-07-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> \"in order to create a grenade launcher that could respond to the needs of Ukrainian units and special forces operating in the [[Donbass]]\".

The AGS-17 fires 30&nbsp;mm grenades in either direct or indirect fire to provide suppressive and lethal fire support against soft skinned or fortified targets.\n\nThe weapon uses a blowback mechanism to sustain operation. Rounds are fired through a removable (to reduce barrel stress) rifled barrel.\n\nThe standard metal ammunition drum contains 29 linked rounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=AGS-17 Automatic Grenade Launcher |url=http://www.military-today.com/firearms/ags_17.htm |website=www.military-today.com |publisher=Military Today |access-date=2018-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022193436/http://www.military-today.com/firearms/ags_17.htm |archive-date=2018-10-22 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=AGS-17 |url=http://modernfirearms.net/en/grenade-launchers/russia-grenade-launchers/ags-17-eng/ |website=modernfirearms.net |publisher=Modern Firearms |access-date=2018-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817042023/http://modernfirearms.net/en/grenade-launchers/russia-grenade-launchers/ags-17-eng/ |archive-date=2018-08-17 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe tripod is equipped with fine levelling gear for indirect fire trajectories.\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment of the AGS-17 (''Avtomaticheskiy Granatomyot Stankovyi''\u2014Automatic Grenade launcher, Mounted) started in the [[USSR]] in 1965 by the OKB-16 design bureau (now known as the [[KBP Instrument Design Bureau]], located in the city of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]]). Most probably its development was inspired by the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] of the late 1960s, as well as initial experience with several US automatic grenade launchers, learned from Vietnamese troops who were often on the receiving end of these weapons.\n\nIt was thought that an automatic grenade launcher would be one of the most effective infantry support weapons against typical Chinese \"human wave\" attacks. This lightweight weapon was to provide infantry with close to medium range fire support against enemy personnel and unarmored targets, like trucks, half-tracks, jeeps and sandbag-protected machine-gun nests. The first prototypes of the new weapon entered trials in 1969, with mass production commencing in 1971.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Never used against the Chinese, the AGS-17 was widely operated and well liked by Soviet troops in [[Afghanistan]] as a ground support weapon or as a vehicle weapon on improvised mounts installed on armored personnel carriers and trucks.<ref name=\"Encyclopedie\"/>\n\nAt the same time, a special airborne version of the AGS-17 was developed for installation on [[Mi-24 Hind]] gunship helicopters.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nIt is still in use with the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian army]] as a direct fire support weapon for infantry troops; it is also installed in several vehicle mounts and turrets along with machine guns, guided rocket launchers and sighting equipment. A special airborne version, the [[AG-17A]], was installed on the door mounts of several [[Mil Mi-8]] Hip combat transport helicopters and on gun pods used in late model Mi-24 Hind gunships; this weapon had a thick aluminium jacket on the barrel and used a special mount and an electric remotely controlled trigger. It is being replaced by the [[AGS-30]] launcher, (using the same ammunition, this weapon weighs only 16&nbsp;kg unloaded on the tripod and has an upgraded blowback action).\n\n==Variants==\n*AGS-17A-remotely controlled aircraft mounted version with electric trigger mechanism.\n*AGS-17D-remotely controlled vehicle mounted version with electric trigger mechanism.\n\n==RGSh-30==\nUkrainian company [[Precision Systems]] developed a [[miniaturized]] [[handheld]] version of AGS-17 called [[RGSh-30]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htweap/20161108.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726170409/https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htweap/20161108.aspx |archive-date=2018-07-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> \"in order to create a grenade launcher that could respond to the needs of Ukrainian units and special forces operating in the [[Donbass]]\".

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh. In 1999 MdHS sent the journal to the Center for Conservation in Philadelphia where it was rebound, deacidified, and given full conservation treatment.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219030526/http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2014/02/06/the-dreams-of-benjamin-banneker/|archivedate=2018-02-19}}<br>(2) {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302003904/http://m60006.eos-intl.net/M60006/OPAC/Details/Record.aspx?SearchType=1&BibCode=MM60006%7C9682055%7C15%7C9318734|archivedate=March 2, 2020|url=http://m60006.eos-intl.net/M60006/OPAC/Details/Record.aspx?SearchType=1&BibCode=MM60006%7C9682055%7C15%7C9318734|title=Banneker Astronomical Journal, 1781; 1790-1802; 1806.|work=[[Maryland Historical Society#Library|H.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

In August, 2019, [[Scientific American]] wrote: \"\u201cMeade\u2019s unique work illustrates that depth perception is always a brain construct, not only in art but also in life.

Meade\u2019s artful application of paint disrupts this brain process.\u201d<ref>[https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/when-a-still-life-comes-alive/  Scientific American: Illusion Chasers.
