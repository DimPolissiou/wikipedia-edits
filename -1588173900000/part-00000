Likewise, possessive pronouns are enclitic to the nouns they modify.\n\n===Morphology===\nGreek is a largely [[Synthetic language|synthetic]] (inflectional) language. Although the complexity of the inflectional system has been somewhat reduced in comparison to [[Ancient Greek]], there is also a considerable degree of continuity in the morphological system, and Greek still has a somewhat archaic character compared with other Indo-European languages of Europe.<ref name=\"Browning\">Robert Browning, ''Medieval and Modern Greek'', Cambridge University Press, Second Edition, 1983, {{ISBN|0521299780}}</ref> Nouns, adjectives and verbs are each divided into several inflectional classes (declension classes and conjugation classes), which have different sets of endings. In the nominals, the ancient inflectional system is well preserved, with the exception of the loss of one case, the [[dative]], and the restructuring of several of the inflectional classes. In the verbal system, the loss of synthetic inflectional categories is somewhat greater, and several new [[Analytic language|analytic]] (periphrastic) constructions have evolved instead.\n\n===Characteristics of the Balkan language area===\nModern Greek shares several syntactic characteristics with its geographical neighbours, with which it forms the so-called [[Balkan language area]] (''Sprachbund'').<ref name=\"Lindstedt\">{{harvnb|Lindstedt|1998}}</ref> Among these characteristics are:\n*The lack of an infinitive. In Greek, verbal complementation in contexts where English would use an infinitive is typically formed with the help of finite (subjunctive) verb forms (e.g. {{lang|el|\u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03c9}}, {{IPA|[\u02c8\u03b8elo na \u02c8pao]}}, literally 'I-want that I-go', i.e. 'I want to go').\n*The merger of the dative and the genitive case. In Greek, indirect objects are expressed partly through genitive forms of nouns or pronouns, and partly through a periphrasis consisting of the preposition {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b5}} ({{IPA|[se]}}, 'to') and the accusative.\n*The use of a future construction derived from the verb 'want' ({{lang|el|\u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u03b8eli na]}} \u2192 {{lang|el|\u03b8\u03b1}} {{IPA|[\u03b8a]}}).\n*A tendency to use pre-verbal clitic object pronouns redundantly ([[clitic doubling]]), doubling an object that is also expressed elsewhere in the clause: for example, {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf}} ({{IPA|[to \u02c8i\u00f0a to afto\u02c8cinito]}}, 'I saw it, the car\", literally 'It I-saw the car').\nOn the other hand, one prominent feature of the Balkan language area that Greek does not share is the use of a postposed definite article. The Greek article (like the Ancient Greek one) stands before the noun.\n\n==Accent==\nModern Greek has a [[stress accent]], similar to English. The accent is notated with a stroke (\u0384) over the accented vowel and is called {{lang|el|\u03bf\u03be\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}} (''oxeia'', \"acute\") or {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}} (''tonos'', \"accent\") in Greek. The former term is taken from one of the accents used in [[polytonic orthography]] which officially became obsolete in 1982.\n\nMost monosyllabic words take no accent such as in {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf}} ({{IPA|[to]}}, \"the\") and {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[pjos]}}, \"who\"). Exceptions include the conjunction {{lang|el|\u03ae}} ({{IPA|[i]}}, \"or\"), the interrogative adverbs {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03ce\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[pos]}}, \"how\") and {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd}} ({{IPA|[pu]}}, \"where\") in both direct and indirect questions and some fixed expressions such as {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03cd}} ({{IPA|[pu ke pu]}}, \"occasionally\") and {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03ce\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03ce\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[pos ke pos]}}, \"cravingly\"). Moreover, weak personal pronouns are accented in cases where they may be mistaken for enclitics (see below). For example, {{lang|el|\u03bf \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u03b3\u03ac\u03b2\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5}} ({{IPA|[o \u02c8skilos mu \u02c8\u0263av\u029dise]}}, \"the dog barked at me\") instead of {{lang|el|\u03bf \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b3\u03ac\u03b2\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5}} ({{IPA|[o \u02c8skiloz\u203fmu \u02c8\u0263av\u029dise]}}, \"my dog barked\").<ref name=\"triantafyllidis\">\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2, \u0391. \u03ba\u03ac., ''\u039d\u03b5\u03bf\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae: \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b3\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b7'', \u039f\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u0395\u03ba\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u0392\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1, 2004, pp. 22\u201326</ref>\n\nEnclitics are pronounced very closely to the previous word. Most enclitics are weak personal pronouns. Enclitics do not modify the accent of the previous word when this word is accented on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, for example {{lang|el|\u03bf\u03b4\u03b7\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[o\u00f0i\u02c8\u0263oz\u203fmas]}}, \"our driver\") and {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5}} ({{IPA|[vi\u02c8vlio\u203fsu]}}, \"your book\"). However, when the previous word is accented on the antepenultimate syllable, the enclitic causes the ultimate syllable to be accented too. For example, {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u00f0askalos]}}, \"teacher\") but {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5}} ({{IPA|[\u02cc\u00f0aska\u02c8loz\u203fmu]}}, \"my teacher\") and {{lang|el|\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8forese]}}, \"wear {{sc|(imp)}}\") but {{lang|el|\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03ad \u03c4\u03bf}} ({{IPA|[\u02ccfore\u02c8se\u203fto]}}, \"wear it\"). Finally, enclitics are accented only when they precede another enclitic and these two determine an imperative accented on the penultimate syllable. For example, {{lang|el|\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5 \u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u03c4\u03bf}} ({{IPA|[\u02ccfere\u203f\u02c8mu\u203fto]}}, \"bring it to me\").<ref name=\"triantafyllidis\"/>\n\nIn [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] which are pronounced as simple [[phoneme]]s such as {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03b9}} {{IPA|[e]}}, {{lang|el|\u03bf\u03b9}} {{IPA|[i]}} and {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03b9}} {{IPA|[i]}} and in the case of {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03c5}} ({{IPA|[af]}} or {{IPA|[av]}}) and {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03c5}} ({{IPA|[ef]}} or {{IPA|[ev]}}), the accent is written on the second letter as in {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03af}}, {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03af}}, {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03cd}} etc. When the accent is written on the first letter, the sequence is pronounced as an accented diphthong, for example {{lang|el|\u03ac\u03b9}} {{IPA|[\u02c8ai\u032f]}} as in {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03ac\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u0263ai\u032f\u00f0aros]}}, \"donkey\"). When the second letter takes a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], the sequence is often pronounced as a diphthong, for example {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03ca}} {{IPA|[ai\u032f]}} as in {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b1\u03ca\u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1}} ({{IPA|[pai\u032f\u02c8\u00f0acja]}}, \"ribs\"). Finally, when the accent is placed on the second letter together with diaeresis, the vowels are pronounced separately and the second vowel is accented, for example {{lang|el|\u03b1\u0390}} {{IPA|[a\u02c8i]}} as in {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b1\u0390\u03c4\u03b1}} ({{IPA|[sa\u02c8ita]}}, \"paper airplane\").\n\nAs in Ancient Greek, in Modern Greek the accent cannot be placed before the antepenultimate syllable (Greek: {{lang|el|\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}, \"law of three syllables\", also known as \"law of limitation\" and ''[[Dreimorengesetz]]''). As a result, in many [[wikt:imparisyllabic|imparisyllabic]] nouns, i.e. nouns that do not have the same number of syllables in all their inflections, an antepenultimate accent moves to the next syllable when a syllable is added. For example, {{sc|nom}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|\u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8ma\u03b8ima]}}, \"lesson\") but {{sc|gen}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}} {{IPA|[ma\u02c8\u03b8imatos]}} and {{sc|nom}} {{sc|pl}} {{lang|el|\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1}} {{IPA|[ma\u02c8\u03b8imata]}} etc. In some words, the accent moves forward even without the addition of a syllable. For example, {{sc|nom}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8an\u03b8ropos]}}, \"human\") but {{sc|gen}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5}} {{IPA|[an\u02c8\u03b8ropu]}}, {{sc|gen}} {{sc|pl}} {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd}} {{IPA|[an\u02c8\u03b8ropon]}} and {{sc|acc}} {{sc|pl}} {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2}} {{IPA|[an\u02c8\u03b8ropus]}}. This is due to historical reasons: long vowels and diphthongs occupied two [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] which had the same effect as the addition of a syllable.<ref>{{in lang|el}} [http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/glossology/show.html?id=21 Portal for the Greek Language: \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1\u03c2]. Retrieved 6 June 2017.</ref>\n\n==Verbs==\nGreek verb morphology is structured around a basic 2-by-2 contrast of two [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]], namely [[imperfective]] and [[perfective]], and two [[Grammatical tense|tenses]], namely past and non-past (or present). The aspects are expressed by two separate verb stems, while the tenses are marked mainly by different sets of endings. Of the four possible combinations, only three can be used in [[indicative]] function: the '''present''' (i.e. imperfective non-past), the  '''imperfect''' (i.e. imperfective past) and the '''aorist''' (i.e. perfective past). All four combinations can be used in [[subjunctive]] function, where they are typically preceded by the particle {{lang|el|\u03bd\u03b1}} or by one of a set of subordinating conjunctions. There are also two [[Imperative mood|imperatives]], one for each aspect.\n\nIn addition to these basic forms, Greek also has several [[periphrastic]] verb constructions. All the basic forms can be combined with the [[Future tense|future]] particle {{lang|el|\u03b8\u03b1}} (historically a contraction of {{lang|el|\u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1}}, 'want to'). Combined with the non-past forms, this creates an imperfective and a perfective future. Combined with the imperfective past it is used as a [[Conditional mood|conditional]], and with the perfective past as an [[Inferential mood|inferential]]. There is also a [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], which is expressed with an inflected form of the [[auxiliary verb]] {{lang|el|\u03ad\u03c7\u03c9}} ('have'). It occurs both as a past perfect (pluperfect) and as a present perfect.\n\nModern Greek verbs additionally have three [[Non-finite verb|non-finite]] forms. There is a form traditionally called \"\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\" (i.e. 'infinitive', literally the 'invariant form'), which is historically derived from the perfective (aorist) infinitive, but has today lost all syntactical functions typically associated with that category. It is used only to form the periphrastic perfect and pluperfect, and is always formally identical to the 3rd person singular of the perfective non-past. There is also a passive participle, typically ending in ''-menos (-meni, -meno)'', which is inflected as a regular adjective. Its use is either as a canonical adjective, or as a part of a second, alternative perfect periphrasis with transitive verbs. Finally, there is another invariant form, formed from the present tense and typically ending in ''-ontas'', which is variably called either a participle or a gerund by modern authors. It is historically derived from an old present participle, and its sole use today is to form non-finite adjunct adverbial clauses of time or manner, roughly corresponding to an ''-ing'' participle in English.\n\n* Regular perfect periphrasis, with ''aparemphato'' (\"invariant form\"), for example:\n** {{lang|el|\u0388\u03c7\u03c9 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8exo \u02c8\u0263rapsi tin epita\u02c8\u029di]}}, 'I have written the cheque')\n* Alternative perfect periphrasis, with passive participle, for example:\n** {{lang|el|\u0388\u03c7\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8exo tin epita\u02c8\u029di \u0263ra\u02c8meni]}}, 'I have written the cheque')\n* Adverbial clause with present participle/gerund form, for example:\n** {{lang|el|\u0388\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03be\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8etrekse ston \u02c8\u00f0romo tra\u0263u\u02c8\u00f0ondas]}}, 'he ran along the street singing')\n\nThe tables below exemplify the range of forms with those of one large inflectional class of verbs, the 1st Conjugation.\n\n===First conjugation===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In regular (demotic) verbs in standard modern Greek, the prefix is used depending on a stress rule, which specifies that each past tense verb form has its stress on the third syllable from the last (the ''antepenultimate''); the prefix is only inserted whenever the verb would otherwise have fewer than three syllables. In these verbs, the augment always appears as {{lang|el|\u03ad-}}. A number of frequent verbs have irregular forms involving other vowels, mostly {{lang|el|\u03b7-}} (''i-''), for example, {{lang|el|\u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9}} \u2192 {{lang|el|\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1}} ('want'). In addition, verbs from the learned tradition partly preserve more complex patterns inherited from ancient Greek. In learned compound verbs with adverbial prefixes such as {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9-}} (''peri-'') or {{lang|el|\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf-}} (''ipo-''), the augment is inserted between the prefix and the verb stem (for example, {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9-\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9}} \u2192 {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ad-\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c8\u03b1}} ('describe'). Where the prefix itself ends in a vowel, the vowels in this position may be subject to further assimilation rules, such as in {{lang|el|\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf-\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9}} \u2192 {{lang|el|\u03c5\u03c0-\u03ad-\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c8\u03b1}} ('sign').

The mediopassive has several functions: \n*Passive function, denoting an action that is performed on the subject by another agent (for example, {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03ce\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5}} 'he was killed');\n*Reflexive function, denoting an action performed by the subject on him-/herself (for example, {{lang|el|\u03be\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5}} 'he shaved himself');\n*Reciprocal function, denoting an action performed by several subjects on each other (for example, {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}} 'they love each other');\n*Modal function, denoting the possibility of an action (for example, {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}} 'it is edible');\n*Deponential function: verbs that occur only in the mediopassive and lack a corresponding active form. They often have meanings that are rendered as active in other languages: {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9}} '\u0399 work'; {{lang|el|\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9}} 'I sleep'; {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9}} 'I accept'. There are also many verbs that have both an active and a mediopassive form but where the mediopassive has a special function that may be rendered with a separate verb in other languages: for example, active {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b7\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd\u03c9}} 'I raise', passive {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b7\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9}} 'I get up'; active {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9}} 'I strike', passive {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9}} 'I am bored'.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9}} 'write'\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ce}} 'love'\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{lang|el|\u03bf\u03b4\u03b7\u03b3\u03ce}} 'lead'\n|-\n!

As in many other Indo-European languages, the distribution of grammatical gender across nouns is largely arbitrary and need not coincide with natural sex.<ref name=\"HPWC.2.2\">{{harvnb|Holton|Mackridge|Philippaki-Warburton|1997|loc=\u00a7C.2.2}}</ref> Case, number and gender are marked on the noun as well as on articles and adjectives modifying it. While there are four cases, there is a great degree of [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]] between case forms within most paradigms. Only one sub-group of the masculine nouns actually has four distinct forms in the four cases.\n\n===Articles===\nThere are two articles in Modern Greek, the definite and the indefinite. They are both inflected for gender and case, and the definite article also for number. The article agrees with the noun it modifies.\n\n====Definite article====\nThe definite article is used frequently in Greek, such as before proper names and nouns used in an abstract sense.

In addition each noun belongs to one of three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. Within each of the three genders, there are several sub-groups (declension classes) with different sets of inflectional endings.\n\n====Masculine nouns====\nThe main groups of masculine nouns have the nominative singular end in -\u03bf\u03c2 [-os], -\u03b7\u03c2 [-is], -\u03b1\u03c2 [-as], -\u03b5\u03b1\u03c2 [-\u02c8eas]. Nouns in ''-os'' are identical to the Ancient Greek [[Ancient Greek nouns#Second declension|second declension]], except for the final ''-n'' of the accusative singular. However, in other parts of speech that follow the same declension and where clarity is necessary, such as in pronouns, the ''-n'' is added. When the word has more than two syllables and the antepenult is accented, the accent fluctuates between the antepenult and the penult according to whether the last syllable has one of the ancient long diphthongs, -\u03bf\u03c5, -\u03c9\u03bd or -\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2. Nouns in ''-is'' correspond to the ancient [[Ancient Greek nouns#First declension|first declension]] and have the accent on the ultimate syllable in genitive plural, and so do some nouns ending in -\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 [-\u02c8ias].<ref name=\"Atkinson\">B.F.C. Atkinson, ''The Greek Language'', Cambridge University Press, Second Edition, October 1933, p. 316</ref>  Nouns in ''-as'' stem from the ancient third declension. They formed their nominative singular from the accusative singular and retain the original accent in genitive plural.<ref name=\"Atkinson\" /> Nouns in ''-eas'' stem from the ancient [[Ancient Greek nouns#Third declension|third declension]] and form their plural respectively.\n\nMoreover, there are other categories and forms too that have to do with either Demotic or Katharevousa. For example, through Demotic, many nouns, especially oxytones (those that are accented on the last syllable) in -\u03ac\u03c2 (''-as'') or -\u03ae\u03c2 (''-is'') form their plural by adding the stem extension -\u03ac\u03b4- (''-ad-'') and -\u03ae\u03b4- (''-id-'') respectively. Although this declension group is an element of Demotic, it has its roots in [[Ionic Greek]] that influenced later [[Koine Greek|Koine]].<ref>{{in lang|el}} [http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/studies/history/thema_14/25.html \u00a7\u00a7 \u03b1 & \u03b2, \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2, \u03a7.

Moreover, some nouns in -\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf (''-imo''), which are usually derivatives of verbs, are declined similarly to those that end in ''-a''. Also note that most borrowings are indeclinable neuter, and can have just about any ending, such as \u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03af\u03bd\u03c4-\u03c3\u03ad\u03c1\u03c6\u03b9\u03bd\u03b3\u03ba \"windsurfing\".

For example, \u03c4\u03bf \u03c6\u03c9\u03c2 (''fos'', \"light\") becomes \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c6\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1 and \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c6\u03ce\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd and \u03c4\u03bf \u03bf\u03be\u03cd (''oxy'', \"acid\") becomes \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bf\u03be\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b1 \u03bf\u03be\u03ad\u03b1 and \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bf\u03be\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd.\n\n==Adjectives==\nAdjectives agree with nouns in gender, case and number. Therefore, each adjective has a threefold declension paradigm for the three genders. Adjectives show [[agreement (grammar)|agreement]] both when they are used as attributes, e.g. \u03b7 \u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 (''i omorfi gynaika'', \"the beautiful woman\") and when they are used as predicates e.g. \u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03b7 (''i gynaika einai omorfi'', \"the woman is beautiful\").\n\nMost adjectives take forms in -\u03bf\u03c2 (''-os'') in the masculine, -\u03bf (''-o'') in the neuter and either -\u03b7 (''-i''), -\u03b1 (''-a'') or -\u03b9\u03b1 (''-ia'') in the feminine. All those adjectives are declined similarly with the nouns that have the same endings. However they keep the accent stable where nouns change it. Adjectives with a consonant before the ending usually form the feminine with -\u03b7, those with a vowel before the ending in -\u03b1 and some adjectives that end in -\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ([-\u02c8kos], ''-kos'') or -\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2 ([-\u02c8xos], ''-chos'') usually form it in -\u03b9\u03b1 although the ending -\u03b7 is applicable for those too.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n!

comparative for expressing comparisons. Similar to English, it can be formed in two ways, as a periphrastic form (as in English {{sc|pos}} beautiful, {{sc|comp}} more beautiful) and as a synthetic form using suffixes, as in English {{sc|adj}} tall {{sc|comp}} tall-er. The periphrastic comparative is formed by the particle \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf ([p\u00e7o], ''pio'', originally \"more\") preceding the adjective. The synthetic forms of the regular adjectives in -\u03bf\u03c2, -\u03b7 and -o is created with the suffix -\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''-oteros''), -\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7 (''-oteri'') and -\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf (''-otero''). For those adjectives that end in -\u03b7\u03c2 and -\u03b5\u03c2 or -\u03c5\u03c2, -\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 and -\u03c5 the corresponding suffixes are -\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''-esteros'') etc. and -\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''-yteros'') etc. respectively.\n\nA [[superlative]] is expressed by combining the comparative, in either its periphrastic or synthetic form, with a preceding definite article. Thus, Modern Greek does not distinguish between ''the largest house'' and ''the larger house''; both are \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u03c3\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03b9.\n\nBesides the superlative proper, sometimes called \"relative superlative\", there is also an \"absolute superlative\" or [[elative (gradation)|elative]], expressing the meaning \"very...\", for example \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 means ''very beautiful''.

Nominative pronouns only have the strong form (except in some minor environments) and are used as subjects only when special emphasis is intended, since unstressed subjects recoverable from context are not overtly expressed anyway. Genitive (possessive) pronouns are used in their weak forms as pre-verbal clitics to express indirect objects (for example, \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1, {{IPA|[tu \u02c8milisa]}}, 'I talked to him'), and as a post-nominal clitic to express possession (for example, \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, {{IPA|[i \u02c8fili tu]}}, 'his friends'). The strong genitive forms are relatively rare and used only for special emphasis (for example, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, {{IPA|[af\u02c8tu i \u02c8fili]}}, '''his'' friends'); often they are doubled by the weak forms (for example, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1, {{IPA|[af\u02c8tu tu \u02c8milisa]}}, ' ''him'' I talked to'). An alternative way of giving emphasis to a possessive pronoun is propping it up with the stressed adjective \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ({{IPA|[\u00f0i\u02c8kos]}}, 'own'), for example, \u03bf\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 ({{IPA|[i \u00f0i\u02c8ci tu \u02c8fili]}}, '<nowiki/>''his'' friends').\n\nAccusative pronouns exist both in a weak and a strong form. The weak form in the oblique cases is used as a pre-verbal clitic (for example, \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b1, {{IPA|[ton \u02c8i\u00f0a]}}, 'I saw him'); the strong form is used elsewhere in the clause (for example, \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, {{IPA|[\u02c8i\u00f0a af\u02c8ton]}}, 'I saw ''him''<nowiki/>'). The weak form in the nominative is found only in few idiomatic deictic expressions, such as \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 'there he [is]', \u03c0\u03bf\u03cd '\u03bd' \u03c4\u03bf\u03c2; 'where is he?'. Third-person pronouns have separate forms for the three genders; those of the first and second person do not. The weak third-person forms are similar to the corresponding forms of the definite article. The strong third-person forms function simultaneously as generic demonstratives ('this, that').\n\nThe strong forms of the third person in the genitive (\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2) have optional alternative forms extended by an additional syllable {{IPA|[-on-]}} or {{IPA|[-un-]}} (\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd). In the plural, there exists the alternative accusative form \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|1st person\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|2nd person\n!colspan=\"6\"|3rd person\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Masc.\n!colspan=\"2\"|Fem.\n!colspan=\"2\"|Neut.\n|-\n!rowspan=\"6\"|Strong\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Singular\n!Nominative\n|\u03b5\u03b3\u03ce   ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8\u0263o]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03cd   ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8si]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tos]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae  ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ti]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc  ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8to]}}\n|-\n!Genitive\n|\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8mena]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8sena]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4o\u03cd ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tu]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tis]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tu]}}\n|-\n!Accusative\n|\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8mena]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8sena]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ton]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03bd||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tin]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc  ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8to]}}\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Plural\n!Nominative\n|\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8mis]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8sis]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03af ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ti]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tes]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac  ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ta]}}\n|-\n!Genitive\n|\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2  ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8mas]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03ac\u03c2  ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8sas]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ton]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ton]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ton]}}\n|-\n!Accusative\n|\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2  ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8mas]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03ac\u03c2  ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8sas]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tus]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tes]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac  ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ta]}}\n|-\n!rowspan=\"6\"|Weak\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Singular\n!Nominative\n| colspan=\"4\" |\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tos]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b7\n|{{IPA|[ti]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\n|{{IPA|[to]}}\n|-     ||\n!Genitive\n|\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\n|{{IPA|[mu]}}\n|\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\n|{{IPA|[su]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\n|{{IPA|[tu]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tis]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\n|{{IPA|[tu]}}\n|-     ||\n!Accusative\n|\u03bc\u03b5\n|{{IPA|[me]}}||\u03c3\u03b5\n|{{IPA|[se]}}||\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\n|{{IPA|[ton]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd<ref name=\"nu\" group=\"note\" />\n|{{IPA|[tin]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\n|{{IPA|[to]}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Plural\n!Nominative\n| colspan=\"4\" |\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\n|{{IPA|[ti]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tes]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b1\n|{{IPA|[ta]}}\n|- ||\n!Genitive\n|\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[mas]}}\n|\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[sas]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tus]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tus]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tus]}}\n|- ||\n!Accusative\n|\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2   ||{{IPA|[mas]}}\n|\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2||{{IPA|[sas]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tus]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2/\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tis]/[tes]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b1\n|{{IPA|[ta]}}\n|}\n\nBesides \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 {{IPA|[af\u02c8tos]}} as a generic demonstrative, there are also the more specific spatial demonstrative pronouns \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, -\u03b7, -\u03bf ({{IPA|[\u02c8tutos]}}, 'this here') and \u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, -\u03b7, -\u03bf ({{IPA|[e\u02c8cinos]}}, 'that there').\n\n==Prepositions==\nIn [[Demotic Greek]], prepositions normally require the [[accusative case]]: \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc (from), \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 (for), \u03bc\u03b5 (with), \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac (after), \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 (without), \u03c9\u03c2 (as) and \u03c3\u03b5 (to, in or at). The preposition \u03c3\u03b5, when followed by a definite article, fuses with it into forms like \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf (\u03c3\u03b5 + \u03c4\u03bf) and \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 (\u03c3\u03b5 + \u03c4\u03b7). While there is only a relatively small number of simple prepositions native to Demotic, the two most basic prepositions \u03c3\u03b5 and \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc can enter into a large number of combinations with preceding adverbs to form new compound prepositions, for example, \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c3\u03b5 (on), \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc (underneath), \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5 (beside) etc.\n\nA few prepositions that take cases other than the accusative have been borrowed into [[Standard Modern Greek]] from the learned tradition of [[Katharevousa]]: \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac (against), \u03c5\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1 (in favor of, for), \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af (instead of). Other prepositions live on in a fossilised form in certain fixed expressions (for example, \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03c9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03cd 'in the meantime', dative).\n\nThe preposition \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc (''ap\u00f3'', 'from') is also used to express the agent in passive sentences, like English ''by''.\n\n==Conjunctions==\nCoordinating and subordinating [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] in Greek include:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"1\" |Kinds\n!colspan=\"1\" |Conjunctions\n!colspan=\"1\" |Meaning\n|-\n!Copulative\n|\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 (\u03ba\u03b9), \u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5, \u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03b5, \u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03ad, \u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u03ad, \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd... \u03b4\u03b5\n|''and, neither''\n|-\n!Disjunctive\n|\u03ae, \u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b5\n|''or, either''\n|-\n!Adversative\n|\u03bc\u03b1, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac, \u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2, \u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf, \u03b5\u03bd\u03ce, \u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9, \u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9, \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf, \u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\n|''but, although, however, whereas'' \n|-\n!Inferential\n|\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd, \u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5, \u03ac\u03c1\u03b1, \u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03c2, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\n|''so, so as, thus, that''\n|-\n!Explanatory\n|\u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03b4\u03ae\n|''so, in other words''\n|-\n![[Complementizer]]s<ref>Holton, Mackridge & Philippaki-Warburton 2004, p. 195</ref>\n|\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9, \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\n|''that''\n|-\n!Temporal\n|\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd, \u03b5\u03bd\u03ce, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ce\u03c2, \u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03cd, \u03b1\u03c6\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd (\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1), \u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd, \u03ce\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c9\u03c3\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, \u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5, \u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\n|''when, while, after, before, just, until''\n|-\n!Causal\n|\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af, \u03b4\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9, \u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae, \u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03cd\n|''because''\n|-\n!Conditional\n|\u03b1\u03bd, \u03b5\u03ac\u03bd, \u03ac\u03bc\u03b1, \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\n|''if''\n|-\n!Purpose\n|\u03bd\u03b1, \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1\n|''so as, (in order) to''\n|-\n!Result\n|\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 (\u03bd\u03b1), \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\n|''so as, (in order) to''\n|-\n!Concessive\n|\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\n|''despite''\n|-\n!Dubitative\n|\u03bc\u03b7(\u03bd), \u03bc\u03ae\u03c0\u03c9\u03c2\n|''maybe, perhaps''\n|-\n!Comparative\n|\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\n|''to, than''\n|}\n\nThe word \u03bd\u03b1 ({{IPA|[na]}}) serves as a generic subordinator corresponding roughly to English ''to'' (+ infinitive) or ''that'' in sentences like \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ce \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03c9 ({{IPA|[proti\u02c8mo na \u02c8pao]}}, 'I prefer to go', literally 'I prefer that I go') or \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ce \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bf \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 ({{IPA|[proti\u02c8mo na \u02c8pai o \u02c8\u029dannis]}}, 'I prefer that John go'). It marks the following verb as being in the [[subjunctive]] mood. Somewhat similar to the English ''to''-infinitive its use is often associated with meanings of non-factuality, i.e. events that have not (yet) come true, that are expected, wished for etc. In this, it contrasts with \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 {{IPA|[\u02c8oti]}} and \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 {{IPA|[pos]}}, which correspond to English ''that'' when used with a meaning of factuality. The difference can be seen in the contrast between \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5 \u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03c4\u03b1 ({{IPA|[mas \u02c8ipe na \u02c8pame \u02c8volta]}}, 'he told us to go for a walk') vs. \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03ae\u03b3\u03b5 \u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03c4\u03b1 ({{IPA|[mas \u02c8ipe pos \u02c8pi\u029de \u02c8volta]}}, 'he told us that he went for a walk'). When used on its own with a following verb, \u03bd\u03b1 may express a wish or order, as in \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9! ({{IPA|[na \u02c8pai]}}, 'let him go' or 'may he go'). Unlike the other subordinating conjunctions, \u03bd\u03b1 is always immediately followed by the verb it governs, separated from it only by any clitics that might be attached to the verb, but not by a subject or other clause-initial material.\n\n==Negation==\nFor sentence negation, Greek has two distinct negation particles, \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd ([\u02c8\u00f0en], ''den'') and \u03bc\u03b7(\u03bd)<ref name=\"nu\" group=\"note\"/> ([\u02c8mi(n)], ''mi(n)''). \u0394\u03b5\u03bd is used  in clauses with indicative mood, while \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd is used primarily in subjunctive contexts, either after subjunctive-inducing \u03bd\u03b1 or as a negative replacement for \u03bd\u03b1. Both particles are syntactically part of the [[proclitic]] group in front of the verb, and can be separated from the verb only by intervening clitic pronouns.<ref>Joseph and Philippaki-Warburton, 1987, p. 62</ref> The distinction between \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd and \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd is a particularly archaic feature in Greek, continuing an old [[Prohibitive mood|prohibitive]] negation marker inherited from Indo-European.<ref name=\"Wackernagel\">{{cite book|first=Jacob|last=Wackernagel|title=Lectures on syntax, with special reference to Greek, Latin, and Germanic.

(''Tou zitisa na '''min''' erthei'', \"I asked him '''not''' to come.\")\n\nWhen used alone with a subjunctive verb in the second person, prohibitive \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd serves as the functional equivalent to a negative imperative, which itself cannot be negated. Thus, the negation of the positive imperative \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03be\u03b5 ({{IPA|[\u02c8trekse]}}, 'run!') is \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 ({{IPA|[min \u02c8treksis]}}, 'don't run!').\n\nThe particle \u03cc\u03c7\u03b9 serves as the stand-alone utterance of negation ('no'), and also for negation of elliptical, verbless sentences and for contrastive negation of individual constituents:\n\n*\u039a\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, '''\u03cc\u03c7\u03b9''' \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf. (''Kalesa tin Maria, '''ochi''' ton Giorgo'', \"I invited Mary, '''not''' George.\")\n\nFor constituent negation, Greek employs [[negative concord]]. The negated constituent is marked with a negative-polarity item (e.g. \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 'any, anybody/nobody', \u03c4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1 'anything/nothing', \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac 'anywhere/nowhere'), and the verb is additionally marked with the sentence negator \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd (or \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd).<ref>Joseph and Philippaki-Warburton 1987, p. 65</ref> In verbless, elliptical contexts the negative-polarity items can also serve to express negation alone.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"|&nbsp;\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"|Masculine\n!colspan=\"2\"|Feminine\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"|Neuter\n|-\n!Nominative<br/>Genitive<br/>Accusative\n|\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 <small>or</small> \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd<ref name=\"nu\" group=\"note\"/>\n|{{IPA|[-enas]}} <small>or</small> {{IPA|[-is]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-enos]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-enan]}}\n|\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c2<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\n|{{IPA|[-mia]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-mias]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-mia]}}\n|\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\n|{{IPA|[-ena]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-enos]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-ena]}}\n|}\nThe negative pronoun \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 ([ka\u02c8nis], ''kaneis''), i.e. ''nobody'' or ''anybody'' is declined in all three genders and three cases and can be used as the English determiner ''no''.\n\n*\u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd \u03b5\u03b4\u03ce.

The simpler and by far the more frequent uses the invariable [[relativizer]] \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 ({{IPA|[pu]}}, 'that', literally 'where'), as in: \u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 ({{IPA|[i \u029di\u02c8neka pu \u02c8i\u00f0a xtes]}}, 'the woman that I saw yesterday'). When the relativized element is a subject, object or adverbial within the relative clause, then \u2013 as in English \u2013 it has no other overt expression within the relative clause apart from the relativizer. Some other types of relativized elements, however, such as possessors, are represented within the clause by a resumptive pronoun, as in: \u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 <u>\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2</u> ({{IPA|/i \u029di\u02c8neka pu \u02c8vrika tin \u02c8t\u0361sanda <u>tis</u>/}}, 'the woman whose handbag I found', literally 'the woman that I found <u>her</u> handbag').\n\nThe second and more formal form of relative clauses employs complex inflected [[relative pronoun]]s. They are composite elements consisting of the definite article and a following pronominal element that is inflected like an adjective: \u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b7 \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b1, \u03c4\u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03bf ({{IPA|[o o\u02c8pios, i o\u02c8pia, to o\u02c8pio]}} etc., literally 'the which'). Both elements are inflected for case, number and gender according to the grammatical properties of the relativized item within the relative clause, as in: \u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 ({{IPA|[i \u029di\u02c8neka tin o\u02c8pia \u02c8i\u00f0a xtes]}}, 'the woman whom I saw yesterday'); \u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 ({{IPA|[i \u029di\u02c8neka tis o\u02c8pias \u02c8vrika tin \u02c8t\u0361sanda]}}, 'the woman whose handbag I found').\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Hardy, D.

This applies particularly to unstressed object pronouns, negation [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s, the tense particle {{lang|el|\u03b8\u03b1}} {{IPA|[\u03b8a]}}, and the [[subjunctive]] particle {{lang|el|\u03bd\u03b1}} {{IPA|[na]}}. Likewise, possessive pronouns are enclitic to the nouns they modify.\n\n===Morphology===\nGreek is a largely [[Synthetic language|synthetic]] (inflectional) language. Although the complexity of the inflectional system has been somewhat reduced in comparison to [[Ancient Greek]], there is also a considerable degree of continuity in the morphological system, and Greek still has a somewhat archaic character compared with other Indo-European languages of Europe.<ref name=\"Browning\">Robert Browning, ''Medieval and Modern Greek'', Cambridge University Press, Second Edition, 1983, {{ISBN|0521299780}}</ref> Nouns, adjectives and verbs are each divided into several inflectional classes (declension classes and conjugation classes), which have different sets of endings. In the nominals, the ancient inflectional system is well preserved, with the exception of the loss of one case, the [[dative]], and the restructuring of several of the inflectional classes. In the verbal system, the loss of synthetic inflectional categories is somewhat greater, and several new [[Analytic language|analytic]] (periphrastic) constructions have evolved instead.\n\n===Characteristics of the Balkan language area===\nModern Greek shares several syntactic characteristics with its geographical neighbours, with which it forms the so-called [[Balkan language area]] (''Sprachbund'').<ref name=\"Lindstedt\">{{harvnb|Lindstedt|1998}}</ref> Among these characteristics are:\n*The lack of an infinitive. In Greek, verbal complementation in contexts where English would use an infinitive is typically formed with the help of finite (subjunctive) verb forms (e.g. {{lang|el|\u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03c9}}, {{IPA|[\u02c8\u03b8elo na \u02c8pao]}}, literally 'I-want that I-go', i.e. 'I want to go').\n*The merger of the dative and the genitive case. In Greek, indirect objects are expressed partly through genitive forms of nouns or pronouns, and partly through a periphrasis consisting of the preposition {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b5}} ({{IPA|[se]}}, 'to') and the accusative.\n*The use of a future construction derived from the verb 'want' ({{lang|el|\u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u03b8eli na]}} \u2192 {{lang|el|\u03b8\u03b1}} {{IPA|[\u03b8a]}}).\n*A tendency to use pre-verbal clitic object pronouns redundantly ([[clitic doubling]]), doubling an object that is also expressed elsewhere in the clause: for example, {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf}} ({{IPA|[to \u02c8i\u00f0a to afto\u02c8cinito]}}, 'I saw it, the car\", literally 'It I-saw the car').\nOn the other hand, one prominent feature of the Balkan language area that Greek does not share is the use of a postposed definite article. The Greek article (like the Ancient Greek one) stands before the noun.\n\n==Accent==\nModern Greek has a [[stress accent]], similar to English. The accent is notated with a stroke (\u0384) over the accented vowel and is called {{lang|el|\u03bf\u03be\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}} (''oxeia'', \"acute\") or {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}} (''tonos'', \"accent\") in Greek. The former term is taken from one of the accents used in [[polytonic orthography]] which officially became obsolete in 1982.\n\nMost monosyllabic words take no accent such as in {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf}} ({{IPA|[to]}}, \"the\") and {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[pjos]}}, \"who\"). Exceptions include the conjunction {{lang|el|\u03ae}} ({{IPA|[i]}}, \"or\"), the interrogative adverbs {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03ce\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[pos]}}, \"how\") and {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd}} ({{IPA|[pu]}}, \"where\") in both direct and indirect questions and some fixed expressions such as {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03cd}} ({{IPA|[pu ke pu]}}, \"occasionally\") and {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03ce\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03ce\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[pos ke pos]}}, \"cravingly\"). Moreover, weak personal pronouns are accented in cases where they may be mistaken for enclitics (see below). For example, {{lang|el|\u03bf \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u03b3\u03ac\u03b2\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5}} ({{IPA|[o \u02c8skilos mu \u02c8\u0263av\u029dise]}}, \"the dog barked at me\") instead of {{lang|el|\u03bf \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b3\u03ac\u03b2\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5}} ({{IPA|[o \u02c8skiloz\u203fmu \u02c8\u0263av\u029dise]}}, \"my dog barked\").<ref name=\"triantafyllidis\">\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2, \u0391. \u03ba\u03ac., ''\u039d\u03b5\u03bf\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae: \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b3\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b7'', \u039f\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u0395\u03ba\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u0392\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1, 2004, pp. 22\u201326</ref>\n\nEnclitics are pronounced very closely to the previous word. Most enclitics are weak personal pronouns. Enclitics do not modify the accent of the previous word when this word is accented on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, for example {{lang|el|\u03bf\u03b4\u03b7\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[o\u00f0i\u02c8\u0263oz\u203fmas]}}, \"our driver\") and {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5}} ({{IPA|[vi\u02c8vlio\u203fsu]}}, \"your book\"). However, when the previous word is accented on the antepenultimate syllable, the enclitic causes the ultimate syllable to be accented too. For example, {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u00f0askalos]}}, \"teacher\") but {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5}} ({{IPA|[\u02cc\u00f0aska\u02c8loz\u203fmu]}}, \"my teacher\") and {{lang|el|\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8forese]}}, \"wear {{sc|(imp)}}\") but {{lang|el|\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03ad \u03c4\u03bf}} ({{IPA|[\u02ccfore\u02c8se\u203fto]}}, \"wear it\"). Finally, enclitics are accented only when they precede another enclitic and these two determine an imperative accented on the penultimate syllable. For example, {{lang|el|\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5 \u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u03c4\u03bf}} ({{IPA|[\u02ccfere\u203f\u02c8mu\u203fto]}}, \"bring it to me\").<ref name=\"triantafyllidis\"/>\n\nIn [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] which are pronounced as simple [[phoneme]]s such as {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03b9}} {{IPA|[e]}}, {{lang|el|\u03bf\u03b9}} {{IPA|[i]}} and {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03b9}} {{IPA|[i]}} and in the case of {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03c5}} ({{IPA|[af]}} or {{IPA|[av]}}) and {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03c5}} ({{IPA|[ef]}} or {{IPA|[ev]}}), the accent is written on the second letter as in {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03af}}, {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03af}}, {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03cd}} etc. When the accent is written on the first letter, the sequence is pronounced as an accented diphthong, for example {{lang|el|\u03ac\u03b9}} {{IPA|[\u02c8ai\u032f]}} as in {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03ac\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u0263ai\u032f\u00f0aros]}}, \"donkey\"). When the second letter takes a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], the sequence is often pronounced as a diphthong, for example {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03ca}} {{IPA|[ai\u032f]}} as in {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b1\u03ca\u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1}} ({{IPA|[pai\u032f\u02c8\u00f0acja]}}, \"ribs\"). Finally, when the accent is placed on the second letter together with diaeresis, the vowels are pronounced separately and the second vowel is accented, for example {{lang|el|\u03b1\u0390}} {{IPA|[a\u02c8i]}} as in {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b1\u0390\u03c4\u03b1}} ({{IPA|[sa\u02c8ita]}}, \"paper airplane\").\n\nAs in Ancient Greek, in Modern Greek the accent cannot be placed before the antepenultimate syllable (Greek: {{lang|el|\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}, \"law of three syllables\", also known as \"law of limitation\" and ''[[Dreimorengesetz]]''). As a result, in many [[wikt:imparisyllabic|imparisyllabic]] nouns, i.e. nouns that do not have the same number of syllables in all their inflections, an antepenultimate accent moves to the next syllable when a syllable is added. For example, {{sc|nom}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|\u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8ma\u03b8ima]}}, \"lesson\") but {{sc|gen}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}} {{IPA|[ma\u02c8\u03b8imatos]}} and {{sc|nom}} {{sc|pl}} {{lang|el|\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1}} {{IPA|[ma\u02c8\u03b8imata]}} etc. In some words, the accent moves forward even without the addition of a syllable. For example, {{sc|nom}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8an\u03b8ropos]}}, \"human\") but {{sc|gen}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5}} {{IPA|[an\u02c8\u03b8ropu]}}, {{sc|gen}} {{sc|pl}} {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd}} {{IPA|[an\u02c8\u03b8ropon]}} and {{sc|acc}} {{sc|pl}} {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2}} {{IPA|[an\u02c8\u03b8ropus]}}. This is due to historical reasons: long vowels and diphthongs occupied two [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] which had the same effect as the addition of a syllable.<ref>{{in lang|el}} [http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/glossology/show.html?id=21 Portal for the Greek Language: \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1\u03c2]. Retrieved 6 June 2017.</ref>\n\n==Verbs==\nGreek verb morphology is structured around a basic 2-by-2 contrast of two [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]], namely [[imperfective]] and [[perfective]], and two [[Grammatical tense|tenses]], namely past and non-past (or present). The aspects are expressed by two separate verb stems, while the tenses are marked mainly by different sets of endings. Of the four possible combinations, only three can be used in [[indicative]] function: the '''present''' (i.e. imperfective non-past), the  '''imperfect''' (i.e. imperfective past) and the '''aorist''' (i.e. perfective past). All four combinations can be used in [[subjunctive]] function, where they are typically preceded by the particle {{lang|el|\u03bd\u03b1}} or by one of a set of subordinating conjunctions. There are also two [[Imperative mood|imperatives]], one for each aspect.\n\nIn addition to these basic forms, Greek also has several [[periphrastic]] verb constructions. All the basic forms can be combined with the [[Future tense|future]] particle {{lang|el|\u03b8\u03b1}} (historically a contraction of {{lang|el|\u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1}}, 'want to'). Combined with the non-past forms, this creates an imperfective and a perfective future. Combined with the imperfective past it is used as a [[Conditional mood|conditional]], and with the perfective past as an [[Inferential mood|inferential]]. There is also a [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], which is expressed with an inflected form of the [[auxiliary verb]] {{lang|el|\u03ad\u03c7\u03c9}} ('have'). It occurs both as a past perfect (pluperfect) and as a present perfect.\n\nModern Greek verbs additionally have three [[Non-finite verb|non-finite]] forms. There is a form traditionally called \"\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\" (i.e. 'infinitive', literally the 'invariant form'), which is historically derived from the perfective (aorist) infinitive, but has today lost all syntactical functions typically associated with that category. It is used only to form the periphrastic perfect and pluperfect, and is always formally identical to the 3rd person singular of the perfective non-past. There is also a passive participle, typically ending in ''-menos (-meni, -meno)'', which is inflected as a regular adjective. Its use is either as a canonical adjective, or as a part of a second, alternative perfect periphrasis with transitive verbs. Finally, there is another invariant form, formed from the present tense and typically ending in ''-ontas'', which is variably called either a participle or a gerund by modern authors. It is historically derived from an old present participle, and its sole use today is to form non-finite adjunct adverbial clauses of time or manner, roughly corresponding to an ''-ing'' participle in English.\n\n* Regular perfect periphrasis, with ''aparemphato'' (\"invariant form\"), for example:\n** {{lang|el|\u0388\u03c7\u03c9 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8exo \u02c8\u0263rapsi tin epita\u02c8\u029di]}}, 'I have written the cheque')\n* Alternative perfect periphrasis, with passive participle, for example:\n** {{lang|el|\u0388\u03c7\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8exo tin epita\u02c8\u029di \u0263ra\u02c8meni]}}, 'I have written the cheque')\n* Adverbial clause with present participle/gerund form, for example:\n** {{lang|el|\u0388\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03be\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8etrekse ston \u02c8\u00f0romo tra\u0263u\u02c8\u00f0ondas]}}, 'he ran along the street singing')\n\nThe tables below exemplify the range of forms with those of one large inflectional class of verbs, the 1st Conjugation.\n\n===First conjugation===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In regular (demotic) verbs in standard modern Greek, the prefix is used depending on a stress rule, which specifies that each past tense verb form has its stress on the third syllable from the last (the ''antepenultimate''); the prefix is only inserted whenever the verb would otherwise have fewer than three syllables. In these verbs, the augment always appears as {{lang|el|\u03ad-}}. A number of frequent verbs have irregular forms involving other vowels, mostly {{lang|el|\u03b7-}} (''i-''), for example, {{lang|el|\u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9}} \u2192 {{lang|el|\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1}} ('want'). In addition, verbs from the learned tradition partly preserve more complex patterns inherited from ancient Greek. In learned compound verbs with adverbial prefixes such as {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9-}} (''peri-'') or {{lang|el|\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf-}} (''ipo-''), the augment is inserted between the prefix and the verb stem (for example, {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9-\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9}} \u2192 {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ad-\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c8\u03b1}} ('describe'). Where the prefix itself ends in a vowel, the vowels in this position may be subject to further assimilation rules, such as in {{lang|el|\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf-\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9}} \u2192 {{lang|el|\u03c5\u03c0-\u03ad-\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c8\u03b1}} ('sign'). In addition, verbs whose stem begins in a vowel may also display vocalic changes instead of a syllabic augment, as in {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03bb\u03c0\u03af\u03b6\u03c9}} \u2192 {{lang|el|\u03ae\u03bb\u03c0\u03b9\u03b6\u03b1}} ('hope').

The mediopassive has several functions: \n*Passive function, denoting an action that is performed on the subject by another agent (for example, {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03ce\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5}} 'he was killed');\n*Reflexive function, denoting an action performed by the subject on him-/herself (for example, {{lang|el|\u03be\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5}} 'he shaved himself');\n*Reciprocal function, denoting an action performed by several subjects on each other (for example, {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}} 'they love each other');\n*Modal function, denoting the possibility of an action (for example, {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}} 'it is edible');\n*Deponential function: verbs that occur only in the mediopassive and lack a corresponding active form. They often have meanings that are rendered as active in other languages: {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9}} '\u0399 work'; {{lang|el|\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9}} 'I sleep'; {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9}} 'I accept'. There are also many verbs that have both an active and a mediopassive form but where the mediopassive has a special function that may be rendered with a separate verb in other languages: for example, active {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b7\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd\u03c9}} 'I raise', passive {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b7\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9}} 'I get up'; active {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9}} 'I strike', passive {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9}} 'I am bored'.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9}} 'write'\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ce}} 'love'\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{lang|el|\u03bf\u03b4\u03b7\u03b3\u03ce}} 'lead'\n|-\n!

As in many other Indo-European languages, the distribution of grammatical gender across nouns is largely arbitrary and need not coincide with natural sex.<ref name=\"HPWC.2.2\">{{harvnb|Holton|Mackridge|Philippaki-Warburton|1997|loc=\u00a7C.2.2}}</ref> Case, number and gender are marked on the noun as well as on articles and adjectives modifying it. While there are four cases, there is a great degree of [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]] between case forms within most paradigms. Only one sub-group of the masculine nouns actually has four distinct forms in the four cases.\n\n===Articles===\nThere are two articles in Modern Greek, the definite and the indefinite. They are both inflected for gender and case, and the definite article also for number. The article agrees with the noun it modifies.\n\n====Definite article====\nThe definite article is used frequently in Greek, such as before proper names and nouns used in an abstract sense.

In addition each noun belongs to one of three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. Within each of the three genders, there are several sub-groups (declension classes) with different sets of inflectional endings.\n\n====Masculine nouns====\nThe main groups of masculine nouns have the nominative singular end in -\u03bf\u03c2 [-os], -\u03b7\u03c2 [-is], -\u03b1\u03c2 [-as], -\u03b5\u03b1\u03c2 [-\u02c8eas]. Nouns in ''-os'' are identical to the Ancient Greek [[Ancient Greek nouns#Second declension|second declension]], except for the final ''-n'' of the accusative singular. However, in other parts of speech that follow the same declension and where clarity is necessary, such as in pronouns, the ''-n'' is added. When the word has more than two syllables and the antepenult is accented, the accent fluctuates between the antepenult and the penult according to whether the last syllable has one of the ancient long diphthongs, -\u03bf\u03c5, -\u03c9\u03bd or -\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2. Nouns in ''-is'' correspond to the ancient [[Ancient Greek nouns#First declension|first declension]] and have the accent on the ultimate syllable in genitive plural, and so do some nouns ending in -\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 [-\u02c8ias].<ref name=\"Atkinson\">B.F.C. Atkinson, ''The Greek Language'', Cambridge University Press, Second Edition, October 1933, p. 316</ref>  Nouns in ''-as'' stem from the ancient third declension. They formed their nominative singular from the accusative singular and retain the original accent in genitive plural.<ref name=\"Atkinson\" /> Nouns in ''-eas'' stem from the ancient [[Ancient Greek nouns#Third declension|third declension]] and form their plural respectively.\n\nMoreover, there are other categories and forms too that have to do with either Demotic or Katharevousa. For example, through Demotic, many nouns, especially oxytones (those that are accented on the last syllable) in -\u03ac\u03c2 (''-as'') or -\u03ae\u03c2 (''-is'') form their plural by adding the stem extension -\u03ac\u03b4- (''-ad-'') and -\u03ae\u03b4- (''-id-'') respectively. Although this declension group is an element of Demotic, it has its roots in [[Ionic Greek]] that influenced later [[Koine Greek|Koine]].<ref>{{in lang|el}} [http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/studies/history/thema_14/25.html \u00a7\u00a7 \u03b1 & \u03b2, \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2, \u03a7.

Moreover, some nouns in -\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf (''-imo''), which are usually derivatives of verbs, are declined similarly to those that end in ''-a''. Also note that most borrowings are indeclinable neuter, and can have just about any ending, such as \u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03af\u03bd\u03c4-\u03c3\u03ad\u03c1\u03c6\u03b9\u03bd\u03b3\u03ba \"windsurfing\".

For example, \u03c4\u03bf \u03c6\u03c9\u03c2 (''fos'', \"light\") becomes \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c6\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1 and \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c6\u03ce\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd and \u03c4\u03bf \u03bf\u03be\u03cd (''oxy'', \"acid\") becomes \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bf\u03be\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b1 \u03bf\u03be\u03ad\u03b1 and \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bf\u03be\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd.\n\n==Adjectives==\nAdjectives agree with nouns in gender, case and number. Therefore, each adjective has a threefold declension paradigm for the three genders. Adjectives show [[agreement (grammar)|agreement]] both when they are used as attributes, e.g. \u03b7 \u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 (''i omorfi gynaika'', \"the beautiful woman\") and when they are used as predicates e.g. \u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03b7 (''i gynaika einai omorfi'', \"the woman is beautiful\").\n\nMost adjectives take forms in -\u03bf\u03c2 (''-os'') in the masculine, -\u03bf (''-o'') in the neuter and either -\u03b7 (''-i''), -\u03b1 (''-a'') or -\u03b9\u03b1 (''-ia'') in the feminine. All those adjectives are declined similarly with the nouns that have the same endings. However they keep the accent stable where nouns change it. Adjectives with a consonant before the ending usually form the feminine with -\u03b7, those with a vowel before the ending in -\u03b1 and some adjectives that end in -\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ([-\u02c8kos], ''-kos'') or -\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2 ([-\u02c8xos], ''-chos'') usually form it in -\u03b9\u03b1 although the ending -\u03b7 is applicable for those too.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n!

comparative for expressing comparisons. Similar to English, it can be formed in two ways, as a periphrastic form (as in English {{sc|pos}} beautiful, {{sc|comp}} more beautiful) and as a synthetic form using suffixes, as in English {{sc|adj}} tall {{sc|comp}} tall-er. The periphrastic comparative is formed by the particle \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf ([p\u00e7o], ''pio'', originally \"more\") preceding the adjective. The synthetic forms of the regular adjectives in -\u03bf\u03c2, -\u03b7 and -o is created with the suffix -\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''-oteros''), -\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7 (''-oteri'') and -\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf (''-otero''). For those adjectives that end in -\u03b7\u03c2 and -\u03b5\u03c2 or -\u03c5\u03c2, -\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 and -\u03c5 the corresponding suffixes are -\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''-esteros'') etc. and -\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''-yteros'') etc. respectively.\n\nA [[superlative]] is expressed by combining the comparative, in either its periphrastic or synthetic form, with a preceding definite article. Thus, Modern Greek does not distinguish between ''the largest house'' and ''the larger house''; both are \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u03c3\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03b9.\n\nBesides the superlative proper, sometimes called \"relative superlative\", there is also an \"absolute superlative\" or [[elative (gradation)|elative]], expressing the meaning \"very...\", for example \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 means ''very beautiful''.

Nominative pronouns only have the strong form (except in some minor environments) and are used as subjects only when special emphasis is intended, since unstressed subjects recoverable from context are not overtly expressed anyway. Genitive (possessive) pronouns are used in their weak forms as pre-verbal clitics to express indirect objects (for example, \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1, {{IPA|[tu \u02c8milisa]}}, 'I talked to him'), and as a post-nominal clitic to express possession (for example, \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, {{IPA|[i \u02c8fili tu]}}, 'his friends'). The strong genitive forms are relatively rare and used only for special emphasis (for example, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, {{IPA|[af\u02c8tu i \u02c8fili]}}, '''his'' friends'); often they are doubled by the weak forms (for example, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1, {{IPA|[af\u02c8tu tu \u02c8milisa]}}, ' ''him'' I talked to'). An alternative way of giving emphasis to a possessive pronoun is propping it up with the stressed adjective \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ({{IPA|[\u00f0i\u02c8kos]}}, 'own'), for example, \u03bf\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 ({{IPA|[i \u00f0i\u02c8ci tu \u02c8fili]}}, '<nowiki/>''his'' friends').\n\nAccusative pronouns exist both in a weak and a strong form. The weak form in the oblique cases is used as a pre-verbal clitic (for example, \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b1, {{IPA|[ton \u02c8i\u00f0a]}}, 'I saw him'); the strong form is used elsewhere in the clause (for example, \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, {{IPA|[\u02c8i\u00f0a af\u02c8ton]}}, 'I saw ''him''<nowiki/>'). The weak form in the nominative is found only in few idiomatic deictic expressions, such as \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 'there he [is]', \u03c0\u03bf\u03cd '\u03bd' \u03c4\u03bf\u03c2; 'where is he?'. Third-person pronouns have separate forms for the three genders; those of the first and second person do not. The weak third-person forms are similar to the corresponding forms of the definite article. The strong third-person forms function simultaneously as generic demonstratives ('this, that').\n\nThe strong forms of the third person in the genitive (\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2) have optional alternative forms extended by an additional syllable {{IPA|[-on-]}} or {{IPA|[-un-]}} (\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd). In the plural, there exists the alternative accusative form \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|1st person\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|2nd person\n!colspan=\"6\"|3rd person\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Masc.\n!colspan=\"2\"|Fem.\n!colspan=\"2\"|Neut.\n|-\n!rowspan=\"6\"|Strong\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Singular\n!Nominative\n|\u03b5\u03b3\u03ce   ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8\u0263o]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03cd   ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8si]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tos]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae  ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ti]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc  ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8to]}}\n|-\n!Genitive\n|\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8mena]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8sena]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4o\u03cd ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tu]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tis]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tu]}}\n|-\n!Accusative\n|\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8mena]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8sena]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ton]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03bd||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tin]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc  ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8to]}}\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Plural\n!Nominative\n|\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8mis]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8sis]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03af ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ti]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tes]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac  ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ta]}}\n|-\n!Genitive\n|\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2  ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8mas]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03ac\u03c2  ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8sas]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ton]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ton]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ton]}}\n|-\n!Accusative\n|\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2  ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8mas]}}\n|\u03b5\u03c3\u03ac\u03c2  ||{{IPA|[e\u02c8sas]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tus]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8tes]}}\n|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac  ||{{IPA|[af\u02c8ta]}}\n|-\n!rowspan=\"6\"|Weak\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Singular\n!Nominative\n| colspan=\"4\" |\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tos]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b7\n|{{IPA|[ti]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\n|{{IPA|[to]}}\n|-     ||\n!Genitive\n|\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\n|{{IPA|[mu]}}\n|\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\n|{{IPA|[su]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\n|{{IPA|[tu]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tis]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\n|{{IPA|[tu]}}\n|-     ||\n!Accusative\n|\u03bc\u03b5\n|{{IPA|[me]}}||\u03c3\u03b5\n|{{IPA|[se]}}||\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\n|{{IPA|[ton]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd<ref name=\"nu\" group=\"note\" />\n|{{IPA|[tin]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\n|{{IPA|[to]}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Plural\n!Nominative\n| colspan=\"4\" |\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\n|{{IPA|[ti]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tes]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b1\n|{{IPA|[ta]}}\n|- ||\n!Genitive\n|\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[mas]}}\n|\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[sas]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tus]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tus]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tus]}}\n|- ||\n!Accusative\n|\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2   ||{{IPA|[mas]}}\n|\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2||{{IPA|[sas]}}\n|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tus]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2/\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2\n|{{IPA|[tis]/[tes]}}\n|\u03c4\u03b1\n|{{IPA|[ta]}}\n|}\n\nBesides \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 {{IPA|[af\u02c8tos]}} as a generic demonstrative, there are also the more specific spatial demonstrative pronouns \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, -\u03b7, -\u03bf ({{IPA|[\u02c8tutos]}}, 'this here') and \u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, -\u03b7, -\u03bf ({{IPA|[e\u02c8cinos]}}, 'that there').\n\n==Prepositions==\nIn [[Demotic Greek]], prepositions normally require the [[accusative case]]: \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc (from), \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 (for), \u03bc\u03b5 (with), \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac (after), \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 (without), \u03c9\u03c2 (as) and \u03c3\u03b5 (to, in or at). The preposition \u03c3\u03b5, when followed by a definite article, fuses with it into forms like \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf (\u03c3\u03b5 + \u03c4\u03bf) and \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 (\u03c3\u03b5 + \u03c4\u03b7). While there is only a relatively small number of simple prepositions native to Demotic, the two most basic prepositions \u03c3\u03b5 and \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc can enter into a large number of combinations with preceding adverbs to form new compound prepositions, for example, \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c3\u03b5 (on), \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc (underneath), \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5 (beside) etc.\n\nA few prepositions that take cases other than the accusative have been borrowed into [[Standard Modern Greek]] from the learned tradition of [[Katharevousa]]: \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac (against), \u03c5\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1 (in favor of, for), \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af (instead of). Other prepositions live on in a fossilised form in certain fixed expressions (for example, \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03c9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03cd 'in the meantime', dative).\n\nThe preposition \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc (''ap\u00f3'', 'from') is also used to express the agent in passive sentences, like English ''by''.\n\n==Conjunctions==\nCoordinating and subordinating [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] in Greek include:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"1\" |Kinds\n!colspan=\"1\" |Conjunctions\n!colspan=\"1\" |Meaning\n|-\n!Copulative\n|\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 (\u03ba\u03b9), \u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5, \u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03b5, \u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03ad, \u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u03ad, \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd... \u03b4\u03b5\n|''and, neither''\n|-\n!Disjunctive\n|\u03ae, \u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b5\n|''or, either''\n|-\n!Adversative\n|\u03bc\u03b1, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac, \u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2, \u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf, \u03b5\u03bd\u03ce, \u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9, \u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9, \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf, \u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\n|''but, although, however, whereas'' \n|-\n!Inferential\n|\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd, \u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5, \u03ac\u03c1\u03b1, \u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03c2, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\n|''so, so as, thus, that''\n|-\n!Explanatory\n|\u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03b4\u03ae\n|''so, in other words''\n|-\n![[Complementizer]]s<ref>Holton, Mackridge & Philippaki-Warburton 2004, p. 195</ref>\n|\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9, \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\n|''that''\n|-\n!Temporal\n|\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd, \u03b5\u03bd\u03ce, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ce\u03c2, \u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03cd, \u03b1\u03c6\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd (\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1), \u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd, \u03ce\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c9\u03c3\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, \u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5, \u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\n|''when, while, after, before, just, until''\n|-\n!Causal\n|\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af, \u03b4\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9, \u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae, \u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03cd\n|''because''\n|-\n!Conditional\n|\u03b1\u03bd, \u03b5\u03ac\u03bd, \u03ac\u03bc\u03b1, \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\n|''if''\n|-\n!Purpose\n|\u03bd\u03b1, \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1\n|''so as, (in order) to''\n|-\n!Result\n|\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 (\u03bd\u03b1), \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\n|''so as, (in order) to''\n|-\n!Concessive\n|\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\n|''despite''\n|-\n!Dubitative\n|\u03bc\u03b7(\u03bd), \u03bc\u03ae\u03c0\u03c9\u03c2\n|''maybe, perhaps''\n|-\n!Comparative\n|\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\n|''to, than''\n|}\n\nThe word \u03bd\u03b1 ({{IPA|[na]}}) serves as a generic subordinator corresponding roughly to English ''to'' (+ infinitive) or ''that'' in sentences like \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ce \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03c9 ({{IPA|[proti\u02c8mo na \u02c8pao]}}, 'I prefer to go', literally 'I prefer that I go') or \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ce \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bf \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 ({{IPA|[proti\u02c8mo na \u02c8pai o \u02c8\u029dannis]}}, 'I prefer that John go'). It marks the following verb as being in the [[subjunctive]] mood. Somewhat similar to the English ''to''-infinitive its use is often associated with meanings of non-factuality, i.e. events that have not (yet) come true, that are expected, wished for etc. In this, it contrasts with \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 {{IPA|[\u02c8oti]}} and \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 {{IPA|[pos]}}, which correspond to English ''that'' when used with a meaning of factuality. The difference can be seen in the contrast between \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5 \u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03c4\u03b1 ({{IPA|[mas \u02c8ipe na \u02c8pame \u02c8volta]}}, 'he told us to go for a walk') vs. \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03ae\u03b3\u03b5 \u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03c4\u03b1 ({{IPA|[mas \u02c8ipe pos \u02c8pi\u029de \u02c8volta]}}, 'he told us that he went for a walk'). When used on its own with a following verb, \u03bd\u03b1 may express a wish or order, as in \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9! ({{IPA|[na \u02c8pai]}}, 'let him go' or 'may he go'). Unlike the other subordinating conjunctions, \u03bd\u03b1 is always immediately followed by the verb it governs, separated from it only by any clitics that might be attached to the verb, but not by a subject or other clause-initial material.\n\n==Negation==\nFor sentence negation, Greek has two distinct negation particles, \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd ([\u02c8\u00f0en], ''den'') and \u03bc\u03b7(\u03bd)<ref name=\"nu\" group=\"note\"/> ([\u02c8mi(n)], ''mi(n)''). \u0394\u03b5\u03bd is used  in clauses with indicative mood, while \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd is used primarily in subjunctive contexts, either after subjunctive-inducing \u03bd\u03b1 or as a negative replacement for \u03bd\u03b1. Both particles are syntactically part of the [[proclitic]] group in front of the verb, and can be separated from the verb only by intervening clitic pronouns.<ref>Joseph and Philippaki-Warburton, 1987, p. 62</ref> The distinction between \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd and \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd is a particularly archaic feature in Greek, continuing an old [[Prohibitive mood|prohibitive]] negation marker inherited from Indo-European.<ref name=\"Wackernagel\">{{cite book|first=Jacob|last=Wackernagel|title=Lectures on syntax, with special reference to Greek, Latin, and Germanic.

(''Tou zitisa na '''min''' erthei'', \"I asked him '''not''' to come.\")\n\nWhen used alone with a subjunctive verb in the second person, prohibitive \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd serves as the functional equivalent to a negative imperative, which itself cannot be negated. Thus, the negation of the positive imperative \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03be\u03b5 ({{IPA|[\u02c8trekse]}}, 'run!') is \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 ({{IPA|[min \u02c8treksis]}}, 'don't run!').\n\nThe particle \u03cc\u03c7\u03b9 serves as the stand-alone utterance of negation ('no'), and also for negation of elliptical, verbless sentences and for contrastive negation of individual constituents:\n\n*\u039a\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, '''\u03cc\u03c7\u03b9''' \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf. (''Kalesa tin Maria, '''ochi''' ton Giorgo'', \"I invited Mary, '''not''' George.\")\n\nFor constituent negation, Greek employs [[negative concord]]. The negated constituent is marked with a negative-polarity item (e.g. \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 'any, anybody/nobody', \u03c4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1 'anything/nothing', \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac 'anywhere/nowhere'), and the verb is additionally marked with the sentence negator \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd (or \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd).<ref>Joseph and Philippaki-Warburton 1987, p. 65</ref> In verbless, elliptical contexts the negative-polarity items can also serve to express negation alone.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"|&nbsp;\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"|Masculine\n!colspan=\"2\"|Feminine\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"|Neuter\n|-\n!Nominative<br/>Genitive<br/>Accusative\n|\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 <small>or</small> \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd<ref name=\"nu\" group=\"note\"/>\n|{{IPA|[-enas]}} <small>or</small> {{IPA|[-is]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-enos]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-enan]}}\n|\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c2<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\n|{{IPA|[-mia]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-mias]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-mia]}}\n|\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2<br />\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\n|{{IPA|[-ena]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-enos]}}<br/>{{IPA|[-ena]}}\n|}\nThe negative pronoun \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 ([ka\u02c8nis], ''kaneis''), i.e. ''nobody'' or ''anybody'' is declined in all three genders and three cases and can be used as the English determiner ''no''.\n\n*\u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd \u03b5\u03b4\u03ce.

The simpler and by far the more frequent uses the invariable [[relativizer]] \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 ({{IPA|[pu]}}, 'that', literally 'where'), as in: \u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 ({{IPA|[i \u029di\u02c8neka pu \u02c8i\u00f0a xtes]}}, 'the woman that I saw yesterday'). When the relativized element is a subject, object or adverbial within the relative clause, then \u2013 as in English \u2013 it has no other overt expression within the relative clause apart from the relativizer. Some other types of relativized elements, however, such as possessors, are represented within the clause by a resumptive pronoun, as in: \u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 <u>\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2</u> ({{IPA|/i \u029di\u02c8neka pu \u02c8vrika tin \u02c8t\u0361sanda <u>tis</u>/}}, 'the woman whose handbag I found', literally 'the woman that I found <u>her</u> handbag').\n\nThe second and more formal form of relative clauses employs complex inflected [[relative pronoun]]s. They are composite elements consisting of the definite article and a following pronominal element that is inflected like an adjective: \u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b7 \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b1, \u03c4\u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03bf ({{IPA|[o o\u02c8pios, i o\u02c8pia, to o\u02c8pio]}} etc., literally 'the which'). Both elements are inflected for case, number and gender according to the grammatical properties of the relativized item within the relative clause, as in: \u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 ({{IPA|[i \u029di\u02c8neka tin o\u02c8pia \u02c8i\u00f0a xtes]}}, 'the woman whom I saw yesterday'); \u03b7 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 ({{IPA|[i \u029di\u02c8neka tis o\u02c8pias \u02c8vrika tin \u02c8t\u0361sanda]}}, 'the woman whose handbag I found').\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Hardy, D.

She is best known for her groundbreaking comedy variety show, ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', originally aired on [[CBS]]. It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects. Her film roles include ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972),  ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1974), ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992), and ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008). On television, she has appeared in other sketch shows; in dramatic roles in ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]'' (1974) and ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]'' (1979); in various well-regarded guest roles, such as in ''[[Mad About You]],'' for which she won an Emmy Award; and in specials with [[Julie Andrews]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Beverly Sills]], and others. She returned to the Broadway stage in 1995 in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]],'' for which she was again nominated for a [[Tony Award]].\n\nBurnett has written and narrated several [[memoir]]s, earning [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations for almost all of them, and a win for ''[[In Such Good Company|In Such Good Company: Eleven Years Of Laughter, Mayhem, And Fun In The Sandbox]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/carol-burnett|title=Artist Carol Burnett|website=www.grammy.com|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-grammys-2017-nominations-winners-list-20161205-story.html |title=2017 Grammy Awards: Complete list of nominees |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 12, 2017|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n  \nIn 2005, she was recognized as \"one of America's most cherished entertainers\" and awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] \"for enhancing the lives of millions of Americans and for her extraordinary contributions to American entertainment.\"<ref>{{cite press release|date=November 9, 2005 |title= Citations for Recipients of the 2005 Presidential Medal of Freedom |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051109-10.html|location=Washington, DC|publisher=The White House|agency= Office of the Press Secretary|access-date=June 19, 2018}}</ref> In 2013, Burnett was awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] at the [[John F.

During her junior year at UCLA in 1954, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a party in place of their class final that had been canceled (which required a performance in front of an audience).

They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars like [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and this opened doors for several of the girls. She was cast in a minor role on ''The [[Paul Winchell]] and Jerry Mahoney Show'' in 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist's dummy on the popular children's program. This role led to her starring role opposite [[Buddy Hackett]] in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' from 1956-57.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Carol burnett garry moore 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Burnett and Larry Blyden from ''The Garry Moore Show'', 1960]]\nAfter ''Stanley'', Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. She eventually bounced back a few months later as a highly popular performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called \"I Made a Fool of Myself Over [[John Foster Dulles]]\" (Dulles was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] at the time). In 1957, she performed this number on both ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', hosted by [[Jack Paar]], and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Dulles was asked about her on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' and joked,  \u201cI never discuss matters of the heart in public.\u201d<ref name=MTprize/>\n\nShe also worked as a regular on one of television's earliest game shows, ''[[Pantomime Quiz]]'', during this time. In 1957, just as she was achieving her first small successes, her mother died.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}<del></del>\n\nBurnett's first true taste of success came with her appearance on Broadway in the 1959 musical ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. The same year, she became a regular player on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'', a job that lasted until 1962. She won an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/carol-burnett|title=Carol Burnett Emmy Winner|publisher=The Emmys|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref> that year for her \"Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program or Series\" on the show. She portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman who later became her signature alter-ego. With her success on the ''Moore Show'', Burnett finally rose to headliner status and appeared in the special ''[[Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall]]'' (1962), co-starring with her friend [[Julie Andrews]].

She returned to the show later but withdrew again to participate in a variety show, ''[[The Entertainers]]'', opposite [[Caterina Valente]] and [[Bob Newhart]]. The producers of ''Fade Out \u2013 Fade In'' sued the actress for breach of contract after her absences from the popular show caused its failure, but the suit was later dropped.

Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994).

National Enquirer, Inc'''\n{{main|Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor. The charwoman is shown mopping the floor in the porn shop, and the characters subsequently discuss Burnett's ear tug and make a crude comment about it. Burnett and her company requested that Fox remove all references to her, the theme and the character but the studio did not.<ref name=\"Reut20th\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-burnett/carol-burnett-sues-tvs-family-guy-cartoon-idUSN1624604020070317 |title=Carol Burnett sues TV's \"Family Guy\" cartoon |work=[[Reuters]] |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Gun20th\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/carol-burnett-v-family-guy |title=Carol Burnett v. \"Family Guy\" Comedian sues over porn shop spoof of beloved charwoman character |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |date=March 16, 2018 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref> The suit was ruled in favor of the defendant because the bit was a parody, which is protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects.

Gurney's ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.\n\nBurnett had long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'', and realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.\n\nIn 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress \u2013 Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]].

National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor.
