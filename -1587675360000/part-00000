Article III, Section 1 of the [[Constitution of Florida]], adopted in 1968, defines the role of the Legislature and how it is to be constituted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes#A3S01|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature|access-date=December 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208105533/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=constitution&submenu=3&tab=statutes#A3S01|archive-date=December 8, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The House is composed of 120 members, each elected from a [[single-member district]] with a population of approximately 157,000 residents. Legislative districts are drawn on the basis of population figures, provided by the federal decennial census. Representatives' terms begin immediately, upon their election. As of 2019, [[Republican Party of Florida|Republicans]] hold the majority in the State House with 73 seats; [[Florida Democratic Party|Democrats]] are in the minority with 46 seats. One seat is vacant.\n\n==Titles==\nMembers of the House of Representatives are referred to as representatives. Because this shadows the terminology used to describe members of [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], constituents and the news media, using [[AP Stylebook|''The Associated Press Stylebook'']], often refer to members as state representatives to avoid confusion with their federal counterparts.\n\n==Terms==\nArticle III of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]] defines the terms for state legislators.\n\nThe Constitution requires state representatives to be elected for two-year terms.\n\nUpon election, legislators take office immediately.\n\n==Term limits==\nOn November 3, 1992, almost 77 percent of Florida voters backed Amendment 9, the Florida Term Limits Amendment, which amended the state Constitution, to enact eight-year term limits on federal and state officials. Under the Amendment, former members can be elected again after a break.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-10-27/news/9202250950_1_term-limits-national-constitutional-amendment-state-ballots|title=Vote Yes On Amendment No. 9 To Begin Limiting Political Terms|publisher=Sun-Sentinel}}</ref> In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could not enact congressional term limits, but ruled that the state level term limits remain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sunshinestatenews.com/story/florida-backs-article-v-convention-constitutional-amendment-congressional-term-limits|title=Florida Backs Article V Convention for Constitutional Amendment on Congressional Term Limits|publisher=Sunshine State News}}</ref>\n\n==Qualifications==\nEach legislator shall be at least 21 years of age, an elector and resident of the district from which elected and shall have resided in the state for a period of two years prior to election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative session==\nEach year during which the Legislature meets constitutes a new legislative session.\n\n===Committee weeks===\nLegislators start Committee activity in September of the year prior to the regular legislative session. Because Florida is a part-time legislature, this is necessary to allow legislators time to work their bills through the committee process, prior to the regular legislative session.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20140118/OPINION04/301180001/Paula-Dockery-Advice-Legislature-Pursue-limited-agenda|title=Editorial:Advice to Legislature:Pursue limited agenda |publisher=Florida Today}}</ref>\n\n===Regular legislative session===\nThe Florida Legislature meets in a 60-day regular legislative session each year. regular legislative sessions in odd-numbered years must begin on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March. Under the state Constitution, the Legislature can begin even-numbered year regular legislative sessions at a time of its choosing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3#A3S03|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1991, the regular legislative session began in April. Senate Joint Resolution 380 (1989) proposed to the voters a constitutional amendment (approved November 1990) that shifted the starting date of regular legislative session from April to February. Subsequently, Senate Joint Resolution 2606 (1994) proposed to the voters a constitutional amendment (approved November 1994) shifting the start date to March, where it remains. The reason for the \"first Tuesday after the first Monday\" requirement stems back to the time when regular legislative session began in April. regular legislative session could start any day from April 2 through April 8, but never on April 1 \u2013 April Fool's Day. In recent years, the Legislature has opted to start in January in order to allow lawmakers to be home with their families during school spring breaks, and to give more time ahead of the legislative elections in the Fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridapolitics.com/archives/202114-proposal-to-move-2018-session-to-january-heads-to-house-floor|title=Proposal to move 2018 session to January heads House floor|last = Buzzacco-Foerster|first=Jenna|date=2016-02-18|work=Florida Politics|access-date=2016-02-18}}</ref>\n\n===Organizational session===\nOn the fourteenth day following each general election, the Legislature meets for an organizational session to organize and select officers.\n\n===Special session===\nSpecial legislative sessions may be called by the governor, by a joint proclamation of the Senate president and House speaker, or by a three-fifths vote of all legislators. During any special session the Legislature may only address legislative business that is within the purview of the purpose or purposes stated in the special session proclamation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0000-0099/0011/Sections/0011.011.html|title=The Florida Constitution|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and process==\nThe Florida House is authorized by the [[Florida Constitution]] to create and amend the laws of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]], subject to the governor's power to veto legislation. To do so, legislators propose legislation in the forms of bills drafted by a nonpartisan, professional staff. Successful legislation must undergo committee review, three [[Reading (legislature)|readings]] on the floor of each house, with appropriate voting majorities, as required, and either be signed into law by the governor or enacted through a veto override approved by two-thirds of the membership of each legislative house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/PublishedContent/ADMINISTRATIVEPUBLICATIONS/handbook.pdf|title=The Florida Senate Handbook|publisher=Florida Senate}}</ref>\n\nIts statutes, called \"chapter laws\" or generically as \"[[slip law]]s\" when printed separately, are compiled into the ''[[Laws of Florida]]'' and are called \"[[session laws]]\".<ref name=\"sunshine\">{{cite web|title=Statutes & Constitution: Online Sunshine|publisher=Florida Legislature|accessdate=26 September 2013|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Tab=statutes&submenu=-1}}</ref> The ''[[Florida Statutes]]'' are the [[codification (law)|codified]] statutory laws of the state.<ref name=\"sunshine\"/>\n\nIn 2009, legislators filed 2,138 bills for consideration.

About 1000 of these are \"member bills.\" The remainder are bills by committees responsible for certain functions, such as budget. In 2016, about 15% of the bills were passed.<ref name=ft170307>{{Cite news|first=Bill|last=Cotterell |title=Legislative session by the numbers| url=|newspaper=Florida Today|location=Melbourne,Florida|pages= 5A|date=March 7, 2017 }}</ref>\nIn 2017, 1,885 lobbyists registered to represent 3,724 entities.<ref name=ft170307/>\n\nThe House also has the power to propose amendments to the [[Florida Constitution]]. Additionally, the House has the exclusive power to impeach officials, who are then tried by the [[Florida Senate|Senate]].\n\n===Leadership===\nThe House is headed by a [[List of Speakers of the Florida House of Representatives|speaker]], elected by the members of the House to a two-year term. The speaker presides over the House, appoints committee members and committee chairs, influences the placement of bills on the calendar, and rules on procedural motions. The speaker ''pro tempore'' presides if the speaker leaves the chair or if there is a vacancy. The speaker, along with the [[List of Presidents of the Florida Senate|Senate president]] and [[governor of Florida]], control most of the agenda of state business in Florida.\n\nThe majority and minority caucus each elect a leader.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Republican Party has been the majority party since that time in the House. \n\nAdditional information on the past composition of the Florida House of Representatives can be found in Allen Morris's ''The Florida Handbook'' (various years, published every two years for many years).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Florida Democratic Party]]\n*[[Florida House of Representatives election, 2012]]\n*[[Florida Legislature]]\n*[[Florida State Capitol]]\n*[[Florida Senate]]\n*[[Florida Senate Majority Office]]\n*[[Government of Florida]]\n*[[List of Speakers of the Florida House of Representatives|List of speakers of the Florida House of Representatives]]\n*[[Republican Party of Florida]]\n*[[The Florida Channel]]\n{{Commons category|Florida House of Representatives}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/ Official Site Florida House]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090417203023/http://election.dos.state.fl.us/ Official Site Florida Elections Division]\n*[http://ufdc.ufl.edu/fhrp The House ''Journal''], the official record of actions taken by the House and its committees, full text online in the [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/ University of Florida's Digital Collections]\n\n{{Commons category|Florida House of Representatives}}\n{{Florida House of Representatives}}\n{{United States legislatures}}\n{{Florida year nav}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Florida House Of Representatives}}\n[[Category:Florida House of Representatives| ]]\n[[Category:Florida Legislature]]\n[[Category:Government of Florida]]\n[[Category:1839 establishments in Florida Territory]]\n[[Category:State lower houses in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2011}}\n{{short description|Lower house of the Florida Legislature}}\n{{Infobox legislature\n| background_color = {{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\n| name              = Florida House of Representatives\n| legislature       = 2018\u20132020 Florida Legislature\n| coa_pic           = Florida House Seal.svg\n| house_type        = Lower house\n| body              = Florida Legislature\n| term_length       = 2 years\n| term_limits       = 4 terms (8 years)\n| foundation        = May 26, 1845\n| motto             = ''In God We Trust''\n| preceded_by       = [[Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida]]\n| new_session       =\n| leader1_type      = [[Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]\n| leader1           = [[Jos\u00e9 R.

Legislative districts are drawn on the basis of population figures, provided by the federal decennial census. Representatives' terms begin immediately, upon their election. As of 2019, [[Republican Party of Florida|Republicans]] hold the majority in the State House with 73 seats; [[Florida Democratic Party|Democrats]] are in the minority with 46 seats. One seat is vacant.\n\n==Titles==\nMembers of the House of Representatives are referred to as representatives. Because this shadows the terminology used to describe members of [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], constituents and the news media, using [[AP Stylebook|''The Associated Press Stylebook'']], often refer to members as state representatives to avoid confusion with their federal counterparts.\n\n==Terms==\nArticle III of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]] defines the terms for state legislators.\n\nThe Constitution requires state representatives to be elected for two-year terms.\n\nUpon election, legislators take office immediately.\n\n==Term limits==\nOn November 3, 1992, almost 77 percent of Florida voters backed Amendment 9, the Florida Term Limits Amendment, which amended the state Constitution, to enact eight-year term limits on federal and state officials. Under the Amendment, former members can be elected again after a break.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-10-27/news/9202250950_1_term-limits-national-constitutional-amendment-state-ballots|title=Vote Yes On Amendment No. 9 To Begin Limiting Political Terms|publisher=Sun-Sentinel}}</ref> In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could not enact congressional term limits, but ruled that the state level term limits remain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sunshinestatenews.com/story/florida-backs-article-v-convention-constitutional-amendment-congressional-term-limits|title=Florida Backs Article V Convention for Constitutional Amendment on Congressional Term Limits|publisher=Sunshine State News}}</ref>\n\n==Qualifications==\nEach legislator shall be at least 21 years of age, an elector and resident of the district from which elected and shall have resided in the state for a period of two years prior to election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative session==\nEach year during which the Legislature meets constitutes a new legislative session.\n\n===Committee weeks===\nLegislators start Committee activity in September of the year prior to the regular legislative session. Because Florida is a part-time legislature, this is necessary to allow legislators time to work their bills through the committee process, prior to the regular legislative session.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20140118/OPINION04/301180001/Paula-Dockery-Advice-Legislature-Pursue-limited-agenda|title=Editorial:Advice to Legislature:Pursue limited agenda |publisher=Florida Today}}</ref>\n\n===Regular legislative session===\nThe Florida Legislature meets in a 60-day regular legislative session each year. regular legislative sessions in odd-numbered years must begin on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March. Under the state Constitution, the Legislature can begin even-numbered year regular legislative sessions at a time of its choosing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3#A3S03|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1991, the regular legislative session began in April. Senate Joint Resolution 380 (1989) proposed to the voters a constitutional amendment (approved November 1990) that shifted the starting date of regular legislative session from April to February. Subsequently, Senate Joint Resolution 2606 (1994) proposed to the voters a constitutional amendment (approved November 1994) shifting the start date to March, where it remains. The reason for the \"first Tuesday after the first Monday\" requirement stems back to the time when regular legislative session began in April. regular legislative session could start any day from April 2 through April 8, but never on April 1 \u2013 April Fool's Day. In recent years, the Legislature has opted to start in January in order to allow lawmakers to be home with their families during school spring breaks, and to give more time ahead of the legislative elections in the Fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridapolitics.com/archives/202114-proposal-to-move-2018-session-to-january-heads-to-house-floor|title=Proposal to move 2018 session to January heads House floor|last = Buzzacco-Foerster|first=Jenna|date=2016-02-18|work=Florida Politics|access-date=2016-02-18}}</ref>\n\n===Organizational session===\nOn the fourteenth day following each general election, the Legislature meets for an organizational session to organize and select officers.\n\n===Special session===\nSpecial legislative sessions may be called by the governor, by a joint proclamation of the Senate president and House speaker, or by a three-fifths vote of all legislators. During any special session the Legislature may only address legislative business that is within the purview of the purpose or purposes stated in the special session proclamation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0000-0099/0011/Sections/0011.011.html|title=The Florida Constitution|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and process==\nThe Florida House is authorized by the [[Florida Constitution]] to create and amend the laws of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]], subject to the governor's power to veto legislation. To do so, legislators propose legislation in the forms of bills drafted by a nonpartisan, professional staff. Successful legislation must undergo committee review, three [[Reading (legislature)|readings]] on the floor of each house, with appropriate voting majorities, as required, and either be signed into law by the governor or enacted through a veto override approved by two-thirds of the membership of each legislative house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/PublishedContent/ADMINISTRATIVEPUBLICATIONS/handbook.pdf|title=The Florida Senate Handbook|publisher=Florida Senate}}</ref>\n\nIts statutes, called \"chapter laws\" or generically as \"[[slip law]]s\" when printed separately, are compiled into the ''[[Laws of Florida]]'' and are called \"[[session laws]]\".<ref name=\"sunshine\">{{cite web|title=Statutes & Constitution: Online Sunshine|publisher=Florida Legislature|accessdate=26 September 2013|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Tab=statutes&submenu=-1}}</ref> The ''[[Florida Statutes]]'' are the [[codification (law)|codified]] statutory laws of the state.<ref name=\"sunshine\"/>\n\nIn 2009, legislators filed 2,138 bills for consideration.

The speaker presides over the House, appoints committee members and committee chairs, influences the placement of bills on the calendar, and rules on procedural motions. The speaker ''pro tempore'' presides if the speaker leaves the chair or if there is a vacancy. The speaker, along with the [[List of Presidents of the Florida Senate|Senate president]] and [[governor of Florida]], control most of the agenda of state business in Florida.\n\nThe majority and minority caucus each elect a leader.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

For example, the nearest star to the [[Sun]] is [[Proxima Centauri]], about {{convert|4.2|ly|km mi}} or 30 million (3{{e|7}}) solar diameters away. \n\nTo visualize that scale, if the Sun were a [[ping-pong ball]], Proxima Centauri would be a pea about {{convert|1100|km|abbr=on}} away, and the Milky Way would be about 30 million km ({{convert|30|km|disp=output number only}} million mi) wide.

These black holes will converge near the centre of the newly formed galaxy over a period that may take millions of years, due to a process known as [[dynamical friction]]: as the SMBHs move relative to the surrounding cloud of much less massive stars, gravitational interactions lead to a net transfer of [[orbital energy]] from the SMBHs to the stars, causing the stars to be [[Gravity assist|\"slingshotted\"]] into higher-radius orbits, and the SMBHs to \"sink\" toward the galactic core. When the SMBHs come within one light-year of one another, they will begin to strongly emit [[gravitational wave]]s that will radiate further orbital energy until they merge completely.
