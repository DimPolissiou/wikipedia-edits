The title of the episode refers to the fact that the Starks, whose [[Seal (emblem)|sigil]] is a wolf, may soon be at war with the Lannisters, whose sigil is the lion.\n\nWith this episode the season hits its halfway mark and the action picks up considerably. Despite being a topic of discussion at King's Landing, [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and [[Jorah Mormont]] do not themselves appear in this episode. [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] and all characters on the Wall are also absent, and [[Robb Stark]] does not appear in Winterfell scenes.

Clegane beheads his horse and attempts to kill Loras, but Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane intervenes.\n\nVarys reveals to Ned that Jon Arryn was killed by a poison called the \"Tears of Lys\", and suggests that Arryn's slain squire Ser Hugh of the Vale was the poisoner.\n\nIn training, Arya chases a cat through the Red Keep and overhears a conversation between Varys and Illyrio, who appear to be plotting against the throne. Arya tries to warn her father but is unable to identify the plotters. Yoren, a Night's Watch recruiter, informs Ned of Catelyn's arrest of Tyrion.\n\nNews of Daenerys' pregnancy reaches the Small Council. Fearing an invasion by the Targaryen-Dothraki alliance, Robert orders that Daenerys and her unborn child, along with Viserys, be assassinated. Ned refuses and resigns the office of Hand of the King. As Robert drinks in sorrow, Cersei visits him and they talk about the serious threat the Dothraki pose, and their failed marriage. Robert's brother Renly is convinced by his lover, Ser Loras, that he should be king instead.\n\nLittlefinger reveals to Ned that Arryn was searching for Robert's bastards. Ned is ambushed by Jaime Lannister, and claims responsibility for Tyrion's arrest, leading to a brutal fight; Ned's guards are killed, including captain Jory Cassel; Ned duels Jaime, but one of Jaime's men spears Ned through the leg from behind.

Captain Grisham offers to be her partner or escort her home, but she dislikes him, and refuses. Walking across the square, she looks up at the hotel window, and sees the shadow of another couple kissing.  Then a shot is fired, the window opens, and Carmina, a peasant girl, falls to the ground.  A young man, Anton, appears at the window calling Carmina's name, as a curtain is drawn in an adjoining room. Tessa reaches the girl, followed by Captain Grisham, but the girl is dead, and Grisham orders the arrest of the young man.  The next morning, Tessa is in the church paying her respects to Carmina, when she is approached by the girl's two brothers asking if she will testify against the young man.  She assures them she will, but the elder brother is not convinced, saying Tessa only came to retrieve her shawl she had used to cover the dead girl's eyes.  In the square, nine thundering horsemen arrive, and one, turning out to be Mary Rose, a former pirate and the boy's mother, goes to Colonel Montoya's office, and demands Anton's release. Despite pleading her son's innocence -  and the threat of her armed men - Montoya maintains the law must take its course as there is a witness, Tessa Alvarado. Mary Rose visits her son in jail, but he is hostile to her, and expects to be hanged, posing an opportunity to the eavesdropping Montoya.\n\nTessa meets Marta at the blacksmith's and takes their carriage to journey home. On the trail home they are chased all the way back to the Alvarado hacienda by Mary Rose's men who surround the property. Safely inside they discover Mary Rose waiting for them in no mood to allow Tessa to testify against her son - with the threat of death if she does. Tessa returns to town to speak to Colonel Montoya but he is not available, and a chance meeting with a worried Vera Hidalgo is cut short when Vera sees Mary Rose's foreman. Walking through the town, Tessa is watched by Mary Rose's men, unnerving her.  When Carmina's brothers grab her and take her to one side, she confirms she will testify, and they let her go, just as she then receives a note from a small boy. Colonel Montoya and Captain Grisham are at the jail trying to goad Anton into confessing, and after the fractious meeting, orders a second scaffold for his mother. A worried Vera goes to her lover Grisham for help, but realises she can't confide in him, and  then rides to the Alvarado hacienda to see Tessa.  Vera tries to confide in Tessa about the events of the previous evening.  Doubts put in her mind, Tessa  returns to town to ask Montoya if she can see Anton but Montoya refuses, gleefully expecting (and hoping) Mary Rose will kill Tessa Alvarado, and then he could hang Mary Rose and confiscate both women's land.  Montoya is as pleased as can be. Returning along the trail, Tessa Alvarado is pursued by Mary Rose's foreman, Geraldo, waving a note from Mary Rose. Tessa stops her carriage to read the note but it is blank and with one movement Geraldo lifts Tessa from the carriage and throws her to the ground producing a [[Navaja]] fighting knife. Tessa evades the knife thrusts and as Geraldo grabs her throat she hold his arm-wielding knife and manages to trip him causing him to fall upon his knife, dead. Shocked by what she has done she returns home to Marta, who points out some home truths that it is not only the Queen that can kill. Mary Rose can't believe a witless girl could kill her foreman and wants the killer found. Montoya plays a waiting game.\n\nVera, unnerved by seeing the scaffold in the square, meets Montoya but again when she is about to say something about the girl's death, he stops her short with the consequences of speaking for her and her husband Don Hidalgo. Walking on she meets Tessa who demands she tells what she knows. A tearful Vera admits she was next-door with a young man and saw events in the next room when Carmina took Anton's pistol and in a struggle was accidentally killed. She cannot come forward as it would destroy her husband. Montoya is stirring trouble with Carmina's brothers in the church, and then back on the square,Tessa approaches him to tell him she will not testify.  Meanwhile, Mary Rose is at the Alvarado hacienda with her men taking Marta as hostage to prevent Tessa testifying.  Not that Marta gave up without a fight - she was pouring water from a boiling kettle, and tossed this at her assailants, then, cornered, took up a stance with a hot dry-iron. Tessa returns home to discover from her workers Marta has been taken. The Queen enters Mary Rose's camp and confronts her. A sword fight ensues with the Queen gaining the upper hand and she assures Mary Rose that Tessa Alvarado will not testify. A statement to the disbelieving Mary Rose the Queen has to back up by returning Mary Rose her sword and offering her own life. Satisfied Mary Rose frees Marta.\n\nThe next morning Tessa, driving her carriage on the trail to Santa Helena, meets Mary Rose and her men and together ride into town to find Colonel Montoya seated at a table in a crowded town square ready to conduct a trial. To the anger of Carmina's brothers, Tessa refuses to testify, and Montoya insists the trial will go ahead, whereupon Mary Rose draws her pistol and there follows a standoff between Montoya's soldiers and Mary Rose's men. Tessa steps forward and points out if there is blood spilt his would be the first.  In the absence of a substantial witness, Montoya decides to free Anton in the interests of justice.  A final threat by Carmina's elder brother is dealt with by Mary Rose saying she will seek him out if anything happens to Tessa.\n\n==Production notes==\nRichard Cruz credited as playing Geraldo is also the series horse stunt co-ordinator as Ricardo Cruz.

It was written by series co-creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], and directed by [[Miguel Sapochnik]].\n\n[[Cersei Lannister]] plots to destroy all her immediate enemies with one swift stroke; [[Arya Stark]] gets revenge; [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] is declared King in the North by the lords of the Northern houses; [[Bran Stark]] learns that Jon is actually the son of Lyanna Stark; [[Samwell Tarly]] arrives at the [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Oldtown|Citadel]]; and [[Daenerys Targaryen]] begins heading to [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Westeros|Westeros]] alongside [[Tyrion Lannister]], her entire army, the Ironborn loyal to Yara Greyjoy, the Tyrells, the Sand Snakes, and her three dragons.\n\n\"The Winds of Winter\" received universal acclaim from critics, listing it as one of the series' best episodes as well as one of the best television episodes of all time. Critics praised the Great Sept explosion, Lena Headey's performance, Arya's revenge on the Freys, the resolution to the Tower of Joy flashback, and Daenerys going to Westeros as highlights of the episode. In the United States, the episode [[Nielsen ratings|achieved a viewership]] of 8.89 million in its initial broadcast, making it the highest rated episode in the series' history at that time. It was nominated for several awards, including Headey for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress]], and won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Fantasy/Sci-Fi Costumes|Emmy for Outstanding Costumes for a Period/Fantasy Series, Limited Series or Movie]].\n\nThis episode marks the final appearance for [[Natalie Dormer]] (Queen [[Margaery Tyrell]]), [[Dean-Charles Chapman]] (King [[Tommen Baratheon]]), [[Finn Jones]] (Ser Loras Tyrell), [[Eugene Simon]] (Lancel Lannister), [[Ian Gelder]] (Kevan Lannister), [[Jonathan Pryce]] (The [[High Sparrow]]), [[Roger Ashton-Griffiths]] (Mace Tyrell), [[Julian Glover]] (Grand Maester Pycelle), and [[Michiel Huisman]] ([[Daario Naharis]]).\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=May 2019}}<!--\"Too long\" means over 400 words per MOS:TVPLOT. Therefore do NOT remove tag until episode is under 400 words.-->\n\n===At the Twins===\n[[Walder Frey]] celebrates the recapture of Riverrun with the Lannisters. Some time later, Walder eats alone, wondering why his sons have yet to arrive. His servant reveals that she baked them into the meat pie he has been eating, and then removes her face to reveal that she is actually Arya Stark, before cutting Walder's throat.\n\n===In King's Landing===\nOn the day of Cersei's and Loras' trials, the High Sparrow, the Faith and the court gather in the Great Sept. However Cersei remains in her chambers, while Ser Gregor prevents Tommen from leaving his quarters. Meanwhile, Qyburn summons Grand Maester Pycelle to his laboratory, where his child spies stab Pycelle to death.\n\nLoras confesses to his crimes and atones by giving up his name and title, and joins the Faith Militant. After Cersei fails to appear, Lancel and others are sent to retrieve her. Lancel is distracted by following one of Cersei's spies beneath the Sept, where he finds a wildfire cache about to explode, but is stabbed before he can disarm it. Inside the Sept, Margaery, realizing that Cersei has set a trap, warns the crowd to leave, but the High Sparrow prevents anyone from leaving. The wildfire ignites and destroys the Great Sept, killing everyone inside. The sole survivor of the Faith Militant's destruction is Septa Unella, whom Cersei leaves with Gregor to be tortured. Tommen witnesses the explosion from the Red Keep; after being informed of Margaery's death, he commits suicide by jumping out of a window. Cersei orders Qyburn to cremate his remains and scatter the ashes at the ruins of the Great Sept, where Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tywin were interred.\n\nAs Jaime and Bronn return from the Riverlands, they view the burning ruins of the Great Sept. Jaime subsequently arrives at the Red Keep to witness Cersei being crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n===At Oldtown===\nAs Samwell and Gilly arrive at Oldtown, they witness the Citadel releasing white ravens to announce the arrival of winter. They report to the Citadel, and Sam is scheduled to meet the Archmaester. In the meantime, Sam is granted access to the library.\n\n===At Winterfell===\nDavos confronts Melisandre about Shireen's death. Melisandre admits to burning Shireen alive, but declares that she did it for the Lord of Light. Davos rebuts by saying that Stannis was defeated anyway and that Melisandre's actions were all for naught, forcing her to admit that she was wrong. Davos requests permission from Jon to execute Melisandre, but she insists that she will be useful in the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon banishes Melisandre from the North and he and Davos threaten to execute her if she ever returns. Later, Jon and Sansa discuss who will lead the united Stark forces, with each deferring to the other. Sansa tells Jon that a white raven arrived from Oldtown; \u201cwinter is here\u201d.\n\nLittlefinger privately meets with Sansa in the godswood. He reveals that his ultimate goal is to sit on the Iron Throne with Sansa at his side. Sansa rejects his offer and leaves.\n\nLater, Jon gathers the various Northern lords, the Knights of the Vale, and the Wildlings to plan for the fight against the White Walkers. After Lyanna Mormont shames the Northern lords that did not come to Jon's aid, all lords present (except, to Sansa's concern, Littlefinger) declare a reluctant Jon the new King in the North.\n\n===In Dorne===\nA grieving Olenna meets with Ellaria and the Sand Snakes concerning the possibility of an alliance against Cersei. To Olenna's surprise, Ellaria presents Varys, who offers Olenna vengeance by allying with Daenerys.\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\nBran, Meera, and Benjen arrive near the Wall. Benjen takes his leave, as the Wall's magical protection also prevents him from being able to pass. Meera assists Bran to a weirwood tree and he re-enters the vision of [[Ned Stark]] at the Tower of Joy. Ned finds Lyanna covered in blood from childbirth. With her dying breath, Lyanna pleads with Ned to protect her son, particularly from [[Robert Baratheon]], whom she insists will kill her son if he were to know his true parentage. Ned is given the infant, who is revealed to be Jon Snow.\n\n===In Meereen===\nDaenerys informs Daario that he will not accompany her to Westeros, as she needs him to keep order in Meereen while she invades Westeros. Daario is reluctant, admitting his love for her, but complies. Daenerys proclaims Tyrion the Hand of the Queen, and the two of them, along with their extensive forces from [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Essos|Essos]] and their new alliances of the Ironborn, Dorne, and Highgarden, finally depart for Westeros in a massive armada, with her dragons flying above.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:D.

She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch.\"<ref name=\"ignite\">{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-will-jon-snow-and-sansa-stark-stay-allies |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-will-jon-snow-and-sansa-stark-stay-allies |title=Game of Thrones: Will Jon Snow and Sansa Stark Stay Allies? |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=June 28, 2016 |date=June 27, 2016 |author=Vejvoda, Jim|url-status=live}}</ref> Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting \"We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes.\"<ref name=\"ignite\"/>\n\nWeiss also noted about the death of King Tommen Baratheon, \"Meanwhile, while the explosion is happening, Tommen is alone. This fragile, malleable, devastated child, basically, is sitting there without anybody to comfort him, and if she had been there, he wouldn't have gone out that window. She failed him, and she alone failed him here.\"<ref name=\"kl\">{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.businessinsider.com.au/cersei-gone-wild-game-of-throne-tommen-dead-2016-6 |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/cersei-gone-wild-game-of-throne-tommen-dead-2016-6 |title=There's nothing to stop Cersei from going off the rails in 'Game of Thrones' season seven |work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=June 28, 2016 |date=June 28, 2016 |author=Oswald, Anjelica|url-status=live}}</ref> Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying \"I think the idea of Cersei without her children is a pretty terrifying prospect. It was the one thing that really humanized her, you know, her love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really did love her children, and now those children are gone, and all she's got is power.\"<ref name=\"kl\"/> In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will play an important role in the story for the next season.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160816120112/http://deadline.com/2016/06/game-of-thrones-season-6-finale-david-benioff-d-b-weiss-hbo-1201780242/ |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |url=https://deadline.com/2016/06/game-of-thrones-season-6-finale-david-benioff-d-b-weiss-hbo-1201780242/ |title='Game Of Thrones' David Benioff & D.B.

This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there thinking, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad?

I picked up the phone, and instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice. I couldn't have asked for a better way to have that news broken to me. Them telling me beforehand really helped me out, otherwise I would have been in a state when I read it in the scripts.

In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately six months before the rest of the cast, saying \"I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me \u2014 and that was The Call.

I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits.

So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'\"<ref name=\"ah\"/> He continued \"The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complementary image.\"<ref name=\"ah\"/>\n\nIn the same interview, Sapochnik was also asked about how he went about creating a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying \"It wasn't hard. I think as fans we'd been waiting for it for so long. That said, it was a very difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew.\"<ref name=\"ah\"/>\n\nSapochnik was asked in an interview what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding \"The final sequence of seeing the armada on its way to Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again. It was also raining and freezing when we shot it, and it was meant to be a Mediterranean climate. Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant to be thinking in that moment, the cold will do that. She asked me to help, so I suggested that she just hum the theme to ''Game of Thrones'' in her head while we were rolling the cameras, and apparently that worked because it's the take we used in the final cut!\"<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.vulture.com/2016/06/miguel-sapochnik-game-of-thrones-finale-director.html |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/06/miguel-sapochnik-game-of-thrones-finale-director.html |title=Director Miguel Sapochnik on the Most Difficult Shot in the Game of Thrones Finale |work=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]] |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |date=June 28, 2016 |author=Vineyard, Jennifer|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Costuming===\n[[File:Game-of-Thrones-S06-E10-Queen-Cersei.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Cersei Lannister in her gown and crown|Costume designer [[Michele Clapton]] returned to the series to design Cersei Lannister's gown and crown, among other costumes.]]\nCostume designer [[Michele Clapton]] designed most of the newly introduced costumes and jewelry in \"The Winds of Winter\".<ref name=\"gown\">{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160712204739/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/06/game-of-thrones-season-6-finale-cersei-dress |archivedate=July 12, 2016 |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/06/game-of-thrones-season-6-finale-cersei-dress |title=Game of Thrones Finale: the Secret Symbolism in Cersei's Badass Gown |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |date=June 28, 2016 |author=Miller, Julie|url-status=live}}</ref> Clapton had initially left the series, but returned for the final two episodes of the season to design four different costumes.<ref name=\"gown\"/> In an interview, Michele Clapton spoke about the process and meaning behind Cersei Lannister's gown and crown in the season finale.

Djawadi has worked on the series since its inception, and additionally composed the show's main theme. In an interview, Djawadi spoke about the score he created for the beginning of the episode, titled \"[[Light of the Seven]]\", which largely consisted of piano, something unusual for the series.<ref name=\"dj\">{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-finale-composer-light-907084 |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-finale-composer-light-907084 |title='Game of Thrones' Composer Discusses \"Light of the Seven,\" the Finale's \"Haunting\" King's Landing Score |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |date=June 28, 2016 |author=Wigler, Josh|url-status=live}}</ref> Djawadi stated, \"The interesting thing to me was the use of the piano. When we started the season, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of the episode, reached out to me and said, 'There's something coming up in episode 10.' We talked about 'The Light of the Seven', and how it needed to be a new piece of music. Any kind of character theme could tip it, and we didn't want to tip the audience. Miguel brought it up: 'What about the piano?' We discussed it. The piano is not really in the language of the ''Game of Thrones'' score.\"<ref name=\"dj\"/>\n\nHe continued, \"It all felt like a perfect fit. What's great about the scene, too, is there's hardly any dialogue. It's nine minutes long. I knew I had to start minimal and give it space. Let notes ring, then give it space, and build up the anticipation from there, without tipping in either direction.\"<ref name=\"dj\"/> Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical Lannister theme, \"[[The Rains of Castamere (song)|The Rains of Castamere]]\", in order to create more of a mystery.<ref name=\"dj\"/> The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying \"The boys I recorded completely separate. The strings I recorded all together. Even the solo instruments, I recorded them separately \u2014 the solo violins and solo cellists were recorded separately. The piano, I played.

It was written by series co-creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], and directed by [[Miguel Sapochnik]].\n\n[[Cersei Lannister]] plots to destroy all her immediate enemies with one swift stroke; [[Arya Stark]] gets revenge; [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] is declared King in the North by the lords of the Northern houses; [[Bran Stark]] learns that Jon is actually the son of Lyanna Stark; [[Samwell Tarly]] arrives at the [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Oldtown|Citadel]]; and [[Daenerys Targaryen]] begins heading to [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Westeros|Westeros]] alongside [[Tyrion Lannister]], her entire army, the Ironborn loyal to Yara Greyjoy, the Tyrells, the Sand Snakes, and her three dragons.\n\n\"The Winds of Winter\" received universal acclaim from critics, listing it as one of the series' best episodes as well as one of the best television episodes of all time. Critics praised the Great Sept explosion, Lena Headey's performance, Arya's revenge on the Freys, the resolution to the Tower of Joy flashback, and Daenerys going to Westeros as highlights of the episode. In the United States, the episode [[Nielsen ratings|achieved a viewership]] of 8.89 million in its initial broadcast, making it the highest rated episode in the series' history at that time. It was nominated for several awards, including Headey for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress]], and won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Fantasy/Sci-Fi Costumes |Emmy for Outstanding Costumes for a Period/Fantasy Series, Limited Series or Movie]].\n\nThis episode marks the final appearance for [[Natalie Dormer]] (Queen [[Margaery Tyrell]]), [[Dean-Charles Chapman]] (King [[Tommen Baratheon]]), [[Finn Jones]] (Ser Loras Tyrell), [[Eugene Simon]] (Lancel Lannister), [[Ian Gelder]] (Kevan Lannister), [[Jonathan Pryce]] (The [[High Sparrow]]), [[Roger Ashton-Griffiths]] (Mace Tyrell), [[Julian Glover]] (Grand Maester Pycelle), and [[Michiel Huisman]] ([[Daario Naharis]]).\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=May 2019}}<!--\"Too long\" means over 400 words per MOS:TVPLOT. Therefore do NOT remove tag until episode is under 400 words.-->\n\n===At the Twins===\n[[Walder Frey]] celebrates the recapture of Riverrun with the Lannisters. Some time later, Walder eats alone, wondering why his sons have yet to arrive. His servant reveals that she baked them into the meat pie he has been eating, and then removes her face to reveal that she is actually Arya Stark, before cutting Walder's throat.\n\n===In King's Landing===\nOn the day of Cersei's and Loras' trials, the High Sparrow, the Faith and the court gather in the Great Sept. However Cersei remains in her chambers, while Ser Gregor prevents Tommen from leaving his quarters. Meanwhile, Qyburn summons Grand Maester Pycelle to his laboratory, where his child spies stab Pycelle to death.\n\nLoras confesses to his crimes and atones by giving up his name and title, and joins the Faith Militant. After Cersei fails to appear, Lancel and others are sent to retrieve her. Lancel is distracted by following one of Cersei's spies beneath the Sept, where he finds a wildfire cache about to explode, but is stabbed before he can disarm it. Inside the Sept, Margaery, realizing that Cersei has set a trap, warns the crowd to leave, but the High Sparrow prevents anyone from leaving. The wildfire ignites and destroys the Great Sept, killing everyone inside. The sole survivor of the Faith Militant's destruction is Septa Unella, whom Cersei leaves with Gregor to be tortured. Tommen witnesses the explosion from the Red Keep; after being informed of Margaery's death, he commits suicide by jumping out of a window. Cersei orders Qyburn to cremate his remains and scatter the ashes at the ruins of the Great Sept, where Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tywin were interred.\n\nAs Jaime and Bronn return from the Riverlands, they view the burning ruins of the Great Sept. Jaime subsequently arrives at the Red Keep to witness Cersei being crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n===At Oldtown===\nAs Samwell and Gilly arrive at Oldtown, they witness the Citadel releasing white ravens to announce the arrival of winter. They report to the Citadel, and Sam is scheduled to meet the Archmaester. In the meantime, Sam is granted access to the library.\n\n===At Winterfell===\nDavos confronts Melisandre about Shireen's death. Melisandre admits to burning Shireen alive, but declares that she did it for the Lord of Light. Davos rebuts by saying that Stannis was defeated anyway and that Melisandre's actions were all for naught, forcing her to admit that she was wrong. Davos requests permission from Jon to execute Melisandre, but she insists that she will be useful in the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon banishes Melisandre from the North and he and Davos threaten to execute her if she ever returns. Later, Jon and Sansa discuss who will lead the united Stark forces, with each deferring to the other. Sansa tells Jon that a white raven arrived from Oldtown; \u201cwinter is here\u201d.\n\nLittlefinger privately meets with Sansa in the godswood. He reveals that his ultimate goal is to sit on the Iron Throne with Sansa at his side. Sansa rejects his offer and leaves.\n\nLater, Jon gathers the various Northern lords, the Knights of the Vale, and the Wildlings to plan for the fight against the White Walkers. After Lyanna Mormont shames the Northern lords that did not come to Jon's aid, all lords present (except, to Sansa's concern, Littlefinger) declare a reluctant Jon the new King in the North.\n\n===In Dorne===\nA grieving Olenna meets with Ellaria and the Sand Snakes concerning the possibility of an alliance against Cersei. To Olenna's surprise, Ellaria presents Varys, who offers Olenna vengeance by allying with Daenerys.\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\nBran, Meera, and Benjen arrive near the Wall. Benjen takes his leave, as the Wall's magical protection also prevents him from being able to pass. Meera assists Bran to a weirwood tree and he re-enters the vision of [[Ned Stark]] at the Tower of Joy. Ned finds Lyanna covered in blood from childbirth. With her dying breath, Lyanna pleads with Ned to protect her son, particularly from [[Robert Baratheon]], whom she insists will kill her son if he were to know his true parentage. Ned is given the infant, who is revealed to be Jon Snow.\n\n===In Meereen===\nDaenerys informs Daario that he will not accompany her to Westeros, as she needs him to keep order in Meereen while she invades Westeros. Daario is reluctant, admitting his love for her, but complies. Daenerys proclaims Tyrion the Hand of the Queen, and the two of them, along with their extensive forces from [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Essos|Essos]] and their new alliances of the Ironborn, Dorne, and Highgarden, finally depart for Westeros in a massive armada, with her dragons flying above.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:D.

She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch.\"<ref name=\"ignite\">{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-will-jon-snow-and-sansa-stark-stay-allies |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-will-jon-snow-and-sansa-stark-stay-allies |title=Game of Thrones: Will Jon Snow and Sansa Stark Stay Allies? |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=June 28, 2016 |date=June 27, 2016 |author=Vejvoda, Jim|url-status=live}}</ref> Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting \"We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes.\"<ref name=\"ignite\"/>\n\nWeiss also noted about the death of King Tommen Baratheon, \"Meanwhile, while the explosion is happening, Tommen is alone. This fragile, malleable, devastated child, basically, is sitting there without anybody to comfort him, and if she had been there, he wouldn't have gone out that window. She failed him, and she alone failed him here.\"<ref name=\"kl\">{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.businessinsider.com.au/cersei-gone-wild-game-of-throne-tommen-dead-2016-6 |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/cersei-gone-wild-game-of-throne-tommen-dead-2016-6 |title=There's nothing to stop Cersei from going off the rails in 'Game of Thrones' season seven |work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=June 28, 2016 |date=June 28, 2016 |author=Oswald, Anjelica|url-status=live}}</ref> Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying \"I think the idea of Cersei without her children is a pretty terrifying prospect. It was the one thing that really humanized her, you know, her love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really did love her children, and now those children are gone, and all she's got is power.\"<ref name=\"kl\"/> In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will play an important role in the story for the next season.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160816120112/http://deadline.com/2016/06/game-of-thrones-season-6-finale-david-benioff-d-b-weiss-hbo-1201780242/ |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |url=https://deadline.com/2016/06/game-of-thrones-season-6-finale-david-benioff-d-b-weiss-hbo-1201780242/ |title='Game Of Thrones' David Benioff & D.B.

This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there thinking, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad?

I picked up the phone, and instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice. I couldn't have asked for a better way to have that news broken to me. Them telling me beforehand really helped me out, otherwise I would have been in a state when I read it in the scripts.

In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately six months before the rest of the cast, saying \"I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me \u2014 and that was The Call.

They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job you really want to do and we're really sorry about that. But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.'

I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits.

So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'\"<ref name=\"ah\"/> He continued \"The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complementary image.\"<ref name=\"ah\"/>\n\nIn the same interview, Sapochnik was also asked about how he went about creating a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying \"It wasn't hard. I think as fans we'd been waiting for it for so long. That said, it was a very difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew.\"<ref name=\"ah\"/>\n\nSapochnik was asked in an interview what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding \"The final sequence of seeing the armada on its way to Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again. It was also raining and freezing when we shot it, and it was meant to be a Mediterranean climate. Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant to be thinking in that moment, the cold will do that. She asked me to help, so I suggested that she just hum the theme to ''Game of Thrones'' in her head while we were rolling the cameras, and apparently that worked because it's the take we used in the final cut!\"<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.vulture.com/2016/06/miguel-sapochnik-game-of-thrones-finale-director.html |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/06/miguel-sapochnik-game-of-thrones-finale-director.html |title=Director Miguel Sapochnik on the Most Difficult Shot in the Game of Thrones Finale |work=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]] |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |date=June 28, 2016 |author=Vineyard, Jennifer|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Costuming===\n[[File:Game-of-Thrones-S06-E10-Queen-Cersei.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Cersei Lannister in her gown and crown|Costume designer [[Michele Clapton]] returned to the series to design Cersei Lannister's gown and crown, among other costumes.]]\nCostume designer [[Michele Clapton]] designed most of the newly introduced costumes and jewelry in \"The Winds of Winter\".<ref name=\"gown\">{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160712204739/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/06/game-of-thrones-season-6-finale-cersei-dress |archivedate=July 12, 2016 |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/06/game-of-thrones-season-6-finale-cersei-dress |title=Game of Thrones Finale: the Secret Symbolism in Cersei's Badass Gown |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |date=June 28, 2016 |author=Miller, Julie|url-status=live}}</ref> Clapton had initially left the series, but returned for the final two episodes of the season to design four different costumes.<ref name=\"gown\"/> In an interview, Michele Clapton spoke about the process and meaning behind Cersei Lannister's gown and crown in the season finale.

Djawadi has worked on the series since its inception, and additionally composed the show's main theme. In an interview, Djawadi spoke about the score he created for the beginning of the episode, titled \"[[Light of the Seven]]\", which largely consisted of piano, something unusual for the series.<ref name=\"dj\">{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-finale-composer-light-907084 |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-finale-composer-light-907084 |title='Game of Thrones' Composer Discusses \"Light of the Seven,\" the Finale's \"Haunting\" King's Landing Score |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |date=June 28, 2016 |author=Wigler, Josh|url-status=live}}</ref> Djawadi stated, \"The interesting thing to me was the use of the piano. When we started the season, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of the episode, reached out to me and said, 'There's something coming up in episode 10.' We talked about 'The Light of the Seven', and how it needed to be a new piece of music. Any kind of character theme could tip it, and we didn't want to tip the audience. Miguel brought it up: 'What about the piano?' We discussed it. The piano is not really in the language of the ''Game of Thrones'' score.\"<ref name=\"dj\"/>\n\nHe continued, \"It all felt like a perfect fit. What's great about the scene, too, is there's hardly any dialogue. It's nine minutes long. I knew I had to start minimal and give it space. Let notes ring, then give it space, and build up the anticipation from there, without tipping in either direction.\"<ref name=\"dj\"/> Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical Lannister theme, \"[[The Rains of Castamere (song)|The Rains of Castamere]]\", in order to create more of a mystery.<ref name=\"dj\"/> The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying \"The boys I recorded completely separate. The strings I recorded all together. Even the solo instruments, I recorded them separately \u2014 the solo violins and solo cellists were recorded separately. The piano, I played.

Lost in his own world of meditation, he is a concern for his mother Supriya Vyas and father Harish Vyas who belong to the affluent Vyas family. Pooja on the other hand, is warm, confident and a complete people's person who can take care of herself and is deeply rooted in family values.\n\nNaren's parents want Pooja to be Naren's wife. Initially thinking Naren to be another rich boy, Pooja finally starts appreciating his genuine selfless nature. Naren and Pooja become best friends and Pooja falls in love with him after he saves her from being raped by his cousin, Rahul. Naren's wedding is fixed with Surbhi Singhania, the daughter of Harish's friend Yash Singhania while Pooja agrees to marry Dr. Anand. Naren's cousin, Mayank falls in love with Pooja. His love for Pooja turns into an obsession and he kills Anand on Pooja's wedding day. To save Pooja from humiliation, Naren steps in and marries her while Surbhi ends up marrying Rahul.\n\nSoon, Naren realizes that he also loves Pooja. Pooja finds out that her horoscope has some problems and feign insulting Naren and his family so they can separate. Supriya meets with an accident trying to stop Pooja and becomes mentally unstable.\n \n===One year later<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiawest.com/entertainment/television/zee-show-piya-albela-takes-time-leap-lead-pair-sheen/article_be645cdc-05eb-11e8-8a7c-ff2d4be7ec92.html|title=Zee Show \u2018Piya Albela\u2019 Takes Time Leap: Lead Pair Sheen Das and Akshay Mhatre to Don New Looks|last=India-West|first=R.

Naren, who was a simple and sober man, has become a ruthless womanizer. Pooja's friend, Ashish Kapoor, tries to solve Pooja and Naren's misunderstanding but Rahul misleads Ashish into believing that Pooja has fallen in love with him. Ashish joins hands with Rahul and Surbhi. Naren falls in their trap and proposes marriage to Surbhi. Pooja records Ashish's confession and stops Surbhi and Naren's wedding. A guilt-stricken Naren apologises to Pooja but Ashish comes between and tries to kill Naren. Pooja shoots Ashish and Naren takes the blame. However, Kapoor reaches the court on time and saves Pooja. \n\nPooja and Naren's wedding preparations begin but Pooja meets with an accident while praying for Supriya's recovery. Supriya recovers and is able to stop Mayank's father Rakesh from attacking Pooja. After her accident, Pooja starts behaving like a child. Her uncle, Satish Gupta takes Pooja with him to their hometown [[Dehradun]]. To stop her from being sent to a mental asylum, Naren marries her and starts taking care of her. \n\nIt is revealed that Pooja has been feigning her illness to save Naren's grandfather from Kapoor who has been threatening to expose that Naren is not the biological son of Supriya and Harish. Kapoor kidnaps Pooja who finally kills him to protect Kashinath. Planning on ending her act, Pooja's half sister Naina Goel reveals Pooja's secret to Naren instead causing him to become furious with Pooja. Naina sets her eyes on Naren wanting to take revenge on Pooja who she thinks was always preferred by their father.\n\nNaren's health deteriorates as a result of his excessive drinking. Pooja finds out Naren's real mother, Chandrika who is a prostitute. To hide this truth from the Vyas family, Satish and Pooja lie that Pooja is Chandrika's illegitimate daughter while Naina is Satish's legitimate niece. The Vyas family, except for Kashinath, start hating Pooja. Chandrika is allowed to stay with the family in the Vyas Mansion but is blamed for an attack on Supriya. The misunderstanding leads to Pooja and Chandrika leaving the house.\n\n===Six months later===\n          \nMayank is dead. Pooja lives in Krishnapuri, a [[Red-light district|red-light area]] with Chandrika. Naren is standing for elections and visits Pooja everyday at Krishnapuri. Everyone thinks that Naren does this because he loves Pooja but only Chandrika, the Vyas family and Naren's assistant Danish know that Naren in fact hates Pooja. Pooja continues to fulfil her duty of a wife.  \n\nNaren hires a shooter to kill Pooja. On a trip to Dehradun, Naren realises Pooja's trust in him and calls the sharpshooter to call off the attack. Naren and Pooja consummate their marriage. At Naren's election rally, Pooja is shot at and Naren discovers that a woman called the sharpshooter to carry put the attack. He realises Pooja was aware of his initial plan and apologises but Pooja loses all trust in him. However, they team up to expose Naina as the culprit behind causing Supriya's attack and resulting paralysis, framing Chandrika for the attack, killing Mayank, abducting a heavily pregnant Surbhi and planning to kill Rahul and marry Naren.\n\nKashinath reveals that Naren is Chandrika's son. A heart-broken Naren leaves the Vyas Mansion. At an [[ashram]], Naren and Pooja renew their marital vows. They meet Bela and Praveen, another newly-wed couple. Bela is an introvert while Praveen is an extrovert who often acts silly. Instigated by Rahul, Harish decides to kill Naren but Harsha, Naren's aunt, warns Pooja and Naren. Naren and Praveen meet with an accident and Praveen dies while Naren, needing a heart-transplant, receives Praveen's heart. A strange change appears in Naren's behaviour as he starts behaving like Praveen. It is revealed that Bela is planning to take revenge from Praveen's parents as they insulted her parents for dowry resulting in Bela's mother's death and her father's blindness. Under Bela's spell, Naren abducts Praveen's parents and Bela kills them but spares Naren for saving her father. Bela, then, surrenders to the police.\n\nNaren's adoptive sister Meghna ([[Sangeita Chauhan]]) is blind and is about to marry Kunal Goenka, the man she loves. On their wedding day, Meghna is raped and suspicion falls on Naren as he was absent from the venue. Pooja saves Naren from the accusations. The next suspicion falls on Pooja's cousin Anuj Gupta, Danish, Rahul and Kunal. The real culprit tries to kill Surbhi and Pooja as they discover his real identity. Surbhi loses her child. It is revealed that Rahul's father, Hardik Vyas is the real culprit. Hardik is arrested and Meghna and Kunal are married.\n\nAngraj ([[Sahil Uppal]]), Harish and Supriya's biological son, enters the Vyas Mansion. Angraj sets his eyes on Pooja, who he used to eve-tease and harass before her marriage, and starts plotting to kill Naren. On the day of Pooja's birthday, Anuj shoots Angraj trying to save Pooja but Naren shoots Anuj to defend his half brother resulting in both Angraj and Anuj dying causing tension between Naren and Pooja's families.\n\nAngraj is revealed to be alive and gets a plastic surgery and returns with Naren's face and kidnaps the real Naren. Angraj (as Naren) takes Naren's place at home. After an interesting twist in the plot, Supriya herself kills Angraj.\n\nThe story ends with Supriya managing Angraj's foundation, Rahul and Surbhi having a baby boy, Anuj's wife Rachel ([[Sandhya Mehta]]) marries Rahul's half brother Arjun Vyas ([[Khushwant Walia]]), and Pooja gets pregnant with Naren's child.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Akshay Mhatre]] as Naren Vyas<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iwmbuzz.com/television/29078/2018/05/06|title=Breaking into the TV industry has become easier: Akshay Mhatre|last=Team|first=Author: Editorial|date=2018-05-06|website=IWMBuzz|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n**Veer Bhanushali as young Naren Vyas\n*[[Sheen Das]] as Pooja Vyas<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/television/260317/i-confide-in-akshay-says-sheen-dass.html|title=I confide in Akshay, says Sheen Dass|date=26 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Sahil Uppal]] as Angraj Vyas (before plastic surgery), Naren's half-brother<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.televisionsworld.com/piyaa-albela-to-be-seen-a-new-entry-in-the-form-of-sahil-uppal/|title=Piyaa Albela to be seen a new entry in the form of Sahil Uppal!|last=Rajveer|website=Televisions World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n**Akshay Mhatre as Angraj (after plastic surgery)\n\n===Recurring===\n\n*[[Paintal (comedian)|Kanwarjit Paintal]] as Kashinath Vyas, patriarch of the Vyas family, Hardik and Harish's father\n*[[Avinash Wadhawan]] as Harish Vyas, Kahinath's elder son, Naren and Angraj's father<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/avinash-wadhwan-even-an-oscar-winner-will-exhaust-all-his-creative-skills-if-he-does-our-tv-soaps/articleshow/64174073.cms|title=Avinash Wadhwan: Even an Oscar winner will exhaust all his creative skills if he does our TV soaps -

Lost in his own world of meditation, he is a concern for his mother Supriya Vyas and father Harish Vyas who belong to the affluent Vyas family. Pooja on the other hand, is warm, confident and a complete people's person who can take care of herself and is deeply rooted in family values.\n\nNaren's parents want Pooja to be Naren's wife. Initially thinking Naren to be another rich boy, Pooja finally starts appreciating his genuine selfless nature. Naren and Pooja become best friends and Pooja falls in love with him after he saves her from being raped by his cousin, Rahul. Naren's wedding is fixed with Surbhi Singhania, the daughter of Harish's friend Yash Singhania while Pooja agrees to marry Dr. Anand. Naren's cousin, Mayank falls in love with Pooja. His love for Pooja turns into an obsession and he kills Anand on Pooja's wedding day. To save Pooja from humiliation, Naren steps in and marries her while Surbhi ends up marrying Rahul.\n\nSoon, Naren realizes that he also loves Pooja. Pooja finds out that her horoscope has some problems and feign insulting Naren and his family so they can separate. Supriya meets with an accident trying to stop Pooja and becomes mentally unstable.\n \n===One year later<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiawest.com/entertainment/television/zee-show-piya-albela-takes-time-leap-lead-pair-sheen/article_be645cdc-05eb-11e8-8a7c-ff2d4be7ec92.html|title=Zee Show \u2018Piya Albela\u2019 Takes Time Leap: Lead Pair Sheen Das and Akshay Mhatre to Don New Looks|last=India-West|first=R.

Naren, who was a simple and sober man, has become a ruthless womanizer. Pooja's friend, Ashish Kapoor, tries to solve Pooja and Naren's misunderstanding but Rahul misleads Ashish into believing that Pooja has fallen in love with him. Ashish joins hands with Rahul and Surbhi. Naren falls in their trap and proposes marriage to Surbhi. Pooja records Ashish's confession and stops Surbhi and Naren's wedding. A guilt-stricken Naren apologises to Pooja but Ashish comes between and tries to kill Naren. Pooja shoots Ashish and Naren takes the blame. However, Kapoor reaches the court on time and saves Pooja. \n\nPooja and Naren's wedding preparations begin but Pooja meets with an accident while praying for Supriya's recovery. Supriya recovers and is able to stop Mayank's father Rakesh from attacking Pooja. After her accident, Pooja starts behaving like a child. Her uncle, Satish Gupta takes Pooja with him to their hometown [[Dehradun]]. To stop her from being sent to a mental asylum, Naren marries her and starts taking care of her. \n\nIt is revealed that Pooja has been feigning her illness to save Naren's grandfather from Kapoor who has been threatening to expose that Naren is not the biological son of Supriya and Harish. Kapoor kidnaps Pooja who finally kills him to protect Kashinath. Planning on ending her act, Pooja's half sister Naina Goel reveals Pooja's secret to Naren instead causing him to become furious with Pooja. Naina sets her eyes on Naren wanting to take revenge on Pooja who she thinks was always preferred by their father.\n\nNaren's health deteriorates as a result of his excessive drinking. Pooja finds out Naren's real mother, Chandrika who is a prostitute. To hide this truth from the Vyas family, Satish and Pooja lie that Pooja is Chandrika's illegitimate daughter while Naina is Satish's legitimate niece. The Vyas family, except for Kashinath, start hating Pooja. Chandrika is allowed to stay with the family in the Vyas Mansion but is blamed for an attack on Supriya. The misunderstanding leads to Pooja and Chandrika leaving the house.\n\n===Six months later===\n          \nMayank is dead. Pooja lives in Krishnapuri, a [[Red-light district|red-light area]] with Chandrika. Naren is standing for elections and visits Pooja everyday at Krishnapuri. Everyone thinks that Naren does this because he loves Pooja but only Chandrika, the Vyas family and Naren's assistant Danish know that Naren in fact hates Pooja. Pooja continues to fulfil her duty of a wife.  \n\nNaren hires a shooter to kill Pooja. On a trip to Dehradun, Naren realises Pooja's trust in him and calls the sharpshooter to call off the attack. Naren and Pooja consummate their marriage. At Naren's election rally, Pooja is shot at and Naren discovers that a woman called the sharpshooter to carry put the attack. He realises Pooja was aware of his initial plan and apologises but Pooja loses all trust in him. However, they team up to expose Naina as the culprit behind causing Supriya's attack and resulting paralysis, framing Chandrika for the attack, killing Mayank, abducting a heavily pregnant Surbhi and planning to kill Rahul and marry Naren.\n\nKashinath reveals that Naren is Chandrika's son. A heart-broken Naren leaves the Vyas Mansion. At an [[ashram]], Naren and Pooja renew their marital vows. They meet Bela and Praveen, another newly-wed couple. Bela is an introvert while Praveen is an extrovert who often acts silly. Instigated by Rahul, Harish decides to kill Naren but Harsha, Naren's aunt, warns Pooja and Naren. Naren and Praveen meet with an accident and Praveen dies while Naren, needing a heart-transplant, receives Praveen's heart. A strange change appears in Naren's behaviour as he starts behaving like Praveen. It is revealed that Bela is planning to take revenge from Praveen's parents as they insulted her parents for dowry resulting in Bela's mother's death and her father's blindness. Under Bela's spell, Naren abducts Praveen's parents and Bela kills them but spares Naren for saving her father. Bela, then, surrenders to the police.\n\nNaren's adoptive sister Meghna ([[Sangeita Chauhan]]) is blind and is about to marry Kunal Goenka, the man she loves. On their wedding day, Meghna is raped and suspicion falls on Naren as he was absent from the venue. Pooja saves Naren from the accusations. The next suspicion falls on Pooja's cousin Anuj Gupta, Danish, Rahul and Kunal. The real culprit tries to kill Surbhi and Pooja as they discover his real identity. Surbhi loses her child. It is revealed that Rahul's father, Hardik Vyas is the real culprit. Hardik is arrested and Meghna and Kunal are married.\n\nAngraj ([[Sahil Uppal]]), Harish and Supriya's biological son, enters the Vyas Mansion. Angraj sets his eyes on Pooja, who he used to eve-tease and harass before her marriage, and starts plotting to kill Naren. On the day of Pooja's birthday, Anuj shoots Angraj trying to save Pooja but Naren shoots Anuj to defend his half brother resulting in both Angraj and Anuj dying causing tension between Naren and Pooja's families.\n\nAngraj is revealed to be alive and gets a plastic surgery and returns with Naren's face and kidnaps the real Naren. Angraj (as Naren) takes Naren's place at home. After an interesting twist in the plot, Supriya herself kills Angraj.\n\nThe story ends with Supriya managing Angraj's foundation, Rahul and Surbhi having a baby boy, Anuj's wife Rachel ([[Sandhya Mehta]]) gets married to Rahul's half brother Arjun Vyas ([[Khushwant Walia]]), and Pooja gets pregnant with Naren's child.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Akshay Mhatre]] as Naren Vyas<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iwmbuzz.com/television/29078/2018/05/06|title=Breaking into the TV industry has become easier: Akshay Mhatre|last=Team|first=Author: Editorial|date=2018-05-06|website=IWMBuzz|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n**Veer Bhanushali as young Naren Vyas\n*[[Sheen Das]] as Pooja Vyas<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/television/260317/i-confide-in-akshay-says-sheen-dass.html|title=I confide in Akshay, says Sheen Dass|date=26 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Sahil Uppal]] as Angraj Vyas (before plastic surgery), Naren's half-brother<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.televisionsworld.com/piyaa-albela-to-be-seen-a-new-entry-in-the-form-of-sahil-uppal/|title=Piyaa Albela to be seen a new entry in the form of Sahil Uppal!|last=Rajveer|website=Televisions World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n**Akshay Mhatre as Angraj (after plastic surgery)\n\n===Recurring===\n\n*[[Paintal (comedian)|Kanwarjit Paintal]] as Kashinath Vyas, patriarch of the Vyas family, Hardik and Harish's father\n*[[Avinash Wadhawan]] as Harish Vyas, Kahinath's elder son, Naren and Angraj's father<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/avinash-wadhwan-even-an-oscar-winner-will-exhaust-all-his-creative-skills-if-he-does-our-tv-soaps/articleshow/64174073.cms|title=Avinash Wadhwan: Even an Oscar winner will exhaust all his creative skills if he does our TV soaps -

Across the hall, Penny, Bernadette and Amy are also discussing Raj's loneliness.\n\nPenny introduces Raj to her friend Emily. Emily is [[deafness|deaf]], so Raj's [[selective mutism]] is not an issue, however, Penny calls Howard to interpret Emily's [[sign language]] to Raj (as he knows it). The two go out on a date at a coffee shop, and with Howard's help, the date goes reasonably well.\n\nHoward reveals that Raj is buying Emily lots of expensive gifts, with Sheldon saying he can do so as his family is rich. Concerned that Emily is exploiting Raj for his wealth, Penny and Howard confront her at her gym.

To protect the Chalcidians from missile attacks by their warlike sister world of Eretria, the Federation has promised the Chalcidians a planetary defense grid. However, during the meeting, Kirk is struck in the back of the head by an Eretrian dissident, forcing an emergency beam out. In sickbay, Kirk has an hallucination of Rayna, an android girl who died after being overwhelmed by the emotions she developed by falling in love with Kirk (episode \"[[Requiem for Methuselah]]\"). Spock had erased Rayna from Kirk's memory to save him from the emotional turmoil.\n\nMcCoy uses the experimental drug alkysine to save Kirk's life. Kirk appears to make a recovery, and proceeds to the bridge in order to activate the defense grid with his own personal password. However, Kirk is suddenly stopped by the image of a beautiful woman in an old Starfleet uniform. She vanishes and Kirk cannot remember the password. As Chekov and Scott try to initialize the grid, Kirk sees a little girl running in the halls.\n\nOn the bridge, Smith reports a missile from Eretria heading directly for Chalcis. The Chalcidian minister demands the password to activate the grid, but Spock is forced to stall for time while the captain recovers. In sickbay, Kirk once again sees the beautiful woman lying on a bio-bed. McCoy reports that his heart appears to be shutting down with no medical explanation. Kirk tells him about the woman he's been seeing in his hallucinations: Nakia, an officer he dated on the ''Farragut''. She was killed along with 200 crewman at Tycho IV by the dikronium cloud creature (as recalled in episode \"[[Obsession (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Obsession]]\").\n\nMcCoy believes Kirk's symptoms may be psychological, and that the injury and/or the alkysine may have unleashed emotions that Kirk's been keeping buried. McCoy suggests Dr. McKennah's help, but Kirk refuses and vows to return to the bridge. While arguing with Spock in the hallway, Kirk sees another old love: [[Edith Keeler]], a woman he met on Earth in the 1930s, whom he allowed to die in order to restore history (episode \"[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]\"). At this point, Kirk suffers a brief but painful seizure.\n\nBack on the bridge, Uhura reports that a replacement grid is four days away. Smith reports the Eretrian missile has vanished from sensors.\n\nSpock, McKennah, and McCoy speculate as to the cause of the captain's condition, but once again Kirk is dismissive of McKennah's help. While Spock and McCoy try to plead with Kirk, he once again has another hallucination: this time of Miramanee, the American Indian princess whom he married during a memory lapse (episode \"[[The Paradise Syndrome]]\"). Miramanee had become pregnant with Kirk's child, but subsequently died when Kirk was attacked by angry villagers. Kirk then experiences another seizure, but resolves to perform his duties.\n\nOn the bridge, Spock, Sulu, and Smith are able to detect and destroy the Eretrian warhead. But at a crucial moment, Kirk is tormented by the hallucinations of Nakia, Edith, and Miramanee. Disturbed, Kirk relieves himself of duty and hands control of the ship to Mr. Spock.\n\nWith McCoy in his quarters, Kirk wonders aloud about the women. Despite his love, he feels that they died because of him, since he had to \"do his duty\" in each case. Kirk has another seizure and sees all three women again; however, Spock mind-melds with him and witnesses the women as well. Spock is uncertain as to whether the women are figments of Kirk's imagination or actual ''katra''s (souls), and he suggests to Kirk that they may need closure in order to move on.\n\nKirk finally goes to see Dr. McKennah, who notes that he feels a tremendous amount of guilt. The feelings of grief that Kirk has kept buried for so long are coming out now, and it's not actually the women who need closure. It's Kirk himself.\n\nKirk goes to Scotty's experimental holographic rec room, and recreates the scenes in which he encountered each woman. In the 1930s he sees Edith, the woman he loved for her compassion and her intellect; the one who could see that humanity would find peace and explore the galaxy. Kirk informs her that she had to die in order for history to be restored properly, so that her dreams of a better future would eventually come into fruition. Understanding, she tells Kirk to be at peace. In sickbay on the ''Farragut'', Kirk sees Nakia, the woman he loved in his youth. She tells him she knew the risks when she entered Starfleet, and that he needs to forgive himself. In the American Indian village, Miramanee is on her deathbed. Kirk tells her he sometimes wishes that he had not been found, as he was never happier than when he was with her. She was a gift he could never repay. Miramanee tells him that he made her very happy; that her place was by his side; that one does not repay a gift. Finally Kirk sees the android girl Rayna, whom he loved because she, too, was lonely. Rayna simply smiles and says nothing; she is at peace as well.\n\nSmith reports that Eretria has launched a barrage of missiles, and Kirk orders the Enterprise to physically block them in order to protect Chalcis. He begins to head to the bridge when he encounters the little girl again. He asks her name, and she says he never gave her one. She then shows him a gift \u2013 a piece of beadwork with markings from Miramanee's headband \u2013 at which point Kirk realizes she is a vision of his unborn child. Kirk imagines hugging her, and she whispers the word \"Irises.\" Remembering now that this is the password, Kirk is able to activate the defense grid.\n\nAfter witnessing the grid's power, the Eretrians declare their intention to sue for peace. Kirk thanks McKennah for her help and notes that he now sees the benefit of having a counselor on board. Meanwhile, Spock and McCoy are perplexed as to why Kirk chose the password \"Irises.\" Spock discovers a painting called ''[[Irises (painting)|Irises]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]] \u2013 a single white iris in a field of purple flowers, which van Gogh apparently used to symbolize his loneliness.\n\nMcCoy notes that, despite most of his heart shutting down, Kirk still persevered because part of his heart belongs to another special lady. Kirk smiles as he realizes McCoy's referring to the ''Enterprise'' herself.\n\n==Controversy==\nOn June 1, 2015, the episode was removed from YouTube due to \"copyright claims by [[CBS]]\".   However, the episode remained on [[Vimeo]]. Two days later, Mignogna announced on the production's official Facebook page that the removal of the episode was unintentional, per a vice president in the CBS legal department, and that \"YouTube has been instructed to reinstate it immediately.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/StarTrekContinues/photos/a.368013926565463.92376.333296680037188/983342111699305/?type=1&theater|title=AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE CAPTAIN:... - Star Trek Continues - Facebook|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.startrekcontinues.com/episodes.html ''The White Iris'' at the Star Trek Continues website]\n*{{IMDb title|4333924}}\n*{{Vimeo|id=128304406|title=The White Iris}}\n*{{Youtube|id=6PvgJI6cvh8|title=The White Iris}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:White Iris}}\n[[Category:2015 American television episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{plot|date=July 2015}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = The White Iris\n| series       = [[Star Trek Continues]]\n| image        =  \n| caption      =  \n| season       = \n| series_no    = \n| episode      = 4\n| writer       = \n| director     = [[James Kerwin]]\n| narrator     = \n| teleplay     =  James Kerwin<br>Chris White<br>[[Vic Mignogna]]\n| story        =  Vic Mignogna <br> Chris White\n| producer     =  Vic Mignogna <br>Steven Dengler\n| music        = [[Star Trek: The Original Series]] incidental music\n| photographer =  Matt Bucy\n| editor       = \n| production   = \n| airdate      = {{Start date|2015|5|29}}\n| length       = 47:54\n| guests       =\n*[[Colin Baker]] as Amphidamas \n*Nakia Burrise as Nakia\n*Tiffany Brouwer as Miramanee\n*[[Adrienne Wilkinson]] as Edith Keeler \n*Sarai Duenas as Miramanee's Child\n*[[Marina Sirtis]] as Computer voice\n*[[Kipleigh Brown]] as Smith\n| season_list  =\n\n| prev         = [[Fairest of Them All]]\n| next         = [[Divided We Stand (STC episode)|Divided We Stand]]\n| episode_list = \n}}\n\"'''The White Iris'''\" is a [[Star Trek fandom|fan-produced]] ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode released in 2015, the fourth in the [[web series]] ''[[Star Trek Continues]]'', which aims to continue the episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' replicating their visual and storytelling style<ref name=\"cnet\">{{cite interview |last=Mignogna |first=Vic |interviewer=Michael Franco |publisher=[[CNET]] |title=The coolest Star Trek reboot you're probably not watching |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/the-coolest-star-trek-reboot-youre-not-watching/ |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> The episode is dedicated to [[Leonard Nimoy]], who had died earlier in the year.\n\n==Plot summary==\nCaptain Kirk, Scotty, and Uhura are on the planet Chalcis to welcome its people to the Federation.

At this point, Kirk suffers a brief but painful seizure.\n\nBack on the bridge, Uhura reports that a replacement grid is four days away. Smith reports the Eretrian missile has vanished from sensors.\n\nSpock, McKennah, and McCoy speculate as to the cause of the captain's condition, but once again Kirk is dismissive of McKennah's help. While Spock and McCoy try to plead with Kirk, he once again has another hallucination: this time of Miramanee, the American Indian princess whom he married during a memory lapse (episode \"[[The Paradise Syndrome]]\"). Miramanee had become pregnant with Kirk's child, but subsequently died when Kirk was attacked by angry villagers. Kirk then experiences another seizure, but resolves to perform his duties.\n\nOn the bridge, Spock, Sulu, and Smith are able to detect and destroy the Eretrian warhead. But at a crucial moment, Kirk is tormented by the hallucinations of Nakia, Edith, and Miramanee. Disturbed, Kirk relieves himself of duty and hands control of the ship to Mr. Spock.\n\nWith McCoy in his quarters, Kirk wonders aloud about the women. Despite his love, he feels that they died because of him, since he had to \"do his duty\" in each case. Kirk has another seizure and sees all three women again; however, Spock mind-melds with him and witnesses the women as well. Spock is uncertain as to whether the women are figments of Kirk's imagination or actual ''katra''s (souls), and he suggests to Kirk that they may need closure in order to move on.\n\nKirk finally goes to see Dr. McKennah, who notes that he feels a tremendous amount of guilt. The feelings of grief that Kirk has kept buried for so long are coming out now, and it's not actually the women who need closure. It's Kirk himself.\n\nKirk goes to Scotty's experimental holographic rec room, and recreates the scenes in which he encountered each woman. In the 1930s he sees Edith, the woman he loved for her compassion and her intellect; the one who could see that humanity would find peace and explore the galaxy. Kirk informs her that she had to die in order for history to be restored properly, so that her dreams of a better future would eventually come into fruition. Understanding, she tells Kirk to be at peace. In sickbay on the ''Farragut'', Kirk sees Nakia, the woman he loved in his youth. She tells him she knew the risks when she entered Starfleet, and that he needs to forgive himself. In the American Indian village, Miramanee is on her deathbed. Kirk tells her he sometimes wishes that he had not been found, as he was never happier than when he was with her. She was a gift he could never repay. Miramanee tells him that he made her very happy; that her place was by his side; that one does not repay a gift. Finally Kirk sees the android girl Rayna, whom he loved because she, too, was lonely. Rayna simply smiles and says nothing; she is at peace as well.\n\nSmith reports that Eretria has launched a barrage of missiles, and Kirk orders the Enterprise to physically block them in order to protect Chalcis. He begins to head to the bridge when he encounters the little girl again. He asks her name, and she says he never gave her one. She then shows him a gift \u2013 a piece of beadwork with markings from Miramanee's headband \u2013 at which point Kirk realizes she is a vision of his unborn child. Kirk imagines hugging her, and she whispers the word \"Irises.\" Remembering now that this is the password, Kirk is able to activate the defense grid.\n\nAfter witnessing the grid's power, the Eretrians declare their intention to sue for peace. Kirk thanks McKennah for her help and notes that he now sees the benefit of having a counselor on board. Meanwhile, Spock and McCoy are perplexed as to why Kirk chose the password \"Irises.\" Spock discovers a painting called ''[[Irises (painting)|Irises]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]] \u2013 a single white iris in a field of purple flowers, which van Gogh apparently used to symbolize his loneliness.\n\nMcCoy notes that, despite most of his heart shutting down, Kirk still persevered because part of his heart belongs to another special lady. Kirk smiles as he realizes McCoy's referring to the ''Enterprise'' herself.\n\n==Controversy==\nOn June 1, 2015, the episode was removed from YouTube due to \"copyright claims by [[CBS]]\".   However, the episode remained on [[Vimeo]]. Two days later, Mignogna announced on the production's official Facebook page that the removal of the episode was unintentional, per a vice president in the CBS legal department, and that \"YouTube has been instructed to reinstate it immediately.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/StarTrekContinues/photos/a.368013926565463.92376.333296680037188/983342111699305/?type=1&theater|title=AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE CAPTAIN:... - Star Trek Continues - Facebook|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.startrekcontinues.com/episodes.html ''The White Iris'' at the Star Trek Continues website]\n*{{IMDb title|4333924}}\n*{{Vimeo|id=128304406|title=The White Iris}}\n*{{Youtube|id=6PvgJI6cvh8|title=The White Iris}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:White Iris}}\n[[Category:2015 American television episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Iris"}

The album was released on March 20, 2020, by [[XO (record label)|XO]] and [[Republic Records]]. Prior to the album's release, The Weeknd confirmed ''After Hours'' would face stylistic differences to his previous album ''[[Starboy]]'' (2016). It was also subject of widespread media anticipation leading up to its release. \n\nBeginning in 2018, recording for the album took place at New York's [[Jungle City Studios]], [[Noble Street Studios|Noble Street]] in [[Toronto]], as well as [[Maratone Studios|MXM]] and The Weeknd's home studio (both in [[California]]). The album was produced primarily by The Weeknd, along with a variety of high-profile producers such as [[Jason Quenneville|DaHeala]], [[Illangelo]], and [[Metro Boomin]], all of whom The Weeknd had worked with previously. The standard edition has no features, although the remixes edition contains [[guest appearance]]s from [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]]. Music journalists have noted the album as an artistic reinvention for The Weeknd, with the introduction of [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[dream pop]] influences, while thematically, ''After Hours'' explores promiscuity, overindulgence, and self-loathing. \n\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as: ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995), ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998), ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'' and ''[[Uncut Gems]]'' (both 2019). The album was supported by three singles: \"[[Heartless (The Weeknd song)|Heartless]]\", \"[[Blinding Lights]]\", and \"[[In Your Eyes (The Weeknd song)|In Your Eyes]]\", with \"Heartless\" and \"Blinding Lights\" peaking at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and receiving [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification. Its [[After Hours (The Weeknd song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single. In March 2020, ''After Hours'' broke the record for the most global pre-adds in [[Apple Music]] history, with over 1.02 million users.\n\n''After Hours'' received widespread acclaim, with some critics praising the album as The Weeknd's best piece of work. The album debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 444,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, 275,000 of which were in pure sales. It is The Weeknd's fourth number-one album, and marks the biggest first week sales of 2020 for an album. The album also reached number one in 16 other countries, including the Canada and the United Kingdom. ''After Hours'' will be promoted with [[the After Hours Tour]], which is set to span [[North America]] and [[Europe]].\n\n==Background and release==\nThe Weeknd first teased that he was working on a new album in November 2018, via a performance in which he told the crowd that \"''Chapter VI'' was coming soon.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-weeknd-teases-chapter-vi-album-shares-new-artwork-2413493|title=The Weeknd teases 'Chapter VI' album, shares new artwork|website=NME|last=Krol|first=Charlotte|date=November 27, 2018|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> On January 12, 2019, Tesfaye then proceeded to further tease the project and its sound by tweeting \"no more daytime music\" to fans, making media outlets believe that he was set to continue the darker music found in ''[[My Dear Melancholy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/the-weekend-says-new-album-will-be-less-pop-friendly-no-more-daytime-music-news.69193.html|title=The Weeknd Says New Album Will Be Less Pop-Friendly: \"No More Daytime Music\"|website=HotNewHipHop|last=Ch|first=Devin|date=January 13, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> Following a trio of collaborative singles throughout 2019, on August 6, he further reassured fans that he was working on his fourth studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-weekend-teases-new-album-chapter-6-2536077|title=Is The Weeknd's new album finally on its way?|website=NME|last=Skinner|first=Tom|date=August 7, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> Then after a five-month period of silence,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/the-weeknd-returns-to-instagram-and-fans-are-convinced-chapter-vi-is-coming-news.96171.html|title=The Weeknd Returns To Instagram & Fans Are Convinced \"Chapter VI\" Is Coming|website=HotNewHipHop|last=A.|first=Aron|date=November 20, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1095452/the-weeknd-returns-to-instagram-with-a-loading-message|title=The Weeknd Returns to Instagram With a \"Loading\" Message|publisher=[[E!

singer [[The Weeknd]]. The album was released on March 20, 2020, by [[XO (record label)|XO]] and [[Republic Records]]. The album was produced primarily by The Weeknd, along with a variety of high-profile producers such as [[Jason Quenneville|DaHeala]], [[Illangelo]], and [[Metro Boomin]], all of whom The Weeknd had worked with previously. The standard edition has no features, although the remixes edition contains [[guest appearance]]s from [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]]. Music journalists have noted the album as an artistic reinvention for The Weeknd, with the introduction of [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[dream pop]] influences, while thematically, ''After Hours'' explores promiscuity, overindulgence, and self-loathing. \n\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as: ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995), ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998), ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'' and ''[[Uncut Gems]]'' (both 2019). The album was supported by three singles: \"[[Heartless (The Weeknd song)|Heartless]]\", \"[[Blinding Lights]]\", and \"[[In Your Eyes (The Weeknd song)|In Your Eyes]]\", with \"Heartless\" and \"Blinding Lights\" peaking at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and receiving [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification. Its [[After Hours (The Weeknd song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single. In March 2020, ''After Hours'' broke the record for the most global pre-adds in [[Apple Music]] history, with over 1.02 million users.\n\n''After Hours'' received widespread acclaim, with some critics praising the album as The Weeknd's best piece of work. The album debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 444,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, 275,000 of which were in pure sales. It is The Weeknd's fourth number-one album, and marks the biggest first week sales of 2020 for an album. The album also reached number one in 16 other countries, including the Canada and the United Kingdom. ''After Hours'' will be promoted with [[the After Hours Tour]], which is set to span [[North America]] and [[Europe]].\n\n==Background and release==\nThe Weeknd first teased that he was working on a new album in November 2018, via a performance in which he told the crowd that \"''Chapter VI'' was coming soon.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-weeknd-teases-chapter-vi-album-shares-new-artwork-2413493|title=The Weeknd teases 'Chapter VI' album, shares new artwork|website=NME|last=Krol|first=Charlotte|date=November 27, 2018|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> On January 12, 2019, Tesfaye then proceeded to further tease the project and its sound by tweeting \"no more daytime music\" to fans, making media outlets believe that he was set to continue the darker music found in ''[[My Dear Melancholy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/the-weekend-says-new-album-will-be-less-pop-friendly-no-more-daytime-music-news.69193.html|title=The Weeknd Says New Album Will Be Less Pop-Friendly: \"No More Daytime Music\"|website=HotNewHipHop|last=Ch|first=Devin|date=January 13, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> Following a trio of collaborative singles throughout 2019, on August 6, he further reassured fans that he was working on his fourth studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-weekend-teases-new-album-chapter-6-2536077|title=Is The Weeknd's new album finally on its way?|website=NME|last=Skinner|first=Tom|date=August 7, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> Then after a five-month period of silence,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/the-weeknd-returns-to-instagram-and-fans-are-convinced-chapter-vi-is-coming-news.96171.html|title=The Weeknd Returns To Instagram & Fans Are Convinced \"Chapter VI\" Is Coming|website=HotNewHipHop|last=A.|first=Aron|date=November 20, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1095452/the-weeknd-returns-to-instagram-with-a-loading-message|title=The Weeknd Returns to Instagram With a \"Loading\" Message|publisher=[[E!
