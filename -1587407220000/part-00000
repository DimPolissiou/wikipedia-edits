It was also known as \"Toronto Rocks\", \"Stars 4 SARS\", \"SARSStock\", \"SARSfest\", \"SARS-a-palooza\", the \"SARS concert\", or, more descriptively, \"The Rolling Stones SARS Benefit Concert\". Estimated to have between 450,000 and 500,000 people attending the concert, it is the largest outdoor ticketed event in Canadian history, and one of the largest in [[North America]]n history.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/sarsbenefit/| title=CBC News - Toronto Rocked| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727191619/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/sarsbenefit/| archivedate=2009-07-27}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe concert was organized in about a month, upon the suggestion of headliners [[The Rolling Stones]], who wanted to help revive Toronto's economy after the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] outbreaks earlier in the year. (The Rolling Stones have held tour rehearsals in Toronto on more than one occasion; Toronto was also the setting for [[Keith Richards#Public image and private life|Keith Richards's 1977 arrest and subsequent trial]].) When The Rolling Stones announced the concert, Toronto was still under a SARS warning from the [[World Health Organization]]. The publicity garnered by the SARS outbreak led to a downturn in Toronto's tourism industry, which the concert was intended to help revive.\n\nTickets for the concert went on sale on June 27, 2003 and cost $21.50 Canadian.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030703083541/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2003/06/2403.cfm|title=Molson Mega-Concert To Feature The Rolling Stones, The Flaming Lips, AC/DC And Many More|publisher=[[Chart Attack]] |accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref> The Canadian portion of 150,000 tickets sold out almost immediately and made a single-day record for the Canadian arm of [[Ticketmaster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030810045107/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2003/06/3004.cfm|title=Rush Joins SARS Benefit, Canadian Tix Sell Out|publisher=[[Chart Attack]] |accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe concert was held at [[Downsview Park]] in northern Toronto, a former military base which also accommodated 800,000 people when [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the city in 2002. The concert was hosted by actor/singer [[Dan Aykroyd]], and vendors sold [[Alberta]] beef in support of the Canadian beef industry, which had recently suffered because of a case of [[mad cow disease]]. [[North York General Hospital]], which had been hit the hardest by the SARS outbreak in previous months, provided emergency on-site hospital services. The Toronto water department was initially supposed to provide free water by tapping the groundwater at the site, but were unable to do so due to health concerns.

(The Rolling Stones have held tour rehearsals in Toronto on more than one occasion; Toronto was also the setting for [[Keith Richards#Public image and private life|Keith Richards's 1977 arrest and subsequent trial]].) When The Rolling Stones announced the concert, Toronto was still under a SARS warning from the [[World Health Organization]]. The publicity garnered by the SARS outbreak led to a downturn in Toronto's tourism industry, which the concert was intended to help revive.\n\nTickets for the concert went on sale on June 27, 2003 and cost $21.50 Canadian.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030703083541/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2003/06/2403.cfm|title=Molson Mega-Concert To Feature The Rolling Stones, The Flaming Lips, AC/DC And Many More|publisher=[[Chart Attack]] |accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref> The Canadian portion of 150,000 tickets sold out almost immediately and made a single-day record for the Canadian arm of [[Ticketmaster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030810045107/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2003/06/3004.cfm|title=Rush Joins SARS Benefit, Canadian Tix Sell Out|publisher=[[Chart Attack]] |accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe concert was held at [[Downsview Park]] in northern Toronto, a former military base which also accommodated 800,000 people when [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the city in 2002. The concert was hosted by actor/singer [[Dan Aykroyd]], and vendors sold [[Alberta]] beef in support of the Canadian beef industry, which had recently suffered because of a case of [[mad cow disease]]. [[North York General Hospital]], which had been hit the hardest by the SARS outbreak in previous months, provided emergency on-site hospital services.

It is made clear that a woman's reputation is fragile in the community of Dagestan, and Patya's internal dialogue acknowledges and despises this.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Cultural Significance ==\nThe cultural significance of this novel is deep in magnitude, especially regarding it tackling the ideas of traditionalism, race, gender, and religion in Dagestan, Russia. \n\n=== Traditionalism ===\n[[File:Dagestan-Novolakskiy.png|thumb|Dagestan, Russia]]\nTraditionalism functions throughout the book largely through the scope of marriage. <ref name=\":3\" /> The fact that both characters are expected to marry by their early or mid-twenties is one of the key elements of the plot. This is perpetuated by the families of both characters. This was the same for their parents, and those before -- it was expected. One also gets to feel the pangs and echoes of a post-USSR Russia, where certain political opinions and ideas can put you in danger at times.<ref name=\":7\" /> Other times, these opinions create firm, divisive rifts between families and characters- Patya and Timur didn't get along for this very reason. The whole political youth group Timur was part of wouldn't disagree with him at all (besides Patya). They took what he said as fact, and fact alone. This powerful scene creates a sense of dread that the youth of Russia could be indoctrinated in a sort of \"[[Hitler Youth|Nazi Youth]]\" type fashion, and again contributes to the tone of dread laced throughout the book.\n\n=== Race ===\nGanieva tackles race in a subtle, interesting way throughout the book. Race plays a large role in who the main characters are permitted to marry, and is frequently noted throughout when mentioning potential candidates for marriage for both main characters. It is also highly sectionalized -- Russia has many microcosms of culture throughout its nation along with three separate dialects<ref name=\":5\" />, so the fact that race and traditionalism are still tied together in the beginning of this book by the parents of the main characters wanting them to \"keep it in the family\" paints a disparaging pre-modern picture of Russia, akin to a place similar to the \"wild west\"  where anything can go wrong at any minute.\n\n=== Gender ===\nIn the context of women, Ganieva presents a sense of sexism that is omnipresent and subtle and sometimes not so subtle throughout the book. For the not so subtle, one only needs to look to the first few pages of the book to be able to tell that women are not held as highly in esteem as men are, as Patya is almost raped, and casually goes about her day. This is not reported, and she doesn't tell anyone. Another character who highlights this is Timur, who, through his conversations about politics with Patya, subtly proves to think he is smarter than her and needs to change the ideas in her head because she is a woman who doesn't really know better. <ref name=\":4\" />Women are also considered less suitable if they do not have their virginity or already have kids, as this looks bad in the society presented in the book, and can lead to social isolation of sorts. Ganieva's awareness and criticism of sexism in Dagestan is apparent through her use of a male pseudonym to originally publish some of her works.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Religion ===\nAlthough the novel is fictitious, the religious tension that appears throughout ''Bride and Groom'' is no fantasy. Most religious content of the book involves conflict between different sects of [[Islam]]. The majority of people in the [[North Caucasus]] region practice the Islamic faith. Muslims in Dagestan, like in many other places in the world, are involved in an ongoing debate regarding the proper practice of Islam and the identity of the modern Muslim.<ref name=\":5\" /> Dagestan is a region that struggles with Islamic radicalism, a fact that is prevalent in the lives of Marat, Patya, and the author herself.<ref name=\":6\" /><br />\n== Synopsis ==\n[[File:Alisa Ganieva.jpg|thumb|[[Alisa Ganieva]], author of ''Bride and Groom'']]\nThe novel begins by introducing the main characters, Marat and Patya, through a series of events within Dagestan, Russia <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. Marat is a human rights lawyer who is working on solving a murder case, and Patya is a 25-year-old woman who is worrisome that she will not be able to find a husband soon. Marat and Patya have similar families -- both of which want them to find a spouse and get married as quickly as possible. Both families also observe the Islamic faith and share similar political beliefs, disliking what a central shady political character, Khalilbek, is doing within the government. Rumors and whispers of Khalilbek's wrongdoings pepper the community. Some, however, love Khalilbek, and claim he has done much for the community, disregarding the fact that he was in jail for the murder of a young man, who was ran over by him in the middle of the night, for some reason. The people who love Khalilbek create a very dystopic idea of the society they live in, blindly and wholeheartedly embrace him without any doubt of character, making his status near godhood.\n\nMarat and Patya meet at a concert which was supposed to celebrate his release- and both detest the concert. The two make an instant connection when they meet, and become romantic interests of one another. Marat attends a wedding at which an old lady cursed the bride and groom because the groom had gotten the old lady's daughter pregnant. While Marat's mother is continuously trying to set him up with a potential wife, Patya tries to sever ties with unwanted suitors, namely the aggressive Timur. Marat's mother requests that he go see a fortune teller to see if he will get married soon. Marat reluctantly agrees, and seems to gain nothing from the experience. On his way out, he finds out that a friend of his died in a religiously-based altercation. After a family dinner, Patya finds Marat outside and the two eat at a diner. Word quickly spreads, and despite Marat's mother desperately wanting her son to find a girl to marry, she does not approve of the relationship. Marat hears of a raid on his law firm, so he travels to Moscow at his next opportunity to try to salvage any important work left untouched. After Patya refuses to marry Timur, who her mother suggests, she meets up with Marat. Marat asks her to be his wife to which she agrees, but not without some reasonable doubt. Patya's news was not received well with her family. Marat met a stranger on the street who informed him of some of the reasonings behind Khalilbek's seemingly corrupt deeds among other things. Their conversation gives Marat new perspectives on the events of his life, and he felt his happiness become more pronounced. On the day of the wedding, Marat does not show up. Patya and her family are told that Marat has been taken by the police under the false accusation that he is a religious extremist. Patya leaves her house when nobody is watching and gets on a train headed for the shore. Marat is depicted to be beaten up in an interrogation room, slipping in and out of his real surroundings and a beachside conversation with Khalilbek.\n\n== Critical Reception ==\nReviews of the book were generally positive, with it garnering a good review from several people. Some notable examples include a review from Viv Groskop of the Observer <ref name=\":0\" />, which was posted on the Guardian, as well as a positive review from Emily D. Johnson in World Literature Today<ref name=\":1\" />. Both articles focus primarily on the tone of the book. For instance, Groskop  commented about how the tone feels generally clunky, but for the purpose of how it mirrors the characters' reality, where everyone speaks the same language but it is all mixed up in the chaos the author creates.  Emily D. Johnson comments in the same way about the nature of the Russia the characters live in, deeming it a chaotic and unstable environment where anything can go wrong at any minute. Olga Zillerbourg, also with World Literature Today, provides a great summary of the book which also mentions the dark tone of the book as well, mentioning the aspects of corruption within the book.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n''Bride and Groom''  received a radio adaptation by Bethan Roberts on [[BBC Radio 4]] in February of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09r3xzw|title=BBC Radio 4 - Drama, Reading Europe - Russia: Bride and Groom, Episode 2|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Bride and Groom'' is noted as the runner-up for 2015 [[Russian Booker Prize]], listed on the Asian Review of Books' top books of 2018, and included in a Russia Behind The Headlines list of top translated books of 2018.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== References ==\n<br /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Groskop|first=Viv|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/25/bride-and-groom-alisa-ganieva-review-odd-couples-dagestan|title=Bride and Groom review \u2013 odd couples in Dagestan|date=2018-03-25|work=The Observer|access-date=2020-04-01|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2017/november/bride-and-groom-alisa-ganieva|title=Bride and Groom by Alisa Ganieva|date=2017-10-12|website=World Literature Today|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/07/27/love-in-daghestan-alisa-ganievas-bride-and-groom-a66569|title=Love in Dagestan: Alisa Ganieva's 'Bride and Groom'|last=Kapp|first=Sarah|date=2019-07-27|website=The Moscow Times|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Olson|first=Laura|title=The Worlds of Russian Village Women [Electronic Resource]: Tradition, Transgression, Compromise.|last2=Adonyeva|first2=Svetlana|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=JEWL}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Puppo|first=Lili Di|last2=Schmoller|first2=Jesko|date=2018|title=Islam and Ethnicity in Russia|url=|journal=Anthropological Journal of European Cultures|volume=27|pages=84-87|via=JEWL}}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Tyrras|first=Nicholas S.|title=Russian Intellectual and Cultural History from the Ninth to the Twenty-First Century.|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=355-359|via=JEWL}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.asymptotejournal.com/criticism/alisa-ganieva-bride-and-groom/|title=Hannah Weber reviews Bride and Groom by Alisa Ganieva - Asymptote|website=www.asymptotejournal.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2019/spring/what-read-now-contemporary-russian-language-literature-olga-zilberbourg|title=What to Read Now: Contemporary Russian-language Literature, by Olga Zilberbourg|date=2019-03-07|website=World Literature Today|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n<references />\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox book\n| name              = Bride and Groom\n| image             = \n| author            = [[Alisa Ganieva]]\n| language          = English (Translated from Russian)\n| country           = Russia\n| genre             = Fiction\n| published         = Deep Vellum\n| pub_date          = March 27, 2018\n| translator        = Carol Apollonio\n}}\n\n''Bride and Groom'' is a translation of a fictional novel by Russian contemporary author, [[Alisa Ganieva]], in which two people struggle to get married amidst the chaos of family, religion, politics, and life itself. <ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" /> The translation was done by Carol Apollonio, who had translated one of Ganieva's works before. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://slaviceurasian.duke.edu/people/carol-apollonio|title=Carol Apollonio {{!}} Duke Slavic & Eurasian Studies|website=slaviceurasian.duke.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  \n\n== Publication ==\n''Bride and Groom'' was first published in 2015 in the original Russian with the title ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (''zhenikh i nevesta'').

It is made clear that a woman's reputation is fragile in the community of Dagestan, and Patya's internal dialogue acknowledges and despises this.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Cultural Significance ==\nThe cultural significance of this novel is deep in magnitude, especially regarding it tackling the ideas of traditionalism, race, gender, and religion in Dagestan, Russia. \n\n=== Traditionalism ===\n[[File:Dagestan-Novolakskiy.png|thumb|Dagestan, Russia]]\nTraditionalism functions throughout the book largely through the scope of marriage. <ref name=\":3\" /> The fact that both characters are expected to marry by their early or mid-twenties is one of the key elements of the plot. This is perpetuated by the families of both characters. This was the same for their parents, and those before -- it was expected. One also gets to feel the pangs and echoes of a post-USSR Russia, where certain political opinions and ideas can put you in danger at times.<ref name=\":7\" /> Other times, these opinions create firm, divisive rifts between families and characters- Patya and Timur didn't get along for this very reason. The whole political youth group Timur was part of wouldn't disagree with him at all (besides Patya). They took what he said as fact, and fact alone. This powerful scene creates a sense of dread that the youth of Russia could be indoctrinated in a sort of \"[[Hitler Youth|Nazi Youth]]\" type fashion, and again contributes to the tone of dread laced throughout the book.\n\n=== Race ===\nGanieva tackles race in a subtle, interesting way throughout the book. Race plays a large role in who the main characters are permitted to marry, and is frequently noted throughout when mentioning potential candidates for marriage for both main characters. It is also highly sectionalized -- Russia has many microcosms of culture throughout its nation along with three separate dialects<ref name=\":5\" />, so the fact that race and traditionalism are still tied together in the beginning of this book by the parents of the main characters wanting them to \"keep it in the family\" paints a disparaging pre-modern picture of Russia, akin to a place similar to the \"wild west\"  where anything can go wrong at any minute.\n\n=== Gender ===\nIn the context of women, Ganieva presents a sense of sexism that is omnipresent and subtle and sometimes not so subtle throughout the book. For the not so subtle, one only needs to look to the first few pages of the book to be able to tell that women are not held as highly in esteem as men are, as Patya is almost raped, and casually goes about her day. This is not reported, and she doesn't tell anyone. Another character who highlights this is Timur, who, through his conversations about politics with Patya, subtly proves to think he is smarter than her and needs to change the ideas in her head because she is a woman who doesn't really know better. <ref name=\":4\" />Women are also considered less suitable if they do not have their virginity or already have kids, as this looks bad in the society presented in the book, and can lead to social isolation of sorts. Ganieva's awareness and criticism of sexism in Dagestan is apparent through her use of a male pseudonym to originally publish some of her works.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Religion ===\nAlthough the novel is fictitious, the religious tension that appears throughout ''Bride and Groom'' is no fantasy. Most religious content of the book involves conflict between different sects of [[Islam]]. The majority of people in the [[North Caucasus]] region practice the Islamic faith. Muslims in Dagestan, like in many other places in the world, are involved in an ongoing debate regarding the proper practice of Islam and the identity of the modern Muslim.<ref name=\":5\" /> Dagestan is a region that struggles with Islamic radicalism, a fact that is prevalent in the lives of Marat, Patya, and the author herself.<ref name=\":6\" /><br />\n== Synopsis ==\n[[File:Alisa Ganieva.jpg|thumb|Alisa Ganieva, author of ''Bride and Groom'']]\nThe novel begins by introducing the main characters, Marat and Patya, through a series of events within Dagestan, Russia <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. Marat is a human rights lawyer who is working on solving a murder case, and Patya is a 25-year-old woman who is worrisome that she will not be able to find a husband soon. Marat and Patya have similar families -- both of which want them to find a spouse and get married as quickly as possible. Both families also observe the Islamic faith and share similar political beliefs, disliking what a central shady political character, Khalilbek, is doing within the government. Rumors and whispers of Khalilbek's wrongdoings pepper the community. Some, however, love Khalilbek, and claim he has done much for the community, disregarding the fact that he was in jail for the murder of a young man, who was ran over by him in the middle of the night, for some reason. The people who love Khalilbek create a very dystopic idea of the society they live in, blindly and wholeheartedly embrace him without any doubt of character, making his status near godhood.\n\nMarat and Patya meet at a concert which was supposed to celebrate his release- and both detest the concert. The two make an instant connection when they meet, and become romantic interests of one another. Marat attends a wedding at which an old lady cursed the bride and groom because the groom had gotten the old lady's daughter pregnant. While Marat's mother is continuously trying to set him up with a potential wife, Patya tries to sever ties with unwanted suitors, namely the aggressive Timur. Marat's mother requests that he go see a fortune teller to see if he will get married soon. Marat reluctantly agrees, and seems to gain nothing from the experience. On his way out, he finds out that a friend of his died in a religiously-based altercation. After a family dinner, Patya finds Marat outside and the two eat at a diner. Word quickly spreads, and despite Marat's mother desperately wanting her son to find a girl to marry, she does not approve of the relationship. Marat hears of a raid on his law firm, so he travels to Moscow at his next opportunity to try to salvage any important work left untouched. After Patya refuses to marry Timur, who her mother suggests, she meets up with Marat. Marat asks her to be his wife to which she agrees, but not without some reasonable doubt. Patya's news was not received well with her family. Marat met a stranger on the street who informed him of some of the reasonings behind Khalilbek's seemingly corrupt deeds among other things. Their conversation gives Marat new perspectives on the events of his life, and he felt his happiness become more pronounced. On the day of the wedding, Marat does not show up. Patya and her family are told that Marat has been taken by the police under the false accusation that he is a religious extremist. Patya leaves her house when nobody is watching and gets on a train headed for the shore. Marat is depicted to be beaten up in an interrogation room, slipping in and out of his real surroundings and a beachside conversation with Khalilbek.\n\n== Critical Reception ==\nReviews of the book were generally positive, with it garnering a good review from several people. Some notable examples include a review from Viv Groskop of the Observer <ref name=\":0\" />, which was posted on the Guardian, as well as a positive review from Emily D. Johnson in World Literature Today<ref name=\":1\" />. Both articles focus primarily on the tone of the book.
