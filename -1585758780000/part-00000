Shrek is the [[protagonist]] of the [[Shrek!|book of the same name]] and of eponymous films by [[DreamWorks Animation]]. The name \"Shrek\" is derived from the [[German language|German]] word ''[[wikt:Schreck|Schreck]]'', meaning \"fright\" or \"terror\". Shrek is voiced by [[Mike Myers]], although it was planned for him to be voiced by [[Chris Farley]] before his death in December 1997, and played by [[Brian d'Arcy James]] in the musical. [[Shrek]] is an [[ogre]] living in a [[swamp]].\n\nOn May 21, 2010, Shrek received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in [[Los Angeles]]. In June 2010, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named him one of the \"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\", placing 15th.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years: Here's our full list! |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/01/100-greatest-characters-of-last-20-years-full-list/ |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=July 7, 2012 |author=Adam B.

Even though his background is something of a mystery, according to ''[[Shrek The Musical]]'', it is revealed that on his 7th birthday, Shrek was sent away by his parents because it was an ogre tradition. He is seen traveling alone, being either screamed at or teased by passers-by. The only time he receives a pleasant greeting is a wave from a young [[Princess Fiona|Fiona]], who is promptly led away by her parents. In the book, his parents threw him into a dark hole that leads to the real world.\n\nAfter scaring away an angry mob, he arrives at his swamp, enters an [[outhouse]], and literally breaks out as the adult Shrek. Though surly, dangerous, [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]], [[misanthropic]], and venomously cranky, Shrek is peaceful and does not care to hurt anyone, but just wants to live in solitude and be left alone. Shrek is accompanied by [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], an excitable and hyperactive talking [[donkey]]. When Shrek is first seen, he successfully scares off villagers by roaring at them, but it later becomes obvious that they were only attacking him because he is an ogre rather than because he did anything wrong.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek]]'', during a conversation with Donkey, he laments that he is constantly judged by the outside world the minute people meet him, and is thus better off alone (\"Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go 'Aah! Help! Run! A big stupid ugly ogre!' They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.\"). This implies that he became a recluse after trying and failing to find acceptance among others.\n\nAnother factor causing lack of acceptance can be found in ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', where it is revealed that Shrek's father tried to [[Cannibalism|eat him]]. As he says, \"I guess I should have seen it coming. He used to bathe me in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth,\" even though he might have been joking.\n\nWhen he finds [[squatters]] where he lives, he attempts to evict them only to learn he has no legal recourse against them, for he does not own the swamp. Shrek is hired by [[Lord Farquaad]] to rescue Princess Fiona in exchange for the deed to the swamp, with which he can legally banish the squatters.\n\nHowever, during the course of the mission, Shrek falls deeply in love with Fiona. Being an ogre, Shrek has considerable physical strength, being able to break wood and metal constructs, get in physical combat with a number of armored humans and usually winning, and even lifting or turning objects that are too heavy for a normal human being, such as a gigantic vat of magic potion against the maximum security of the Fairy Godmother in ''[[Shrek 2]]''.\n\nIn ''Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party!'', Shrek sings \"Just the Way You Are\". In Far Far Away Idol, he sang \"[[What I Like About You (song)|What I Like About You]]\" by [[The Romantics]] with Fiona. Shrek has a little problem socializing due to the fact that people think he is a mean ugly [[ogre]], even though his appearance is remarkably humanoid, with a few cosmetic exceptions. In the process Shrek is said to have [[sociophobia]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Breaking the Magic Spell: Radical Theories of Folk and Fairy Tales |first=Jack David |last=Zipes |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8131-7030-5}}{{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, from ''Shrek the Third'' onward, Shrek has become a well-liked celebrity, at least in Far Far Away. In the fourth movie, people manage to realize that Shrek is not dangerous and lose their fear and prejudice against him, but to Shrek's dismay they also come to regard him as a [[folk hero]] and visit him with even more frequency than before, disturbing him.

So, shortly before going onstage, she added a closing: \"We are Virginia Tech.\" <ref name=\"Bowers\"/> Her performance produced a sense of unity and received a fifty-four second standing ovation from the over-capacity audience in Cassell Coliseum, including then-President George W. Bush.<ref>Robin Bernstein, [https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12967683/Bernstein%20Utopian%20Movements%20Nikki%20Giovanni.pdf?sequence=1 \"Utopian Movements: Nikki Giovanni and the Convocation Following the Virginia Tech Massacre\"], ''African American Review'' 45.3 (2012): 341\u2013353.</ref>\n\n==Writing==\n[[Image:Nikki Giovanni.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Giovanni in 2007]]\nThe [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Black Power movement]]s inspired her early poetry that was collected in ''Black Feeling, Black Talk'' (1968), which sold over ten thousand copies in its first year, in ''Black Judgement'' (1968), selling six thousand copies in three months, and in ''Re: Creation'' (1970). All three of these early works aided in establishing Giovanni as a new voice for African Americans.(30)  In ''\"After Mecca\": Women Poets and the Black Arts Movement'', [[Cheryl Clarke]] cites Giovanni as a woman poet who became a significant part of the Civil Rights and Black Power Movement.<ref>Clarke, Cheryl, ''\"After Mecca\": Women Poets and the Black Arts Movement'', New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2005.</ref> Giovanni is commonly praised as one of the best African-American poets emerging from the 1960s Black Power and Black Arts Movements.<ref name=\"poetryfoundation.org\">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/nikki-giovanni \"Nikki Giovanni\"]. Poetry Foundation. 2010.</ref> Her early poems that were collected in the late 1960s and early 1970s are seen as radical as and more militant than her later work. Her poetry is described as being \"politically, spiritually, and socially aware\".<ref name=\"poetryfoundation.org\" /> [[Evie Shockley]] describes Giovanni as \"epitomizing the defiant, unapologetically political, unabashedly Afrocentric, BAM ethos\".<ref>\nShockley, Evie, ''Renegade Poetics: Black Aesthetics and Formal Innovation in African- American Poetry''. Iowa City, IA: University of Iowa Press, 2011.</ref> Her work is described as conveying \"urgency in expressing the need for Black awareness, unity, [and] solidarity.\"  Giovanni herself takes great pride in being a \"Black American, a daughter, mother, and a Professor of English\". (29) <ref name=\"poetryfoundation.org\"/> She has since written more than two dozen books, including volumes of poetry, illustrated children's books, and three collections of essays. Her work is said to speak to all ages, and she strives to make her work easily accessible and understood by both adults and children. (29)  Her writing, heavily inspired by African-American activists and artists,<ref>\"Nikki Giovanni - Spotlight - Interview\", ''Ebony'', December 2003.</ref><ref>\"Poet, Tupac capture beauty beneath pain\", ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'' (April 5, 1997).</ref> also reflects the influences of issues of race, gender, sexuality, and the African-American family.<ref name=\"poetryfoundation.org\" /> Her book ''Love Poems'' (1997) was written in memory of [[Tupac Shakur]], and she has stated that she would \"rather be with the thugs than the people who are complaining about them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/flash/vd.asp?PID=12012&aud=1&%7Bslinkprefix%7D&nav=1|title=Barnes and Noble, Meet the Authors audio|author=|date=|website=barnesandnoble.com|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, in 2007 she wrote a children's picture book titled ''[[Rosa (children's book)|Rosa]]'', which centers on the life of Civil Rights leader Rosa Parks. In addition to this book reaching number three on the New York Best Seller list, it also received the Caldecott Honors Award, and its illustrator, Brian Collier, received the Coretta Scott King Award. (29)\n\nGiovanni's poetry reaches more readership through her active engagement with live audiences. She gave her first public reading at the New York City jazz spot, Birdland.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/nikki-giovanni|title=Nikki Giovanni|first=Poetry|last=Foundation|date= January 30, 2019|website=Poetry Foundation|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref> Her public expression of \u201coppression, anger, and solidarity\u201d<ref name=\"auto\"/> as well as her political activism allow her to reach more than just the poetic circles. After the birth of her son in 1969, Giovanni recorded several of her poems with a musical backdrop of jazz and gospel. She began to travel all around the world and speak and read to a wider audience. Even though Giovanni's earlier works were known to carry a militant, revolutionary tone, Giovanni communicated \"a global sense of solidarity amongst oppressed peoples in the world\" in her travels.<ref name=\"auto\"/> It is in this sense of human unity in which Giovanni aligns herself with the beliefs of Martin Luther King, Jr. Like King, Giovanni believes a unified, collective government must be made up of the everyday, ordinary citizen, regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In the 1970s and '80s her popularity as a speaker increased even more. In 1972 Giovanni interviewed Muhammad Ali on ''Soul!''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=nikki+giovanni=interviews+muhammed+ali&view=detail&mid=18024AE78B61603529D2&FORM=VIRE/|title=Soul!: 1972-Miriam Makeba, Muhammad Ali, Nikki Giovanni, the Delfonics|author=|date= April 11, 2013|website=bing.com|access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGiovanni is often interviewed regarding themes pertaining to her poetry such as gender and race. In an interview entitled \"I am Black, Female, Polite\", Peter Bailey questions her regarding the role of gender and race in the poetry she writes.<ref name=bailey>Bailey, Peter. \"I am Black, Female, Polite\". Nikki Giovanni and Virginia C. Fowler, ''Conversations with Nikki Giovanni'', Jackson: University of Mississippi, 1992. 31\u201338.</ref> Bailey specifically addresses the critically acclaimed poem \"Nikki-Rosa,\" and questions whether it is reflective of the poet's own childhood and her experiences in her community. In the interview, Giovanni stresses that she did not like constantly reading the trope of the black family as a tragedy and that \"Nikki-Rosa\" demonstrates the experiences that she witnessed in her communities.<ref name=bailey /> Specifically, the poem deals with black folk culture and touches on such gender, race, and social issues as alcoholism and domestic violence and not having an indoor bathroom. (30)\n\nGiovanni's poetry in the late 1960s and early 1970s addressed black womanhood and black manhood among other themes. In a book she co-wrote with [[James Baldwin]] entitled ''A Dialogue'', the two authors speak blatantly about the status of the black male in the household. Baldwin challenges Giovanni's opinion on the representation of black women as the \"breadwinners\" in the household. Baldwin states: \"A man is not a woman. And whether he's wrong or right... Look, if we're living in the same house and you're my wife or my woman, I have to be responsible for that house.\"<ref name=\"Baldwin 1992\">Baldwin, James and Nikki Giovanni. \"Excerpt from A Dialogue.\" Nikki Giovanni and Virginia C. Fowler, ''Conversations with Nikki Giovanni'', Jackson: University of Mississippi, 1992. 70\u201379.</ref> Conversely, Giovanni recognizes the black man's strength, whether or not he is \"responsible\" for the home or economically advantaged. The interview makes it clear that regardless of who is \"responsible\" for the home, the black woman and the black man should be dependent on one another. In a 1972 ''Soul!'' interview with Mohammed Ali, Giovanni uses her popularity as a speaker to a broader audience to read some of her essay \"Gemini\" from her book, ''Gemini''.  In the excerpt from that essay, Giovanni intones, \"we are born men and women...we need some happiness in our lives, some hope, some love...I really like to think a black, beautiful loving world is possible.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=nikki+giovanni=interviews+muhammed+ali&view=detail&mid=18024AE78B61603529D2&FORM=VIRE/|title=Soul!: 1972-Miriam Makeba, Muhammad Ali, Nikki Giovanni, the Delfonics|author=|date= April 11, 2013|website=bing.com|access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref> Such themes appeared throughout her early poetry which focused on race and gender dynamics in the black community.<ref name=\"Baldwin 1992\"/>\n\nGiovanni tours nationwide and frequently speaks out against hate-motivated violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aavw.org/special_features/pofidr_poetry_giovanni.html|title=Poetry, Fiction, and Drama - Poetry|work=aavw.org|accessdate= April 25, 2016}}</ref> At a 1999 [[Martin Luther King Day]] event, she recalled the 1998 murders of [[James Byrd, Jr.]] and [[Matthew Shepard]]: \"What's the difference between dragging a black man behind a truck in Jasper, Texas, and beating a white boy to death in Wyoming because he's gay?\"<ref>[http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/9899/Jan25_99/keynote.htm \"Giovanni tells students to 'sail on'\"], University of Michigan's ''The University Record'', January 25, 1999.</ref>\n\n''Those Who Ride the Night Winds'' (1983) acknowledged black figures. Giovanni collected her essays in the 1988 volume ''Sacred Cows ... and Other Edibles''. Her more recent works include ''Acolytes'', a collection of 80 new poems, and ''On My Journey Now''. ''Acolytes'' is her first published volume since her 2003 ''Collected Poems''. The work is a celebration of love and recollection directed at friends and loved ones, and it recalls memories of nature, theater, and the glories of children. However, Giovanni's fiery persona still remains a constant undercurrent in ''Acolytes'', as some of the most serious verse links her own life struggles (being a black woman and a cancer survivor) to the wider frame of African-American history and the continual fight for equality.\n\nGiovanni's collection ''Bicycles: Love Poems'' (2009) is a companion work to her 1997 ''Love Poems''. Both works touch on the deaths of her mother, her sister, and those massacred on the Virginia Tech campus. \"Tragedy and trauma are the wheels\" of the bicycle. The first poem (\"Blacksburg Under Siege: 21 August 2006\") and the last poem (\"We Are Virginia Tech\") reflect this. Giovanni chose the title of the collection as a metaphor for love itself, \"because love requires trust and balance.\"<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/02132009/watch2.html Interview with Bill Moyers], February 13, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn ''Chasing Utopia: A Hybrid'' (2013), Giovanni describes falling off of a bike and her mother saying, \"Come here, Nikki and I will pick you up.\" She has explained that it was comforting to hear her mother say this, and that \"it took me the longest to realize \u2013 no, she made me get up myself.\"<ref>Sara Kugler, [http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/poet-nikki-giovanni-visits-nerdland \"Nikki Giovanni reflects on 'Chasing Utopia,' and other struggles\"], ''Melissa Harris-Perry'', MSNBC, December 16, 2013.</ref> Chasing Utopia continues as a hybrid (poetry and prose) work about food as a metaphor and as a connection to the memory of her mother, sister, and grandmother. The theme of the work is love relationships.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/nikki-giovanni/ \"Writer Nikki Giovanni\"], ''Tavis Smiley'', PBS, November 18, 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Giovanni was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album]] at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]] for her album ''The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection''. This was a collection of poems that she read against the backdrop of gospel music.(29)  She also featured on the track \"Ego Trip by Nikki Giovanni\" on [[Blackalicious]]'s 2000 album ''[[Nia (album)|Nia]]''. In November 2008, a song cycle of her poems, ''Sounds That Shatter the Staleness in Lives'' by Adam Hill, was premiered as part of the Soundscapes [[Chamber Music]] Series in [[Taos, New Mexico]].\n\nShe was commissioned by National Public Radio's ''[[All Things Considered]]'' to create an inaugural poem for President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99264347|title=Yes We Can, Yes We Can, Yes We Can!|date=January 16, 2009 |work=All Things Considered|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref> Giovanni read poetry at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] as a part of the bi-centennial celebration of Lincoln's birth on February 12, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/house-divided/2009/02/washingtons_official_lincoln_c.html|title=Washington's Official Lincoln Celebration To Begin Feb. 12|last=Wheeler|first=Linda|work=Washington Post|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nGiovani was part of the 2016 Writer's Symposium by the Sea at Loma Nazarene University.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uctv.tv/series/Writers-Symposium-By-The-Sea-87|title=Writer's Symposium By The Sea -|first=UCTV, University of California Television-|last=https://www.uctv.tv|date=|website=www.uctv.tv|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref> The University of California Television (UCTV) published the readings of Giovanni at the symposium.

Influenced by the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Black Power Movement]] of the period, her early work provides a strong, militant African-American perspective, leading one writer to dub her the \"Poet of the Black Revolution\".<ref name=barstow />  During the 1970s, she began writing children's literature, and co-founded a publishing company, NikTom Ltd, to provide an outlet for other African-American women writers.

Soon after her birth, the family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio where her parents worked at Glenview School. In 1948, the family moved to Wyoming, and sometime in those first three years, Giovanni's sister, Gary, began calling her \"Nikki.\" In 1958, Giovanni moved to Knoxville, TN to live with her grandparents and attend [[Austin-East High School|Austin High School]].<ref name=tehc /> In 1960, she began her studies at her grandfather's alma mater, [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] as an \"Early Entrant\" which meant that she could enroll in college without having finished high school first.<ref>[http://listings.dallasnews.com/dallas_tx/events/show/358045663-nikki-giovanni-the-real-deal \"Nikki Giovanni-The Real Deal\"], ''Dallas News''.</ref> She immediately clashed with the Dean of Women, Ann Cheatam, and was expelled after neglecting to obtain the required permission from the Dean to leave campus and travel home for Thanksgiving break. Giovanni moved back to Knoxville where she worked at a Walgreens Drug Store and helped care for her nephew, Christopher. In 1964, Giovanni spoke with the new Dean of Women at Fisk University, Blanche McConnell Cowan (\"Jackie\"), who urged Giovanni to return to Fisk that fall. While at Fisk, Giovanni edited a student literary journal (titled \u00c8lan), reinstated the campus chapter of SNCC (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee), and published an essay in ''[[Negro Digest]]'' on gender questions in the Movement.<ref name=\"nikki-giovanni.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://nikki-giovanni.com/timeline.php|title=Chronology|last=Giovanni|first=Nikki|website=Nikki Giovanni|access-date=2018-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190305195423/http://nikki-giovanni.com/timeline.php|archive-date=2019-03-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1967, she graduated with honors with a B.A. degree in History.\n\nSoon after graduation, she suffered the loss of her grandmother, Louvenia Watson, and turned to writing to cope with her death. These poems would later be included in her anthology, ''Black Feelings, Black Talk''. In 1968, Giovanni attended a semester at [[University of Pennsylvania]] and then moved to New York City.

Bush.<ref>Robin Bernstein, [https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12967683/Bernstein%20Utopian%20Movements%20Nikki%20Giovanni.pdf?sequence=1 \"Utopian Movements: Nikki Giovanni and the Convocation Following the Virginia Tech Massacre\"], ''African American Review'' 45.3 (2012): 341\u2013353.</ref>\n\n==Writing==\n[[Image:Nikki Giovanni.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Giovanni in 2007]]\nThe [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Black Power movement]]s inspired her early poetry that was collected in ''Black Feeling, Black Talk'' (1968), which sold over ten thousand copies in its first year, in ''Black Judgement'' (1968), selling six thousand copies in three months, and in ''Re: Creation'' (1970). All three of these early works aided in establishing Giovanni as a new voice for African Americans.(30)  In ''\"After Mecca\": Women Poets and the Black Arts Movement'', [[Cheryl Clarke]] cites Giovanni as a woman poet who became a significant part of the Civil Rights and Black Power Movement.<ref>Clarke, Cheryl, ''\"After Mecca\": Women Poets and the Black Arts Movement'', New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2005.</ref> Giovanni is commonly praised as one of the best African-American poets emerging from the 1960s Black Power and Black Arts Movements.<ref name=\"poetryfoundation.org\">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/nikki-giovanni \"Nikki Giovanni\"]. Poetry Foundation. 2010.</ref> Her early poems that were collected in the late 1960s and early 1970s are seen as radical as and more militant than her later work. Her poetry is described as being \"politically, spiritually, and socially aware\".<ref name=\"poetryfoundation.org\" /> [[Evie Shockley]] describes Giovanni as \"epitomizing the defiant, unapologetically political, unabashedly Afrocentric, BAM ethos\".<ref>\nShockley, Evie, ''Renegade Poetics: Black Aesthetics and Formal Innovation in African- American Poetry''. Iowa City, IA: University of Iowa Press, 2011.</ref> Her work is described as conveying \"urgency in expressing the need for Black awareness, unity, [and] solidarity.\"  Giovanni herself takes great pride in being a \"Black American, a daughter, mother, and a Professor of English\". (29) <ref name=\"poetryfoundation.org\"/> She has since written more than two dozen books, including volumes of poetry, illustrated children's books, and three collections of essays. Her work is said to speak to all ages, and she strives to make her work easily accessible and understood by both adults and children. (29)  Her writing, heavily inspired by African-American activists and artists,<ref>\"Nikki Giovanni - Spotlight - Interview\", ''Ebony'', December 2003.</ref><ref>\"Poet, Tupac capture beauty beneath pain\", ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'' (April 5, 1997).</ref> also reflects the influences of issues of race, gender, sexuality, and the African-American family.<ref name=\"poetryfoundation.org\" /> Her book ''Love Poems'' (1997) was written in memory of [[Tupac Shakur]], and she has stated that she would \"rather be with the thugs than the people who are complaining about them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/flash/vd.asp?PID=12012&aud=1&%7Bslinkprefix%7D&nav=1|title=Barnes and Noble, Meet the Authors audio|author=|date=|website=barnesandnoble.com|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, in 2007 she wrote a children's picture book titled ''[[Rosa (children's book)|Rosa]]'', which centers on the life of Civil Rights leader Rosa Parks. In addition to this book reaching number three on the New York Best Seller list, it also received the Caldecott Honors Award, and its illustrator, Brian Collier, received the Coretta Scott King Award. (29)\n\nGiovanni's poetry reaches more readership through her active engagement with live audiences. She gave her first public reading at the New York City jazz spot, Birdland.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/nikki-giovanni|title=Nikki Giovanni|first=Poetry|last=Foundation|date= January 30, 2019|website=Poetry Foundation|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref> Her public expression of \u201coppression, anger, and solidarity\u201d<ref name=\"auto\"/> as well as her political activism allow her to reach more than just the poetic circles. After the birth of her son in 1969, Giovanni recorded several of her poems with a musical backdrop of jazz and gospel. She began to travel all around the world and speak and read to a wider audience. Even though Giovanni's earlier works were known to carry a militant, revolutionary tone, Giovanni communicated \"a global sense of solidarity amongst oppressed peoples in the world\" in her travels.<ref name=\"auto\"/> It is in this sense of human unity in which Giovanni aligns herself with the beliefs of Martin Luther King, Jr. Like King, Giovanni believes a unified, collective government must be made up of the everyday, ordinary citizen, regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In the 1970s and '80s her popularity as a speaker increased even more. In 1972 Giovanni interviewed Muhammad Ali on ''Soul!''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=nikki+giovanni=interviews+muhammed+ali&view=detail&mid=18024AE78B61603529D2&FORM=VIRE/|title=Soul!: 1972-Miriam Makeba, Muhammad Ali, Nikki Giovanni, the Delfonics|author=|date= April 11, 2013|website=bing.com|access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGiovanni is often interviewed regarding themes pertaining to her poetry such as gender and race. In an interview entitled \"I am Black, Female, Polite\", Peter Bailey questions her regarding the role of gender and race in the poetry she writes.<ref name=bailey>Bailey, Peter. \"I am Black, Female, Polite\". Nikki Giovanni and Virginia C. Fowler, ''Conversations with Nikki Giovanni'', Jackson: University of Mississippi, 1992. 31\u201338.</ref> Bailey specifically addresses the critically acclaimed poem \"Nikki-Rosa,\" and questions whether it is reflective of the poet's own childhood and her experiences in her community. In the interview, Giovanni stresses that she did not like constantly reading the trope of the black family as a tragedy and that \"Nikki-Rosa\" demonstrates the experiences that she witnessed in her communities.<ref name=bailey /> Specifically, the poem deals with black folk culture and touches on such gender, race, and social issues as alcoholism and domestic violence and not having an indoor bathroom. (30)\n\nGiovanni's poetry in the late 1960s and early 1970s addressed black womanhood and black manhood among other themes. In a book she co-wrote with [[James Baldwin]] entitled ''A Dialogue'', the two authors speak blatantly about the status of the black male in the household. Baldwin challenges Giovanni's opinion on the representation of black women as the \"breadwinners\" in the household. Baldwin states: \"A man is not a woman. And whether he's wrong or right... Look, if we're living in the same house and you're my wife or my woman, I have to be responsible for that house.\"<ref name=\"Baldwin 1992\">Baldwin, James and Nikki Giovanni. \"Excerpt from A Dialogue.\" Nikki Giovanni and Virginia C. Fowler, ''Conversations with Nikki Giovanni'', Jackson: University of Mississippi, 1992. 70\u201379.</ref> Conversely, Giovanni recognizes the black man's strength, whether or not he is \"responsible\" for the home or economically advantaged. The interview makes it clear that regardless of who is \"responsible\" for the home, the black woman and the black man should be dependent on one another. In a 1972 ''Soul!'' interview with Mohammed Ali, Giovanni uses her popularity as a speaker to a broader audience to read some of her essay \"Gemini\" from her book, ''Gemini''.  In the excerpt from that essay, Giovanni intones, \"we are born men and women...we need some happiness in our lives, some hope, some love...I really like to think a black, beautiful loving world is possible.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=nikki+giovanni=interviews+muhammed+ali&view=detail&mid=18024AE78B61603529D2&FORM=VIRE/|title=Soul!: 1972-Miriam Makeba, Muhammad Ali, Nikki Giovanni, the Delfonics|author=|date= April 11, 2013|website=bing.com|access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref> Such themes appeared throughout her early poetry which focused on race and gender dynamics in the black community.<ref name=\"Baldwin 1992\"/>\n\nGiovanni tours nationwide and frequently speaks out against hate-motivated violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aavw.org/special_features/pofidr_poetry_giovanni.html|title=Poetry, Fiction, and Drama - Poetry|work=aavw.org|accessdate= April 25, 2016}}</ref> At a 1999 [[Martin Luther King Day]] event, she recalled the 1998 murders of [[James Byrd, Jr.]] and [[Matthew Shepard]]: \"What's the difference between dragging a black man behind a truck in Jasper, Texas, and beating a white boy to death in Wyoming because he's gay?\"<ref>[http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/9899/Jan25_99/keynote.htm \"Giovanni tells students to 'sail on'\"], University of Michigan's ''The University Record'', January 25, 1999.</ref>\n\n''Those Who Ride the Night Winds'' (1983) acknowledged black figures. Giovanni collected her essays in the 1988 volume ''Sacred Cows ... and Other Edibles''. Her more recent works include ''Acolytes'', a collection of 80 new poems, and ''On My Journey Now''. ''Acolytes'' is her first published volume since her 2003 ''Collected Poems''. The work is a celebration of love and recollection directed at friends and loved ones, and it recalls memories of nature, theater, and the glories of children. However, Giovanni's fiery persona still remains a constant undercurrent in ''Acolytes'', as some of the most serious verse links her own life struggles (being a black woman and a cancer survivor) to the wider frame of African-American history and the continual fight for equality.\n\nGiovanni's collection ''Bicycles: Love Poems'' (2009) is a companion work to her 1997 ''Love Poems''. Both works touch on the deaths of her mother, her sister, and those massacred on the Virginia Tech campus. \"Tragedy and trauma are the wheels\" of the bicycle. The first poem (\"Blacksburg Under Siege: 21 August 2006\") and the last poem (\"We Are Virginia Tech\") reflect this. Giovanni chose the title of the collection as a metaphor for love itself, \"because love requires trust and balance.\"<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/02132009/watch2.html Interview with Bill Moyers], February 13, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn ''Chasing Utopia: A Hybrid'' (2013), Giovanni describes falling off of a bike and her mother saying, \"Come here, Nikki and I will pick you up.\" She has explained that it was comforting to hear her mother say this, and that \"it took me the longest to realize \u2013 no, she made me get up myself.\"<ref>Sara Kugler, [http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/poet-nikki-giovanni-visits-nerdland \"Nikki Giovanni reflects on 'Chasing Utopia,' and other struggles\"], ''Melissa Harris-Perry'', MSNBC, December 16, 2013.</ref> Chasing Utopia continues as a hybrid (poetry and prose) work about food as a metaphor and as a connection to the memory of her mother, sister, and grandmother. The theme of the work is love relationships.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/nikki-giovanni/ \"Writer Nikki Giovanni\"], ''Tavis Smiley'', PBS, November 18, 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Giovanni was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album]] at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]] for her album ''The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection''. This was a collection of poems that she read against the backdrop of gospel music.(29)  She also featured on the track \"Ego Trip by Nikki Giovanni\" on [[Blackalicious]]'s 2000 album ''[[Nia (album)|Nia]]''. In November 2008, a song cycle of her poems, ''Sounds That Shatter the Staleness in Lives'' by Adam Hill, was premiered as part of the Soundscapes [[Chamber Music]] Series in [[Taos, New Mexico]].\n\nShe was commissioned by National Public Radio's ''[[All Things Considered]]'' to create an inaugural poem for President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99264347|title=Yes We Can, Yes We Can, Yes We Can!|date=January 16, 2009 |work=All Things Considered|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref> Giovanni read poetry at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] as a part of the bi-centennial celebration of Lincoln's birth on February 12, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/house-divided/2009/02/washingtons_official_lincoln_c.html|title=Washington's Official Lincoln Celebration To Begin Feb. 12|last=Wheeler|first=Linda|work=Washington Post|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nGiovani was part of the 2016 Writer's Symposium by the Sea at Loma Nazarene University.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uctv.tv/series/Writers-Symposium-By-The-Sea-87|title=Writer's Symposium By The Sea -|first=UCTV, University of California Television-|last=https://www.uctv.tv|date=|website=www.uctv.tv|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref> The University of California Television (UCTV) published the readings of Giovanni at the symposium.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * *

It was the first ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' game to be released on a [[Nintendo]] platform and was produced in commemoration of the series' tenth anniversary. The story follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]], and [[Amy Rose|Amy]] as they journey to stop [[Doctor Eggman]] from taking over the world. Controlling a character, players are tasked with completing each [[Level (video gaming)|level]], defeating Eggman and his [[robot]] army, and collecting the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]].\n\nDevelopment began after [[Sega]] shifted its focus to third-party software development, due to the poor performance of the [[Dreamcast]] console. Sega recruited [[Dimps]] to lead development, making the game the first in the franchise developed by the studio. While ''Sonic Advance'' follows a similar style of gameplay to the [[Sega Genesis]] ''Sonic'' games, certain concepts and designs were reused from newer titles such as ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' (1998). The game has been [[Porting|ported]] to [[Nokia]]'s [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, and is available on the [[Wii U]] via the [[Virtual Console]] in Japan.\n\n''Sonic Advance'' received positive reviews for its graphics, character animations, and its similarities to the original Genesis games, but was criticized for its short length and special stages. It was a major commercial success, selling 1.21 million copies in the United States and is among the [[List of best-selling Game Boy Advance video games|GBA's bestselling titles]]. Dimps has since created many entries in the series, including two sequels to the game, ''[[Sonic Advance 2]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic Advance 3]]'' (2004).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:SonicAdvanceLoop.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Screenshot showing Sonic running around a loop in Angel Island zone, the game's fifth level. The HUD on the upper left-hand corner shows the timer, score, and amount of rings the player has.|Gameplay screenshot showing [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] in one of the game's levels]]\n''Sonic Advance'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]] [[action game]] reminiscent of the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games released for the [[Sega Genesis]].<ref name=\"gsrev\" /> Players journey through an island to defeat [[Doctor Eggman]], who is attempting to capture its animal population to turn them into evil [[robot]]s. Players select one of four characters, each with their own unique set of moves. [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] is fastest and can perform an \"insta-shield\" that protects him for a moment; [[Tails (character)|Tails]] can fly or swim for a short time; [[Knuckles the Echidna]] can glide through the air, swim above water for a few seconds and climb walls; and [[Amy Rose]] can destroy enemies using a hammer.<ref name=\"ignrev\" /> Except for Amy, each character can defeat enemy robots by jumping and curling into a ball, or by performing a spin dash on the ground to gain speed. By entering a [[cheat code]], players can control Sonic while Tails runs alongside him, similar to ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Sonic Advance + Sonic Adventure 2 Battle Official Perfect Guide|last=|first=|publisher=Versus Books|year=2002|isbn=9780970646866|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe game takes place over six [[level (video gaming)|level]]s called zones. Each zone is split into two acts, where the player must guide their selected character past enemies and obstacles such as spikes and bottomless pits to reach the end in under ten minutes. Scattered around acts are springboards, boost pads, and golden [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]], which serve as a form of [[Health (gaming)|health]]; players survive hits as long as they have at least one ring, but their rings will scatter and disappear after a short period.<ref name=\"gsrev\" /> Players collect canisters that contain [[power-up]]s such as speed shoes, elemental shields, and [[invincibility]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The first act ends when players pass a signpost, and the second culminates in a [[boss fight]] with Eggman; after hitting him eight times, Eggman will flee and drop a capsule of captured animals. Each character starts the game with a number of lives, which are lost when they are hit with no rings in their possession, crushed, drown, or fall in a bottomless pit.

It was the first ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' game to be released on a [[Nintendo]] platform and was produced in commemoration of the series' tenth anniversary. The story follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]], and [[Amy Rose|Amy]] as they journey to stop [[Doctor Eggman]] from taking over the world. Controlling a character, players are tasked with completing each [[Level (video gaming)|level]], defeating Eggman and his [[robot]] army, and collecting the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]].\n\nDevelopment began after [[Sega]] shifted its focus to third-party software development, due to the poor performance of the [[Dreamcast]] console. Sega recruited [[Dimps]] to lead development, making the game the first in the franchise developed by the studio. While ''Sonic Advance'' follows a similar style of gameplay to the [[Sega Genesis]] ''Sonic'' games, certain concepts and designs were reused from newer titles such as ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' (1998). The game has been [[Porting|ported]] to [[Nokia]]'s [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, and is available on the [[Wii U]] via the [[Virtual Console]] in Japan.\n\n''Sonic Advance'' received positive reviews for its graphics, character animations, and its similarities to the original Genesis games, but was criticized for its short length and special stages. It was a major commercial success, selling 1.21 million copies in the United States and is among the [[List of best-selling Game Boy Advance video games|GBA's bestselling titles]]. Dimps has since created many entries in the series, including two sequels to the game, ''[[Sonic Advance 2]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic Advance 3]]'' (2004).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:SonicAdvanceLoop.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Screenshot showing Sonic running around a loop in Angel Island zone, the game's fifth level. The HUD on the upper left-hand corner shows the timer, score, and amount of rings the player has.|Gameplay screenshot showing [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] in one of the game's levels]]\n''Sonic Advance'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]] [[action game]] reminiscent of the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games released for the [[Sega Genesis]].<ref name=\"gsrev\" /> Players journey through an island to defeat [[Doctor Eggman]], who is attempting to capture its animal population to turn them into evil [[robot]]s. Players select one of four characters, each with their own unique set of moves. [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] is fastest and can perform an \"insta-shield\" that protects him for a moment; [[Tails (character)|Tails]] can fly or swim for a short time; [[Knuckles the Echidna]] can glide through the air, swim above water for a few seconds and climb walls; and [[Amy Rose]] can destroy enemies using a hammer.<ref name=\"ignrev\" /> Except for Amy, each character can defeat enemy robots by jumping and curling into a ball, or by performing a spin dash on the ground to gain speed. By entering a [[cheat code]], players can control Sonic while Tails runs alongside him, similar to ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Sonic Advance + Sonic Adventure 2 Battle Official Perfect Guide|last=|first=|publisher=Versus Books|year=2002|isbn=9780970646866|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe game takes place over six [[level (video gaming)|level]]s called zones. Each zone is split into two acts, where the player must guide their selected character past enemies and obstacles such as spikes and bottomless pits to reach the end in under ten minutes. Scattered around acts are springboards, boost pads, and golden [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]], which serve as a form of [[Health (gaming)|health]]; players survive hits as long as they have at least one ring, but their rings will scatter and disappear after a short period.<ref name=\"gsrev\" /> Players collect canisters that contain [[power-up]]s such as speed shoes, elemental shields, and [[invincibility]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The first act ends when players pass a signpost, and the second culminates in a [[boss fight]] with Eggman; after hitting him eight times, Eggman will flee and drop a capsule of captured animals. Each character starts the game with a number of lives, which are lost when they are hit with no rings in their possession, crushed, drown, or fall in a bottomless pit.

The varieties of Hunza and Nagar diverge slightly, but are clearly dialects of a single language. The Yasin variety, also known by the Khowar exonym ''Werchikwar'', is much more divergent. Intelligibility between Hunza-Nagar and Yasin is difficult, and Yasin is sometimes considered a distinct language.<ref>Backstrom & Radloff (1992), Anderson (2006)</ref> Yasin is the least affected by [[language contact|contact with neighboring languages]], though speakers are bilingual in [[Khowar language|Khowar]].

Various contractions result in long vowels; stressed vowels (marked with acute accents in Berger's transcription) tend to be longer and less \"open\" than unstressed ones ({{IPA|[i e a o u]}} as opposed to {{IPA|[\u026a \u025b \u028c \u0254 \u028a]}}). Long vowels also occur in loans and in a few onomatopoeic words (Grune 1998). All vowels have nasal counterparts in Hunza (in some expressive words) and in Nager (also in proper names and a few other words).\n\nBerger (1998) finds the following consonants to be [[Phoneme|phonemic]], shown below in his transcription and in the [[help:IPA|IPA]]:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Dental consonant|Dental]]/[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |  [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!\n!\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| m\n|\n| n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e45 {{IPA|/\u014b/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| p\n|ph {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote1|group=decimal}}\n| t\n|th {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n| \u1e6d {{IPA|/\u0288/}}\n|\u1e6dh {{IPA|/\u0288\u02b0/}}\n| k\n|kh {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}}\n| q\n|qh {{IPA|/q\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote2|group=decimal}}\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| b\n|\n| d\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e0d {{IPA|/\u0256/}}\n|\n| g\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n|'''c''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}}\n|'''ch''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s\u02b0/}}\n|''\u0107 {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255/}}''\n|''\u0107h {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u02b0/}}''\n|'''c\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282/}}\n|'''c\u0323h''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|''j {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0291/}}{{r|footnote4|group=decimal}}''\n|\n|'''j\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0256\u0361\u0290/}}{{r|footnote5|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n| s\n|\n|''\u015b {{IPA|/\u0255/}}''\n|\n|'''\u1e63''' {{IPA|/\u0282/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| h\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n| z\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|'''\u0121''' {{IPA|/\u0281/}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|\n|\n| r\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|\n|\n| l\n|\n| y {{IPA|[j]}}{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n| \u1ef5 {{IPA|/\u027b/}}{{r|footnote7|group=decimal}}\n|\n| w{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes:\n{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=\n<ref name=footnote1>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[p\u02b0] ~ [p\u0361f] ~ [f]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote2>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[q\u02b0] ~ [q\u0361\u03c7] ~ [\u03c7]}}.</ref>\n<!--<ref name=footnote3>The Yasin dialect lacks aspirated affricates and uses the plain ones instead.</ref>-->\n<ref name=footnote4>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0291]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote5>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0290]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote6>Berger (1998) regards {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[j]}} as allophones of /u/ and /i/ that occur in front of stressed vowels.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote7>This phoneme has various pronunciations, all of which are rare sounds cross-linguistically.

In any case, it does not occur in the Yasin dialect, and in Hunza and Nager it does not occur at the beginning of words.</ref>\n}}\n\n==Grammar==\nBurushaski is a [[double-marking language]] and word order is generally [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]].\n\n[[Noun]]s in Burushaski are divided into four [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: human masculine, human feminine, countable objects, and uncountable ones (similar to [[mass noun]]s). The assignment of a noun to a particular gender is largely predictable. Some words can belong both to the countable and to the uncountable class, producing differences in meaning. For example, when countable, ''b\u00e1alt'' means 'apple' but when uncountable, it means 'apple tree' (Grune 1998).\n\nNoun [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] consists of the noun stem, a [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]] [[prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] (mandatory for some nouns, and thus an example of inherent possession), and [[grammatical number|number]] and [[declension|case]] [[Affix|suffixes]]. Distinctions in number are singular, plural, indefinite, and grouped. Cases include [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]]/[[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], and several [[Locative case|locatives]]; the latter indicate both location and direction and may be compounded.\n\nBurushaski [[verb]]s have three basic stems: past tense, present tense, and consecutive. The past stem is the citation form and is also used for [[Imperative mood|imperatives]] and [[nominalization]]; the consecutive stem is similar to a past participle and is used for [[grammatical conjunction|coordination]]. [[Agreement (linguistics)|Agreement]] on the verb has both [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative]] and [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative]] features: transitive verbs and unaccusatives mark both the subject and the object of a clause, while unergatives verbs mark only subject agreement on the verb.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}{{Dubious|date=July 2011}} Altogether, a verb can take up to four prefixes and six suffixes.\n\n== Nouns ==\n\n=== Noun classes ===\nIn Burushaski, there are four [[noun class]]es, similar to declensional classes in [[Indo-European languages]], but unlike Indo-European, the nominal classes in Burushaski are associated with four grammatical \"genders\":\n* '''m''' = male human beings, gods and spirits\n* '''f''' = female human beings and spirits\n* '''x''' = animals, [[countable]] nouns\n* '''y''' = abstract concepts, fluids, uncountable nouns\n\nBelow, the abbreviation \"'''h'''\" will stand for the combination of the m- and f-classes, while \"'''hx'''\" will stand for the combination of the m-, f- and x-classes. Nouns in the x-class typically refer to countable, non-human beings or things, for example animals, fruit, stones, eggs, or coins; conversely, nouns in the y-class are as a rule uncountable abstractions or mass nouns, such as rice, fire, water, snow, wool, etc.\n\nHowever, these rules are not universal \u2013 countable objects in the y-class are sometimes encountered, e.g. ''ha'', 'house'. Related words can subtly change their meanings when used in different classes \u2013 for example, ''bay\u00fa'', when a member of the x-class, means salt in clumps, but when in the y-class, it means powdered salt. Fruit trees are understood collectively and placed in the y-class, but their individual fruits belong to the x-class. Objects made of particular materials can belong to either the x- or the y- class: stone and wood are in the x-class, but metal and leather in the y-class. The [[Article (grammar)|article]], [[adjectives]], [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] and other attributes must be in [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the noun class of their subject.\n\n=== Pluralisation ===\nThere are two [[grammatical number|numbers]] in Burushaski: singular and [[plural]]. The singular is unmarked, while the plural is expressed by means of suffix, which vary depending on the class of the noun:\n* '''h-class''': possible suffixes -ting, -aro, -daro, -taro, -tsaro\n* '''h- and x-class''': possible suffixes -o, -i\u0161o, -ko, -iko, -juko; -ono, -u; -i, -ai; -ts, -uts, -muts, -umuts; -nts, -ants, -ints, -iants, -ingants, -ents, -onts\n* '''y-class''': possible suffixes -ng, -ang, -ing, -iang; -eng, -ong, -ongo; -ming, -\u010ding, -i\u010ding, -mi\u010ding, -i\u010dang (Nagar dialect)\n\nSome nouns admit two or three different prefixes, while others have no distinctive suffix, and occur only in the plural, e.g. ''bras'' 'rice', ''gur'' 'wheat', ''bishk\u00e9'', 'fur', (cf. [[plurale tantum]]). On the other hand, there are also nouns which have identical forms in the singular and plural, e.g. ''hag\u00far'' 'horse(s)'. Adjectives have a unique plural suffix, whose form depends on the class of the noun they modify, e.g. ''bur\u00fam'' 'white' gives the x-class plural ''burum-i\u0161o'' and the y-class plural ''bur\u00fam-ing''.\n\nExamples of pluralisation in Burushaski:\n* ''waz\u00edir'' (m), pl. ''waz\u00edirishu'' 'vizier, minister'\n* ''hir'' (m), pl. ''huri'' 'man' (stress shifts)\n* ''gus'' (f), pl. ''gush\u00ednga'' 'woman' (stress shifts)\n* ''das\u00edn'' (f), pl. ''daseyoo'' 'girl', 'unmarried woman'\n* ''huk'' (x), pl. ''huk\u00e1'' 'dog'\n* ''thely'' (x), pl. ''til\u00ed'' 'walnut'\n* ''thely'' (y), pl. ''theleng'' 'walnut tree'\n\n=== Declension ===\nBurushaski is an [[ergativity|ergative]] language. It has five primary [[case (linguistics)|cases]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Case\n!Suffix\n!Function\n|-\n| [[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] || unmarked || The subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive ones.\n|-\n| [[Ergative case|Ergative]] || ''-e'' || The subject of transitive verbs.\n|-\n| [[Oblique case|Oblique]] || ''-e''; ''-mo'' (f)|| [[Genitive]]; the basis of secondary case endings\n|-\n| [[Dative case|Dative]] || ''-ar'', ''-r'' || Dative, [[allative]].\n|-\n| [[Ablative case|Ablative]] || ''-um'', ''-m'', ''-mo'' || Indicates separation (e.g. 'from where?')\n|}\n\nThe case suffixes are appended to the plural suffix, e.g. ''Hus\u00e9iniukutse'', 'the people of Hussein' (ergative plural). The genitive ending is irregular, /mo/, for singular f-class nouns, but /-e/ in all others (identical to the ergative ending). The dative ending, /-ar/, /-r/ is attached to the genitive ending for singular f-class nouns, but to the stem for all others. Examples:\n* ''hir-e'' 'the man's', ''gus-mo'' 'the woman's' (gen.)\n* ''hir-ar'' 'to the man', ''gus-mu-r'' 'to the woman' (dat.)\n\nThe genitive is placed before the thing possessed: ''Hunzue tham'', 'the Emir of Hunza.'\n\nThe endings of the secondary cases are formed from a secondary case suffix (or infix) and one of the primary endings /-e/, /-ar/ or /-um/. These endings are directional, /-e/ being locative (answering 'where?'), /-ar/ being terminative (answering 'where to?'), and /-um/ being ablative (answering 'where from?'). The infixes, and their basic meanings, are as follows:\n\n# ''-ts-'' 'at'\n# ''-ul-'' 'in'\n# ''-a\u1e6d-'' 'on; with'\n# ''-al-'' 'near' (only in the Hunza dialect)\n\nFrom these, the following secondary or compound cases are formed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Infix\n!Locative\n!Terminative\n!Ablative\n|-\n| '''-ts-''' || ''-ts-e'' 'at' || ''-ts-ar'' 'to' || ''-ts-um'' 'from'\n|-\n| '''-ul-''' || ''-ul-e'' 'in' || ''-ul-ar'' 'into' || ''-ul-um'' 'out of'\n|-\n| '''-a\u1e6d-''' || ''-a\u1e6d-e'' 'on','with' || ''-a\u1e6d-ar'' 'up to' || ''-a\u1e6d-um'' 'down from'\n|-\n| '''-al-''' || ''-al-e'' 'near' || ''-al-ar'' 'to' || ''-al-um'' 'from'\n|}\n\nThe regular endings /-ul-e/ and /-ul-ar/ are archaic and are now replaced by /-ul-o/ and /-ar-ulo/ respectively.\n\n=== Pronouns and pronominal prefixes ===\nNouns indicating parts of the body and kinship terms are accompanied by an obligatory pronominal prefix. Thus, one cannot simply say 'mother' or 'arm' in Burushaski, but only 'my arm', 'your mother', 'his father', etc. For example, the root ''mi'' 'mother', is never found in isolation, instead one finds:\n* ''i-mi'' 'his mother', ''mu-mi'' 'her mother', \"gu-mi\" 'your mother'(3f sg.), ''u-mi'' 'their mother' (3h pl.), ''u-mi-tsaro'' 'their mothers'(3h pl.).\n\nThe pronominal, or personal, prefixes agree with the person, number and \u2013 in the third person, the class of their noun. A summary of the basic forms is given in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>Noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-'', ''me-''\n|-\n| 2nd person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'', ''go-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''y-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-''\n|}\n\nPersonal pronouns in Burushaski distinguish proximal and distal forms, e.g. ''khin'' 'he, this one here', but ''in'', 'he, that one there'. In the oblique, there are additional abbreviated forms.\n\n== Numerals ==\nThe Burushaski number system is [[vigesimal]], i.e. based on the number 20. For example, 20 ''altar'', 40 ''alto-altar'' (2 times 20), 60 ''iski-altar'' (3 times 20) etc. The base numerals are:\n* 1 ''han'' (or ''hen'', ''hak'')\n* 2 ''alt\u00f3'' (or ''alt\u00e1n'')\n* 3 ''isko'' (or ''iskey'')\n* 4 ''w\u00e1lto''\n* 5 ''\u010dind\u00f3''\n* 6 ''mish\u00edndo''\n* 7 ''thal\u00f3''\n* 8 ''alt\u00e1mbo''\n* 9 ''hunch\u00f3''\n* 10 ''t\u00f3orumo'' (also ''toorimi'' and ''turma'')\n* 100 ''tha''\n\nExamples of compound numerals:\n\n11 ''turma-han'', 12 ''turma-alto'', 13 ''turma-isko'', ... , 19 ''turma-hunti'';\n20 ''altar'', 30 ''altar-toorumo'', 40 ''alto-altar'', 50 ''alto-altar-toorumo'', 60 ''iski-altar'' and so on;\n21 ''altar-hak'', 22 ''altar-alto'', 23 ''altar-isko'' and so on.\n\n==Verbs==\n\n===Overview===\nThe verbal morphology of Burushaski is extremely complicated and rich in forms. Many sound changes can take place, including [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[deletion (linguistics)|deletion]] and [[Accent (dialect)|accent shift]], which are unique for almost every verb. Here, we can only specify certain basic principles.\n\nThe Burushaski [[finite verb]] falls into the following categories:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Category\n!Possible forms\n|-\n| [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]/[[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]] || Present, [[Future tense|Future]], [[Imperfect]], [[Perfect (grammar)|Perfect]], [[Pluperfect]]\n|-\n| [[Mood (linguistics)|Mood]] || [[Conditional mood|Conditional]], three [[Optative]]s, [[Imperative mood|Imperative]], [[Conative]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical number|Number]] || Singular, [[Plural]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical person|Person]] || 1st, 2nd and 3rd Person (2nd person only in the imperative).\n|-\n| [[Noun class]] || the four noun classes m, f, x and y (only in the 3rd person)\n|}\n\nFor many [[transitive verb]]s, in addition to the subject, the (direct) object is also indicated, also by pronomimal prefixes which vary according to person, number and class. All verbs have negative forms, and many intransitive verbs also have derived transitive forms. The [[infinitive]] forms \u2013 which in Burushaski are the absolutives of the past and present, the perfect participle, and two infinitives \u2013 admit all the finite variations except tense and mood. Infinitive forms are made together with auxiliary verbs and periphrastic forms.\n\n=== The 11 positions of the finite verb ===\nAll verb forms can be constructed according to a complex but regular position system. Berger describes a total of 11 possible positions, or slots, although not all of these will be filled in any given verb form. Many positions also have several alternative contents (indicated by A/B/C below). The verb stem is in position 5, preceded by four possible prefixes and followed by seven possible suffixes. The following table gives an overview of the positions and their functions\n* '''The positions of Burushaski finite verbs'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Position\n!Affixes and their meanings\n|-\n| 1 || Negative prefix ''a-''\n|-\n| 2a/b || d-prefix (creates intransitive verbs) / n-prefix (absolutive prefix)\n|-\n| 3 || '''Pronominal prefixes''': subject of intransitive, object of transitive verbs\n|-\n| 4 || s-prefix (creates secondary transitive verbs)\n|- style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"\n|| 5 || style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"| '''Verb Stem'''\n|-\n| 6 || Plural suffix ''-ya-'' on the verb stem\n|-\n| 7 || Present stem mark ''-\u010d-'' (or ''\u0161'', ''ts''..) forming the present, future and imperfect\n|-\n| 8a/b || '''Pronominal suffix''' of the 1.sg.

The preterite, perfect, pluperfect and conative are formed from the 'simple stem,' whereas the present, imperfect, future and conditional are formed from the 'present stem,' which is itself formed from the simple stem by placing -\u010d- in position 7. The optative and imperative are derived directly from the stem. Altogether, the schema is as follows:\n\nThe formation of the tenses and moods of the verb ''her'' 'to cry', without prefixes:\n* '''Simple stem tenses'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| Conative || stem + personal suffix || ''her-i'' 'he starts to cry'\n|-\n| Preterite || stem [+ linking vowel] + m-suffix + personal suffix || ''her-i-m-i'' 'he cried'\n|-\n| Perfect || stem [+ linking vowel] + present auxiliary || ''her-a-i'' 'he has cried'\n|-\n| Pluperfect || stem [+ linking vowel] + perfect auxiliary || ''her-a-m'' 'he had cried'\n|}\n* '''Present stem tenses'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| Future || stem + present marker [+ linking vowel + m-suffix] + personal ending || ''her-\u010d-i'' 'he will cry'\n|-\n| Present || stem + present marker + linking vowel + present auxiliary || ''her-\u010d-a-i'' 'he is crying'\n|-\n| Imperfect || stem + present marker + linking vowel + perfect auxiliary || ''her-\u010d-a-m'' 'he was crying, used to cry'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Conditional || stem + present marker + linking vowel + m-Suffix (except 1. pl.) + ''\u010de'' || ''her-\u010d-u-m-\u010de'' '...{{nbsp}}he would cry',\n|-\n| stem + present marker + linking vowel + 1. pl. ending + ''\u010de'' || ''her-\u010d-an-\u010de'' 'we would cry'\n|}\n* '''Optatives and Imperative'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| ''\u00e1a''-optative || stem + ''\u00e1a'' (in all persons) || ''her-\u00e1a'' \"...{{nbsp}}should.. cry\"\n|-\n| ''m''-optative || stem [+ linking vowel] + m-suffix || ''her-u-m'' \"...{{nbsp}}should.. cry\u201c\n|-\n| ''\u0161''-optative || stem + ''(i)\u0161'' + personal suffix || ''her-\u0161-an'' \"he should cry\"\n|-\n| Imperative<br>singular || stem [+ ''\u00e9'' for ending-accented verbs] || ''her'' \"cry!\"\n|-\n| Imperative<br>plural || stem + ''in'' || ''her-in'' \"cry!\"\n|}\n\n=== Indication of the subject and object ===\nThe subject and object of the verb are indicated by the use of personal prefixes and suffixes in positions 3, 8 and 10 as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Affix\n!Position\n!Function\n|-\n| Prefixes || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3 || direct object of transitive verbs, subject of intransitive ones\n|-\n| Suffixes || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 8/10 || subject of transitive and intransitive verbs\n|}\n\nThe personal prefixes are identical to the pronominal prefixes of nouns (mandatory with body parts and kinship terms, as above). A simplified overview of the forms of the affixes is given in the following table:\n* '''Personal prefix''' (Position 3)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-''\n|-\n| 2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-''\n|}\n* '''Personal suffixes''' (Positions 8 and 10)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st/2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-a'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-o'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-ie''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i''\n|}\n\nFor example, the construction of the preterite of the transitive verb ''phus'' 'to tie', with prefixes and suffixes separated by hyphens, is as follows :\n* ''i-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties him\" (filled positions: 3-5-8-9-10)\n* ''mu-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties her (f)\"\n* ''u-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties them (pl. hx)\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-an'' \"we/you/they tie him\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-an'' \"you/they tie us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie it\"\n* ''gu-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie you\"\n\nThe personal affixes are also used when the noun occupies the role of the subject or the object, e.g. ''hir i-\u00edr-i-mi'' 'the man died'. With intransitive verbs, the subject function is indicated by both a prefix and a suffix, as in:\n* ''gu-ir-\u010d-u-m-a'' \"you will die\" (future)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he sank\" (preterite)\n\nPersonal prefixes do not occur in all verbs and all tenses. Some verbs do not admit personal prefixes, others still do so only under certain circumstances. Personal prefixes used with intransitive verbs often express a volitional function, with prefixed forms indicating an action contrary to the intention of the subject. For example:\n* ''hur\u00fa\u1e6d-i-m-i'' \"he sat down\" (volitional action without prefix)\n* ''i-\u00edr-i-m-i'' \"he died\" (involuntary action with prefix)\n* ''ghurts-i-mi'' \"he went willingly underwater\", \"he dove\" (without prefix)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he went unwillingly underwater\", \"he sank\" (with prefix)\n\n=== The d- prefix ===\nA number of verbs \u2013 mostly according to their root form \u2013 are found with the d-prefix in position 2, which occurs before a consonant according to [[vowel harmony]]. The precise semantic function of the d-prefix is unclear. With primary transitive verbs the d-prefix, always without personal prefixes, forms regular intransitives. Examples:\n* ''i-phalt-i-mi'' 'he breaks it open' (transitive)\n* ''du-phalt-as'' 'to break open, to explode' (intransitive)\n\nA master's thesis research work of a native speaker of Burushaski on Middle Voice Construction in the Hunza Dialect claims that the [dd-] verbal prefix is an overt morphological middle marker for MV constructions, while the [n-] verbal prefix is a morphological marker for passive voice.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc271839/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf|title=MIDDLE VOICE CONSTRUCTION IN BURUSHASKI: FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NATIVE SPEAKER OF THE HUNZA DIALECT|last=Karim|first=Piar B.A.|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=1\u201310}}</ref> The data primarily come from the Hunza dialect of Burushaski, but analogous phenomena can be observed in other dialects. This research is based on a corpus of 120 dd-prefix verbs. This research has showed that position {-2} on the verb template is occupied by voice-marker in Burushaski. The author argues that the middle marker is a semantic category of its own and that it is clearly distinguished from the reflexive marker in this language. The middle marker (MM) means the grammatical device used to \"indicate that the two semantic roles of Initiator and Endpoint refer to a single holistic entity\" (Kemmer 1993: 47). In the view of that definition, I look at a middle marked verb in Burushaski and illustration follows the example.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* ''hiles dd-i-il-imi''  'the boy drenched'\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wiktionary:Appendix:Burushaski comparative vocabulary list|Burushaski comparative vocabulary list]] ([[Wiktionary]])\n* [[Partawi Shah]]\n* [[Languages of Pakistan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Anderson, Gregory D.

The varieties of Hunza and Nagar diverge slightly, but are clearly dialects of a single language. The Yasin variety, also known by the Khowar exonym ''Werchikwar'', is much more divergent. Intelligibility between Hunza-Nagar and Yasin is difficult, and Yasin is sometimes considered a distinct language.<ref>Backstrom & Radloff (1992), Anderson (2006)</ref> Yasin is the least affected by [[language contact|contact with neighboring languages]], though speakers are bilingual in [[Khowar language|Khowar]]. Yasin is spoken by a quarter of Burushaski speakers.<ref>Anderson 1997: 1022</ref>\n\nIn [[India]], Jammu & Kashmir Burushaski (JKB) \"has developed divergent linguistic features which make it systematically different from the varieties spoken in Pakistan.\"<ref name=\"2006Munshi\">{{cite book|last=Munshi|first=Sadaf |title=Jammu and Kashmir Burushashki: Language, Language Contact, and Change|year=2006|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |language=English|pages=13, 19}}</ref> The dialect of Burushashki spoken in India has been influenced by [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], as well as [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Munshi|first=Sadaf |title=Jammu and Kashmir Burushashki: Language, Language Contact, and Change|year=2006|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |language=English|pages=17\u201318|quote=Linguistic influence from Urdu on JKB is primarily via second language speakers of Urdu.

Various contractions result in long vowels; stressed vowels (marked with acute accents in Berger's transcription) tend to be longer and less \"open\" than unstressed ones ({{IPA|[i e a o u]}} as opposed to {{IPA|[\u026a \u025b \u028c \u0254 \u028a]}}). Long vowels also occur in loans and in a few onomatopoeic words (Grune 1998). All vowels have nasal counterparts in Hunza (in some expressive words) and in Nager (also in proper names and a few other words).\n\nBerger (1998) finds the following consonants to be [[Phoneme|phonemic]], shown below in his transcription and in the [[help:IPA|IPA]]:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Dental consonant|Dental]]/[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |  [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!\n!\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| m\n|\n| n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e45 {{IPA|/\u014b/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| p\n|ph {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote1|group=decimal}}\n| t\n|th {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n| \u1e6d {{IPA|/\u0288/}}\n|\u1e6dh {{IPA|/\u0288\u02b0/}}\n| k\n|kh {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}}\n| q\n|qh {{IPA|/q\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote2|group=decimal}}\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| b\n|\n| d\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e0d {{IPA|/\u0256/}}\n|\n| g\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n|'''c''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}}\n|'''ch''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s\u02b0/}}\n|''\u0107 {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255/}}''\n|''\u0107h {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u02b0/}}''\n|'''c\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282/}}\n|'''c\u0323h''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|''j {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0291/}}{{r|footnote4|group=decimal}}''\n|\n|'''j\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0256\u0361\u0290/}}{{r|footnote5|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n| s\n|\n|''\u015b {{IPA|/\u0255/}}''\n|\n|'''\u1e63''' {{IPA|/\u0282/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| h\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n| z\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|'''\u0121''' {{IPA|/\u0281/}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|\n|\n| r\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|\n|\n| l\n|\n| y {{IPA|[j]}}{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n| \u1ef5 {{IPA|/\u027b/}}{{r|footnote7|group=decimal}}\n|\n| w{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes:\n{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=\n<ref name=footnote1>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[p\u02b0] ~ [p\u0361f] ~ [f]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote2>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[q\u02b0] ~ [q\u0361\u03c7] ~ [\u03c7]}}.</ref>\n<!--<ref name=footnote3>The Yasin dialect lacks aspirated affricates and uses the plain ones instead.</ref>-->\n<ref name=footnote4>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0291]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote5>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0290]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote6>Berger (1998) regards {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[j]}} as allophones of /u/ and /i/ that occur in front of stressed vowels.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote7>This phoneme has various pronunciations, all of which are rare sounds cross-linguistically.

In any case, it does not occur in the Yasin dialect, and in Hunza and Nager it does not occur at the beginning of words.</ref>\n}}\n\n==Grammar==\nBurushaski is a [[double-marking language]] and word order is generally [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]].\n\n[[Noun]]s in Burushaski are divided into four [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: human masculine, human feminine, countable objects, and uncountable ones (similar to [[mass noun]]s). The assignment of a noun to a particular gender is largely predictable. Some words can belong both to the countable and to the uncountable class, producing differences in meaning. For example, when countable, ''b\u00e1alt'' means 'apple' but when uncountable, it means 'apple tree' (Grune 1998).\n\nNoun [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] consists of the noun stem, a [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]] [[prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] (mandatory for some nouns, and thus an example of inherent possession), and [[grammatical number|number]] and [[declension|case]] [[Affix|suffixes]]. Distinctions in number are singular, plural, indefinite, and grouped. Cases include [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]]/[[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], and several [[Locative case|locatives]]; the latter indicate both location and direction and may be compounded.\n\nBurushaski [[verb]]s have three basic stems: past tense, present tense, and consecutive. The past stem is the citation form and is also used for [[Imperative mood|imperatives]] and [[nominalization]]; the consecutive stem is similar to a past participle and is used for [[grammatical conjunction|coordination]]. [[Agreement (linguistics)|Agreement]] on the verb has both [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative]] and [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative]] features: transitive verbs and unaccusatives mark both the subject and the object of a clause, while unergatives verbs mark only subject agreement on the verb.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}{{Dubious|date=July 2011}} Altogether, a verb can take up to four prefixes and six suffixes.\n\n== Nouns ==\n\n=== Noun classes ===\nIn Burushaski, there are four [[noun class]]es, similar to declensional classes in [[Indo-European languages]], but unlike Indo-European, the nominal classes in Burushaski are associated with four grammatical \"genders\":\n* '''m''' = male human beings, gods and spirits\n* '''f''' = female human beings and spirits\n* '''x''' = animals, [[countable]] nouns\n* '''y''' = abstract concepts, fluids, uncountable nouns\n\nBelow, the abbreviation \"'''h'''\" will stand for the combination of the m- and f-classes, while \"'''hx'''\" will stand for the combination of the m-, f- and x-classes. Nouns in the x-class typically refer to countable, non-human beings or things, for example animals, fruit, stones, eggs, or coins; conversely, nouns in the y-class are as a rule uncountable abstractions or mass nouns, such as rice, fire, water, snow, wool, etc.\n\nHowever, these rules are not universal \u2013 countable objects in the y-class are sometimes encountered, e.g. ''ha'', 'house'. Related words can subtly change their meanings when used in different classes \u2013 for example, ''bay\u00fa'', when a member of the x-class, means salt in clumps, but when in the y-class, it means powdered salt. Fruit trees are understood collectively and placed in the y-class, but their individual fruits belong to the x-class. Objects made of particular materials can belong to either the x- or the y- class: stone and wood are in the x-class, but metal and leather in the y-class. The [[Article (grammar)|article]], [[adjectives]], [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] and other attributes must be in [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the noun class of their subject.\n\n=== Pluralisation ===\nThere are two [[grammatical number|numbers]] in Burushaski: singular and [[plural]]. The singular is unmarked, while the plural is expressed by means of suffix, which vary depending on the class of the noun:\n* '''h-class''': possible suffixes -ting, -aro, -daro, -taro, -tsaro\n* '''h- and x-class''': possible suffixes -o, -i\u0161o, -ko, -iko, -juko; -ono, -u; -i, -ai; -ts, -uts, -muts, -umuts; -nts, -ants, -ints, -iants, -ingants, -ents, -onts\n* '''y-class''': possible suffixes -ng, -ang, -ing, -iang; -eng, -ong, -ongo; -ming, -\u010ding, -i\u010ding, -mi\u010ding, -i\u010dang (Nagar dialect)\n\nSome nouns admit two or three different prefixes, while others have no distinctive suffix, and occur only in the plural, e.g. ''bras'' 'rice', ''gur'' 'wheat', ''bishk\u00e9'', 'fur', (cf. [[plurale tantum]]). On the other hand, there are also nouns which have identical forms in the singular and plural, e.g. ''hag\u00far'' 'horse(s)'. Adjectives have a unique plural suffix, whose form depends on the class of the noun they modify, e.g. ''bur\u00fam'' 'white' gives the x-class plural ''burum-i\u0161o'' and the y-class plural ''bur\u00fam-ing''.\n\nExamples of pluralisation in Burushaski:\n* ''waz\u00edir'' (m), pl. ''waz\u00edirishu'' 'vizier, minister'\n* ''hir'' (m), pl. ''huri'' 'man' (stress shifts)\n* ''gus'' (f), pl. ''gush\u00ednga'' 'woman' (stress shifts)\n* ''das\u00edn'' (f), pl. ''daseyoo'' 'girl', 'unmarried woman'\n* ''huk'' (x), pl. ''huk\u00e1'' 'dog'\n* ''thely'' (x), pl. ''til\u00ed'' 'walnut'\n* ''thely'' (y), pl. ''theleng'' 'walnut tree'\n\n=== Declension ===\nBurushaski is an [[ergativity|ergative]] language. It has five primary [[case (linguistics)|cases]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Case\n!Suffix\n!Function\n|-\n| [[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] || unmarked || The subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive ones.\n|-\n| [[Ergative case|Ergative]] || ''-e'' || The subject of transitive verbs.\n|-\n| [[Oblique case|Oblique]] || ''-e''; ''-mo'' (f)|| [[Genitive]]; the basis of secondary case endings\n|-\n| [[Dative case|Dative]] || ''-ar'', ''-r'' || Dative, [[allative]].\n|-\n| [[Ablative case|Ablative]] || ''-um'', ''-m'', ''-mo'' || Indicates separation (e.g. 'from where?')\n|}\n\nThe case suffixes are appended to the plural suffix, e.g. ''Hus\u00e9iniukutse'', 'the people of Hussein' (ergative plural). The genitive ending is irregular, /mo/, for singular f-class nouns, but /-e/ in all others (identical to the ergative ending). The dative ending, /-ar/, /-r/ is attached to the genitive ending for singular f-class nouns, but to the stem for all others. Examples:\n* ''hir-e'' 'the man's', ''gus-mo'' 'the woman's' (gen.)\n* ''hir-ar'' 'to the man', ''gus-mu-r'' 'to the woman' (dat.)\n\nThe genitive is placed before the thing possessed: ''Hunzue tham'', 'the Emir of Hunza.'\n\nThe endings of the secondary cases are formed from a secondary case suffix (or infix) and one of the primary endings /-e/, /-ar/ or /-um/. These endings are directional, /-e/ being locative (answering 'where?'), /-ar/ being terminative (answering 'where to?'), and /-um/ being ablative (answering 'where from?'). The infixes, and their basic meanings, are as follows:\n\n# ''-ts-'' 'at'\n# ''-ul-'' 'in'\n# ''-a\u1e6d-'' 'on; with'\n# ''-al-'' 'near' (only in the Hunza dialect)\n\nFrom these, the following secondary or compound cases are formed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Infix\n!Locative\n!Terminative\n!Ablative\n|-\n| '''-ts-''' || ''-ts-e'' 'at' || ''-ts-ar'' 'to' || ''-ts-um'' 'from'\n|-\n| '''-ul-''' || ''-ul-e'' 'in' || ''-ul-ar'' 'into' || ''-ul-um'' 'out of'\n|-\n| '''-a\u1e6d-''' || ''-a\u1e6d-e'' 'on','with' || ''-a\u1e6d-ar'' 'up to' || ''-a\u1e6d-um'' 'down from'\n|-\n| '''-al-''' || ''-al-e'' 'near' || ''-al-ar'' 'to' || ''-al-um'' 'from'\n|}\n\nThe regular endings /-ul-e/ and /-ul-ar/ are archaic and are now replaced by /-ul-o/ and /-ar-ulo/ respectively.\n\n=== Pronouns and pronominal prefixes ===\nNouns indicating parts of the body and kinship terms are accompanied by an obligatory pronominal prefix. Thus, one cannot simply say 'mother' or 'arm' in Burushaski, but only 'my arm', 'your mother', 'his father', etc. For example, the root ''mi'' 'mother', is never found in isolation, instead one finds:\n* ''i-mi'' 'his mother', ''mu-mi'' 'her mother', \"gu-mi\" 'your mother'(3f sg.), ''u-mi'' 'their mother' (3h pl.), ''u-mi-tsaro'' 'their mothers'(3h pl.).\n\nThe pronominal, or personal, prefixes agree with the person, number and \u2013 in the third person, the class of their noun. A summary of the basic forms is given in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>Noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-'', ''me-''\n|-\n| 2nd person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'', ''go-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''y-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-''\n|}\n\nPersonal pronouns in Burushaski distinguish proximal and distal forms, e.g. ''khin'' 'he, this one here', but ''in'', 'he, that one there'. In the oblique, there are additional abbreviated forms.\n\n== Numerals ==\nThe Burushaski number system is [[vigesimal]], i.e. based on the number 20. For example, 20 ''altar'', 40 ''alto-altar'' (2 times 20), 60 ''iski-altar'' (3 times 20) etc. The base numerals are:\n* 1 ''han'' (or ''hen'', ''hak'')\n* 2 ''alt\u00f3'' (or ''alt\u00e1n'')\n* 3 ''isko'' (or ''iskey'')\n* 4 ''w\u00e1lto''\n* 5 ''\u010dind\u00f3''\n* 6 ''mish\u00edndo''\n* 7 ''thal\u00f3''\n* 8 ''alt\u00e1mbo''\n* 9 ''hunch\u00f3''\n* 10 ''t\u00f3orumo'' (also ''toorimi'' and ''turma'')\n* 100 ''tha''\n\nExamples of compound numerals:\n\n11 ''turma-han'', 12 ''turma-alto'', 13 ''turma-isko'', ... , 19 ''turma-hunti'';\n20 ''altar'', 30 ''altar-toorumo'', 40 ''alto-altar'', 50 ''alto-altar-toorumo'', 60 ''iski-altar'' and so on;\n21 ''altar-hak'', 22 ''altar-alto'', 23 ''altar-isko'' and so on.\n\n==Verbs==\n\n===Overview===\nThe verbal morphology of Burushaski is extremely complicated and rich in forms. Many sound changes can take place, including [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[deletion (linguistics)|deletion]] and [[Accent (dialect)|accent shift]], which are unique for almost every verb. Here, we can only specify certain basic principles.\n\nThe Burushaski [[finite verb]] falls into the following categories:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Category\n!Possible forms\n|-\n| [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]/[[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]] || Present, [[Future tense|Future]], [[Imperfect]], [[Perfect (grammar)|Perfect]], [[Pluperfect]]\n|-\n| [[Mood (linguistics)|Mood]] || [[Conditional mood|Conditional]], three [[Optative]]s, [[Imperative mood|Imperative]], [[Conative]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical number|Number]] || Singular, [[Plural]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical person|Person]] || 1st, 2nd and 3rd Person (2nd person only in the imperative).\n|-\n| [[Noun class]] || the four noun classes m, f, x and y (only in the 3rd person)\n|}\n\nFor many [[transitive verb]]s, in addition to the subject, the (direct) object is also indicated, also by pronomimal prefixes which vary according to person, number and class. All verbs have negative forms, and many intransitive verbs also have derived transitive forms. The [[infinitive]] forms \u2013 which in Burushaski are the absolutives of the past and present, the perfect participle, and two infinitives \u2013 admit all the finite variations except tense and mood. Infinitive forms are made together with auxiliary verbs and periphrastic forms.\n\n=== The 11 positions of the finite verb ===\nAll verb forms can be constructed according to a complex but regular position system. Berger describes a total of 11 possible positions, or slots, although not all of these will be filled in any given verb form. Many positions also have several alternative contents (indicated by A/B/C below). The verb stem is in position 5, preceded by four possible prefixes and followed by seven possible suffixes. The following table gives an overview of the positions and their functions\n* '''The positions of Burushaski finite verbs'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Position\n!Affixes and their meanings\n|-\n| 1 || Negative prefix ''a-''\n|-\n| 2a/b || d-prefix (creates intransitive verbs) / n-prefix (absolutive prefix)\n|-\n| 3 || '''Pronominal prefixes''': subject of intransitive, object of transitive verbs\n|-\n| 4 || s-prefix (creates secondary transitive verbs)\n|- style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"\n|| 5 || style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"| '''Verb Stem'''\n|-\n| 6 || Plural suffix ''-ya-'' on the verb stem\n|-\n| 7 || Present stem mark ''-\u010d-'' (or ''\u0161'', ''ts''..) forming the present, future and imperfect\n|-\n| 8a/b || '''Pronominal suffix''' of the 1.sg.

The preterite, perfect, pluperfect and conative are formed from the 'simple stem,' whereas the present, imperfect, future and conditional are formed from the 'present stem,' which is itself formed from the simple stem by placing -\u010d- in position 7.

A simplified overview of the forms of the affixes is given in the following table:\n* '''Personal prefix''' (Position 3)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-''\n|-\n| 2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-''\n|}\n* '''Personal suffixes''' (Positions 8 and 10)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st/2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-a'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-o'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-ie''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i''\n|}\n\nFor example, the construction of the preterite of the transitive verb ''phus'' 'to tie', with prefixes and suffixes separated by hyphens, is as follows :\n* ''i-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties him\" (filled positions: 3-5-8-9-10)\n* ''mu-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties her (f)\"\n* ''u-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties them (pl. hx)\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-an'' \"we/you/they tie him\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-an'' \"you/they tie us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie it\"\n* ''gu-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie you\"\n\nThe personal affixes are also used when the noun occupies the role of the subject or the object, e.g. ''hir i-\u00edr-i-mi'' 'the man died'. With intransitive verbs, the subject function is indicated by both a prefix and a suffix, as in:\n* ''gu-ir-\u010d-u-m-a'' \"you will die\" (future)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he sank\" (preterite)\n\nPersonal prefixes do not occur in all verbs and all tenses. Some verbs do not admit personal prefixes, others still do so only under certain circumstances. Personal prefixes used with intransitive verbs often express a volitional function, with prefixed forms indicating an action contrary to the intention of the subject. For example:\n* ''hur\u00fa\u1e6d-i-m-i'' \"he sat down\" (volitional action without prefix)\n* ''i-\u00edr-i-m-i'' \"he died\" (involuntary action with prefix)\n* ''ghurts-i-mi'' \"he went willingly underwater\", \"he dove\" (without prefix)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he went unwillingly underwater\", \"he sank\" (with prefix)\n\n=== The d- prefix ===\nA number of verbs \u2013 mostly according to their root form \u2013 are found with the d-prefix in position 2, which occurs before a consonant according to [[vowel harmony]]. The precise semantic function of the d-prefix is unclear. With primary transitive verbs the d-prefix, always without personal prefixes, forms regular intransitives. Examples:\n* ''i-phalt-i-mi'' 'he breaks it open' (transitive)\n* ''du-phalt-as'' 'to break open, to explode' (intransitive)\n\nA master's thesis research work of a native speaker of Burushaski on Middle Voice Construction in the Hunza Dialect claims that the [dd-] verbal prefix is an overt morphological middle marker for MV constructions, while the [n-] verbal prefix is a morphological marker for passive voice.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc271839/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf|title=MIDDLE VOICE CONSTRUCTION IN BURUSHASKI: FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NATIVE SPEAKER OF THE HUNZA DIALECT|last=Karim|first=Piar B.A.|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=1\u201310}}</ref> The data primarily come from the Hunza dialect of Burushaski, but analogous phenomena can be observed in other dialects. This research is based on a corpus of 120 dd-prefix verbs. This research has showed that position {-2} on the verb template is occupied by voice-marker in Burushaski. The author argues that the middle marker is a semantic category of its own and that it is clearly distinguished from the reflexive marker in this language. The middle marker (MM) means the grammatical device used to \"indicate that the two semantic roles of Initiator and Endpoint refer to a single holistic entity\" (Kemmer 1993: 47). In the view of that definition, I look at a middle marked verb in Burushaski and illustration follows the example.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* ''hiles dd-i-il-imi''  'the boy drenched'\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wiktionary:Appendix:Burushaski comparative vocabulary list|Burushaski comparative vocabulary list]] ([[Wiktionary]])\n* [[Partawi Shah]]\n* [[Languages of Pakistan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Anderson, Gregory D.

Short plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a group of brief pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\n''Shadow Play'' depicts a husband and wife in a marriage on the brink of collapse. Under the influence of an unwisely large dose of sleeping pills, the wife has a dream that retells their story in hallucinatory form. Musical intervals weave in and out of the dream. The husband is so concerned for his wife's condition that his love is rekindled, and when she comes round they are reconciled.\n\nThe play was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936\u20131937), where it played (together with other plays in the cycle) to full houses. It has enjoyed several major revivals and has been adapted for television.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre. He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> Among Coward's earlier one-act plays are ''[[The Better Half (play)|The Better Half]]'' (1921) and ''[[Post Mortem (Coward play)|Post Mortem]]'' (1930). In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of nine short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in a revival of ''[[The Assumption of Hannele]]'' in 1913.<ref>Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51</ref> They starred together in his revue ''[[London Calling!]]'' (1923) and his comedy ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1930\u201331),<ref>Morley, (1999), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217</ref> and he wrote the ''Tonight at 8.30'' plays \"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283</ref> Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them. They were performed in various combinations of three.{{refn|The plays chosen for each performance were announced in advance, although a myth evolved that the groupings were random.<ref>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 January 1936, p. 10; 11 February 1936, p. 12; 2 March 1936, p. 12; 6 April 1936, p. 10; 2 May 1936, p. 12; 10 June 1936, p. 14.</ref>|group=n}}  ''Shadow Play'' was first presented on the third night of the cycle on 18 October 1935 at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House, Manchester]], the final play in a programme that also contained ''[[Hands Across the Sea (play)|Hands Across the Sea]]'' and ''[[Fumed Oak]]''.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, p. 282</ref>\n\nThe first London performance was on 18 January 1936 at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]].<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 19 January 1936, p. 15.</ref> The production ran for a limited season, playing to full houses; as was typical for him, Coward closed the cycle after three months.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 192</ref>{{refn|Coward, who disliked long runs, and also needed to set aside time to write and compose,<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 94\u201395</ref> usually insisted on playing a part for no longer than three months.<ref>Hoare, p. 155</ref>|group=n}} The Broadway premiere was at the [[Nederlander Theatre|National Theatre]] on 27 November 1936, with mostly the same cast as in London.

They have been to the theatre together, but Vicky refuses to accompany Martha to a party because Simon Gayforth, her husband, is sure to be there with Sybil Heston, to whom he is somewhat attached.<!-- ATTRACTED? Sic.--> Vicky intends to go to bed, and takes three strong sleeping tablets. Her admirer Michael Doyle rings up, and she tells him brusquely to call back tomorrow as she is too tired to talk now.\n\nSimon comes to tell Martha that George, her husband, is waiting impatiently for her. Simon too has decided not to go to the party, and he asks the Cunninghams to make his excuses for him. When they have gone he begins a serious conversation with his wife: he asks her to divorce him. She agrees, noting sadly that they have been married for just five years. The sleeping tablets begin to take effect making her head swim. The action becomes confused and dreamlike, and is evidently seen through Vicky's drugged eyes. Music is heard; it stops and then starts again. Simon dances a few steps. The music becomes more insistent. Simon and Vicky sing a duet, \"Then\", about transitory joy. This is followed by a second song, \"Play, Orchestra, Play\" (\"We Must Have Music\"). The lights fade to nothing. Sybil Heston appears in a pool of light, telling Simon that they must let Vicky know the truth; they are joined by Michael Doyle, who asks them to give her his love. The lights fade on a reprise of \"Play, Orchestra, Play\".\n\nThe scene changes to a moonlit garden. We see the first meeting of Vicky and Simon, at a country ball. Their dialogue is a mixture of what they said at the time and their current comments on it:\n:Vicky: What do you do?\n:Simon: I'm in a bank.\n:Vicky: High up in a bank? Or just sitting in a cage totting up things?\n:Simon: Oh, quite high up, really. It's a very good bank.\n:Vicky: I'm so glad.\n:Simon: How lovely you are.\n:Vicky: No, no, that came later \u2013 you've skipped some.\n:Simon: Sorry.\n:Vicky: You're nice and thin \u2013 your eyes are funny \u2013 you move easily \u2013 I'm afraid you're terribly attractive.\n:Simon: You never said that.\n:Vicky: No, but I thought it.\n:Simon: Stick to the script.\nThey sing a duet, \"You Were There\", finishing in each other's arms in a spotlight. The dreamlike mood continues. Lena, the maid, is seen spotlit, carrying sleeping tablets and a glass of water, and singing \"Then\". In another pool of light, Martha and George are seen in a car discussing the Gayforths' matrimonial troubles: Vicky runs on and accuses them of \"spoiling it all\". There follow hallucinatory images of the Gayforths' honeymoon journey to Venice and a noisy nightclub where Sybil Heston and Michael Doyle dance together in a brilliant spotlight. Another spotlight picks up Vicky and Simon, and the two couples dance on, constantly switching partners, faster and faster, as voices from the darkness rhythmically chant the names of night-clubs: \"The Florida, The Cocoanut Grove, The Four Hundred, The Blue Train\". The noise crescendos and then stops suddenly, with a blackout.\n\nLena, spotlit, is seen telephoning Martha asking her to come back to the house because Vicky is suffering from an overdose of sleeping tablets and Simon is alarmed about her. In the final scene the lighting returns to normal. Simon, Lena and Martha are at Vicky's bedside, giving her black coffee. Simon tells her, when she asks for explanations, that, under the influence of the drug, \"you just went mad, that's all \u2013 raving \u2026 you began dancing about the room\". Deciding that Vicky is now safe, the others leave her alone with Simon. When she asks him about the divorce, he declares that he wants nothing of the sort; everything is all right again between them. He lifts her on to the bed, covers her over with the counterpane, and lies down on the sofa at her feet.\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\nIn 1937 a company led by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada. In their production of  ''Shadow Play'' [[Jessie Royce Landis]] and [[Bramwell Fletcher]] played Vicky and Simon.<ref>\"Three Coward Plays Please\", ''The Vancouver Sun'', 20 November 1937, p. 15</ref> In 1946, [[Cyril Ritchard|Madge Elliott]] and [[Cyril Ritchard]] played the Gaythorpes in an Australian tour, in a bill also containing ''Ways and Means'' and ''Family Album''.<ref>\"Three Coward Plays: Brilliant First Night\", ''The Age'', 19 August 1946, p. 3</ref> ''Shadow Play'' was revived on Broadway in 1948, with Lawrence as Vicky and [[Graham Payn]] as Simon, directed by Coward as part of a US tour of ''Tonight at 8.30''.

Short plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a group of brief pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\n''Shadow Play'' depicts a husband and wife in a marriage on the brink of collapse. Under the influence of an unwisely large dose of sleeping pills, the wife has a dream that retells their story in hallucinatory form. Musical intervals weave in and out of the dream. The husband is so concerned for his wife's condition that his love is rekindled, and when she comes round they are reconciled.\n\nThe play was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936\u20131937), where it played (together with other plays in the cycle) to full houses. It has enjoyed several major revivals and has been adapted for television.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre. He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> Among Coward's earlier one-act plays are ''[[The Better Half (play)|The Better Half]]'' (1921) and ''[[Post Mortem (Coward play)|Post Mortem]]'' (1930). In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of nine short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in a revival of ''[[The Assumption of Hannele]]'' in 1913.<ref>Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51</ref> They starred together in his revue ''[[London Calling!]]'' (1923) and his comedy ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1930\u201331),<ref>Morley, (1999), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217</ref> and he wrote the ''Tonight at 8.30'' plays \"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283</ref> Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them. They were performed in various combinations of three.{{refn|The plays chosen for each performance were announced in advance, although a myth evolved that the groupings were random.<ref>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 January 1936, p. 10; 11 February 1936, p. 12; 2 March 1936, p. 12; 6 April 1936, p. 10; 2 May 1936, p. 12; 10 June 1936, p. 14.</ref>|group=n}}  ''Shadow Play'' was first presented on the third night of the cycle on 18 October 1935 at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House, Manchester]], the final play in a programme that also contained ''[[Hands Across the Sea (play)|Hands Across the Sea]]'' and ''[[Fumed Oak]]''.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, p. 282</ref>\n\nThe first London performance was on 18 January 1936 at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]].<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 19 January 1936, p. 15.</ref> The production ran for a limited season, playing to full houses; as was typical for him, Coward closed the cycle after three months.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 192</ref>{{refn|Coward, who disliked long runs, and also needed to set aside time to write and compose,<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 94\u201395</ref> usually insisted on playing a part for no longer than three months.<ref>Hoare, p. 155</ref>|group=n}} The Broadway premiere was at the [[Nederlander Theatre|National Theatre]] on 27 November 1936, with mostly the same cast as in London.

They have been to the theatre together, but Vicky refuses to accompany Martha to a party because Simon Gayforth, her husband, is sure to be there with Sybil Heston, to whom he is somewhat attached.<!-- ATTRACTED? Sic.--> Vicky intends to go to bed, and takes three strong sleeping tablets. Her admirer Michael Doyle rings up, and she tells him brusquely to call back tomorrow as she is too tired to talk now.\n\nSimon comes to tell Martha that George, her husband, is waiting impatiently for her. Simon too has decided not to go to the party, and he asks the Cunninghams to make his excuses for him. When they have gone he begins a serious conversation with his wife: he asks her to divorce him. She agrees, noting sadly that they have been married for just five years. The sleeping tablets begin to take effect making her head swim. The action becomes confused and dreamlike, and is evidently seen through Vicky's drugged eyes. Music is heard; it stops and then starts again. Simon dances a few steps. The music becomes more insistent. Simon and Vicky sing a duet, \"Then\", about transitory joy. This is followed by a second song, \"Play, Orchestra, Play\" (\"We Must Have Music\"). The lights fade to nothing. Sybil Heston appears in a pool of light, telling Simon that they must let Vicky know the truth; they are joined by Michael Doyle, who asks them to give her his love. The lights fade on a reprise of \"Play, Orchestra, Play\".\n\nThe scene changes to a moonlit garden. We see the first meeting of Vicky and Simon, at a country ball. Their dialogue is a mixture of what they said at the time and their current comments on it:\n:Vicky: What do you do?\n:Simon: I'm in a bank.\n:Vicky: High up in a bank? Or just sitting in a cage totting up things?\n:Simon: Oh, quite high up, really. It's a very good bank.\n:Vicky: I'm so glad.\n:Simon: How lovely you are.\n:Vicky: No, no, that came later \u2013 you've skipped some.\n:Simon: Sorry.\n:Vicky: You're nice and thin \u2013 your eyes are funny \u2013 you move easily \u2013 I'm afraid you're terribly attractive.\n:Simon: You never said that.\n:Vicky: No, but I thought it.\n:Simon: Stick to the script.\nThey sing a duet, \"You Were There\", finishing in each other's arms in a spotlight. The dreamlike mood continues. Lena, the maid, is seen spotlit, carrying sleeping tablets and a glass of water, and singing \"Then\". In another pool of light, Martha and George are seen in a car discussing the Gayforths' matrimonial troubles: Vicky runs on and accuses them of \"spoiling it all\". There follow hallucinatory images of the Gayforths' honeymoon journey to Venice and a noisy nightclub where Sybil Heston and Michael Doyle dance together in a brilliant spotlight. Another spotlight picks up Vicky and Simon, and the two couples dance on, constantly switching partners, faster and faster, as voices from the darkness rhythmically chant the names of night-clubs: \"The Florida, The Cocoanut Grove, The Four Hundred, The Blue Train\". The noise crescendos and then stops suddenly, with a blackout.\n\nLena, spotlit, is seen telephoning Martha asking her to come back to the house because Vicky is suffering from an overdose of sleeping tablets and Simon is alarmed about her. In the final scene the lighting returns to normal. Simon, Lena and Martha are at Vicky's bedside, giving her black coffee. Simon tells her, when she asks for explanations, that, under the influence of the drug, \"you just went mad, that's all \u2013 raving \u2026 you began dancing about the room\". Deciding that Vicky is now safe, the others leave her alone with Simon. When she asks him about the divorce, he declares that he wants nothing of the sort; everything is all right again between them. He lifts her on to the bed, covers her over with the counterpane, and lies down on the sofa at her feet.\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\nIn 1937 a company led by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.

Originally set at a distance of five [[furlong]]s, beginning in the year 1940, the event was increated to five and a half furlongs on the dirt.  The race currently offers a $150,000 purse.\n\nThis race began at [[Gravesend Race Track]] in 1902 where it stayed until 1910.  It then moved to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] to be contested from 1914 to 1955, and again from 1960 to 1974. It was at [[Jamaica Race Course]] 1956, 1958, and 1959.\n\nFrom 1985 through 1994 the Astoria Stakes held Grade III status.<ref>[https://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Stakes&stkid=1314 Equibase Astoria race stats since 1976] Retrieved July 13, 2018</ref>\n\nNamed after a neighborhood in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Queens, New York|Queens]], it would have been in its 103rd running in 2009, but due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], the Astoria was canceled by the NYRA as they adjusted races to meet the new Grade I standard purse of $300,000.

{"title_page": "Chiang Yee", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n{{Chinese name|[[Jiang (surname)|Chiang (Jiang)]]}}\n\n'''Chiang Yee''' ({{zh|s=\u848b\u5f5d|t=\u8523\u5f5d|p=Ji\u01ceng Y\u00ed|w=Chiang I}}; 19 May 1903 \u2013 26 October 1977), self-styled as \"The Silent Traveller\" (\u54d1\u884c\u8005), was a Chinese poet, author, painter and [[calligraphy|calligrapher]]. The success of ''[[The Silent Traveller in London]]'' (1938) was followed by a series of books in the same vein, all of which he illustrated himself. Mr. Chiang is most famously remembered in China for his translation of \"Coca Cola\" to \u53ef\u53e3\u53ef\u6a02, pronounced Ke3Kou3 Ke3Le4, meaning \"delicious delight\".\n\n==1903\u20131933: China==\nChiang Yee was born in [[Jiujiang]], China, on a day variously recorded as 19 May or 14 June. He married Tseng Yun in 1924, with whom he was to have four children, and in 1925 graduated from [[Nanjing University]] (then named National Southeastern University), not only one of the world's oldest institutions of learning but also relaunched in 1920 as one of China's earlier modern universities. He served for over a year in the [[Chinese army]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], then taught chemistry in middle schools, lectured at [[National Chengchi University]], and worked as assistant editor of a [[Hangzhou]] newspaper. He subsequently served as magistrate of three counties (Jiujang in [[Jiangxi]], and Dangtu and Wuhu in [[Anhui]]). Unhappy with the situation in China then (see [[Nanjing decade]]), he departed for England in 1933, to study for an MSc in Economics at the [[London School of Economics]], focusing on municipal administration, leaving wife and family behind.\n\n==1933\u20131955: England==\nFrom 1935 to 1938 he taught Chinese at the [[School of Oriental Studies]] (now [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]), [[University of London]], and 1938 to 1940 worked at the [[Wellcome Museum of Anatomy and Pathology]]. During this period, he wrote and illustrated a well-received series of books entitled ''The Silent Traveller in....''. His first was ''The Silent Traveller: a Chinese Artist in Lakeland'', written from a journal of a fortnight in the English [[Lake District]] in August 1936). Others followed: [[The Silent Traveller in London]], the [[Yorkshire Dales]], and [[The Silent Traveller in Oxford| Oxford]]. Despite paper shortages and rationing, these books were kept in print. He wrote ''The Silent Traveller in Wartime'', and, after [[World War II]] ended, the series gradually ventured further afield, to Edinburgh, Dublin, Paris, New York, San Francisco, and Boston, concluding in 1972 with Japan. He lived for a time with fellow expatriates [[Hsiung Shih-I]], author of a [[West End theatre|West End hit]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Victoria and Albert Museum |first1=Digital Media webmaster@vam ac uk |title=The silent traveller: Chiang Yee in Britain 1933-55 |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/research-journal/issue-no.-4-summer-2012/the-silent-traveller-chiang-yee-in-britain-1933-55/ |website=www.vam.ac.uk |accessdate=2 July 2019 |date=8 August 2012}}</ref> and Dymia Hsiung, the first Chinese woman to write a [[autobiographical novel|fictionalised autobiography]] in English.\n\n===Commentary on his writing: 1933\u20131955===\nThe books characteristically bring a fresh 'sideways look' in a peaceful and non-judgemental way to places perhaps unfamiliar at the time to a Chinese national: the author was struck by things the locals might not notice, such as beards, or the fact that the so-called Lion's Haunch on [[Arthur's Seat]] in Edinburgh is actually far more like a sleeping elephant. In his wartime books, Chiang Yee made it plain that he was fervently [[anti-Nazi|opposed to Nazism]]. His writings exude a feeling of positive curiosity, life-enhancing in a unique way. Some of his books have been re-issued in modern times, at times with fresh introductions.\n\n==1955\u20131975: United States==\nAfter living for some years in a small flat in London and being obliged, during the war, neither to travel nor to take part in the hostilities, on account of being classed as an 'alien', he moved to the United States in 1955, where he became a lecturer (and ultimately [[Emeritus Professor]] of Chinese) at [[Columbia University]] from 1955 to 1977, with an interlude in 1958 and 1959 during which he was Emerson Fellow in Poetry at [[Harvard University]]. He became a naturalized citizen in 1966. He illustrated all his books, including several for children, and he wrote a standard tome on [[Calligraphy|Chinese calligraphy]].\n\n==1975\u20131977: China==\nChiang died in his seventies in China after spending over forty years away from his homeland, on a day variously recorded as 7 or 26 October 1977. His tomb is on the slopes of [[Mount Lu]] above his home town; he is now part of the landscape and environment that influenced his painting over the years.\n\n==Survivors==\nChiang Yee was survived by his eldest son, Chiang Chien-kuo who joined him in the UK after [[World War II]]. Chien-Kuo married and lived in Jersey, Channel Islands. He died in 2002 and was survived by his wife, Barbara Chiang, two children, Stephen and Sudi Chiang and grandchildren, Toby and Emily Chiang and Shiao-li Green. Chiang Yee's younger son, Chiang Chien-Fei, joined him in the United States in the 1960s, where he worked as an artist until his death in 2011 in Old Saybrook, Connecticut.

The success of ''[[The Silent Traveller in London]]'' (1938) was followed by a series of books in the same vein, all of which he illustrated himself. Mr. Chiang is most famously remembered in China for his translation of \"Coca Cola\" to \u53ef\u53e3\u53ef\u6a02, pronounced Ke3Kou3 Ke3Le4, meaning \"delicious delight\".\n\n==1903\u20131933: China==\nChiang Yee was born in [[Jiujiang]], China, on a day variously recorded as 19 May or 14 June. He married Tseng Yun in 1924, with whom he was to have four children, and in 1925 graduated from [[Nanjing University]] (then named National Southeastern University), not only one of the world's oldest institutions of learning but also relaunched in 1920 as one of China's earlier modern universities. He served for over a year in the [[Chinese army]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], then taught chemistry in middle schools, lectured at [[National Chengchi University]], and worked as assistant editor of a [[Hangzhou]] newspaper. He subsequently served as magistrate of three counties (Jiujang in [[Jiangxi]], and Dangtu and Wuhu in [[Anhui]]). Unhappy with the situation in China then (see [[Nanjing decade]]), he departed for England in 1933, to study for an MSc in Economics at the [[London School of Economics]], focusing on municipal administration, leaving wife and family behind.\n\n==1933\u20131955: England==\nFrom 1935 to 1938 he taught Chinese at the [[School of Oriental Studies]] (now [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]), [[University of London]], and 1938 to 1940 worked at the [[Wellcome Museum of Anatomy and Pathology]]. During this period, he wrote and illustrated a well-received series of books entitled ''The Silent Traveller in....''. His first was ''The Silent Traveller: a Chinese Artist in Lakeland'', written from a journal of a fortnight in the English [[Lake District]] in August 1936). Others followed: [[The Silent Traveller in London]], the [[Yorkshire Dales]], and [[The Silent Traveller in Oxford| Oxford]]. Despite paper shortages and rationing, these books were kept in print. He wrote ''The Silent Traveller in Wartime'', and, after [[World War II]] ended, the series gradually ventured further afield, to Edinburgh, Dublin, Paris, New York, San Francisco, and Boston, concluding in 1972 with Japan. He lived for a time with fellow expatriates [[Hsiung Shih-I]], author of a [[West End theatre|West End hit]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Victoria and Albert Museum |first1=Digital Media webmaster@vam ac uk |title=The silent traveller: Chiang Yee in Britain 1933-55 |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/research-journal/issue-no.-4-summer-2012/the-silent-traveller-chiang-yee-in-britain-1933-55/ |website=www.vam.ac.uk |accessdate=2 July 2019 |date=8 August 2012}}</ref> and Dymia Hsiung, the first Chinese woman to write a [[autobiographical novel|fictionalised autobiography]] in English.\n\n===Commentary on his writing: 1933\u20131955===\nThe books characteristically bring a fresh 'sideways look' in a peaceful and non-judgemental way to places perhaps unfamiliar at the time to a Chinese national: the author was struck by things the locals might not notice, such as beards, or the fact that the so-called Lion's Haunch on [[Arthur's Seat]] in Edinburgh is actually far more like a sleeping elephant. In his wartime books, Chiang Yee made it plain that he was fervently [[anti-Nazi|opposed to Nazism]]. His writings exude a feeling of positive curiosity, life-enhancing in a unique way. Some of his books have been re-issued in modern times, at times with fresh introductions.\n\n==1955\u20131975: United States==\nAfter living for some years in a small flat in London and being obliged, during the war, neither to travel nor to take part in the hostilities, on account of being classed as an 'alien', he moved to the United States in 1955, where he became a lecturer (and ultimately [[Emeritus Professor]] of Chinese) at [[Columbia University]] from 1955 to 1977, with an interlude in 1958 and 1959 during which he was Emerson Fellow in Poetry at [[Harvard University]]. He became a naturalized citizen in 1966. He illustrated all his books, including several for children, and he wrote a standard tome on [[Calligraphy|Chinese calligraphy]].\n\n==1975\u20131977: China==\nChiang died in his seventies in China after spending over forty years away from his homeland, on a day variously recorded as 7 or 26 October 1977. His tomb is on the slopes of [[Mount Lu]] above his home town; he is now part of the landscape and environment that influenced his painting over the years.\n\n==Survivors==\nChiang Yee was survived by his eldest son, Chiang Chien-kuo who joined him in the UK after [[World War II]]. Chien-Kuo married and lived in Jersey, Channel Islands. He died in 2002 and was survived by his wife, Barbara Chiang, two children, Stephen and Sudi Chiang and grandchildren, Toby and Emily Chiang and Shiao-li Green. Chiang Yee's younger son, Chiang Chien-Fei, joined him in the United States in the 1960s, where he worked as an artist until his death in 2011 in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. He is survived by his wife, Chiaowen Chiang; two children, Hsinyee (San-San) and Hsinya (Ton-Ton); and grandchildren Adam, Jeremy, Jolie, and Cooper.<br />\n\n== Commemoration ==\nIn June 2019, 40 years after Chiang's death, a [[blue plaque]] was unveiled at 28 Southmoor Road, Oxford where he rented two rooms from 1940 to 1955.

In 1803 the United States gained possession of the land east of Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]].\n\nZebulon M. Pike was sent by the federal government to lay out the boundary lines of territory in 1806. This expedition investigated the area now known as Colorado Springs. The prominent mountain in the area was named Pike's Peak after Pike, the leading commander of the exploration. There were multiple expeditions sent to lay out and explore the territory throughout the early 1800s. This created multiple trading posts with fur trades attracting many backcountry adventurers. There was still no permanent settlement created until after the conclusion of the Mexican War in 1848. San Luis was founded on the Culebra River in 1851. Spanish-speaking settlers who had moved north from New Mexico founded it.
