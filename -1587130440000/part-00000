Further, bulk waste generators such as hotels, hospitals etc. are expected to treat organic waste either onsite or by collaborating with the urban local body.<ref name=\"downtoearth.org.in\"/>\n* Municipalities and urban local bodies have been directed to include informal [[waste picker]]s and rag pickers into their waste management process. This is the first time that national policy has acknowledged and included the informal sector into the waste management process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vikaspedia.in/energy/environment/waste-management/solid-waste-management-rules|title=Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 \u2014 Vikaspedia|website=vikaspedia.in|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref> India has over 1.5 million subsistence informal waste pickers and including them into the formal waste management system represents an opportunity for urban local bodies to streamline their operations, while provide the waste pickers with better income opportunities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/oppressed-and-unrecognised-life-waste-pickers-crucial-india-s-sanitation-72426|website=www.thenewsminute.com|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wiego.org/publications/mainstreaming-waste-pickers-and-informal-recycling-sector-municipal-solid-waste|title=Mainstreaming Waste Pickers and the Informal Recycling Sector|author=Bharati Chaturvedi}}</ref>\n* [[FMCG]] product manufacturers that use non-biodegradable packaging for their products must put in place a system to collect the [[packaging waste]] generated due to their production.<ref name=\"downtoearth.org.in\"/>\n* Urban local bodies have been given a provision to charge bulk generators a user fee to collect and process their waste, additionally spot fines may be levied on user's burning garbage or throwing it in a public place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/photos/news/10-things-that-you-need-to-know-about-solid-waste-management-rules-2016-24292|title=10 Things That You Need To Know About Solid Waste Management Rules 2016|website=NDTV.com|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref> \n* No non-recyclable waste having a calorific value of 1,500 Kcal/kg or more should be disposed in the landfills.

In fact, it is projected to hover around 80-85 MTs by 2030, offering a business case of approximately US$20 Billion.\n\nGrowing economy, soaring urban population, rising living standards and increasing consumption levels \u2013 is what trending in the emerging economies across the globe. With India flourishing on the same grounds, an increase in the purchasing power parity has led to more affordability, accessibility to resource use and a rapid surge in the waste volumes as well.\n\n== City-based initiatives ==\n\nIn 2014 India inaugurated the [[Swachh Bharat Mission]], a five-year nationwide cleanup effort. Before this national consolidated effort for systematic and total waste management came into common consciousness, many cities and towns in India had already launched individual efforts directed at municipal waste collection of segregated waste, either based on citizen activism and/or municipal efforts to set up sustainable systems. Some examples are Swach <ref>https://swachcoop.com</ref> based in Pune (formed in 1993), [[Warangal|Clean Cities Championship in Warangal]], [[Alappuzha|''Nirmal Bhavanam, Nirmal Nagaram'' or Clean Homes, Clean City in Alappuzha]], [[Gangtok|Engage 14 campaign in Gangtok]], [[Bobbili|Zero Waste in Bobbili, Andhra Pradesh]], [[Mysore|Waste Management in Mysore]] and [[Bangalore|Solid Waste Management Round Table, Bangalore]] (formed in 2009).<ref>http://swmrt.com/</ref> Bangalore's [[Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike|Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike]] was directed by the High Court of [[Karnataka]] to implement mandatory segregation of municipal waste at the household level before collection<ref>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/high-court-notice-to-government-on-segregation-of-waste-at-source/article3708796.ece</ref> - a first for the country. This was a direct effort of citizen-based activism at a local level, and the litigation was led by notable activists such as [[Almitra Patel]] and [[Nalini Shekar]]. Following this High Court ruling, other cities in India have also followed suit to make segregation of municipal waste mandatory at the generator level, [[Mumbai]] <ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Soon-segregation-of-dry-and-wet-waste-will-be-compulsory-all-housing-societies/articleshow/55820318.cms</ref> being one of the notable examples.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

For instance, PPP in MSW is considered quite immature and yet high prequalification limits were observed <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dolla |first1=Tharun |last2=Laishram |first2=Boeing |title=Prequalification in municipal solid waste management public-private partnerships of India |journal=Construction Economics and Building |date=8 May 2019 |volume=19 |issue=1 |doi=10.5130/AJCEB.v19i1.6431}}</ref>.  Moreover, the urban local bodies (ULBs) found difficult to come up appropriate scope for a PPP project <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dolla |first1=Tharun |last2=Laishram |first2=Boeing |title=Bundling in public-private partnership projects \u2013 a conceptual framework |journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management |date=22 November 2019 |volume=ahead-of-print |issue=ahead-of-print |doi=10.1108/IJPPM-02-2019-0086}}</ref>.  Some of the specific issues that were encountered while using PPP in waste management sector are that dire need of services are the primary and important reason behind opting for PPP mode <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dolla |first1=Tharun |last2=Laishram |first2=Boeing |title=Factors affecting public-private partnership preference in Indian municipal waste sector |journal=International Journal of Construction Management |date=20 December 2019 |pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1080/15623599.2019.1703085}}</ref>. This has emerged as the first reason for using PPP mode in waste management.  Secondly, the usual perception about PPP is that it gives greater benefit to the public and the third and interconnected reason is that PPPs avoid financial stress on the public sector.  Fourthly, PPPs are thought that they would contain transaction costs and give value for the money invested.  The research <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dolla |first1=Tharun |last2=Laishram |first2=Boeing |title=Factors affecting public-private partnership preference in Indian municipal waste sector |journal=International Journal of Construction Management |date=20 December 2019 |pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1080/15623599.2019.1703085}}</ref> also revealed some serious negative issues that have crept-in while using PPP mode.  They are often procured in an incompetent manner.  As opposed to the expectation, they are resulting in high transaction costs and resulting in ineffective projects.  Lastly, the private sector is apparently exploiting the sector without any beneficial projects <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dolla |first1=Tharun |last2=Laishram |first2=Boeing |title=Factors affecting public-private partnership preference in Indian municipal waste sector |journal=International Journal of Construction Management |date=20 December 2019 |pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1080/15623599.2019.1703085}}</ref>.

In fact, it is projected to hover around 80-85 MTs by 2030, offering a business case of approximately US$20 Billion.\n\nGrowing economy, soaring urban population, rising living standards and increasing consumption levels \u2013 is what trending in the emerging economies across the globe. With India flourishing on the same grounds, an increase in the purchasing power parity has led to more affordability, accessibility to resource use and a rapid surge in the waste volumes as well.\n\n== City-based initiatives ==\n\nIn 2014 India inaugurated the [[Swachh Bharat Mission]], a five-year nationwide cleanup effort. Before this national consolidated effort for systematic and total waste management came into common consciousness, many cities and towns in India had already launched individual efforts directed at municipal waste collection of segregated waste, either based on citizen activism and/or municipal efforts to set up sustainable systems. Some examples are Swach <ref>https://swachcoop.com</ref> based in Pune (formed in 1993), [[Warangal|Clean Cities Championship in Warangal]], [[Alappuzha|''Nirmal Bhavanam, Nirmal Nagaram'' or Clean Homes, Clean City in Alappuzha]], [[Gangtok|Engage 14 campaign in Gangtok]], [[Bobbili|Zero Waste in Bobbili, Andhra Pradesh]], [[Mysore|Waste Management in Mysore]] and [[Bangalore|Solid Waste Management Round Table, Bangalore]] (formed in 2009).<ref>http://swmrt.com/</ref> Bangalore's [[Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike|Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike]] was directed by the High Court of [[Karnataka]] to implement mandatory segregation of municipal waste at the household level before collection<ref>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/high-court-notice-to-government-on-segregation-of-waste-at-source/article3708796.ece</ref> - a first for the country. This was a direct effort of citizen-based activism at a local level, and the litigation was led by notable activists such as [[Almitra Patel]] and [[Nalini Shekar]]. Following this High Court ruling, other cities in India have also followed suit to make segregation of municipal waste mandatory at the generator level, [[Mumbai]] <ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Soon-segregation-of-dry-and-wet-waste-will-be-compulsory-all-housing-societies/articleshow/55820318.cms</ref> being one of the notable examples.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Some of the specific issues that were encountered while using PPP in waste management sector are that dire need of services are the primary and important reason behind opting for PPP mode <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dolla |first1=Tharun |last2=Laishram |first2=Boeing |title=Factors affecting public-private partnership preference in Indian municipal waste sector |journal=International Journal of Construction Management |date=20 December 2019 |pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1080/15623599.2019.1703085}}</ref>. This has emerged as the first reason for using PPP mode in waste management.  Secondly, the usual perception about PPP is that it gives greater benefit to the public and the third and interconnected reason is that PPPs avoid financial stress on the public sector.  Fourthly, PPPs are thought that they would contain transaction costs and give value for the money invested.  The research <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dolla |first1=Tharun |last2=Laishram |first2=Boeing |title=Factors affecting public-private partnership preference in Indian municipal waste sector |journal=International Journal of Construction Management |date=20 December 2019 |pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1080/15623599.2019.1703085}}</ref> also revealed some serious negative issues that have crept-in while using PPP mode.  They are often procured in an incompetent manner.  As opposed to the expectation, they are resulting in high transaction costs and resulting in ineffective projects.  Lastly, the private sector is apparently exploiting the sector without any beneficial projects <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dolla |first1=Tharun |last2=Laishram |first2=Boeing |title=Factors affecting public-private partnership preference in Indian municipal waste sector |journal=International Journal of Construction Management |date=20 December 2019 |pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1080/15623599.2019.1703085}}</ref>.  Still, there are so many other facets that are yet to be understood while using PPP in the waste management sector.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Environment of India]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Waste management in|noredlinks=yes}}\n\n[[Category:Waste management in India]]\n", "name_user": "Sethulakshmiwiki", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management_in_India"}

Gen. Yitzhak Rabin, 7th IDF Chief of Staff in photos (17).jpg|thumb|right|Ben Gurion (holding field glasses) in 1948. Standing behind him is [[Yitzhak Rabin]]; to his left is [[Yigal Allon]].]]\n'''The Generals' Revolt''' was a series of confrontations between [[David Ben-Gurion]] and generals of the newly-formed [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) in 1948, on the eve of the establishment of the [[State of Israel]]. \n\nThe backdrop to the dispute was Ben Gurion's insistence on having commanders from his own [[Mapai]] party appointed to senior posts in the IDF. It mostly centered upon [[Israel Galili]], the [[Mapam]] Head of National Command, who was finally unseated by Ben-Gurion in June in the midst of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli war]].\n\n==History==\nBen-Gurion had three objectives: Replacing the existing Yishuv structures of control over the Haganah and replacing them with a centralised chain of command; dissolving units connected with political movements and creating a unified national army; and building an army based on the [[British Army]] model, breaking with the [[Palmach]] \"revolutionary army\" tradition.\n\nIn 1946 Ben-Gurion tried to appoint loyal supporters into the upper echelons of the Haganah but was unsuccessful. The following year, there was a debate within the defence establishment about what form of armed forces the [[Yishuv]] should have in the anticipated conflict. Ben-Gurion proposed an entirely new organisation to replace the Haganah, modelled on the [[British Army]]. These new ideas shocked the Haganah leadership. The Haganah had not been active since withdrawing from direct action against the British authorities in July 1946, and the crisis threatened morale within Haganah units. Rather than damage the existing structures, Ben-Gurion allowed his ideas to be dropped.<ref>Peri 1983, p. 54</ref>\n\n[[File:Israel Galili.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yisrael Galili]]]]\nIn April 1948, while Chief of Staff, [[Yaakov Dori]], was absent due to ill health, Ben-Gurion came to the decision to abolish the post of Head of National Command, and give himself, as Minister of Defence, direct control over the General Staff. This post was held by [[Yisrael Galili]], one of the leaders of [[Mapam]], the pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rivals to Ben-Gurion's [[Mapai]] party. On 26 April Ben-Gurion notified Galili of the decision. After Galili raised objections, on 3 May, Ben-Gurion issued an official letter:\n\n<blockquote>\"The post of head of the national command is hereby abolished, and Israel Galili's appointment to the post is terminated. The staff of the security forces will henceforth receive its instructions exclusively from the director of security [Ben-Gurion himself] or his representative.\"</blockquote>\n\nA majority of senior IDF officers at that time were from Mapam, and the response from several of them was to threaten to resign. Mapam's newspaper, ''[[Al HaMishmar]]'', predicted the result would be \"a personal dictatorship.\" On 6 May the Haganah leadership presented Ben-Gurion with an ultimatum:\n\n<blockquote>\"The heads of departments consider it essential to restore [Yisrael Galili] to his post until final arrangements are made. If this matter is not settled within the next 12 hours, the heads of departments will cease to consider themselves responsible for the conduct of affairs.\"</blockquote>\n\nBen-Gurion refused to reinstate Galili, but accepted a compromise whereby Galili was a member of the General Staff, but with unspecified duties and the threatened resignations were withdrawn.<ref>Bar Zohar 1978, pp. 154, 155</ref>\n\n[[File:Ygal Yadin - Lt Gel 1949-1952.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yigael Yadin]]]]\nIn June 1948, Ben-Gurion tried again. He proposed reorganising the Haganah to give the IDF a unified command built on four battle zones. An underlying motive for the changes was to purge the IDF HQ of Mapam officers. In response, on 24 June, the acting Chief of Staff,<ref>acting is used, but ''effective'' is better. The actual Chief of Staff was ill. Yadin's status was not formalized until later.</ref> [[Yigael Yadin]] and a group of staff officers put forward a plan for the restructuring, which included their suggestions as to who should be in command of each of the four Commands. Yadin was not from Mapam, but three of the four suggested appointments were.<ref>Peri 1983, p. 298. [[Shimon Avidan]] (South), [[Yigal Allon]] (Centre), [[Moshe Carmel]] (North)</ref> Ben-Gurion put forward counter-suggestions, with three British Army veterans to be department heads in the General Staff, with 28-year-old [[Mordechai Maklef]]f as commander of the Eastern Command and [[Moshe Dayan]] as commander of Jerusalem. Yadin joined Mapam members in accusing Ben-Gurion of political interference in the army, with particular focus on Makleff who was regarded as inexperienced. A group of generals led by Yadin submitted their resignations. These included  Mapam generals Cohen (Ben Hur), Zvi Ayalon and Galili.<ref>Peri 1983, p. 55. Not Yosef Avidar or Zadok.</ref> At a stormy cabinet meeting Ben-Gurion accepted the setting up of a five-man committee headed by Interior Minister [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]] to consider the structure of the high command, on condition that Galili was dismissed. During its secret sessions the committee heard complaints of Ben-Gurion's \"incessant intervention in operational decisions\" as in the recent attacks on [[Battles of Latrun|Latrun]]. In the media Mapam accused Ben-Gurion of attacking the Palmach. The committee proposed that there should be a multi-party war cabinet, and that there should be two director generals from different parties: one between Ben-Gurion and the Minister of Defence, and one between Ben-Gurion and the army. With eight days until the end of the first truce, Ben-Gurion announced his resignation as Prime Minister and as Minister of Defence. In the negotiations that followed the cabinet agreed to withdraw the committee's recommendations and Ben-Gurion dropped his appointment suggestions and his threat of resigning.

Standing behind him is [[Yitzhak Rabin]]; to his left is [[Yigal Allon]].]]\n'''The Generals' Revolt''' was a series of confrontations between [[David Ben-Gurion]] and generals of the newly-formed [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) in 1948, on the eve of the establishment of the [[State of Israel]]. \n\nThe backdrop to the dispute was Ben Gurion's insistence on having commanders from his own [[Mapai]] party appointed to senior posts in the IDF. It mostly centered upon [[Israel Galili]], the [[Mapam]] Head of National Command, who was finally unseated by Ben-Gurion in June in the midst of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli war]].\n\n==History==\nBen-Gurion had three objectives: Replacing the existing Yishuv structures of control over the Haganah and replacing them with a centralised chain of command; dissolving units connected with political movements and creating a unified national army; and building an army based on the [[British Army]] model, breaking with the [[Palmach]] \"revolutionary army\" tradition.\n\nIn 1946 Ben-Gurion tried to appoint loyal supporters into the upper echelons of the Haganah but was unsuccessful. The following year, there was a debate within the defence establishment about what form of armed forces the [[Yishuv]] should have in the anticipated conflict. Ben-Gurion proposed an entirely new organisation to replace the Haganah, modelled on the [[British Army]]. These new ideas shocked the Haganah leadership. The Haganah had not been active since withdrawing from direct action against the British authorities in July 1946, and the crisis threatened morale within Haganah units. Rather than damage the existing structures, Ben-Gurion allowed his ideas to be dropped.<ref>Peri 1983, p. 54</ref>\n\n[[File:Israel Galili.jpg|thumb|right|[[Israel Galili]]]]\nIn April 1948, while Chief of Staff, [[Yaakov Dori]], was absent due to ill health, Ben-Gurion came to the decision to abolish the post of Head of National Command, and give himself, as Minister of Defence, direct control over the General Staff. This post was held by [[Israel Galili]], one of the leaders of [[Mapam]], the pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rivals to Ben-Gurion's [[Mapai]] party. On 26 April Ben-Gurion notified Galili of the decision. After Galili raised objections, on 3 May, Ben-Gurion issued an official letter:\n\n<blockquote>\"The post of head of the national command is hereby abolished, and Israel Galili's appointment to the post is terminated. The staff of the security forces will henceforth receive its instructions exclusively from the director of security [Ben-Gurion himself] or his representative.\"</blockquote>\n\nA majority of senior IDF officers at that time were from Mapam, and the response from several of them was to threaten to resign. Mapam's newspaper, ''[[Al HaMishmar]]'', predicted the result would be \"a personal dictatorship.\" On 6 May the Haganah leadership presented Ben-Gurion with an ultimatum:\n\n<blockquote>\"The heads of departments consider it essential to restore [Israel Galili] to his post until final arrangements are made. If this matter is not settled within the next 12 hours, the heads of departments will cease to consider themselves responsible for the conduct of affairs.\"</blockquote>\n\nBen-Gurion refused to reinstate Galili, but accepted a compromise whereby Galili was a member of the General Staff, but with unspecified duties and the threatened resignations were withdrawn.<ref>Bar Zohar 1978, pp. 154, 155</ref>\n\n[[File:Ygal Yadin - Lt Gel 1949-1952.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yigael Yadin]]]]\nIn June 1948, Ben-Gurion tried again. He proposed reorganising the Haganah to give the IDF a unified command built on four battle zones. An underlying motive for the changes was to purge the IDF HQ of Mapam officers. In response, on 24 June, the acting Chief of Staff,<ref>acting is used, but ''effective'' is better. The actual Chief of Staff was ill. Yadin's status was not formalized until later.</ref> [[Yigael Yadin]] and a group of staff officers put forward a plan for the restructuring, which included their suggestions as to who should be in command of each of the four Commands. Yadin was not from Mapam, but three of the four suggested appointments were.<ref>Peri 1983, p. 298. [[Shimon Avidan]] (South), [[Yigal Allon]] (Centre), [[Moshe Carmel]] (North)</ref> Ben-Gurion put forward counter-suggestions, with three British Army veterans to be department heads in the General Staff, with 28-year-old [[Mordechai Maklef]]f as commander of the Eastern Command and [[Moshe Dayan]] as commander of Jerusalem. Yadin joined Mapam members in accusing Ben-Gurion of political interference in the army, with particular focus on Makleff who was regarded as inexperienced. A group of generals led by Yadin submitted their resignations. These included  Mapam generals Cohen (Ben Hur), Zvi Ayalon and Galili.<ref>Peri 1983, p. 55. Not Yosef Avidar or Zadok.</ref> At a stormy cabinet meeting Ben-Gurion accepted the setting up of a five-man committee headed by Interior Minister [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]] to consider the structure of the high command, on condition that Galili was dismissed. During its secret sessions the committee heard complaints of Ben-Gurion's \"incessant intervention in operational decisions\" as in the recent attacks on [[Battles of Latrun|Latrun]]. In the media Mapam accused Ben-Gurion of attacking the Palmach. The committee proposed that there should be a multi-party war cabinet, and that there should be two director generals from different parties: one between Ben-Gurion and the Minister of Defence, and one between Ben-Gurion and the army. With eight days until the end of the first truce, Ben-Gurion announced his resignation as Prime Minister and as Minister of Defence. In the negotiations that followed the cabinet agreed to withdraw the committee's recommendations and Ben-Gurion dropped his appointment suggestions and his threat of resigning. Galili was removed from all positions of influence and Ben-Gurion remained supreme commander.<ref>Peri 1983, pp. 54\u201357.</ref><ref>Bar Zohar 1978, pp. 175\u2013179.</ref><ref>Kimche 1950, p. 235</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=Bar Zohar|first=Michael|year=1978|title=Ben-Gurion: A Biography|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|ISBN=0-297-77401-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Kimche|first=Jon|year=1950|title=Seven Fallen Pillars: The Middle East, 1915\u20131950|publisher=Secker and Warburg|location=London}}\n* {{cite book|last=Peri|first=Yoram|year=1983|title=Between Battles and Ballots: Israeli Military in Politics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=0-521-24414-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/betweenbattlesba0000peri}}\n\n[[Category:Haganah]]\n[[Category:1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]\n[[Category:Israel Defense Forces]]\n", "name_user": "Jprg1966", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Generals%27_Revolt"}

Some of the survivors made their way to the Bay of Natal (Durban) where they were taken in by Abambo tribe under leadership of Chief Langalibale. The crew became fluent in the language of the tribe and witnessed their customs. They told that the land where the Abambo people lived was called Embo by the natives and that the people were very hospitable. On the 28th of October 1689 the galiot 'Noord' traveled from Table Bay to the Bay of Natal for the purpose to fetch the survivors of the crew and to negotiate a deal to purchase the bay. The Noord arrived the 9th of December 1689 where after the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] purchased the Bay of Natal from the Abambo people for 1650\u00a3. A formal contract was drawn up by Laurens van Swaanswyk and signed by the Chief of the Abambo people, the crew of the Stavenisse acted as translators.<ref>History of South Africa 1486 - 1691, George McCall Theal, London 1888</ref>\n\n=== First European settlers ===\nIn 1822 Lieutenant James King, captain of the ship ''[[HMS Salisbury|Salisbury]]'', together with [[Francis Farewell|Lt. Francis George Farewell]], both ex-[[Royal Navy]] officers from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], were engaged in trade between the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] and [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]]. On a return trip to the Cape in 1823, they were caught in a very bad storm and decided to risk the Bar and anchor in the Bay of Natal. The crossing went off well and they found safe anchor from the storm.\nLt. King decided to map the Bay and named the \"Salisbury and Farewell Islands\". In 1824 Lt. Farewell, together with a trading company called J. R. Thompson & Co., decided to open trade relations with [[Shaka]] the Zulu King and establish a trading station at the Bay. [[Henry Francis Fynn]], another trader at Delagoa Bay, was also involved in this venture.\nFynn left Delagoa Bay and sailed for the Bay of Natal on the brig ''Julia'', while Farewell followed six weeks later on the ''Antelope''. Between them they had 26 possible settlers, but only 18 stayed. On a visit to King Shaka, Henry Francis Fynn was able to befriend the King by helping him recover from a stab wound suffered as a result of an assassination attempt by one of his half-brothers. As a token of Shaka's gratitude, he granted Fynn a \u201c25-mile strip of coast a hundred miles in depth.\u201d  On 7 August 1824 they concluded negotiations with King Shaka for a cession of land, including the Bay of Natal and land extending ten miles south of the Bay, twenty-five miles north of the Bay and one hundred miles inland. \nFarewell took possession of this grant and raised the [[Union Jack]] with a Royal Salute, which consisted of 4 cannon shots and twenty musket shots. Of the original 18 would-be settlers, only 6 remained, and they can be regarded as the founding members of Port Natal as a British colony. These 6 were joined by Lt. James Saunders King and Nathaniel Isaacs in 1825.\n\nThe modern city of Durban thus dates from 1824 when the settlement was established on the northern shores of the bay near today's Farewell Square.<ref name=walker7>{{cite book\n|title = A History of Southern Africa\n|author=Eric A.

The seal was produced in 1855 and was replaced in 1882. The new seal contained a coat of arms without helmet or mantling that combined the coats of arms of Sir Benjamin D\u2019Urban and Sir Benjamin Pine. An application was made to register the coat of arms with the [[College of Arms]] in 1906, but this application was rejected on grounds that the design implied that D\u2019Urban and Pine were husband and wife. Nevertheless, the coat of arms appeared on the council's stationery from about 1912. The following year, a helmet and mantling was added to the council's stationery and to the new city seal that was made in 1936. The motto reads \"Debile principium melior fortuna sequitur\"\u2014\"Better fortune follows a humble beginning\".\n\nThe blazon of the arms registered by the South African Bureau of Heraldry and granted to Durban on 9 February 1979. The coat of arms fell into disuse with the re-organisation of the South African local government structure in 2000.

The [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]] was formed in 1994 after South Africa's first multiracial elections, with its first mayor being [[Sipho Ngwenya]]. The mayor is elected for a five-year term; however Sipho Ngwenya only served two years. In 1996, the city became part of the ''Durban UniCity'' in July 1996 as part of transitional arrangements and to ''eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality'' in 1999, with the adoption of South Africa's new municipal governance system.

All operations at [[Durban International Airport]] have been transferred to [[King Shaka International]] as of 1 May 2010, with plans for flights to [[Singapore]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kigali]], [[Luanda]], [[Lilongwe]] and [[Nairobi]].\n\n=== Sea ===\n[[File:Durban harbor.jpg|thumb|Durban Harbour]]\n\nDurban has a long tradition as a port city. The [[Port of Durban]], formerly known as the Port of Natal, is one of the few natural [[Harbor|harbour]]s between [[Port Elizabeth]] and Maputo, and is also located at the beginning of a particular weather phenomenon which can cause extremely violent seas. These two features made Durban an extremely busy [[Port|port of call]] for ship repairs when the port was opened in the 1840s. Durban is now the busiest port in South Africa, as well as the third busiest [[Containerization|container port]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].\n\n[[MSC Cruises]] bases one of their cruise ships in Durban from November to April every year. From the 2019/2020 Southern Africa cruise season [[MSC Cruises]] will be basing the [[MSC Orchestra]] in Durban.<ref>https://www.msccruises.co.za/en-za/Cruise-Deals/Cruise_Calendar.aspx</ref> Durban is the most popular cruise hub in Southern Africa. Cruise destinations from Durban on the [[MSC Orchestra|MSC ''Orchestra'']] include [[Mozambique]], [[Mauritius]], [[R\u00e9union]], [[Madagascar]] and other domestic destinations such as Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. For the 2020/2021 cruise season [[MSC Cruises]] will be sending 2 ships being the [[MSC Musica|MSC ''Musica'']] & [[MSC Opera|MSC ''Opera'']] which will include additional cruise dates and [[Seychelles]] being added as a new cruise destination. <ref>https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/21410-msc-to-double-deployment-in-south-africa.html</ref> Many other ships cruise through Durban every year, including some of the world's biggest, such as the [[RMS Queen Mary 2|RMS ''Queen Mary 2'']], the biggest ocean liner in the world. Durban will be building a brand new R200 million cruise terminal that will be operational in October 2019, the [[Durban Cruise Terminal]]. The tender was awarded to KwaZulu Cruise Terminal (Pty) Ltd which is 70% owned by MSC Cruises SA and 30% by Africa Armada Consortium. The new cruise terminal will be able to accommodate two cruise ships at any given time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article2650355.ece|title=Times LIVE|website=www.timeslive.co.za}}</ref>\n\n[[Naval Base Durban]] on [[Salisbury Island, Durban|Salisbury Island]] (now joined to the mainland and part of the Port of Durban), was established as a [[naval base]] during the [[Second World War]]. It was downgraded in 2002 to a naval station. In 2012 a decision was made to renovate and expand the facilities back up to a full naval base to accommodate the [[South African Navy]]'s [[offshore patrol vessel|offshore patrol]] flotilla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23908:navy-may-upgrade-naval-station-durban-&catid=108:maritime-security&Itemid=233|title=Navy may upgrade Naval Station Durban|author=Leon Engelbrecht|work=defenceweb.co.za}}</ref> In December 2015 it was redesignated Naval Base Durban.<ref>{{cite news|first=Kim |last=Helfrich |url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=41760:minister-says-its-naval-base-durban-not-station&catid=111:sa-defence&Itemid=242 |title=Minister says it's Naval Base Durban, not Station |publisher=defenceWeb |date=2015-12-09 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Rail ===\nDurban featured the first operating steam railway in South Africa when the [[Natal Railway Company]] started operating a line between the Point and the city of Durban in 1860.<ref name=\"Holland 1\">Steam Locomotives of the South African Railways, vol 1: 1859\u20131910, (D.F.

These trains terminate at [[Durban railway station]].\n\n[[Metrorail KwaZulu-Natal|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Durban and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network runs from Durban Station outwards as far as [[KwaDukuza, KwaZulu-Natal|Stanger]] on the north coast, [[Kelso, KwaZulu-Natal|Kelso]] on the south coast, and [[Cato Ridge, KwaZulu-Natal|Cato Ridge]] inland.\n\nA [[Johannesburg-Durban High Speed Rail|high-speed rail link]] has been proposed, between Johannesburg and Durban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ambitious-plans-will-still-need-funding/browse/3.html\n|accessdate=19 September 2010\n|title=Railway Gazette: Ambitious plans will still need funding\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Roads ===\n[[File:DurbanN3-aerial.jpg|thumb|N3 freeway on its approach to Durban's CBD, with N2\u2013N3 [[stack interchange]] in the foreground]]\n\nThe city's main position as a [[port of entry]] onto the southern African continent has led to the development of [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]] around it. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3 Western Freeway]], which links Durban with the economic hinterland of [[Gauteng]], heads west out of the city. The [[N2 road (South Africa)|N2 Outer Ring Road]] links Durban with the [[Eastern Cape]] to the south, and [[Mpumalanga]] in the north. The Western Freeway is particularly important because freight is shipped by truck to and from the [[Witwatersrand]] for transfer to the port.\n\nThe N3 Western Freeway starts in the central business district and heads west under Tollgate Bridge and through the suburbs of Sherwood and Mayville. The [[EB Cloete Interchange]] (which is informally nicknamed the [[Spaghetti Junction]]) lies to the east of Westville, allowing for transfer of traffic between the N2 [[Durban Outer Ring Road|Outer Ring Road]] and the Western Freeway.\n\nThe N2 Outer Ring Road cuts through the city from the north coast to the south coast. It provides a vital link to the coastal towns (such as [[Scottburgh]] and [[Stanger]]) that rely on Durban.\n\nDurban also has a system of freeway and [[Dual carriageway|dual arterial]] metropolitan routes, which connect the sprawling suburbs that lie to the north, west and south of the city. The [[M4 (Durban)|M4]] exists in two segments. The northern segment, named the Ruth First Highway, starts as an alternative highway at [[Ballito]] where it separates from the N2. It passes through the northern suburbs of [[Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|Umhlanga]] and [[La Lucia]] where it becomes a [[dual carriageway]] and ends at the northern edge of the CBD. The southern segment of the M4, the [[Albert Lutuli]]<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/services/services_news/red-tar-for-southern-freeway]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Highway, starts at the southern edge of the CBD, connecting through to the old, decommissioned Durban International Airport, where it once again reconnects with the N2 Outer Ring Road.\n\nThe [[M7 (Durban)|M7]] connects the southern industrial basin with the N3 and [[Pinetown]] via [[Queensburgh]] via the N2. The [[M19 (Durban)|M19]] connects the northern suburbs with Pinetown via [[Westville, KwaZulu-Natal|Westville]].\n\nThe [[M13 (Durban)|M13]] is an untolled alternative to the N3 Western Freeway (which is tolled at Mariannhill). It also feeds traffic through [[Gillitts]], [[Kloof]], and Westville. In the Westville area it is called the [[Jan Smuts|Jan Smuts Highway]], while in the Kloof area it is named the [[Arthur Hopewell]] Highway.\n\nA number of streets in Durban were renamed in the late 2000s to the names of figures related to the anti-apartheid struggle, persons related to liberation movements around the world (including [[Che Guevara]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]] and [[SWAPO]]), and others associated with the governing [[African National Congress]].<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/renaming/Final%20Listt-%20Street%20Naming2.xls]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> A few street names were changed in the first round of renaming, followed by a larger second round.<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/new-road-names-go-up-1.406687 |title=New road names go up \u2013 Politics &#124; IOL News |work=Independent Online |location=South Africa |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The renamings provoked incidents of vandalism,<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Bainbridge |year=2009 |url=https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain/page/302 302] |title=South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2011-09-16|isbn=9781742203751 }}</ref> as well as protests from opposition parties<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105050226/http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view|date=5 November 2009}}</ref> and members of the public.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wines |first=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html |title=Where the Road to Renaming Does Not Run Smooth |work=The New York Times |date=25 May 2007 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Buses ===\nSeveral companies run long-distance bus services from Durban to the other cities in South Africa. Buses have a long history in Durban. Most of them have been run by Indian owners since the early 1930s. Privately owned buses which are not subsidised by the government also service the communities.

Located on the east coast of South Africa, Durban is the busiest port in the country. It is also one of the major centres of tourism because of the city's warm [[Subtropics|subtropical]] climate and extensive beaches.

These people lived throughout the area of present-day [[KwaZulu-Natal]] until the [[Bantu expansion|expansion of Bantu farmers and pastoralists]] from the north saw their gradual displacement, incorporation or extermination. \nLittle is known of the history of the first residents, as there is no [[Recorded history|written history]] of the area until it was sighted by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Exploration|explorer]] [[Vasco da Gama]], who sailed parallel to the KwaZulu-Natal coast at Christmastide in 1497 while searching for a route from Europe to [[India]]. He named the area \"Natal\", or Christmas in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=walker1>{{cite book\n|title = A History of Southern Africa\n|author=Eric A.

Some of the survivors made their way to the Bay of Natal (Durban) where they were taken in by Abambo tribe under leadership of Chief Langalibale. The crew became fluent in the language of the tribe and witnessed their customs. They told that the land where the Abambo people lived was called Embo by the natives and that the people were very hospitable. On the 28th of October 1689 the galiot 'Noord' traveled from Table Bay to the Bay of Natal for the purpose to fetch the survivors of the crew and to negotiate a deal to purchase the bay. On the 9th of December 1689 the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] purchased the Bay of Natal from the Abambo people for 1650\u00a3. A formal contract was drawn up by Laurens van Swaanswyk and signed by Chief Langalibalele, the crew of the Stavenisse acted as translators.<ref>History of South Africa 1486 - 1691, George McCall Theal, London 1888</ref>\n\n\n=== First European settlers ===\nIn 1822 Lieutenant James King, captain of the ship ''[[HMS Salisbury|Salisbury]]'', together with [[Francis Farewell|Lt. Francis George Farewell]], both ex-[[Royal Navy]] officers from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], were engaged in trade between the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] and [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]]. On a return trip to the Cape in 1823, they were caught in a very bad storm and decided to risk the Bar and anchor in the Bay of Natal. The crossing went off well and they found safe anchor from the storm.\nLt. King decided to map the Bay and named the \"Salisbury and Farewell Islands\". In 1824 Lt. Farewell, together with a trading company called J. R. Thompson & Co., decided to open trade relations with [[Shaka]] the Zulu King and establish a trading station at the Bay. [[Henry Francis Fynn]], another trader at Delagoa Bay, was also involved in this venture.\nFynn left Delagoa Bay and sailed for the Bay of Natal on the brig ''Julia'', while Farewell followed six weeks later on the ''Antelope''. Between them they had 26 possible settlers, but only 18 stayed. On a visit to King Shaka, Henry Francis Fynn was able to befriend the King by helping him recover from a stab wound suffered as a result of an assassination attempt by one of his half-brothers. As a token of Shaka's gratitude, he granted Fynn a \u201c25-mile strip of coast a hundred miles in depth.\u201d  On 7 August 1824 they concluded negotiations with King Shaka for a cession of land, including the Bay of Natal and land extending ten miles south of the Bay, twenty-five miles north of the Bay and one hundred miles inland. \nFarewell took possession of this grant and raised the [[Union Jack]] with a Royal Salute, which consisted of 4 cannon shots and twenty musket shots. Of the original 18 would-be settlers, only 6 remained, and they can be regarded as the founding members of Port Natal as a British colony. These 6 were joined by Lt. James Saunders King and Nathaniel Isaacs in 1825.\n\nThe modern city of Durban thus dates from 1824 when the settlement was established on the northern shores of the bay near today's Farewell Square.<ref name=walker7>{{cite book\n|title = A History of Southern Africa\n|author=Eric A.

The force arrived on 4 May 1842 and built a fortification that was later to be ''The Old Fort''. On the night of 23/24 May 1842 the British attacked the Voortrekker camp at Congella. The attack failed, and the British had to withdraw to their camp which was put under siege. A local trader [[Dick King]] and his servant Ndongeni were able to escape the blockade and rode to [[Grahamstown]], a distance of {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} in fourteen days to raise reinforcements.

The seal was produced in 1855 and was replaced in 1882. The new seal contained a coat of arms without helmet or mantling that combined the coats of arms of Sir Benjamin D\u2019Urban and Sir Benjamin Pine. An application was made to register the coat of arms with the [[College of Arms]] in 1906, but this application was rejected on grounds that the design implied that D\u2019Urban and Pine were husband and wife. Nevertheless, the coat of arms appeared on the council's stationery from about 1912. The following year, a helmet and mantling was added to the council's stationery and to the new city seal that was made in 1936. The motto reads \"Debile principium melior fortuna sequitur\"\u2014\"Better fortune follows a humble beginning\".\n\nThe blazon of the arms registered by the South African Bureau of Heraldry and granted to Durban on 9 February 1979. The coat of arms fell into disuse with the re-organisation of the South African local government structure in 2000. The seal ceased to be used in 1995.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/za-kn-dur.html \n |title=Durban (South Africa) \u2013 Flags of the World \n |author=Bruce Berry \n |date=8 May 2006 \n |accessdate=8 July 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613221018/http://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/FLAGS/za-kn-dur.html \n |archivedate=13 June 2010 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.ngw.nl/int/zaf/d/durban.htm\n |title        = Durban \u2013 Civic Heraldry of South Africa\n |author       = Ralf Hartemink\n |accessdate   = 8 July 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205062839/http://www.ngw.nl/int/zaf/d/durban.htm\n |archive-date = 5 December 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Government  ==\n {{Further|eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality|Mayors of Durban}}With the end of [[apartheid]], Durban was subject to restructuring of local government. The [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]] was formed in 1994 after South Africa's first multiracial elections, with its first mayor being [[Sipho Ngwenya]]. The mayor is elected for a five-year term; however Sipho Ngwenya only served two years. In 1996, the city became part of the ''Durban UniCity'' in July 1996 as part of transitional arrangements and to ''eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality'' in 1999, with the adoption of South Africa's new municipal governance system. In July 1996, [[Obed Mlaba]] was appointed mayor of Durban UniCity; in 1999 he was elected to mayor of the eThekwini municipality and re-elected in 2006. Following the May 2011 local elections, James Nxumalo, the former Speaker of the Council, was elected as the new mayor.

Durban will be building a brand new R200 million cruise terminal that will be operational in October 2019, the [[Durban Cruise Terminal]]. The tender was awarded to KwaZulu Cruise Terminal (Pty) Ltd which is 70% owned by MSC Cruises SA and 30% by Africa Armada Consortium.

These trains terminate at [[Durban railway station]].\n\n[[Metrorail KwaZulu-Natal|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Durban and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network runs from Durban Station outwards as far as [[KwaDukuza, KwaZulu-Natal|Stanger]] on the north coast, [[Kelso, KwaZulu-Natal|Kelso]] on the south coast, and [[Cato Ridge, KwaZulu-Natal|Cato Ridge]] inland.\n\nA [[Johannesburg-Durban High Speed Rail|high-speed rail link]] has been proposed, between Johannesburg and Durban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ambitious-plans-will-still-need-funding/browse/3.html\n|accessdate=19 September 2010\n|title=Railway Gazette: Ambitious plans will still need funding\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Roads ===\n[[File:DurbanN3-aerial.jpg|thumb|N3 freeway on its approach to Durban's CBD, with N2\u2013N3 [[stack interchange]] in the foreground]]\n\nThe city's main position as a [[port of entry]] onto the southern African continent has led to the development of [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]] around it. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3 Western Freeway]], which links Durban with the economic hinterland of [[Gauteng]], heads west out of the city. The [[N2 road (South Africa)|N2 Outer Ring Road]] links Durban with the [[Eastern Cape]] to the south, and [[Mpumalanga]] in the north. The Western Freeway is particularly important because freight is shipped by truck to and from the [[Witwatersrand]] for transfer to the port.\n\nThe N3 Western Freeway starts in the central business district and heads west under Tollgate Bridge and through the suburbs of Sherwood and Mayville. The [[EB Cloete Interchange]] (which is informally nicknamed the [[Spaghetti Junction]]) lies to the east of Westville, allowing for transfer of traffic between the N2 [[Durban Outer Ring Road|Outer Ring Road]] and the Western Freeway.\n\nThe N2 Outer Ring Road cuts through the city from the north coast to the south coast. It provides a vital link to the coastal towns (such as [[Scottburgh]] and [[Stanger]]) that rely on Durban.\n\nDurban also has a system of freeway and [[Dual carriageway|dual arterial]] metropolitan routes, which connect the sprawling suburbs that lie to the north, west and south of the city. The [[M4 (Durban)|M4]] exists in two segments. The northern segment, named the Ruth First Highway, starts as an alternative highway at [[Ballito]] where it separates from the N2. It passes through the northern suburbs of [[Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|Umhlanga]] and [[La Lucia]] where it becomes a [[dual carriageway]] and ends at the northern edge of the CBD. The southern segment of the M4, the [[Albert Lutuli]]<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/services/services_news/red-tar-for-southern-freeway]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Highway, starts at the southern edge of the CBD, connecting through to the old, decommissioned Durban International Airport, where it once again reconnects with the N2 Outer Ring Road.\n\nThe [[M7 (Durban)|M7]] connects the southern industrial basin with the N3 and [[Pinetown]] via [[Queensburgh]] via the N2. The [[M19 (Durban)|M19]] connects the northern suburbs with Pinetown via [[Westville, KwaZulu-Natal|Westville]].\n\nThe [[M13 (Durban)|M13]] is an untolled alternative to the N3 Western Freeway (which is tolled at Mariannhill). It also feeds traffic through [[Gillitts]], [[Kloof]], and Westville. In the Westville area it is called the [[Jan Smuts|Jan Smuts Highway]], while in the Kloof area it is named the [[Arthur Hopewell]] Highway.\n\nA number of streets in Durban were renamed in the late 2000s to the names of figures related to the anti-apartheid struggle, persons related to liberation movements around the world (including [[Che Guevara]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]] and [[SWAPO]]), and others associated with the governing [[African National Congress]].<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/renaming/Final%20Listt-%20Street%20Naming2.xls]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> A few street names were changed in the first round of renaming, followed by a larger second round.<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/new-road-names-go-up-1.406687 |title=New road names go up \u2013 Politics &#124; IOL News |work=Independent Online |location=South Africa |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The renamings provoked incidents of vandalism,<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Bainbridge |year=2009 |url=https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain/page/302 302] |title=South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2011-09-16|isbn=9781742203751 }}</ref> as well as protests from opposition parties<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105050226/http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view|date=5 November 2009}}</ref> and members of the public.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wines |first=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html |title=Where the Road to Renaming Does Not Run Smooth |work=The New York Times |date=25 May 2007 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Buses ===\nSeveral companies run long-distance bus services from Durban to the other cities in South Africa.

Due to a lack of interest from developers, as well as fluctuations in market trends, the company's business model changed from retailer to marketplace.<ref name=\"g2a-history\">{{cite web|access-date=8 January 2016|date=3 January 2016|title=The Early History of G2A|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-early-history-of-g2a-563085251.html|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref>\n\nSales numbers in 2016 showed the platform had processed 22 million transactions throughout the entire G2A ecosystem, which is valued at $313 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hbrp.pl/a/zachowalismy-energie-start-upu-w-duzej-firmie/D10Kntp71M|title=Zachowali\u015bmy energi\u0119 start-upu w du\u017cej firmie|last=Ro\u017cek|first=Dawid|date=August 2017|publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]]}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, a new product category was introduced to G2A Marketplace \u2013 electronics and merchandise tailored to gamers.
