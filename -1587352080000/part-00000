A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.<ref name=DataBook>''2012 New Jersey Legislative District Data Book'', [[Rutgers University]] [[Edward J.

The mayor can [[veto]] ordinances subject to an [[veto override|override]] by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.<ref>Cerra, Michael F.

The ''Goundans'' were the judges in both civil and criminal affairs. They were aided in deciding cases by a body of nobles called ''Soulins''. The office of the ''Soulins'' is to make enquiries, and try all cases connected with the community, and to abide by the decision of the chiefs. The ''Voyduns'' ([[vaidya]]s) and ''Bhoutuls'' ([[pandit]]s, [[joshi]]s and kavis) also ranked with ''Voyduns'' and had their honours on all important occasions, and they are placed in the same rank with the elders. The ''Karesthals'' (commons), are the whole body of masses.

The Saurashtrians classify their ancestors as originally belonging to the two lines of ''Thiriyarisham'' and ''Pancharisham'' descent groups. They follow ''[[Apastamba Dharmasutra]]'' and belong to the [[Ahobila Matha|Ahobila]] and [[Sankaracharya]] [[Matha]]s.

After their settlement in [[South India|Southern India]], some of them, owing to the preachings of [[Adi Shankara|Sankaracharya]] and [[Ramanuja]]charya, were converted into [[Shaivism|Saivites]] and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavites]] respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":19\" />\n\n====Gotras====\n{{See also|Pravaras}}\n\nSaurashtrians, like all other [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]]s, trace their paternal ancestors to one of the seven or eight sages, the [[Saptarshi|saptarishis]]. They classify themselves into [[gotra]]s, named after the ancestor [[rishi]] and each gotra consists of different family names. The gotra was inherited from [[Guru]] at the time of [[Upanayana]], in ancient times, so it is a remnant of Guru-shishya tradition, but since the tradition is no longer followed, during Upanayana ceremony father acts as Guru of his son, so the son inherits his father's gotra.

These rituals are believed to check the ill effects of Planetary movement. The above rites were carried out on the eleventh day after birth of the child. Grandfather's name was much preferred for a male child and the name of a female deity was suggested for female child.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe ''vaduhom'' ceremony ([[sacred thread ceremony]]) of Saurashtrians is basically the ''[[upanayana]]m'' ceremony. This ceremony is exceedingly important among them. This is performed between seventh and thirteenth years. In rare cases when the sacred thread ceremony was not held in the young ages, it would be performed at the time of marriage. The goal of this ceremony was to highlight their [[Brahminical]] status. During this ceremony there was much feasting and entertainment which lasted for four days.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nAmong the Saurashtrians, attaining [[puberty]] was the greatest event in a girl's life.

The ''Goundans'' were the judges in both civil and criminal affairs. They were aided in deciding cases by a body of nobles called ''Soulins''. The office of the ''Soulins'' is to make enquiries, and try all cases connected with the community, and to abide by the decision of the chiefs. The ''Voyduns'' ([[vaidya]]s) and ''Bhoutuls'' ([[pandit]]s, [[joshi]]s and kavis) also ranked with ''Voyduns'' and had their honours on all important occasions, and they are placed in the same rank with the elders.

They classify themselves into [[gotra]]s, named after the ancestor [[rishi]] and each gotra consists of different family names. The gotra was inherited from [[Guru]] at the time of [[Upanayana]], in ancient times, so it is a remnant of Guru-shishya tradition, but since the tradition is no longer followed, during Upanayana ceremony father acts as Guru of his son, so the son inherits his father's gotra.

These rituals are believed to check the ill effects of Planetary movement. The above rites were carried out on the eleventh day after birth of the child. Grandfather's name was much preferred for a male child and the name of a female deity was suggested for female child.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe ''vaduhom'' ceremony ([[sacred thread ceremony]]) of Saurashtrians is basically the ''[[upanayana]]m'' ceremony. This ceremony is exceedingly important among them. This is performed between seventh and thirteenth years. In rare cases when the sacred thread ceremony was not held in the young ages, it would be performed at the time of marriage. The goal of this ceremony was to highlight their [[Brahminical]] status. During this ceremony there was much feasting and entertainment which lasted for four days.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nAmong the Saurashtrians, attaining [[puberty]] was the greatest event in a girl's life.

Before a marriage is fixed, a long negotiation takes place between the parents of both partners.

''Kartha'' is the name given to the one who carries out this rite. The performance of the rite signifies the belief that the life is continuous and does not end by one's death.

At first, the Madurai Saurashtra Sabha was formed in the year 1895 and it was formally registered in the year 1900 with many objectives. The formation of this Sabha was the first step towards [[social mobilization]]. The Sabha's administration is carried out by elected Councillors and office bearers. It has its own rules and regulations regarding holding of elections, rights and duties of office bearers and celebration of social functions. The election to the Sabha is held once in three years. The [[social]] life of the Saurashtrians is controlled almost wholly by the Saurashtra Sabha. This organisation is a committee of the leading men of the community, which manages and controls all the schools and public institutions, the [[temple]] and its worship, and all political, [[Religion|religious]], and social questions among the Saurashtrians.\n\nThe Saurashtra Madhya (central) Sabha, which has its headquarters at [[Madurai]] now remains as the cultural center for all the Saurashtrians living in [[Tamil Nadu]]. Many well-to-do [[merchant]]s and [[philanthropists]] of the community have contributed substantially to the growth of these institutions.

The Saurashtrians emerged as the dominant social group because of their collective mobilization, intellectual leadership, education, wealth, trade and enterprise. There are several instances when the leaders of the community organised the [[Weaving|weavers]] and made social and economic protests. The well-to-do [[merchant]]s of the community made donations to [[Tamil Nadu Congress Committee|TNCC]] for [[Vedaranyam March|Salt Satyagraha]] and welcomed any form of [[Swadeshi movement|Swadeshi]] agitation which favoured [[Indian people|Indian]] cloth.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/politicssocialco0000irsc|url-access=registration|quote=L.K.Tulsiram.|title=Politics and Social Conflict in South India: The Non-Brahman Movement and Tamil Separatism, 1916-1929|last=Irschick|first=Eugene F.|last2=Studies|first2=University of California, Berkeley Center for South and Southeast Asia|date=1969|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/politicssocialco0000irsc/page/9 9],138|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe leaders who came to lead the community were not always from the upper class.
