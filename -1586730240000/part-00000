{"title_page": "Military career of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:Simon Bolivar \"The Liberator\".jpg|thumb|right|Equestrian statue of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]\nThe '''military and political career of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]''' (July 24, 1783 &ndash; December 17, 1830), which included both formal service in the armies of various revolutionary regimes and actions organized by himself or in collaboration with other exiled patriot leaders during the years from 1811 to 1830, was an important element in the success of the [[Spanish American wars of independence|independence wars in South America]]. Given the unstable political climate during these years, Bol\u00edvar and other patriot leaders, such as [[Santiago Mari\u00f1o]], [[Manuel Piar]], [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Berm\u00fadez]] and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] often had to go into exile in the [[Caribbean]] or nearby areas of Spanish America that at the moment were controlled by those favoring independence, and from there, carry on the struggle. These wars resulted in the creation of several South American states out of the former [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies]], the currently existing [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], and the now defunct [[Gran Colombia]].\n\nIn his 21-year career, Bol\u00edvar faced two main challenges. First was gaining acceptance as undisputed leader of the republican cause. Despite claiming such a role since 1813, he began to achieve this only in 1817, and consolidated his hold on power after his dramatic and unexpected victory in New Granada in 1819. His second challenge was implementing a vision of unifying the region into one large state, which he believed (and most would agree, correctly) would be the only guarantee of maintaining American independence from the Spanish in northern South America. His early experiences under the [[First Republic of Venezuela|First Venezuelan Republic]] and in [[Patria Boba|New Granada]] convinced him that divisions among republicans, augmented by federal forms of government, only allowed [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Spanish American royalists]] to eventually gain the upper hand. Once again, it was his victory in 1819 that gave him the leverage to bring about the creation of a unified state, Gran Colombia, with which to oppose the [[Monarchy|Spanish Monarchy]] on the continent.\n\n==Historical background==\n[[File:Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, 1804.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Miniature portrait of Bol\u00edvar at about age 21 made in Paris, circa 1804.]]\n{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence}}\nThe idea of independence for Spanish America had existed for several years among a minority of the residents of northern South America. In 1797 the Venezuelans [[Manuel Gual]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espa\u00f1a]], inspired by exiled Spaniard Juan Bautista Picornell, unsuccessfully attempted to  establish a [[republic]] in [[Captaincy General of Venezuela|Venezuela]] with greater social equality for Venezuelans of all racial and social backgrounds. Nine years later, in 1806 long-time Venezuelan [[expatriate]] [[Francisco de Miranda]] led a small group of mostly British and American foreign volunteers in an attempt to take over Venezuela and set up an independent republic. Like Gual and Espa\u00f1a's conspiracy, Miranda's [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|putsch]] failed to attract Venezuelans of any social and economic class, in fact local Venezuelans organized the resistance to Miranda's invasion and quickly dispersed it. The lack of interest on the part of the Venezuelan [[Criollo people|Criollos]] is often explained by their fear that the loss of the removal of Spanish control might bring about a revolution that would destroy their own power in Venezuela. Nevertheless, in the decades leading up to 1806, Criollos had often been at odds with the [[Crown of Castile|Spanish Crown]]: they wanted an expansion of the [[free trade]] that was benefiting their plantation economy and objected to the Crown's new policy of granting social privileges that had been traditionally been reserved for whites (''espa\u00f1oles'') to [[Mulatto|Pardos]] through the purchase of certificates of whiteness (''gracias al sacar''). So the Criollos' failure to support Gual, Espa\u00f1a and Miranda, which would have created a state under their control, needs to also be understood by the fact that a national identity separate from the Spanish had not yet emerged among them.\n\nIn neighboring [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] tensions also existed with the Crown but had not evolved into an outright desire for separation. In 1779 the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|Revolt of the Comuneros]] pitted middle-class and rural residents against the royal authorities over the issue of new taxes instituted as part of the [[Bourbon Reforms]]. Although the revolt was stopped and the leaders punished or executed, the uprising did manage to slow down the economic reforms that the Crown had planned for New Granada. In the subsequent decades, a few New Granadans, like [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]], became intrigued by the ideas of the [[French Revolution]] and attempted to promote its values by disseminating translated documents like the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]''. Again, this was a minority and not necessarily a sign that the majority in New Granada did not see themselves as members of the Spanish Monarchy.\n\nThe break with the Crown came in 1808 with the disappearance of a stable government in Spain. The crisis was precipitated by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] removal of Bourbon Dynasty from the throne of Spain (he convinced [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] to abdicate, and his father [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] to renounce any claim to returning to the throne he had abdicated only months earlier) and his [[Peninsular War|invasion of Spain]]. As the entire [[Spanish Empire|Spanish world]] rejected the new Bonaparte Dynasty (Napoleon gave the crown of Spain to his brother, the [[Joseph Bonaparte|King of Naples and Sicily]]), Spain itself fell into chaos and it took almost a year for a coordinated, centralized [[provisional government]] (the  [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom (Spain)|Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies]]) to form. Even then, the rapid and large French advances in the Peninsula seemed to make the idea of a stable government in Spain pointless. By 1810, the Supreme Junta was cornered in the island city of Cadiz during the two-year [[Siege of C\u00e1diz]]. Throughout Spanish America, people felt it was time to take the government into their own hands, if a Spanish world, independent of the French, were to continue to exist at all, and therefore in 1810 juntas were set up throughout the Americas, including in Caracas and [[Patria Boba|Bogot\u00e1]],  just as they had been in Spain two years earlier.<ref>Lynch, ''Bol\u00edvar: A Life'', 44-48; Madariaga, 108-116; and Masur (1969), 62-65.</ref>\n\n==Service under the First Republic (1810-1812)==\n{{Main|First Republic of Venezuela}}\n\nIn 1809 a twenty-six-year-old Bol\u00edvar had retreated to his estate in the [[Aragua|Valleys of Aragua]], refusing to openly participate in calls for the establishment of a Venezuelan junta, because the plans did not consider the option of independence. He was still in his country estates when a junta was successfully established on April 19, 1810. The new Junta of Caracas chose him to be part of a delegation to the United Kingdom to seek British aid. The delegation did not have much success, but Bol\u00edvar did return in December 1810 with [[Francisco de Miranda]], who saw an opportunity in the political turmoil to return to Venezuela.\n\n===Independence declared===\n[[Civil war]] broke out between the provinces of Venezuela that recognized the Caracas Junta and those that still recognized the Regency in Spain that had replaced the Supreme Central Junta. The situation became more tense when a congress, called by the Caracas Junta, [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] on July 5, 1811, sparking rebellions in favor of the Regency and [[C\u00e1diz Cortes]] in [[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]]. Bol\u00edvar's first military service was as an officer under Miranda's command in the units created to put down this revolt. Bol\u00edvar was promoted to [[colonel]] and made [[commandant]] of [[Puerto Cabello]] the following year. At the same time that Frigate Captain [[Juan Domingo de Monteverde|Domingo de Monteverde]] was making fast and vast advances into republican territory from the west (his forces had entered Valencia on May 3, 1812), Bol\u00edvar lost control of [[San Felipe Castle]] along with its ammunition stores on June 30, when the royalist prisoners held there managed to take it over and attack the small number of  troops in the city. Deciding that the situation was lost, Bol\u00edvar effectively abandoned his post and retreated to his estate farm in [[San Mateo, Aragua|San Mateo]]. Miranda also saw the republican cause as lost and authorized a capitulation with Monteverde on July 25.<ref>Masur (1969), 98-102; and Lynch, ''Bol\u00edvar: A Life'', 60-63.</ref>\n\n===The royalist restoration===\nThe terms of the [[Capitulation (surrender)|Capitulation]] of San Mateo, which Monteverde approved but which Miranda never came to sign, granted amnesty and the right to emigrate from Venezuela to all republicans, if they chose to do so. Nevertheless, there was great confusion among the republicans as to what the treaty actually contained or if Monteverde would keep his word. It was in this uncertain environment that Miranda chose to abandon the country before Monteverde occupied Caracas. In the early morning of August 1, Miranda was sleeping in the house of the commandant of [[La Guaira]], Colonel Manuel Mar\u00eda Casas, when he was awakened by Casas, Bol\u00edvar, Miguel Pe\u00f1a and four other soldiers, who promptly arrested Miranda for [[treason]] to the Republic and turned him over to Monteverde. For his apparent services to the royalist cause, Monteverde granted Bol\u00edvar a passport, and Bol\u00edvar left for [[Cura\u00e7ao]] on August 27.\n\n==Exile and the Second Republic (1812-1814)==\n{{Main|Patria Boba|Second Republic of Venezuela}}\n\nIn Cura\u00e7ao Bol\u00edvar learned that Monteverde had broken the promises given in the Capitulation of San Mateo. Many of the republicans who had stayed behind were arrested and the property of many republicans, both in Venezuela and in exile, were [[Confiscation|confiscated]] to make up for the large deficits the government faced. Bol\u00edvar decided to rejoin the patriot cause and made his way to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]], which had established itself as an independent republic on November 11, 1811 (in reaction as much to events in Spain as to attempts by the junta in Bogot\u00e1 to control it) and joined a few days later in a confederation with four other provinces, the [[United Provinces of New Granada]]. In the weeks before arriving in Cartagena in October 1812, Bol\u00edvar began to analyze the collapse of the Venezuelan republic and published his thoughts in December in his [[Cartagena Manifesto]]. In the document Bol\u00edvar blamed the failure on the federal nature of the Venezuelan republic, which had allowed provinces to ignore the needs of other provinces threatened by Monteverde's advance, and the intransigence of the Venezuelan population to the republican cause, among other things. He saw the Venezuelan case as a warning to the divided New Granada and urged it to retake Caracas from the royalists. He enlisted as an officer in the army of the New Granadan Union and led forces in the [[Magdalena Campaign]] against cities in the lower [[Magdalena River]] that had refused to accept Cartagena's authority or that of the Union, and then attacked [[Oca\u00f1a, Norte de Santander|Oca\u00f1a]]. His success in these operations convinced the congress of the Union to authorize his plans to invade Venezuela in May 1813, and thus began his [[Admirable Campaign]].\n\nHis reentry into Venezuela marked a new, more violent phase of the wars of independence. Monteverde's troops had already carried out [[Laws of war|atrocities]]: he had allowed his soldiers to loot many of the cities he occupied and several of his commanders became notorious for torturing and killing civilians suspected of collaborating with the Republic. Bol\u00edvar also faced the fact that by 1813 much of the older aristocrats, who had led the republic, had abandoned the cause of independence, and the general population had turned against republicanism even before its collapse. In order to drive a wedge between Venezuelans and [[Peninsulares]], Bol\u00edvar's instituted a policy of [[no quarter]] in his [[Decree of War to the Death]], in which he promised to kill any Peninsular who did not actively support his efforts to restore independence and to spare any [[Criollo people|American]] even if they actively collaborated with Monteverde or the royalists.<ref>Lynch, ''Bol\u00edvar: A Life'', 70-75; and Masur (1969), 122-127.</ref>\n\n===The Republic restored and lost===\n[[File:Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, 1816.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|Portrait of Bol\u00edvar made in Haiti in 1816.]]\nBol\u00edvar's push towards Caracas was aided by the fact that the general population, which had welcomed Monteverde a year earlier, had become disillusioned by his failure to implement the terms of the San Mateo Capitulation or the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], which the capitulation promised. Monteverde also faced attacks on two fronts, since [[Santiago Mari\u00f1o]] had already opened a front on the east in January 1813. Bol\u00edvar's forces easily defeated the overtaxed and underpaid royalist army in a series of battles, entered [[Caracas]] on August 6, 1813, and laid siege to Monteverde, who had retreated to Puerto Cabello. In Caracas Bol\u00edvar announced the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic, but placed himself at the head of a [[Military junta|military government]], since the situation did not allow for the restoration of the old authorities or new elections. Bol\u00edvar would base his subsequent and enduring claim to be the sole head of the Venezuelan republic and [[commander-in-chief]] of its forces on this accomplishment, although even at this time he was not universally acknowledged as head of the state or the republican forces. Mari\u00f1o, based in [[Cuman\u00e1]], did not recognize Bol\u00edvar's claim, but did collaborate with him militarily. Reprisals were carried out against [[Peninsulares|Peninsular]] royalists that were captured. It was during this period that the republican city fathers of Caracas, following the example of [[M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida]], granted Bol\u00edvar the title of [[Title of honor|Liberator]] and office of [[captain general]] in the [[Iglesia de San Francisco (Caracas)|Church of San Francisco]] (the more appropriate site, the [[Caracas Cathedral|Cathedral of Caracas]], was still damaged from the [[1812 Caracas earthquake|1812 earthquake]]).\n\nBol\u00edvar and Mari\u00f1o's success, like Monteverde's a year earlier, was short-lived. The new Republic failed to convince the common people that it was not a tool of the urban elite. Lower-class people, especially the southern, rural ''[[llanero]]s'' (cowboys), flocked to the royalist cause. ''Llaneros'' played a key military role in the region's struggle. Turning the tide against independence, these highly mobile, ferocious fighters made up a formidable military force that pushed Bol\u00edvar out of his home country once more. By 1814, the regular royalist army headed by Governor and Captain General [[Juan Manuel Cajigal]] was overshadowed by a large, irregular force of ''llaneros'' recruited and led by [[Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Boves]]. With the royalist irregulars displaying the same passion and violence that Bol\u00edvar had demonstrated in his \"war to the death\" decree, the republicans suffered their first major setback at the Battle of [[La Puerta]] on June 15, 1814, and Boves took Caracas on July 16. The republicans and Criollo royalists in Caracas, who also feared Boves's ''llanero'' hoards, had to flee en masse to Mari\u00f1o's strongholds in the east. The combined forces of Mari\u00f1o's and Bol\u00edvar were defeated again at [[Aragua de Barcelona]] on August 18, at a cost of 2,000 royalist casualties of the 10,000 troops they fielded, most of the 3,000 combatants in the republican army, in addition to many civilian casualties. Due to their series of repeated reverses both Bol\u00edvar and Mari\u00f1o were arrested and removed from power by [[Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Ribas]] and [[Manuel Piar]], each representing the two republican [[Command (military formation)|commands]] then in place in Venezuela. A few days later Ribas and Piar decided not to try them and instead released them into exile. On September 8, Bol\u00edvar and Mari\u00f1o set sail for Cartagena de Indias, leaving Piar and Ribas to lead the increasingly encircled republicans.\n\n===Royalist control consolidated===\n{{Main|Spanish reconquest of New Granada}}\nEarlier in March 1814, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] had returned to the throne. The [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]]'s advances made it impossible for Napoleon to continue holding Ferdinand or fighting in Spain. Once in Spain, however, Ferdinand was not pleased by the revolution in government that had been undertaken in his name, and by May he had abolished the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] and began persecuting and arresting the liberals responsible for its creation. To deal with the Americas, Ferdinand organized the largest expeditionary force that Spain ever sent to the Americas up to that time. Colonel [[Pablo Morillo]], a veteran of the Spanish struggle against the French was chosen as its commander. The expeditionary force was made up of approximately 10,000 men and nearly sixty ships. Originally, they were to head for [[Montevideo]] in the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], another region that had fallen out of royalist control, but soon it was decided to send these forces to the Venezuela and New Granada, where the war had become exceedingly savage. Realizing that this change in plans would not go over well with the soldiers, the news was kept from them until they were at sea. When the expeditionary force arrived in Venezuela, it found that most of it had been restored to royalist control, save for [[Isla Margarita|Margarita Island]], which surrendered to it with no blood shed. With Venezuela pacified, plans were quickly made to subdue neighboring New Granada, and the bulk of the troops moved to the coastal city of [[Santa Marta]], which had remained in royalist hands since 1810.\n\n==Second exile in New Granada and the Caribbean (1814-1816)==\nLike many other Venezuelan republicans who fled to New Granada after the second wave of royalist victories, Bol\u00edvar once again entered into the service of the [[United Provinces of New Granada|United Provinces]] and fought against cities that had refused to acknowledge its authority. His forces took Bogot\u00e1 on December 12, 1814, after an eight-month-long war, and was promoted to captain general for his efforts. He was then given the task of capturing the royalist stronghold, Santa Marta, but Cartagena, the obvious base from which to launch this offensive, refused to give him the necessary soldiers and supplies, so infighting broke out. As Santa Martan forces gained ground against the divided republicans in northern New Granada, Bol\u00edvar left for [[Jamaica]] on May 8, 1815. Cartagena would fall to Morillo in December 1815 and Bogot\u00e1 in May of the following year.\n\n===Aid from the Haitian Republic and Cura\u00e7ao===\n[[File:Soublette, Brice\u00f1o M\u00e9ndez, Zea, Mac Gregor and Bri\u00f3n.jpg|300 px|thumb|right|Soublette, Pedro Brice\u00f1o M\u00e9ndez, [[Francisco Antonio Zea]], [[Gregor MacGregor]] and Bri\u00f3n in Ocumare. 19th century illustration by Carmelo Fern\u00e1ndez.]]\nNow thirty-two years of age, he found himself in exile for the second time. In Jamaica, Bol\u00edvar once again issued a manifesto explaining his view of the failure of the republican cause in Venezuela. His famous [[Carta de Jamaica|Letter from Jamaica]], though ostensibly written to one man, was an appeal to Great Britain specifically and the European powers in general to aid the cause of Spanish American independence, but it found no significant response. So he turned to the small and isolated republic of [[Haiti]], that had freed itself from French rule, but being composed of mostly former slaves, received little aid from either the United States or Europe. Bol\u00edvar and other Venezuelan and New Granadan exiles were warmly received by the Haitian president [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]]. The growing exile community would receive money, volunteers and weapons from the Haitian president enabling them to resume plans to continue the struggle for independence. There was debate, however, over who should be in charge, but his ability to win over P\u00e9tion and a Cura\u00e7aoan sea merchant, [[Luis Bri\u00f3n]] (he is traditionally referred to by the Spanish form of his name), who had just acquired a much-needed warship in England to aid the embattled Cartagenan Republic, forced the other Venezuelan leaders to grudgingly accept his leadership. P\u00e9tion, for his part, convinced Bol\u00edvar to expand the fight for independence to include the liberation of slaves.\n\nThe \u00e9migr\u00e9s successfully captured a [[beachhead]] at  Los Cayos on March 31, 1816. Bol\u00edvar proclaimed the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic and in two [[decree]]s of June 2 and July 16 declared the freedom of slaves conditional on their joining the republican forces. Shortly thereafter, Margarita Island, safely separated by water from Morillo's forces, rejoined the republican cause and became a second base of operations. Operating under the command of [[Santiago Mari\u00f1o|Mari\u00f1o]], [[Manuel Piar|Piar]] and [[Carlos Soublette]] the republican expeditionaries captured more coastal towns. On July 14 Bol\u00edvar led an assault against [[Ocumare de la Costa de Oro Municipality|Ocumare de la Costa]], which ended in a debacle in which Bol\u00edvar abandoned Mari\u00f1o, Piar and the rest of his forces, and fled by sea. Piar's forces managed to fight their way from the Caribbean coast to the southern [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]], where the vast and underpopulated terrain and the forces forming under [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez]] protected them from the royalist army. Mari\u00f1o retreated to his home province of Cuman\u00e1, where he could rely on personal connections to maintain a base of operations. After failing to find support along the coast, Bol\u00edvar returned to Haiti. In the intervening months the divided republican leaders unable to agree on a single leader, decided to compromise and in October offered Bol\u00edvar the military command, with the understanding that a separate civilian government would be formed.  In Haiti Bol\u00edvar gathered new supplies and organized a second expedition, named by history as the Jacmel Expedition for the city from which it departed, and on December 31, 1816, landed in [[Barcelona, Anzo\u00e1tegui|Barcelona]] controlled by Mari\u00f1o, who by this point barely accepted Bol\u00edvar as head of the republicans.\n\n==The Third Republic (1817-1820)==\n[[File:Correo del Orinoco 1818 000.jpg|thumb|200px|right|First issue of the ''Correo del Orinoco'', June 27, 1818.]]\nBol\u00edvar took the forces he brought from Haiti to the Orinoco region, which was mostly controlled by Piar. Piar was making headway against the royalists of [[Ciudad Bol\u00edvar|Angostura]], and was preparing to lay siege to the city. The siege proved difficult and long, since Angostura had a lifeline in the river itself. Bol\u00edvar's reinforcements were useful and the city fell in August 1817.<ref>Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions'', 210-211.</ref> Angostura proved to be an immensely valuable base. From it the republicans had access to foreign trade in Caribbean and beyond via the Orinoco. The river's tributaries also provided access to the Venezuelan and New Granadan Llanos to the west, especially those in [[Casanare Department|Casanare]], where refugees from Morillo's troops had organized themselves under [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]. In Angostura Bol\u00edvar began publishing the ''Correo del Orinoco'' newspaper, an official organ of the revolutionaries, which was circulated not only in Venezuela, but in the Caribbean and in Europe. Under P\u00e1ez and Piar, the republican armies had begun to recruit the local ''llaneros'' who, after Morillo disbanded Boves's informal units, no longer had an outlet for quick enrichment and social advancement under the royalist banner. This, however, posed the challenge to the Criollo republican leaders of channeling the ''llanero's'' energy, while not re-igniting the race war that had occurred under Boves. In this environment leaders like Piar, who in recent years had begun to emphasize his [[Mulatto|Pardo]] roots as he built a Pardo and ''llanero'' following, became suspect, and this weakness proved useful to Bol\u00edvar, when the moment came to reassert his position as head of the nascent republic.\n\n===Challenges to Bol\u00edvar's authority===\nThe first overt challenge to his rule came with the meeting of the \"Congresillo of [[Sucre (state)|Cariaco]]\" on May 8 and 9 under the auspices of [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Jos\u00e9 Cort\u00e9s de Madariaga\u2014who had been a member of the Junta of Caracas and had just returned to Venezuela after being imprisoned in Spain\u2014Luis Bri\u00f3n and Santiago Mari\u00f1o. The eight-member Congress proposed to restore the 1811 Constitution and establish a permanent government that could negotiate a recognition by  other nations. Mari\u00f1o offered his and Bol\u00edvar's resignation in order to allow the Congress to elect a new executive. The Congress restored the [[triumvirate]] and selected Fernando Rodr\u00edguez del Toro (who was at the moment exiled in [[Trinidad]]), Francisco Javier Mayz (one of the eight deputies of the Congress) and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar as the new triumvirate. To replace in an interim manner the two who were not present, the Congress chose Francisco Antonio Zea and Canon Cort\u00e9s de Madariaga. It made Mari\u00f1o general-in-chief of the republican forces and established [[La Asunci\u00f3n]] as the temporary capital of the Republic. It sent word to Bol\u00edvar to present himself as soon as military conditions permitted to take his place in the triumvirate. Less than a month later, Rafael Urdaneta and [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], who remained loyal to Bol\u00edvar, lead a group of officers that forced the triumvirate to dissolve itself. By June, Bol\u00edvar, aware of its rise and fall, compared its existence to \"[[Cassava|cassava bread]] in hot soup\" and noted that at the moment in Venezuela only those who could command by force could truly do so.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Luis Salcedo-Bastardo, \"Congreso de Cariaco\" in ''Diccionario de Historia de Venezuela'', Vol. 1. Caracas: Fundaci\u00f3n Polar, 1999. {{ISBN|980-6397-37-1}}</ref>\n\nIt was clear to Bol\u00edvar by mid-1817 that he need to set a clear example that he would not tolerate challenges to his leadership. After the fall of Angostura Piar had become upset at Bol\u00edvar's leadership and decided to leave the area. He requested a passport from Bol\u00edvar, which he granted. Piar had begun to leave the area, when Bol\u00edvar changed his mind and accused Piar of plotting to kill all whites in the area and setting up a black and Mulatto republic (a ''pardocracia'') in imitation of Haiti. Piar was tracked down, [[court-martial]]ed and found guilty. On October 16 he was executed. Although Piar's crime had ostensibly been fomenting racial hatred, it was understood that his true crime had been not recognizing Bol\u00edvar authority. After Piar's execution, Mari\u00f1o, whom Bol\u00edvar's confidant and chronicler [[Daniel Florence O'Leary|Daniel Florencio O'Leary]] later admitted had been more guilty of insubordination than Piar, fell in line and dropped any other pretensions to an independent leadership.<ref>Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions'', 210-213.</ref>\n\nHis political position secured, Bol\u00edvar began to expand the scope of his military activity. He met with P\u00e1ez for the first time in January 1818, who accepted Bol\u00edvar as head of the republicans. P\u00e1ez, however, refused to take his powerful ''llanero'' cavalry outside of the Llanos, where they were extremely effective in holding off and defeating Morillo's formal army. Bol\u00edvar was, therefore, left alone in a mid-year attempt to take Caracas, which failed. Nevertheless, by the end of the year, the republicans were secure enough in southern Venezuela, that Bol\u00edvar felt it was time to convene a new Venezuelan congress to give the republican government a permanent form. Elections were held in republican areas and to pick representatives of the provinces of Venezuela and New Granada under royalist control, among the troops of those areas. The [[Congress of Angostura]], consisting of twenty-six delegates, began holding sessions in February 1819. The highlight of the opening session was Bol\u00edvar's \"[[Address at the Congress of Angostura]]\", now seen along with his \"Cartagena Manifesto\" and \"Jamaica Letter\" as a foundational exposition of his political thought. The same day the Congress elected Bol\u00edvar president of the Republic and ratified his command of its armies.\n\n===The New Granada Campaign===\n{{See also|Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada}}\nAfter the opening of the Congress, Bol\u00edvar conceived of a daring, yet risky, plan of attacking New Granada which had been a Spanish stronghold for the past three years. If he could liberate New Granada he would have a whole new base from which to operate against Morillo. Central New Granada held great promise since, unlike Venezuela, it had only been recently conquered by Morillo and it had a prior six-year experience of independent government. Royalist sentiment was not strong. But it would be hard to take the initiative against the better prepared and supplied royalist army. To surprise it, Bol\u00edvar decided to move during the Venezuelan ''invierno'', the [[wet season|rainy season]], when the Llanos flooded up to a meter and the campaign season ended. Morillo's forces would be evacuated from the Llanos for months and no one would anticipate that Bol\u00edvar's troops would be on the move. This decision, however, would mean literally wading in waist-deep, [[malaria]]l water for days before attempting to scale the Andes. Understandably the plan received little support from the Congress or even from the master of the Llanos himself, P\u00e1ez. With only the forces he and Santander had recruited in the [[Apure River|Apure]] and [[Meta River]] regions, Bol\u00edvar set off in June 1819.\n\n[[File:Bolivar's troops in the Cordillera Oriental.jpg|thumb|Bol\u00edvar's troops cross the Cordillera Oriental]]\nThe small army consisted of about 2,500 men: 1,300 infantry and 800 cavalry, including a [[British Legions|British legion]]. It took a route that went from the hot and humid, flood-swept plains of Colombia to the icy mountain pass of the [[P\u00e1ramo]] de [[Pisba, Boyac\u00e1|Pisba]], at an altitude of 3,960 meters (13,000 feet), through the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]]. After the hardships of wading through a virtual sea, the mostly ''llanero'' army scaled the mountains poorly clothed and ill-prepared for the cold and altitude of the mountains. On both legs of the trip many became ill or died. Despite some intelligence that Bol\u00edvar was on the move, the Spanish considered the route impassable, and therefore, they were taken by surprise when Bol\u00edvar's small army emerged from the mountains on July 5. In a series of battles under the auspices of [[Francisco Mari\u00f1o y Soler]] the republican army cleared its way to [[Bogot\u00e1]]. First at the [[Vargas Swamp Battle|Battle of Vargas Swamp]] on July 25, Bol\u00edvar intercepted a royalist force attempting to reach the poorly defended capital. Then at the [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1]] on August 7, the bulk of the royalist army surrendered to Bol\u00edvar.  On receiving the news, the viceroy, [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de S\u00e1mano y Uribarri|Juan Jos\u00e9 de S\u00e1mano]], and the rest of royalist government fled the capital so fast that they left behind the treasury, an incredible coup for Bol\u00edvar and Santander. On August 10 Bol\u00edvar's army entered Bogot\u00e1.\n\nWith New Granada secure under Santander's control, Bol\u00edvar could return to Venezuela in a position of unprecedented military, political and financial strength. In his absence the Congress had flirted with deposing him, assuming that he would meet his death in New Granada. The vice-president Francisco Antonio Zea was deposed and replaced by Juan Bautista Arismendi. All this was quickly reversed when word got to the Congress of Bol\u00edvar's success. By year's end Bol\u00edvar presented himself before the Congress and asked it to decree the union of Venezuela and New Granada in a new state, [[Gran Colombia|Colombia]]. It did so on December 17 and elected him president of the new country. The Constitution that the Congress had just written for Venezuela became null and void and a new congress was set to convene within two years.\n\n==President and Commander-in-Chief of Gran Colombia (1820-1825)==\n{{See also|Gran Colombia}}\n[[File:Plaza armisticio 2005.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Monument to the meeting between Morillo and Bol\u00edvar in Santa Ana de Trujillo.]]\n1820 proved to be a banner year for Bol\u00edvar. His dream of creating a new nation was becoming a reality. Morillo no longer had the upper hand militarily and by late March reports began to arrive about the success of the [[Rafael del Riego|Riego Revolt]]. The revolt meant that the reinforcements that Morillo's expeditionary force desperately needed would not be coming. Moreover, in June the official orders to reinstate the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|C\u00e1diz Constitution]] arrived and were implemented. The new Constitutional government in Spain radically changed policy towards the rebellions in America. It assumed that the revolutionaries, as liberals, were either fighting for, or could be co-opted by, the Spanish Constitution. Although this might have been true in parts of Spanish America at the start of the decade, by 1820 most Spanish Americans did not trust Fernando VII to keep his oath to the Constitution for long. More importantly, it had always been Bol\u00edvar's stance that the wars were between two sovereign states, and therefore, the question of reconciling with the Spanish Monarchy under the 1812 Constitution was never a consideration.<ref>Earle, Rebecca A. ''Spain and the Independence of Colombia, 1810-1825''. Exeter, University of Exeter Press, 2000, 153. {{ISBN|0-85989-612-9}}</ref>\n\nDespite this, Morillo continued with negotiations and focused on getting a [[ceasefire]] and bringing the war in line with the [[Jus gentium|law of nations]]. This was achieved in two treaties signed on November 25 and 26 in [[Trujillo (state)|Santa Ana de Trujillo]], which established a six-month cessation of hostilities and regularized the [[rules of engagement]]. The negotiations were also important because the Spanish government for the first time tacitly granted Colombia national status, rather than seeing its representatives as mere rebels. Spain did not of course recognize Colombia, but the negotiations papers referred to it as such, rather than with the previous denominations of \"Bol\u00edvar's forces\" or \"the Congress at Angostura.\"<ref>Earle, ''Spain and the Independence of Colombia'', 154-159.</ref> The ceasefire allowed Bol\u00edvar to build up his army for the final showdown everyone knew was coming. By the end of the year, the Constitutional government granted Morillo his long-standing request to resign and he left South America. He was replaced by [[Miguel de la Torre]].\n\n===Victory in Venezuela===\n{{Main|Battle of Carabobo}}\nThe truce did not last all six months. On January 28 the ''[[cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'' of [[Maracaibo]], which had been in secret negotiations with the republicans aided by native son [[Rafael Urdaneta]], declared the province an independent republic, which chose to join Colombia. La Torre took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed, when Bol\u00edvar returned to Venezuela in April 1821, leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on June 24, the Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela, save for [[Puerto Cabello]] and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Hostilities continued until the surrender of Puerto Cabello in 1823, but the main front of the war now moved to southern New Granada and Quito.\n\n===The Southern Campaign, Quito and Peru (1821-1824)===\n{{Main|Ecuadorian War of Independence|Peruvian War of Independence}}\n\n[[File:La Victoria de Jun\u00edn - J.J. Olmedo..jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Allegory]] of Bol\u00edvar's liberation of ''Colombia'' in a book of poetry by [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo]].]]\nWith the Spanish Monarchy collapsing in South America and the uncertainty of constitutional rule in Spain, provinces of the [[Royal Audience of Quito|Presidency of Quito]] began to declare independence. In October 1820 a coup in [[Guayaquil]] set up a junta, which declared Guayaquil a republic. [[Portoviejo]] and [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]] followed suit in the next few weeks. [[Quito]] remained in royalist control under the Audiencia President, Field Marshal [[Melchior Aymerich]], and by January 1821 had defeated the forces sent by Guayaquil against it. Bol\u00edvar was determined to ensure that the Presidency of Quito become part of Gran Colombia and not remain a collection of small, divided republics. To this end, Colombian aid in the form of supplies and an army under [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] began to arrive in Guayaquil in February. Throughout 1821 Sucre was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides were exhausted and signed a 90-day armistice. The following year, at [[Battle of Pichincha]] on May 24, 1822, Sucre's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito. The territory of New Granada was secure. From [[Puerto Cabello]] royalist make a counterattack at [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]]. However the main focus now became neutralizing the royalist Army in Peru.\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] had already made incursions into Peru starting in 1820. He had been declared Protector of Peruvian Freedom, in August 1821 after liberating parts of the country, but the important cities and provinces still remained royalist. Bol\u00edvar and San Mart\u00edn held a [[Guayaquil conference|meeting in Guayaquil]] on July 26 and  27, 1822, in which they discussed plans to liberate Peru and it was decided that Bol\u00edvar and Gran Colombia would take over the task of fully liberating Peru. San Mart\u00edn departed from the scene. For the next two years Colombian and Peruvian patriot forces gain more territory. On February 10, 1824, Bol\u00edvar was given immense political powers when a Peruvian congress named him dictator of Peru, which made Bol\u00edvar the head of state of a second country and allowed Bol\u00edvar to completely reorganize the political and military administration of Peru. Bol\u00edvar, assisted by Sucre, decisively defeated the remnants of the royalist cavalry on August 6, 1824, at the [[Battle of Jun\u00edn]]. Sucre then destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the royalist army at [[Battle of Ayacucho]] on December 9. South American independence was now all but secured. The only royalist area in the continent was highland country of [[Upper Peru]], [[El Callao]] and [[Chilo\u00e9]].\n\n===The Peruvian and Colombian campaign in Upper Peru===\n''For details, see [[Bolivian War of Independence]]''\n\nBol\u00edvar was now president of both Gran Colombia and Peru and had been granted extraordinary powers by the legislatures of both countries to carry out the war against the Spanish Monarchy. Since Bol\u00edvar was tied up with the administration of Quito and Peru, the liberation of Upper Peru fell to Sucre and [[Francisco Burdett O'Connor|O'Connor]], and within a year in April 1825, the task had been completed. A congress of Upper Peru on August 6, 1825, chose to name the new nation after the Liberator and called it the Republic of Bol\u00edvar. (The name would later be changed to Bolivia.) With independence secured for all of Spanish South America, Bol\u00edvar's political life entered a new phase. He now had to turn to consolidating the large nations he had created out of the former Spanish provinces. And dissension began to brew in the north as the regions of Gran Colombia began to chafe under the centralized government.\n\n==The dissolution of Gran Colombia and aftermath==\n[[File:Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar - Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espinosa, 1830.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sketch of Bol\u00edvar at age 47 made from life by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espinosa in 1830.]]\n\nDuring 1826, internal divisions had sparked dissent throughout the nation and regional uprisings erupted in Venezuela, and Gran Colombia appeared to be on the verge of collapse. An amnesty was declared and an arrangement was reached with the Venezuelan rebels, but political dissent appeared in New Granada as a consequence of this. In an attempt to keep the nation together, Bol\u00edvar called for a constitutional convention at [[Oca\u00f1a, Norte de Santander|Oca\u00f1a]] to be held in April 1828. To prevent the splintering of Gran Colombia, Bol\u00edvar proposed to introduce an even more centralist model of government, including some or all of the elements he had been able to place in the Bolivian constitution: a [[President for Life|lifetime presidency]] with the ability to select a successor, and a hereditary third chamber of the legislature. These proposals were deemed anti-liberal and met with strong opposition, including from a faction forming around Santander, who by now was openly opposed to Bol\u00edvar politically.\n\nThe [[Convention of Oca\u00f1a]] (April 9 to June 10, 1828) met under a cloud. Many felt that the breakup of the country was imminent. Addressing these fears, the Congress went in the opposite direction that Bol\u00edvar had hoped, and drafted a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government with greatly reduced the powers for the central administration. Unhappy with this outcome, pro-Bol\u00edvar delegates left the convention and the constitution was never ratified.\n\nAfter the failure of the convention, Bol\u00edvar proclaimed himself dictator on August 27, 1828, through an [[Organic law|Organic]] [[Decree]] of Dictatorship. He considered this as a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, though it only increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents. On September 25, 1828 an attempt to assassinate Bol\u00edvar failed, but it illustrated the tense political atmosphere in Gran Colombia. Although Bol\u00edvar emerged physically intact from the event, he was, nevertheless, greatly affected. Dissent continued, and new uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela and Quito during the next two years. Gran Colombia finally collapsed in 1830. Bol\u00edvar himself died in the same year at age 47 on December 17. His closest political ally at the time, Sucre, who was intending to retire from public life, had been murdered earlier on June 4, 1830.\n\nBol\u00edvar's legacy continued in the [[Succession of states|successor states]] to Gran Colombia. Many of the officers who had fought by him were not only involved in the revolts that led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia, but continued to play important political and military roles in the decades and wars that followed. Bol\u00edvar's political thought\u2014his emphasis on a strong, centralized government\u2014became the basis of conservative thought in nineteenth-century South America.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spain|Latin America|War}}\n*[[Libertadores]]\n*[[Spanish American wars of independence]]\n*[[Latin American integration]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Lynch, John.

Given the unstable political climate during these years, Bol\u00edvar and other patriot leaders, such as [[Santiago Mari\u00f1o]], [[Manuel Piar]], [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Berm\u00fadez]] and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] often had to go into exile in the [[Caribbean]] or nearby areas of Spanish America that at the moment were controlled by those favoring independence, and from there, carry on the struggle. These wars resulted in the creation of several South American states out of the former [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies]], the currently existing [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], and the now defunct [[Gran Colombia]].\n\nIn his 21-year career, Bol\u00edvar faced two main challenges. First was gaining acceptance as undisputed leader of the republican cause. Despite claiming such a role since 1813, he began to achieve this only in 1817, and consolidated his hold on power after his dramatic and unexpected victory in New Granada in 1819. His second challenge was implementing a vision of unifying the region into one large state, which he believed (and most would agree, correctly) would be the only guarantee of maintaining American independence from the Spanish in northern South America. His early experiences under the [[First Republic of Venezuela|First Venezuelan Republic]] and in [[Patria Boba|New Granada]] convinced him that divisions among republicans, augmented by federal forms of government, only allowed [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Spanish American royalists]] to eventually gain the upper hand. Once again, it was his victory in 1819 that gave him the leverage to bring about the creation of a unified state, Gran Colombia, with which to oppose the [[Monarchy|Spanish Monarchy]] on the continent.\n\n==Historical background==\n[[File:Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, 1804.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Miniature portrait of Bol\u00edvar at about age 21 made in Paris, circa 1804.]]\n{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence}}\nThe idea of independence for Spanish America had existed for several years among a minority of the residents of northern South America. In 1797 the Venezuelans [[Manuel Gual]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espa\u00f1a]], inspired by exiled Spaniard Juan Bautista Picornell, unsuccessfully attempted to  establish a [[republic]] in [[Captaincy General of Venezuela|Venezuela]] with greater social equality for Venezuelans of all racial and social backgrounds. Nine years later, in 1806 long-time Venezuelan [[expatriate]] [[Francisco de Miranda]] led a small group of mostly British and American foreign volunteers in an attempt to take over Venezuela and set up an independent republic. Like Gual and Espa\u00f1a's conspiracy, Miranda's [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|putsch]] failed to attract Venezuelans of any social and economic class, in fact local Venezuelans organized the resistance to Miranda's invasion and quickly dispersed it. The lack of interest on the part of the Venezuelan [[Criollo people|Criollos]] is often explained by their fear that the loss of the removal of Spanish control might bring about a revolution that would destroy their own power in Venezuela. Nevertheless, in the decades leading up to 1806, Criollos had often been at odds with the [[Crown of Castile|Spanish Crown]]: they wanted an expansion of the [[free trade]] that was benefiting their plantation economy and objected to the Crown's new policy of granting social privileges that had been traditionally been reserved for whites (''espa\u00f1oles'') to [[Mulatto|Pardos]] through the purchase of certificates of whiteness (''gracias al sacar''). So the Criollos' failure to support Gual, Espa\u00f1a and Miranda, which would have created a state under their control, needs to also be understood by the fact that a national identity separate from the Spanish had not yet emerged among them.\n\nIn neighboring [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] tensions also existed with the Crown but had not evolved into an outright desire for separation. In 1779 the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|Revolt of the Comuneros]] pitted middle-class and rural residents against the royal authorities over the issue of new taxes instituted as part of the [[Bourbon Reforms]]. Although the revolt was stopped and the leaders punished or executed, the uprising did manage to slow down the economic reforms that the Crown had planned for New Granada. In the subsequent decades, a few New Granadans, like [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]], became intrigued by the ideas of the [[French Revolution]] and attempted to promote its values by disseminating translated documents like the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]''. Again, this was a minority and not necessarily a sign that the majority in New Granada did not see themselves as members of the Spanish Monarchy.\n\nThe break with the Crown came in 1808 with the disappearance of a stable government in Spain. The crisis was precipitated by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] removal of Bourbon Dynasty from the throne of Spain (he convinced [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] to abdicate, and his father [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] to renounce any claim to returning to the throne he had abdicated only months earlier) and his [[Peninsular War|invasion of Spain]]. As the entire [[Spanish Empire|Spanish world]] rejected the new Bonaparte Dynasty (Napoleon gave the crown of Spain to his brother, the [[Joseph Bonaparte|King of Naples and Sicily]]), Spain itself fell into chaos and it took almost a year for a coordinated, centralized [[provisional government]] (the  [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom (Spain)|Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies]]) to form. Even then, the rapid and large French advances in the Peninsula seemed to make the idea of a stable government in Spain pointless. By 1810, the Supreme Junta was cornered in the island city of Cadiz during the two-year [[Siege of C\u00e1diz]]. Throughout Spanish America, people felt it was time to take the government into their own hands, if a Spanish world, independent of the French, were to continue to exist at all, and therefore in 1810 juntas were set up throughout the Americas, including in Caracas and [[Patria Boba|Bogot\u00e1]],  just as they had been in Spain two years earlier.<ref>Lynch, ''Bol\u00edvar: A Life'', 44-48; Madariaga, 108-116; and Masur (1969), 62-65.</ref>\n\n==Service under the First Republic (1810-1812)==\n{{Main|First Republic of Venezuela}}\n\nIn 1809 a twenty-six-year-old Bol\u00edvar had retreated to his estate in the [[Aragua|Valleys of Aragua]], refusing to openly participate in calls for the establishment of a Venezuelan junta, because the plans did not consider the option of independence. He was still in his country estates when a junta was successfully established on April 19, 1810. The new Junta of Caracas chose him to be part of a delegation to the United Kingdom to seek British aid. The delegation did not have much success, but Bol\u00edvar did return in December 1810 with [[Francisco de Miranda]], who saw an opportunity in the political turmoil to return to Venezuela.\n\n===Independence declared===\n[[Civil war]] broke out between the provinces of Venezuela that recognized the Caracas Junta and those that still recognized the Regency in Spain that had replaced the Supreme Central Junta. The situation became more tense when a congress, called by the Caracas Junta, [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] on July 5, 1811, sparking rebellions in favor of the Regency and [[C\u00e1diz Cortes]] in [[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]]. Bol\u00edvar's first military service was as an officer under Miranda's command in the units created to put down this revolt. Bol\u00edvar was promoted to [[colonel]] and made [[commandant]] of [[Puerto Cabello]] the following year. At the same time that Frigate Captain [[Juan Domingo de Monteverde|Domingo de Monteverde]] was making fast and vast advances into republican territory from the west (his forces had entered Valencia on May 3, 1812), Bol\u00edvar lost control of [[San Felipe Castle]] along with its ammunition stores on June 30, when the royalist prisoners held there managed to take it over and attack the small number of  troops in the city. Deciding that the situation was lost, Bol\u00edvar effectively abandoned his post and retreated to his estate farm in [[San Mateo, Aragua|San Mateo]]. Miranda also saw the republican cause as lost and authorized a capitulation with Monteverde on July 25.<ref>Masur (1969), 98-102; and Lynch, ''Bol\u00edvar: A Life'', 60-63.</ref>\n\n===The royalist restoration===\nThe terms of the [[Capitulation (surrender)|Capitulation]] of San Mateo, which Monteverde approved but which Miranda never came to sign, granted amnesty and the right to emigrate from Venezuela to all republicans, if they chose to do so. Nevertheless, there was great confusion among the republicans as to what the treaty actually contained or if Monteverde would keep his word. It was in this uncertain environment that Miranda chose to abandon the country before Monteverde occupied Caracas. In the early morning of August 1, Miranda was sleeping in the house of the commandant of [[La Guaira]], Colonel Manuel Mar\u00eda Casas, when he was awakened by Casas, Bol\u00edvar, Miguel Pe\u00f1a and four other soldiers, who promptly arrested Miranda for [[treason]] to the Republic and turned him over to Monteverde. For his apparent services to the royalist cause, Monteverde granted Bol\u00edvar a passport, and Bol\u00edvar left for [[Cura\u00e7ao]] on August 27.\n\n==Exile and the Second Republic (1812-1814)==\n{{Main|Patria Boba|Second Republic of Venezuela}}\n\nIn Cura\u00e7ao Bol\u00edvar learned that Monteverde had broken the promises given in the Capitulation of San Mateo. Many of the republicans who had stayed behind were arrested and the property of many republicans, both in Venezuela and in exile, were [[Confiscation|confiscated]] to make up for the large deficits the government faced. Bol\u00edvar decided to rejoin the patriot cause and made his way to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]], which had established itself as an independent republic on November 11, 1811 (in reaction as much to events in Spain as to attempts by the junta in Bogot\u00e1 to control it) and joined a few days later in a confederation with four other provinces, the [[United Provinces of New Granada]]. In the weeks before arriving in Cartagena in October 1812, Bol\u00edvar began to analyze the collapse of the Venezuelan republic and published his thoughts in December in his [[Cartagena Manifesto]]. In the document Bol\u00edvar blamed the failure on the federal nature of the Venezuelan republic, which had allowed provinces to ignore the needs of other provinces threatened by Monteverde's advance, and the intransigence of the Venezuelan population to the republican cause, among other things. He saw the Venezuelan case as a warning to the divided New Granada and urged it to retake Caracas from the royalists. He enlisted as an officer in the army of the New Granadan Union and led forces in the [[Magdalena Campaign]] against cities in the lower [[Magdalena River]] that had refused to accept Cartagena's authority or that of the Union, and then attacked [[Oca\u00f1a, Norte de Santander|Oca\u00f1a]]. His success in these operations convinced the congress of the Union to authorize his plans to invade Venezuela in May 1813, and thus began his [[Admirable Campaign]].\n\nHis reentry into Venezuela marked a new, more violent phase of the wars of independence. Monteverde's troops had already carried out [[Laws of war|atrocities]]: he had allowed his soldiers to loot many of the cities he occupied and several of his commanders became notorious for torturing and killing civilians suspected of collaborating with the Republic. Bol\u00edvar also faced the fact that by 1813 much of the older aristocrats, who had led the republic, had abandoned the cause of independence, and the general population had turned against republicanism even before its collapse. In order to drive a wedge between Venezuelans and [[Peninsulares]], Bol\u00edvar's instituted a policy of [[no quarter]] in his [[Decree of War to the Death]], in which he promised to kill any Peninsular who did not actively support his efforts to restore independence and to spare any [[Criollo people|American]] even if they actively collaborated with Monteverde or the royalists.<ref>Lynch, ''Bol\u00edvar: A Life'', 70-75; and Masur (1969), 122-127.</ref>\n\n===The Republic restored and lost===\n[[File:Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, 1816.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|Portrait of Bol\u00edvar made in Haiti in 1816.]]\nBol\u00edvar's push towards Caracas was aided by the fact that the general population, which had welcomed Monteverde a year earlier, had become disillusioned by his failure to implement the terms of the San Mateo Capitulation or the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], which the capitulation promised. Monteverde also faced attacks on two fronts, since [[Santiago Mari\u00f1o]] had already opened a front on the east in January 1813. Bol\u00edvar's forces easily defeated the overtaxed and underpaid royalist army in a series of battles, entered [[Caracas]] on August 6, 1813, and laid siege to Monteverde, who had retreated to Puerto Cabello. In Caracas Bol\u00edvar announced the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic, but placed himself at the head of a [[Military junta|military government]], since the situation did not allow for the restoration of the old authorities or new elections. Bol\u00edvar would base his subsequent and enduring claim to be the sole head of the Venezuelan republic and [[commander-in-chief]] of its forces on this accomplishment, although even at this time he was not universally acknowledged as head of the state or the republican forces. Mari\u00f1o, based in [[Cuman\u00e1]], did not recognize Bol\u00edvar's claim, but did collaborate with him militarily. Reprisals were carried out against [[Peninsulares|Peninsular]] royalists that were captured. It was during this period that the republican city fathers of Caracas, following the example of [[M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida]], granted Bol\u00edvar the title of [[Title of honor|Liberator]] and office of [[captain general]] in the [[Iglesia de San Francisco (Caracas)|Church of San Francisco]] (the more appropriate site, the [[Caracas Cathedral|Cathedral of Caracas]], was still damaged from the [[1812 Caracas earthquake|1812 earthquake]]).\n\nBol\u00edvar and Mari\u00f1o's success, like Monteverde's a year earlier, was short-lived. The new Republic failed to convince the common people that it was not a tool of the urban elite. Lower-class people, especially the southern, rural ''[[llanero]]s'' (cowboys), flocked to the royalist cause. ''Llaneros'' played a key military role in the region's struggle. Turning the tide against independence, these highly mobile, ferocious fighters made up a formidable military force that pushed Bol\u00edvar out of his home country once more. By 1814, the regular royalist army headed by Governor and Captain General [[Juan Manuel Cajigal]] was overshadowed by a large, irregular force of ''llaneros'' recruited and led by [[Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Boves]]. With the royalist irregulars displaying the same passion and violence that Bol\u00edvar had demonstrated in his \"war to the death\" decree, the republicans suffered their first major setback at the Battle of [[La Puerta]] on June 15, 1814, and Boves took Caracas on July 16. The republicans and Criollo royalists in Caracas, who also feared Boves's ''llanero'' hoards, had to flee en masse to Mari\u00f1o's strongholds in the east. The combined forces of Mari\u00f1o's and Bol\u00edvar were defeated again at [[Aragua de Barcelona]] on August 18, at a cost of 2,000 royalist casualties of the 10,000 troops they fielded, most of the 3,000 combatants in the republican army, in addition to many civilian casualties. Due to their series of repeated reverses both Bol\u00edvar and Mari\u00f1o were arrested and removed from power by [[Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Ribas]] and [[Manuel Piar]], each representing the two republican [[Command (military formation)|commands]] then in place in Venezuela. A few days later Ribas and Piar decided not to try them and instead released them into exile. On September 8, Bol\u00edvar and Mari\u00f1o set sail for Cartagena de Indias, leaving Piar and Ribas to lead the increasingly encircled republicans.\n\n===Royalist control consolidated===\n{{Main|Spanish reconquest of New Granada}}\nEarlier in March 1814, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] had returned to the throne. The [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]]'s advances made it impossible for Napoleon to continue holding Ferdinand or fighting in Spain. Once in Spain, however, Ferdinand was not pleased by the revolution in government that had been undertaken in his name, and by May he had abolished the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] and began persecuting and arresting the liberals responsible for its creation. To deal with the Americas, Ferdinand organized the largest expeditionary force that Spain ever sent to the Americas up to that time. Colonel [[Pablo Morillo]], a veteran of the Spanish struggle against the French was chosen as its commander. The expeditionary force was made up of approximately 10,000 men and nearly sixty ships. Originally, they were to head for [[Montevideo]] in the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], another region that had fallen out of royalist control, but soon it was decided to send these forces to the Venezuela and New Granada, where the war had become exceedingly savage. Realizing that this change in plans would not go over well with the soldiers, the news was kept from them until they were at sea. When the expeditionary force arrived in Venezuela, it found that most of it had been restored to royalist control, save for [[Isla Margarita|Margarita Island]], which surrendered to it with no blood shed. With Venezuela pacified, plans were quickly made to subdue neighboring New Granada, and the bulk of the troops moved to the coastal city of [[Santa Marta]], which had remained in royalist hands since 1810.\n\n==Second exile in New Granada and the Caribbean (1814-1816)==\nLike many other Venezuelan republicans who fled to New Granada after the second wave of royalist victories, Bol\u00edvar once again entered into the service of the [[United Provinces of New Granada|United Provinces]] and fought against cities that had refused to acknowledge its authority. His forces took Bogot\u00e1 on December 12, 1814, after an eight-month-long war, and was promoted to captain general for his efforts. He was then given the task of capturing the royalist stronghold, Santa Marta, but Cartagena, the obvious base from which to launch this offensive, refused to give him the necessary soldiers and supplies, so infighting broke out. As Santa Martan forces gained ground against the divided republicans in northern New Granada, Bol\u00edvar left for [[Jamaica]] on May 8, 1815. Cartagena would fall to Morillo in December 1815 and Bogot\u00e1 in May of the following year.\n\n===Aid from the Haitian Republic and Cura\u00e7ao===\n[[File:Soublette, Brice\u00f1o M\u00e9ndez, Zea, Mac Gregor and Bri\u00f3n.jpg|300 px|thumb|right|Soublette, Pedro Brice\u00f1o M\u00e9ndez, [[Francisco Antonio Zea]], [[Gregor MacGregor]] and Bri\u00f3n in Ocumare. 19th century illustration by Carmelo Fern\u00e1ndez.]]\nNow thirty-two years of age, he found himself in exile for the second time. In Jamaica, Bol\u00edvar once again issued a manifesto explaining his view of the failure of the republican cause in Venezuela. His famous [[Carta de Jamaica|Letter from Jamaica]], though ostensibly written to one man, was an appeal to Great Britain specifically and the European powers in general to aid the cause of Spanish American independence, but it found no significant response. So he turned to the small and isolated republic of [[Haiti]], that had freed itself from French rule, but being composed of mostly former slaves, received little aid from either the United States or Europe. Bol\u00edvar and other Venezuelan and New Granadan exiles were warmly received by the Haitian president [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]]. The growing exile community would receive money, volunteers and weapons from the Haitian president enabling them to resume plans to continue the struggle for independence. There was debate, however, over who should be in charge, but his ability to win over P\u00e9tion and a Cura\u00e7aoan sea merchant, [[Luis Bri\u00f3n]] (he is traditionally referred to by the Spanish form of his name), who had just acquired a much-needed warship in England to aid the embattled Cartagenan Republic, forced the other Venezuelan leaders to grudgingly accept his leadership. P\u00e9tion, for his part, convinced Bol\u00edvar to expand the fight for independence to include the liberation of slaves.\n\nThe \u00e9migr\u00e9s successfully captured a [[beachhead]] at  Los Cayos on March 31, 1816. Bol\u00edvar proclaimed the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic and in two [[decree]]s of June 2 and July 16 declared the freedom of slaves conditional on their joining the republican forces. Shortly thereafter, Margarita Island, safely separated by water from Morillo's forces, rejoined the republican cause and became a second base of operations. Operating under the command of [[Santiago Mari\u00f1o|Mari\u00f1o]], [[Manuel Piar|Piar]] and [[Carlos Soublette]] the republican expeditionaries captured more coastal towns. On July 14 Bol\u00edvar led an assault against [[Ocumare de la Costa de Oro Municipality|Ocumare de la Costa]], which ended in a debacle in which Bol\u00edvar abandoned Mari\u00f1o, Piar and the rest of his forces, and fled by sea. Piar's forces managed to fight their way from the Caribbean coast to the southern [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]], where the vast and underpopulated terrain and the forces forming under [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez]] protected them from the royalist army. Mari\u00f1o retreated to his home province of Cuman\u00e1, where he could rely on personal connections to maintain a base of operations. After failing to find support along the coast, Bol\u00edvar returned to Haiti. In the intervening months the divided republican leaders unable to agree on a single leader, decided to compromise and in October offered Bol\u00edvar the military command, with the understanding that a separate civilian government would be formed.  In Haiti Bol\u00edvar gathered new supplies and organized a second expedition, named by history as the Jacmel Expedition for the city from which it departed, and on December 31, 1816, landed in [[Barcelona, Anzo\u00e1tegui|Barcelona]] controlled by Mari\u00f1o, who by this point barely accepted Bol\u00edvar as head of the republicans.\n\n==The Third Republic (1817-1820)==\n[[File:CorreodelOrinoco.jpg|thumb|200px|right|First issue of the ''Correo del Orinoco'', June 27, 1818.]]\nBol\u00edvar took the forces he brought from Haiti to the Orinoco region, which was mostly controlled by Piar. Piar was making headway against the royalists of [[Ciudad Bol\u00edvar|Angostura]], and was preparing to lay siege to the city. The siege proved difficult and long, since Angostura had a lifeline in the river itself. Bol\u00edvar's reinforcements were useful and the city fell in August 1817.<ref>Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions'', 210-211.</ref> Angostura proved to be an immensely valuable base. From it the republicans had access to foreign trade in Caribbean and beyond via the Orinoco. The river's tributaries also provided access to the Venezuelan and New Granadan Llanos to the west, especially those in [[Casanare Department|Casanare]], where refugees from Morillo's troops had organized themselves under [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]. In Angostura Bol\u00edvar began publishing the ''Correo del Orinoco'' newspaper, an official organ of the revolutionaries, which was circulated not only in Venezuela, but in the Caribbean and in Europe. Under P\u00e1ez and Piar, the republican armies had begun to recruit the local ''llaneros'' who, after Morillo disbanded Boves's informal units, no longer had an outlet for quick enrichment and social advancement under the royalist banner. This, however, posed the challenge to the Criollo republican leaders of channeling the ''llanero's'' energy, while not re-igniting the race war that had occurred under Boves. In this environment leaders like Piar, who in recent years had begun to emphasize his [[Mulatto|Pardo]] roots as he built a Pardo and ''llanero'' following, became suspect, and this weakness proved useful to Bol\u00edvar, when the moment came to reassert his position as head of the nascent republic.\n\n===Challenges to Bol\u00edvar's authority===\nThe first overt challenge to his rule came with the meeting of the \"Congresillo of [[Sucre (state)|Cariaco]]\" on May 8 and 9 under the auspices of [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Jos\u00e9 Cort\u00e9s de Madariaga\u2014who had been a member of the Junta of Caracas and had just returned to Venezuela after being imprisoned in Spain\u2014Luis Bri\u00f3n and Santiago Mari\u00f1o. The eight-member Congress proposed to restore the 1811 Constitution and establish a permanent government that could negotiate a recognition by  other nations. Mari\u00f1o offered his and Bol\u00edvar's resignation in order to allow the Congress to elect a new executive. The Congress restored the [[triumvirate]] and selected Fernando Rodr\u00edguez del Toro (who was at the moment exiled in [[Trinidad]]), Francisco Javier Mayz (one of the eight deputies of the Congress) and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar as the new triumvirate. To replace in an interim manner the two who were not present, the Congress chose Francisco Antonio Zea and Canon Cort\u00e9s de Madariaga. It made Mari\u00f1o general-in-chief of the republican forces and established [[La Asunci\u00f3n]] as the temporary capital of the Republic. It sent word to Bol\u00edvar to present himself as soon as military conditions permitted to take his place in the triumvirate. Less than a month later, Rafael Urdaneta and [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], who remained loyal to Bol\u00edvar, lead a group of officers that forced the triumvirate to dissolve itself. By June, Bol\u00edvar, aware of its rise and fall, compared its existence to \"[[Cassava|cassava bread]] in hot soup\" and noted that at the moment in Venezuela only those who could command by force could truly do so.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Luis Salcedo-Bastardo, \"Congreso de Cariaco\" in ''Diccionario de Historia de Venezuela'', Vol. 1. Caracas: Fundaci\u00f3n Polar, 1999. {{ISBN|980-6397-37-1}}</ref>\n\nIt was clear to Bol\u00edvar by mid-1817 that he need to set a clear example that he would not tolerate challenges to his leadership. After the fall of Angostura Piar had become upset at Bol\u00edvar's leadership and decided to leave the area. He requested a passport from Bol\u00edvar, which he granted. Piar had begun to leave the area, when Bol\u00edvar changed his mind and accused Piar of plotting to kill all whites in the area and setting up a black and Mulatto republic (a ''pardocracia'') in imitation of Haiti. Piar was tracked down, [[court-martial]]ed and found guilty. On October 16 he was executed. Although Piar's crime had ostensibly been fomenting racial hatred, it was understood that his true crime had been not recognizing Bol\u00edvar authority. After Piar's execution, Mari\u00f1o, whom Bol\u00edvar's confidant and chronicler [[Daniel Florence O'Leary|Daniel Florencio O'Leary]] later admitted had been more guilty of insubordination than Piar, fell in line and dropped any other pretensions to an independent leadership.<ref>Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions'', 210-213.</ref>\n\nHis political position secured, Bol\u00edvar began to expand the scope of his military activity. He met with P\u00e1ez for the first time in January 1818, who accepted Bol\u00edvar as head of the republicans. P\u00e1ez, however, refused to take his powerful ''llanero'' cavalry outside of the Llanos, where they were extremely effective in holding off and defeating Morillo's formal army. Bol\u00edvar was, therefore, left alone in a mid-year attempt to take Caracas, which failed. Nevertheless, by the end of the year, the republicans were secure enough in southern Venezuela, that Bol\u00edvar felt it was time to convene a new Venezuelan congress to give the republican government a permanent form. Elections were held in republican areas and to pick representatives of the provinces of Venezuela and New Granada under royalist control, among the troops of those areas. The [[Congress of Angostura]], consisting of twenty-six delegates, began holding sessions in February 1819. The highlight of the opening session was Bol\u00edvar's \"[[Address at the Congress of Angostura]]\", now seen along with his \"Cartagena Manifesto\" and \"Jamaica Letter\" as a foundational exposition of his political thought. The same day the Congress elected Bol\u00edvar president of the Republic and ratified his command of its armies.\n\n===The New Granada Campaign===\n{{See also|Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada}}\nAfter the opening of the Congress, Bol\u00edvar conceived of a daring, yet risky, plan of attacking New Granada which had been a Spanish stronghold for the past three years. If he could liberate New Granada he would have a whole new base from which to operate against Morillo. Central New Granada held great promise since, unlike Venezuela, it had only been recently conquered by Morillo and it had a prior six-year experience of independent government. Royalist sentiment was not strong. But it would be hard to take the initiative against the better prepared and supplied royalist army. To surprise it, Bol\u00edvar decided to move during the Venezuelan ''invierno'', the [[wet season|rainy season]], when the Llanos flooded up to a meter and the campaign season ended. Morillo's forces would be evacuated from the Llanos for months and no one would anticipate that Bol\u00edvar's troops would be on the move. This decision, however, would mean literally wading in waist-deep, [[malaria]]l water for days before attempting to scale the Andes. Understandably the plan received little support from the Congress or even from the master of the Llanos himself, P\u00e1ez. With only the forces he and Santander had recruited in the [[Apure River|Apure]] and [[Meta River]] regions, Bol\u00edvar set off in June 1819.\n\n[[File:Bolivar's troops in the Cordillera Oriental.jpg|thumb|Bol\u00edvar's troops cross the Cordillera Oriental]]\nThe small army consisted of about 2,500 men: 1,300 infantry and 800 cavalry, including a [[British Legions|British legion]]. It took a route that went from the hot and humid, flood-swept plains of Colombia to the icy mountain pass of the [[P\u00e1ramo]] de [[Pisba, Boyac\u00e1|Pisba]], at an altitude of 3,960 meters (13,000 feet), through the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]]. After the hardships of wading through a virtual sea, the mostly ''llanero'' army scaled the mountains poorly clothed and ill-prepared for the cold and altitude of the mountains. On both legs of the trip many became ill or died. Despite some intelligence that Bol\u00edvar was on the move, the Spanish considered the route impassable, and therefore, they were taken by surprise when Bol\u00edvar's small army emerged from the mountains on July 5. In a series of battles under the auspices of [[Francisco Mari\u00f1o y Soler]] the republican army cleared its way to [[Bogot\u00e1]]. First at the [[Vargas Swamp Battle|Battle of Vargas Swamp]] on July 25, Bol\u00edvar intercepted a royalist force attempting to reach the poorly defended capital. Then at the [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1]] on August 7, the bulk of the royalist army surrendered to Bol\u00edvar.  On receiving the news, the viceroy, [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de S\u00e1mano y Uribarri|Juan Jos\u00e9 de S\u00e1mano]], and the rest of royalist government fled the capital so fast that they left behind the treasury, an incredible coup for Bol\u00edvar and Santander. On August 10 Bol\u00edvar's army entered Bogot\u00e1.\n\nWith New Granada secure under Santander's control, Bol\u00edvar could return to Venezuela in a position of unprecedented military, political and financial strength. In his absence the Congress had flirted with deposing him, assuming that he would meet his death in New Granada. The vice-president Francisco Antonio Zea was deposed and replaced by Juan Bautista Arismendi. All this was quickly reversed when word got to the Congress of Bol\u00edvar's success. By year's end Bol\u00edvar presented himself before the Congress and asked it to decree the union of Venezuela and New Granada in a new state, [[Gran Colombia|Colombia]]. It did so on December 17 and elected him president of the new country. The Constitution that the Congress had just written for Venezuela became null and void and a new congress was set to convene within two years.\n\n==President and Commander-in-Chief of Gran Colombia (1820-1825)==\n{{See also|Gran Colombia}}\n[[File:Plaza armisticio 2005.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Monument to the meeting between Morillo and Bol\u00edvar in Santa Ana de Trujillo.]]\n1820 proved to be a banner year for Bol\u00edvar. His dream of creating a new nation was becoming a reality. Morillo no longer had the upper hand militarily and by late March reports began to arrive about the success of the [[Rafael del Riego|Riego Revolt]]. The revolt meant that the reinforcements that Morillo's expeditionary force desperately needed would not be coming. Moreover, in June the official orders to reinstate the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|C\u00e1diz Constitution]] arrived and were implemented. The new Constitutional government in Spain radically changed policy towards the rebellions in America. It assumed that the revolutionaries, as liberals, were either fighting for, or could be co-opted by, the Spanish Constitution. Although this might have been true in parts of Spanish America at the start of the decade, by 1820 most Spanish Americans did not trust Fernando VII to keep his oath to the Constitution for long. More importantly, it had always been Bol\u00edvar's stance that the wars were between two sovereign states, and therefore, the question of reconciling with the Spanish Monarchy under the 1812 Constitution was never a consideration.<ref>Earle, Rebecca A. ''Spain and the Independence of Colombia, 1810-1825''. Exeter, University of Exeter Press, 2000, 153. {{ISBN|0-85989-612-9}}</ref>\n\nDespite this, Morillo continued with negotiations and focused on getting a [[ceasefire]] and bringing the war in line with the [[Jus gentium|law of nations]]. This was achieved in two treaties signed on November 25 and 26 in [[Trujillo (state)|Santa Ana de Trujillo]], which established a six-month cessation of hostilities and regularized the [[rules of engagement]]. The negotiations were also important because the Spanish government for the first time tacitly granted Colombia national status, rather than seeing its representatives as mere rebels. Spain did not of course recognize Colombia, but the negotiations papers referred to it as such, rather than with the previous denominations of \"Bol\u00edvar's forces\" or \"the Congress at Angostura.\"<ref>Earle, ''Spain and the Independence of Colombia'', 154-159.</ref> The ceasefire allowed Bol\u00edvar to build up his army for the final showdown everyone knew was coming. By the end of the year, the Constitutional government granted Morillo his long-standing request to resign and he left South America. He was replaced by [[Miguel de la Torre]].\n\n===Victory in Venezuela===\n{{Main|Battle of Carabobo}}\nThe truce did not last all six months. On January 28 the ''[[cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'' of [[Maracaibo]], which had been in secret negotiations with the republicans aided by native son [[Rafael Urdaneta]], declared the province an independent republic, which chose to join Colombia. La Torre took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed, when Bol\u00edvar returned to Venezuela in April 1821, leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on June 24, the Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela, save for [[Puerto Cabello]] and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Hostilities continued until the surrender of Puerto Cabello in 1823, but the main front of the war now moved to southern New Granada and Quito.\n\n===The Southern Campaign, Quito and Peru (1821-1824)===\n{{Main|Ecuadorian War of Independence|Peruvian War of Independence}}\n\n[[File:La Victoria de Jun\u00edn - J.J. Olmedo..jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Allegory]] of Bol\u00edvar's liberation of ''Colombia'' in a book of poetry by [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo]].]]\nWith the Spanish Monarchy collapsing in South America and the uncertainty of constitutional rule in Spain, provinces of the [[Royal Audience of Quito|Presidency of Quito]] began to declare independence. In October 1820 a coup in [[Guayaquil]] set up a junta, which declared Guayaquil a republic. [[Portoviejo]] and [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]] followed suit in the next few weeks. [[Quito]] remained in royalist control under the Audiencia President, Field Marshal [[Melchior Aymerich]], and by January 1821 had defeated the forces sent by Guayaquil against it. Bol\u00edvar was determined to ensure that the Presidency of Quito become part of Gran Colombia and not remain a collection of small, divided republics. To this end, Colombian aid in the form of supplies and an army under [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] began to arrive in Guayaquil in February. Throughout 1821 Sucre was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides were exhausted and signed a 90-day armistice. The following year, at [[Battle of Pichincha]] on May 24, 1822, Sucre's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito. The territory of New Granada was secure. From [[Puerto Cabello]] royalist make a counterattack at [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]]. However the main focus now became neutralizing the royalist Army in Peru.\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] had already made incursions into Peru starting in 1820. He had been declared Protector of Peruvian Freedom, in August 1821 after liberating parts of the country, but the important cities and provinces still remained royalist. Bol\u00edvar and San Mart\u00edn held a [[Guayaquil conference|meeting in Guayaquil]] on July 26 and  27, 1822, in which they discussed plans to liberate Peru and it was decided that Bol\u00edvar and Gran Colombia would take over the task of fully liberating Peru. San Mart\u00edn departed from the scene. For the next two years Colombian and Peruvian patriot forces gain more territory. On February 10, 1824, Bol\u00edvar was given immense political powers when a Peruvian congress named him dictator of Peru, which made Bol\u00edvar the head of state of a second country and allowed Bol\u00edvar to completely reorganize the political and military administration of Peru. Bol\u00edvar, assisted by Sucre, decisively defeated the remnants of the royalist cavalry on August 6, 1824, at the [[Battle of Jun\u00edn]]. Sucre then destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the royalist army at [[Battle of Ayacucho]] on December 9. South American independence was now all but secured. The only royalist area in the continent was highland country of [[Upper Peru]], [[El Callao]] and [[Chilo\u00e9]].\n\n===The Peruvian and Colombian campaign in Upper Peru===\n''For details, see [[Bolivian War of Independence]]''\n\nBol\u00edvar was now president of both Gran Colombia and Peru and had been granted extraordinary powers by the legislatures of both countries to carry out the war against the Spanish Monarchy. Since Bol\u00edvar was tied up with the administration of Quito and Peru, the liberation of Upper Peru fell to Sucre and [[Francisco Burdett O'Connor|O'Connor]], and within a year in April 1825, the task had been completed. A congress of Upper Peru on August 6, 1825, chose to name the new nation after the Liberator and called it the Republic of Bol\u00edvar. (The name would later be changed to Bolivia.) With independence secured for all of Spanish South America, Bol\u00edvar's political life entered a new phase. He now had to turn to consolidating the large nations he had created out of the former Spanish provinces. And dissension began to brew in the north as the regions of Gran Colombia began to chafe under the centralized government.\n\n==The dissolution of Gran Colombia and aftermath==\n[[File:Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar - Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espinosa, 1830.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sketch of Bol\u00edvar at age 47 made from life by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espinosa in 1830.]]\n\nDuring 1826, internal divisions had sparked dissent throughout the nation and regional uprisings erupted in Venezuela, and Gran Colombia appeared to be on the verge of collapse. An amnesty was declared and an arrangement was reached with the Venezuelan rebels, but political dissent appeared in New Granada as a consequence of this. In an attempt to keep the nation together, Bol\u00edvar called for a constitutional convention at [[Oca\u00f1a, Norte de Santander|Oca\u00f1a]] to be held in April 1828. To prevent the splintering of Gran Colombia, Bol\u00edvar proposed to introduce an even more centralist model of government, including some or all of the elements he had been able to place in the Bolivian constitution: a [[President for Life|lifetime presidency]] with the ability to select a successor, and a hereditary third chamber of the legislature. These proposals were deemed anti-liberal and met with strong opposition, including from a faction forming around Santander, who by now was openly opposed to Bol\u00edvar politically.\n\nThe [[Convention of Oca\u00f1a]] (April 9 to June 10, 1828) met under a cloud. Many felt that the breakup of the country was imminent. Addressing these fears, the Congress went in the opposite direction that Bol\u00edvar had hoped, and drafted a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government with greatly reduced the powers for the central administration. Unhappy with this outcome, pro-Bol\u00edvar delegates left the convention and the constitution was never ratified.\n\nAfter the failure of the convention, Bol\u00edvar proclaimed himself dictator on August 27, 1828, through an [[Organic law|Organic]] [[Decree]] of Dictatorship. He considered this as a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, though it only increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents. On September 25, 1828 an attempt to assassinate Bol\u00edvar failed, but it illustrated the tense political atmosphere in Gran Colombia. Although Bol\u00edvar emerged physically intact from the event, he was, nevertheless, greatly affected. Dissent continued, and new uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela and Quito during the next two years. Gran Colombia finally collapsed in 1830. Bol\u00edvar himself died in the same year at age 47 on December 17. His closest political ally at the time, Sucre, who was intending to retire from public life, had been murdered earlier on June 4, 1830.\n\nBol\u00edvar's legacy continued in the [[Succession of states|successor states]] to Gran Colombia. Many of the officers who had fought by him were not only involved in the revolts that led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia, but continued to play important political and military roles in the decades and wars that followed. Bol\u00edvar's political thought\u2014his emphasis on a strong, centralized government\u2014became the basis of conservative thought in nineteenth-century South America.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spain|Latin America|War}}\n*[[Libertadores]]\n*[[Spanish American wars of independence]]\n*[[Latin American integration]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Lynch, John.

One of his most successful innovations was a new type of self-bailer. The design is still in production under the Andersen brand and has been widely copied. The new features were a wedge shaped venturi that closes automatically if the boat grounds or hits an obstruction, and a flap that acts as a non return valve to minimise water coming in if the boat is stationary or moving too slowly for the device to work. Previous automatic bailers would be damaged or destroyed if they met an obstruction, and would let considerable amounts of water in if the boat was moving too slowly.\n\nElvstr\u00f8m was a very early innovator in training techniques. For example, he used the technique of 'sitting out' or [[hiking (sailing)|hiking]] using [[toe-straps]] to a greater degree than previously, getting all his body weight from the knees upwards outside the boat, thus providing extra leverage to enable the boat to remain level in stronger winds and hence go faster than his competitors. This technique required great strength and fitness, so Elvstr\u00f8m built a training bench with toe-straps in his garage to replicate the sitting-out position in his dinghy. He then proceeded to spend many training hours on dry land sitting out on the bench at home.\n\nHe also popularised the [[kicking strap]], or boom vang (US). This may take the form of a [[block and tackle]] linking a low point on the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] (or an equivalent point on the hull) and the [[Boom (sailing)|boom]] close to the mast, which allows the boom to be let out when [[reaching (sailing)|reaching]] or [[running (sailing)|running]] without lifting. This controls the twist of the [[mainsail]] from its foot to its head, increasing the sail's power and the boat's speed and controlability. Elvstr\u00f8m did not advertise his new invention, leaving his competitors mystified at his superior boat-speed. Investigation of his dinghy revealed nothing as he used to remove the kicking strap before coming ashore.\n\nHe established a manufacturing company whose products included masts, booms, and sails. He has also been instrumental in developing several international yacht racing rules.\n\nAmong the innovative concepts he brought to sailboat racing was the concept of gates instead of a single windward or leeward mark in large regattas. The leeward gate on a windward-leeward course is commonly used. The windward gate is less often used due to the difficulties in managing right-of-way around the right gate, the subtleties of which are understood mostly by match racers.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/archived_Detail.asp?key=3866 |title = Scuttlebutt: Archived Newsletters |accessdate = 2008-08-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Elvstr\u00f8m was chosen as \"Danish Sportsman of the Century.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Albrechtsen|first1=Karin|last2=Leksikon|first2=Gyldendal|title=Paul Elvstr\u00f8m |url=http://denmark.dk/en/meet-the-danes/great-danes/athletes/paul-elvstroem|website=Denmark.dk |accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Elvstr\u00f8m was among the first six inductees into the [[ISAF Sailing Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sailing.org/halloffame/21227.php |title = ISAF Hall of Fame : Paul Elvstr\u00f6m |accessdate = 2008-08-13 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080917154021/http://www.sailing.org/halloffame/21227.php |archivedate = 17 September 2008 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> He died on 7 December 2016 at the age of 88,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Jens|title=Paul Elvstr\u00f8m er d\u00f8d|url=http://www.dr.dk/sporten/oevrig/paul-elvstroem-er-doed|website=dr.dk|publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]|language=Danish|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref> after battling [[Alzheimers]] for a few years.\n\n==Achievements==\nElvstr\u00f8m won medals at the world championships: [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]], [[505 (dinghy)|505]], [[Snipe (dinghy)|Snipe]], [[Flying Dutchman (dinghy)|Flying Dutchman]], [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]], [[Star (sailboat)|Star]], [[Soling]] [[Tornado (sailboat)|Tornado]] and [[Half Ton Cup|Half Ton]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=70% style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

One of his most successful innovations was a new type of self-bailer. The design is still in production under the Andersen brand and has been widely copied. The new features were a wedge shaped venturi that closes automatically if the boat grounds or hits an obstruction, and a flap that acts as a non return valve to minimise water coming in if the boat is stationary or moving too slowly for the device to work. Previous automatic bailers would be damaged or destroyed if they met an obstruction, and would let considerable amounts of water in if the boat was moving too slowly.\n\nElvstr\u00f8m was a very early innovator in training techniques. For example, he used the technique of 'sitting out' or [[hiking (sailing)|hiking]] using [[toe-straps]] to a greater degree than previously, getting all his body weight from the knees upwards outside the boat, thus providing extra leverage to enable the boat to remain level in stronger winds and hence go faster than his competitors. This technique required great strength and fitness, so Elvstr\u00f8m built a training bench with toe-straps in his garage to replicate the sitting-out position in his dinghy. He then proceeded to spend many training hours on dry land sitting out on the bench at home.\n\nHe also popularised the [[kicking strap]], or boom vang (US). This may take the form of a [[block and tackle]] linking a low point on the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] (or an equivalent point on the hull) and the [[Boom (sailing)|boom]] close to the mast, which allows the boom to be let out when [[reaching (sailing)|reaching]] or [[running (sailing)|running]] without lifting. This controls the twist of the [[mainsail]] from its foot to its head, increasing the sail's power and the boat's speed and controlability. Elvstr\u00f8m did not advertise his new invention, leaving his competitors mystified at his superior boat-speed. Investigation of his dinghy revealed nothing as he used to remove the kicking strap before coming ashore.\n\nHe established a manufacturing company whose products included masts, booms, and sails. He has also been instrumental in developing several international yacht racing rules.\n\nAmong the innovative concepts he brought to sailboat racing was the concept of gates instead of a single windward or leeward mark in large regattas. The leeward gate on a windward-leeward course is commonly used. The windward gate is less often used due to the difficulties in managing right-of-way around the right gate, the subtleties of which are understood mostly by match racers.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/archived_Detail.asp?key=3866 |title = Scuttlebutt: Archived Newsletters |accessdate = 2008-08-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Elvstr\u00f8m was chosen as \"Danish Sportsman of the Century.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Albrechtsen|first1=Karin|last2=Leksikon|first2=Gyldendal|title=Paul Elvstr\u00f8m |url=http://denmark.dk/en/meet-the-danes/great-danes/athletes/paul-elvstroem|website=Denmark.dk |accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Elvstr\u00f8m was among the first six inductees into the [[ISAF Sailing Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sailing.org/halloffame/21227.php |title = ISAF Hall of Fame : Paul Elvstr\u00f6m |accessdate = 2008-08-13 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080917154021/http://www.sailing.org/halloffame/21227.php |archivedate = 17 September 2008 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> He died on 7 December 2016 at the age of 88,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Jens|title=Paul Elvstr\u00f8m er d\u00f8d|url=http://www.dr.dk/sporten/oevrig/paul-elvstroem-er-doed|website=dr.dk|publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]|language=Danish|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref> after battling [[Alzheimers]] for a few years.\n\n==Achievements==\nElvstr\u00f8m won medals at the world championships: [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]], [[505 (dinghy)|505]], [[Snipe (dinghy)|Snipe]], [[Flying Dutchman (dinghy)|Flying Dutchman]], [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]], [[Star (sailboat)|Star]], [[Soling]] [[Tornado (sailboat)|Tornado]] and [[Half Ton Cup|Half Ton]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=70% style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Michelson and Morley's interferometric setup, mounted on a stone slab that floats in an annular trough of mercury]]\n{{General physics}}\nThe '''Michelson\u2013Morley experiment''' was an attempt to detect the existence of the [[Aether theories|luminiferous aether]], a supposed medium permeating space that was thought to be the carrier of light waves. The experiment was performed between April and July 1887 by [[Albert A. Michelson]] and [[Edward W. Morley]] at what is now [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], and published in November of the same year.<ref name=michel2/> It compared the [[speed of light]] in perpendicular directions in an attempt to detect the [[relative motion]] of matter through the stationary [[luminiferous aether]] (\"aether wind\"). The result was negative, in that Michelson and Morley found no significant difference between the speed of light in the direction of movement through the presumed aether, and the speed at right angles. This result is generally considered to be the first strong evidence against the then-prevalent [[Aether theories|aether theory]], and initiated a line of research that eventually led to [[special relativity]], which rules out a stationary aether.<ref group=A name=staley/> Of this experiment, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] wrote, \"If the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment had not brought us into serious embarrassment, no one would have regarded the relativity theory as a (halfway) redemption.\"<ref group=A name=Folsing>{{cite book|author=Albrecht F\u00f6lsing|title=Albert Einstein: A Biography|isbn=0-14-023719-4|year=1998|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/alberteinsteinbi0000fols}}</ref>{{rp|219}} \n\nMichelson\u2013Morley type experiments have been repeated many times with steadily increasing sensitivity. These include experiments from 1902 to 1905, and a series of experiments in the 1920s. More recent [[optical resonator]] experiments confirmed the absence of any aether wind at the 10<sup>\u221217</sup> level.<ref name=Eisele /><ref name=Herrmann2 /> Together with the [[Ives\u2013Stilwell experiment|Ives\u2013Stilwell]] and [[Kennedy\u2013Thorndike experiment]]s, Michelson\u2013Morley type experiments form one of the fundamental [[tests of special relativity]] theory.<ref name=rob group=A />\n\n== Detecting the aether ==\n[[Physics]] theories of the late 19th century assumed that just as surface water waves must have a supporting substance, i.e., a \"medium\", to move across (in this case water), and audible [[sound]] requires a medium to transmit its wave motions (such as air or water), so light must also require a medium, the \"[[luminiferous aether]]\", to transmit its wave motions. Because light can travel through a vacuum<!-- the article \"a\" is optional, and grammatically ok, so please do not remove it as a grammar correction. See [[wp:RETAIN]]-->, it was assumed that even a vacuum must be filled with aether. Because the [[speed of light]] is so great, and because material bodies pass through the ''aether'' without obvious friction or drag, it was assumed to have a highly unusual combination of properties. Designing experiments to investigate these properties was a high priority of 19th century physics.<ref group=A name=Whittaker />{{rp|411ff}}\n\n[[Earth]] orbits around the [[Sun]] at a speed of around {{Convert|30|km/s|4 = 2|abbr = on}}, or {{Convert| 108000|km/h|abbr = on}}. The Earth is in motion, so two main possibilities were considered: (1)&nbsp;The aether is stationary and only partially [[drag (physics)|dragged]] by Earth (proposed by [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] in 1818), or (2)&nbsp;the aether is completely dragged by Earth and thus shares its motion at Earth's surface (proposed by [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet]] in 1844).<ref group=A name=Jan /> In addition, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1865) recognized the [[Electrodynamics|electromagnetic]] nature of light and developed what are now called [[Maxwell's equations]], but these equations were still interpreted as describing the motion of waves through an aether, whose state of motion was unknown. Eventually, Fresnel's idea of an (almost) stationary aether was preferred because it appeared to be confirmed by the [[Fizeau experiment]] (1851) and the [[aberration of light|aberration of star light]].<ref group=A name=Jan />\n\n[[Image:aetherWind.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2. A depiction of the concept of the \"aether wind\"]]\nAccording to the stationary and the partially-dragged aether hypotheses, Earth and the aether are in relative motion, implying that a so-called \"aether wind\" (Fig.&nbsp;2) should exist. Although it would be possible, in theory, for the Earth's motion to match that of the aether at one moment in time, it was not possible for the Earth to remain at rest with respect to the aether at all times, because of the variation in both the direction and the speed of the motion. At any given point on the Earth's surface, the magnitude and direction of the wind would vary with time of day and season. By analyzing the return speed of light in different directions at various different times, it was thought to be possible to measure the motion of the Earth relative to the aether. The expected relative difference in the measured speed of light was quite small, given that the velocity of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun has a magnitude of about one hundredth of one percent of the speed of light.<ref group=A name=Whittaker />{{rp|417ff}}\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, measurements of aether wind effects of first order, i.e., effects proportional to ''v''/''c'' (''v'' being Earth's velocity, ''c'' the speed of light) were thought to be possible, but no direct measurement of the speed of light was possible with the accuracy required. For instance, the [[Fizeau\u2013Foucault apparatus]] could measure the speed of light to perhaps 5% accuracy, which was quite inadequate for measuring directly a first-order 0.01% change in the speed of light. A number of physicists therefore attempted to make measurements of indirect first-order effects not of the speed of light itself, but of variations in the speed of light (see [[Luminiferous aether#First order experiments|First order aether-drift experiments]]). The [[Hoek experiment]], for example, was intended to detect [[interferometry|interferometric]] [[fringe shift]]s due to speed differences of oppositely propagating light waves through water at rest. The results of such experiments were all negative.<ref group=\"A\" name=\"laub\" /> This could be explained by using [[Aether drag hypothesis#Partial aether dragging|Fresnel's dragging coefficient]], according to which the aether and thus light are partially dragged by moving matter. Partial aether-dragging would thwart attempts to measure any first order change in the speed of light. As pointed out by Maxwell (1878), only experimental arrangements capable of measuring second order effects would have any hope of detecting aether drift, i.e., effects proportional to ''v''<sup>2</sup>/''c''<sup>2</sup>.<ref group=A name=maxa /><ref group=A name=maxb /> Existing experimental setups, however, were not sensitive enough to measure effects of that size.\n\n== 1881 and 1887 experiments ==\n\n=== Michelson experiment (1881) ===\n[[File:Michelson1881c.png|thumb|300px|Michelson's 1881 interferometer. Although ultimately it proved incapable of distinguishing between differing theories of aether-dragging, its construction provided important lessons for the design of Michelson and Morley's 1887 instrument.<ref group=note>Among other lessons was the need to control for vibration. Michelson (1881) wrote: \"...&nbsp;owing to the extreme sensitiveness of the instrument to vibrations, the work could not be carried on during the day. Next, the experiment was tried at night. When the mirrors were placed half-way on the arms the fringes were visible, but their position could not be measured till after twelve o'clock, and then only at intervals. When the mirrors were moved out to the ends of the arms, the fringes were only occasionally visible. It thus appeared that the experiments could not be performed in Berlin, and the apparatus was accordingly removed to the Astrophysicalisches Observatorium in Potsdam&nbsp;... Here, the fringes under ordinary circumstances were sufficiently quiet to measure, but so extraordinarily sensitive was the instrument that the stamping of the pavement, about 100 meters from the observatory, made the fringes disappear entirely!\"</ref>]]\n{{Wikisource|The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether|The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether (1881)}} \nMichelson had a solution to the problem of how to construct a device sufficiently accurate to detect aether flow. In 1877, while teaching at his alma mater, the [[United States Naval Academy]] in Annapolis, Michelson conducted his first known light speed experiments as a part of a classroom demonstration. In 1881, he left active U.S. Naval service while in Germany concluding his studies. In that year, Michelson used a prototype experimental device to make several more measurements.\n\nThe device he designed, later known as a [[Michelson interferometer]], sent [[yellow]] light from a [[sodium]] flame (for alignment), or [[white]] light (for the actual observations), through a [[beam splitter|half-silvered mirror]] that was used to split it into two beams traveling at right angles to one another. After leaving the splitter, the beams traveled out to the ends of long arms where they were reflected back into the middle by small mirrors. They then recombined on the far side of the splitter in an eyepiece, producing a pattern of constructive and destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] whose transverse displacement would depend on the relative time it takes light to transit the longitudinal ''vs.'' the transverse arms. If the Earth is traveling through an aether medium, a light beam traveling parallel to the flow of that aether will take longer to reflect back and forth than would a beam traveling perpendicular to the aether, because the increase in elapsed time from traveling against the aether wind is more than the time saved by traveling with the aether wind.  Michelson expected that the Earth's motion would produce a [[fringe shift]] equal to 0.04 fringes\u2014that is, of the separation between areas of the same intensity. He did not observe the expected shift; the greatest average deviation that he measured (in the northwest direction) was only 0.018 fringes; most of his measurements were much less. His conclusion was that Fresnel's hypothesis of a stationary aether with partial aether dragging would have to be rejected, and thus he confirmed Stokes' hypothesis of complete aether dragging.<ref name=michel1/>\n\nHowever, [[Alfred Potier]] (and later [[Hendrik Lorentz]]) pointed out to Michelson that he had made an error of calculation, and that the expected fringe shift should have been only 0.02 fringes.  Michelson's apparatus was subject to experimental errors far too large to say anything conclusive about the aether wind. Definitive measurement of the aether wind would require an experiment with greater accuracy and better controls than the original. Nevertheless, the prototype was successful in demonstrating that the basic method was feasible.<ref group=A name=Jan /><ref group=A name=AIMiller />\n\n=== Michelson\u2013Morley experiment (1887) ===\n{{Wikisource|On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether|On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether (1887)}}\n[[Image:On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether - Fig 4.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 5.

Michelson suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] in September 1885, from which he recovered by October 1885. Morley ascribed this breakdown to the intense work of Michelson during the preparation of the experiments. In 1886, Michelson and Morley successfully confirmed Fresnel's drag coefficient \u2013 this result was also considered as a confirmation of the stationary aether concept.<ref group=A name=staley />\n\nThis result strengthened their hope of finding the aether wind. Michelson and Morley created an improved version of the Michelson experiment with more than enough accuracy to detect this hypothetical effect. The experiment was performed in several periods of concentrated observations between April and July 1887, in the basement of Adelbert Dormitory of WRU (later renamed Pierce Hall, demolished in 1962).<ref group=A name=Fickinger /><ref group=A name=hamerla />\n\nAs shown in Fig.&nbsp;5, the light was repeatedly reflected back and forth along the arms of the interferometer, increasing the path length to {{Convert|11|m|abbr = on}}. At this length, the drift would be about 0.4 fringes. To make that easily detectable, the apparatus was assembled in a closed room in the basement of the heavy stone dormitory, eliminating most thermal and vibrational effects. Vibrations were further reduced by building the apparatus on top of a large block of sandstone (Fig.&nbsp;1), about a foot thick and {{convert|5|ft|spell=in}} square, which was then floated in a circular trough of mercury. They estimated that effects of about 0.01 fringe would be detectable.\n\n[[File:MichelsonCoinAirLumiereBlanche.JPG|thumb|Figure 6. Fringe pattern produced with a Michelson interferometer using white light. As configured here, the central fringe is white rather than black.]]\nMichelson and Morley and other early experimentalists using interferometric techniques in an attempt to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether, used (partially) monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment, always switching to white light for the actual measurements. The reason is that measurements were recorded visually. Purely monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern. Lacking modern means of [[air conditioning|environmental temperature control]], experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift even when the interferometer was set up in a basement. Because the fringes would occasionally disappear due to vibrations caused by passing horse traffic, distant thunderstorms and the like, an observer could easily \"get lost\" when the fringes returned to visibility. The advantages of white light, which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern, far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low [[coherence length]]. As [[Dayton Miller]] wrote, \"White light fringes were chosen for the observations because they consist of a small group of fringes having a central, sharply defined black fringe which forms a permanent zero reference mark for all readings.\"<ref group=A name=Miller1933/><ref group=note>If one uses a half-silvered mirror as the beam splitter, the reflected beam will undergo a different number of front-surface reflections than the transmitted beam. At each front-surface reflection, the light will undergo a phase inversion. Because the two beams undergo a different number of phase inversions, when the path lengths of the two beams match or differ by an integral number of wavelengths (e.g. 0, 1, 2&nbsp;...), there will be destructive interference and a weak signal at the detector. If the path lengths of the beams differ by a half-integral number of wavelengths (e.g., 0.5, 1.5, 2.5&nbsp;...), constructive interference will yield a strong signal. The results are opposite if a cube beam-splitter is used, because a cube beam-splitter makes no distinction between a front- and rear-surface reflection.</ref> Use of partially monochromatic light (yellow sodium light) during initial alignment enabled the researchers to locate the position of equal path length, more or less easily, before switching to white light.<ref group=note>Sodium light produces a fringe pattern that displays cycles of fuzziness and sharpness that repeat every several hundred fringes over a distance of approximately a millimeter. This pattern is due to the yellow sodium D line being actually a doublet, the individual lines of which have a limited [[coherence length]]. After aligning the interferometer to display the centermost portion of the sharpest set of fringes, the researcher would switch to white light.</ref>\n\nThe mercury trough allowed the device to turn with close to zero friction, so that once having given the sandstone block a single push it would slowly rotate through the entire range of possible angles to the \"aether wind,\" while measurements were continuously observed by looking through the eyepiece. The hypothesis of aether drift implies that because one of the arms would inevitably turn into the direction of the wind at the same time that another arm was turning perpendicularly to the wind, an effect should be noticeable even over a period of minutes.\n\nThe expectation was that the effect would be graphable as a sine wave with two peaks and two troughs per rotation of the device. This result could have been expected because during each full rotation, each arm would be parallel to the wind twice (facing into and away from the wind giving identical readings) and perpendicular to the wind twice. Additionally, due to the Earth's rotation, the wind would be expected to show periodic changes in direction and magnitude during the course of a [[sidereal day]].\n\nBecause of the motion of the Earth around the Sun, the measured data were also expected to show annual variations.\n\n=== Most famous \"failed\" experiment ===\n[[File:Michelson Morley 1887 Figure 6.png|thumb|300px|Figure 7. Michelson and Morley's results. The upper solid line is the curve for their observations at noon, and the lower solid line is that for their evening observations.

The expected deviation of the interference fringes from the zero should have been 0.40 of a fringe \u2013 the maximum displacement was 0.02 and the average much less than 0.01 \u2013 and then not in the right place. As displacement is proportional to squares of the relative velocities it follows that if the ether does slip past the relative velocity is less than one sixth of the earth\u2019s velocity.|Albert Abraham Michelson, 1887}}\n\nFrom the standpoint of the then current aether models, the experimental results were conflicting. The [[Fizeau experiment]] and its 1886 repetition by Michelson and Morley apparently confirmed the stationary aether with partial aether dragging, and refuted complete aether dragging. On the other hand, the much more precise Michelson\u2013Morley experiment (1887) apparently confirmed complete aether dragging and refuted the stationary aether.<ref group=A name=Jan /> In addition, the Michelson\u2013Morley null result was further substantiated by the null results of other second-order experiments of different kind, namely the [[Trouton\u2013Noble experiment]] (1903) and the [[experiments of Rayleigh and Brace]] (1902\u20131904). These problems and their solution led to the development of the [[Lorentz transformation]] and [[special relativity]].\n\nAfter the \"failed\" experiment Michelson and Morley ceased their aether drift measurements and started to use their newly developed technique to establish the wavelength of light as a [[Length measurement|standard of length]].<ref name=michel3 /><ref name=michel4 />\n\n== Light path analysis and consequences ==\n=== Observer resting in the aether ===\n[[File:Michelson-morley calculations.svg|thumb|300px|Expected differential phase shift between light traveling the longitudinal versus the transverse arms of the Michelson\u2013Morley apparatus]]\nThe beam travel time in the longitudinal direction can be derived as follows:<ref group=A name=Feynman /> Light is sent from the source and propagates with the speed of light <math display=\"inline\">c</math> in the aether. It passes through the half-silvered mirror at the origin at <math display=\"inline\">T=0</math>.  The reflecting mirror is at that moment at distance <math display=\"inline\">L</math> (the length of the interferometer arm) and is moving with velocity <math display=\"inline\">v</math>. The beam hits the mirror at time <math display=\"inline\">T_1</math> and thus travels the distance <math display=\"inline\">cT_1</math>. At this time, the mirror has traveled the distance <math display=\"inline\">vT_1</math>. Thus <math display=\"inline\">cT_1 =L+vT_1</math> and consequently the travel time <math display=\"inline\">T_1=L/(c-v)</math>. The same consideration applies to the backward journey, with the sign of <math display=\"inline\">v</math> reversed, resulting in <math display=\"inline\">cT_2 =L-vT_2</math> and <math display=\"inline\">T_2 =L/(c+v)</math>. The total travel time <math display=\"inline\">T_\\ell=T_1+T_2</math> is:\n\n:<math>T_\\ell=\\frac{L}{c-v}+\\frac{L}{c+v} =\\frac{2L}{c}\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\approx\\frac{2L}{c} \\left(1+\\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)</math>\n\nMichelson obtained this expression correctly in 1881, however, in transverse direction he obtained the incorrect expression\n\n:<math>T_t=\\frac{2L}{c},</math>\n\nbecause he overlooked the increased path length in the rest frame of the aether. This was corrected by [[Alfred Potier]] (1882) and [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1886). The derivation in the transverse direction can be given as follows (analogous to the derivation of [[time dilation]] using a [[Time dilation#Simple inference of time dilation due to relative velocity|light clock]]): The beam is propagating at the speed of light <math display=\"inline\">c</math> and hits the mirror at time <math display=\"inline\">T_3</math>, traveling the distance <math display=\"inline\">cT_3</math>. At the same time, the mirror has traveled the distance <math display=\"inline\">vT_3</math> in the ''x'' direction. So in order to hit the mirror, the travel path of the beam is <math display=\"inline\">L</math> in the ''y'' direction (assuming equal-length arms) and <math display=\"inline\">vT_3</math> in the ''x'' direction. This inclined travel path follows from the transformation from the interferometer rest frame to the aether rest frame. Therefore, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] gives the actual beam travel distance of <math display=\"inline\"> \\sqrt{L^2+\\left(vT_3\\right)^2}</math>. Thus <math display=\"inline\"> cT_3 =\\sqrt{L^2+\\left(vT_3\\right)^2}</math> and consequently the travel time <math display=\"inline\"> T_3 =L/\\sqrt{c^2-v^2}</math>, which is the same for the backward journey.

So the result would be a delay in one of the light beams that could be detected when the beams were recombined through interference. Any slight change in the spent time would then be observed as a shift in the positions of the interference fringes. The negative result led Michelson to the conclusion that there is no measurable aether drift.<ref name=michel2 />\n\n=== Observer comoving with the interferometer ===\nIf the same situation is described from the view of an observer co-moving with the interferometer, then the effect of aether wind is similar to the effect experienced by a swimmer, who tries to move with velocity <math display=\"inline\">c</math> against a river flowing with velocity <math display=\"inline\">v</math>.<ref group=A name=teller />\n\nIn the longitudinal direction the swimmer first moves upstream, so his velocity is diminished due to the river flow to <math display=\"inline\">c-v</math>. On his way back moving downstream, his velocity is increased to <math display=\"inline\">c+v</math>. This gives the beam travel times <math display=\"inline\">T_1</math> and  <math display=\"inline\">T_2</math> as mentioned above.\n\nIn the transverse direction, the swimmer has to compensate for the river flow by moving at a certain angle against the flow direction, in order to sustain his exact transverse direction of motion and to reach the other side of the river at the correct location. This diminishes his speed to <math display=\"inline\">\\sqrt{c^2-v^2}</math>, and gives the beam travel time <math display=\"inline\">T_3</math> as mentioned above.\n\n=== Mirror reflection ===\nThe classical analysis predicted a relative phase shift between the longitudinal and transverse beams which in Michelson and Morley's apparatus should have been readily measurable. What is not often appreciated (since there was no means of measuring it), is that motion through the hypothetical aether should also have caused the two beams to diverge as they emerged from the interferometer by about 10<sup>\u22128</sup> radians.<ref group=A name=schum94 />\n\nFor an apparatus in motion, the classical analysis requires that the beam-splitting mirror be slightly offset from an exact 45\u00b0 if the longitudinal and transverse beams are to emerge from the apparatus exactly superimposed. In the relativistic analysis, Lorentz-contraction of the beam splitter in the direction of motion causes it to become more perpendicular by precisely the amount necessary to compensate for the angle discrepancy of the two beams.<ref group=A name=schum94 />\n\n=== Length contraction and Lorentz transformation ===\n{{Further|History of special relativity|History of Lorentz transformations}}\nA first step to explaining the Michelson and Morley experiment's null result was found in the [[Length contraction|FitzGerald\u2013Lorentz contraction hypothesis]], now simply called length contraction or Lorentz contraction, first proposed by [[George FitzGerald]] (1889) and [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1892).<ref group=A name=lorentz95 /> According to this law all objects physically contract by <math display=\"inline\">L/\\gamma</math> along the line of motion (originally thought to be relative to the aether), <math display=\"inline\">\\gamma=1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}</math> being the [[Lorentz factor]]. This hypothesis was partly motivated by [[Oliver Heaviside]]'s discovery in 1888 that electrostatic fields are contracting in the line of motion. But since there was no reason at that time to assume that binding forces in matter are of electric origin, length contraction of matter in motion with respect to the aether was considered an [[Ad hoc hypothesis]].<ref group=A name=AIMiller />\n\nIf length contraction of <math display=\"inline\">L</math> is inserted into the above formula for <math display=\"inline\">T_\\ell</math>, then the light propagation time in the longitudinal direction becomes equal to that in the transverse direction:\n\n:<math>T_\\ell=\\frac{2L\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}{c}\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}=\\frac{2L}{c} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=T_t</math>\n\nHowever, length contraction is only a special case of the more general relation, according to which the transverse length is larger than the longitudinal length by the ratio <math display=\"inline\">\\gamma</math>. This can be achieved in many ways. If <math display=\"inline\">L_1</math> is the moving longitudinal length and <math display=\"inline\">L_2</math> the moving transverse length, <math display=\"inline\">L'_1=L'_2</math> being the rest lengths, then it is given:<ref group=A name=lorentz04 />\n\n:<math>\\frac{L_2}{L_1}=\\frac{L'_2}{\\varphi}\\left/\\frac{L'_1}{\\gamma\\varphi}\\right.=\\gamma.</math>\n\n<math display=\"inline\">\\varphi</math> can be arbitrarily chosen, so there are infinitely many combinations to explain the Michelson\u2013Morley null result. For instance, if <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi=1</math> the relativistic value of length contraction of <math display=\"inline\">L_1</math> occurs, but if <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi=1/\\gamma</math> then no length contraction but an elongation of <math display=\"inline\">L_2</math> occurs. This hypothesis was later extended by [[Joseph Larmor]] (1897), Lorentz (1904) and [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1905), who developed the complete [[Lorentz transformation]] including [[time dilation]] in order to explain the [[Trouton\u2013Noble experiment]], the [[Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace]], and [[Kaufmann\u2013Bucherer\u2013Neumann experiments|Kaufmann's experiments]]. It has the form\n\n:<math>x'=\\gamma\\varphi(x-vt),\\ y'=\\varphi y,\\ z'=\\varphi z,\\ t'=\\gamma\\varphi\\left(t-\\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right)</math>\n\nIt remained to define the value of <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi</math>, which was shown by Lorentz (1904) to be unity.<ref group=A name=lorentz04 /> In general, Poincar\u00e9 (1905)<ref group=A name=poincare05 /> demonstrated that only <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi=1</math> allows this transformation to form a [[Lorentz group|group]], so it is the only choice compatible with the [[principle of relativity]], ''i.e.,'' making the stationary aether undetectable. Given this, length contraction and time dilation obtain their exact relativistic values.\n\n=== Special relativity ===\n[[Albert Einstein]] formulated the theory of [[special relativity]] by 1905, deriving the Lorentz transformation and thus length contraction and time dilation from the relativity postulate and the constancy of the speed of light, thus removing the ''ad hoc'' character from the contraction hypothesis. Einstein emphasized the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] foundation of the theory and the modification of the notion of space and time, with the stationary aether no longer playing any role in his theory. He also pointed out the group character of the transformation. Einstein was motivated by [[Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]] (in the form as it was given by Lorentz in 1895) and the lack of evidence for the [[luminiferous aether]].<ref group=A name=einstein />\n\nThis allows a more elegant and intuitive explanation of the Michelson\u2013Morley null result. In a comoving frame the null result is self-evident, since the apparatus can be considered as at rest in accordance with the relativity principle, thus the beam travel times are the same. In a frame relative to which the apparatus is moving, the same reasoning applies as described above in \"Length contraction and Lorentz transformation\", except the word \"aether\" has to be replaced by \"non-comoving inertial frame\". Einstein wrote in 1916:<ref group=A name=einstein2 />\n\n{{Quote|Although the estimated difference between these two times is exceedingly small, Michelson and Morley performed an experiment involving interference in which this difference should have been clearly detectable. But the experiment gave a negative result \u2014 a fact very perplexing to physicists. Lorentz and FitzGerald rescued the theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body relative to the \u00e6ther produces a contraction of the body in the direction of motion, the amount of contraction being just sufficient to compensate for the difference in time mentioned above. Comparison with the discussion in Section 11 shows that also from the standpoint of the theory of relativity this solution of the difficulty was the right one. But on the basis of the theory of relativity the method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory. According to this theory there is no such thing as a \"specially favoured\" (unique) co-ordinate system to occasion the introduction of the \u00e6ther-idea, and hence there can be no \u00e6ther-drift, nor any experiment with which to demonstrate it. Here the contraction of moving bodies follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory, without the introduction of particular hypotheses; and as the prime factor involved in this contraction we find, not the motion in itself, to which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to the body of reference chosen in the particular case in point. Thus for a co-ordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of Michelson and Morley is not shortened, but it is shortened for a co-ordinate system which is at rest relatively to the sun.|Albert Einstein, 1916}}\n\nThe extent to which the null result of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment influenced Einstein is disputed. Alluding to some statements of Einstein, many historians argue that it played no significant role in his path to special relativity,<ref group=A name=stachel /><ref group=A name=Polanyi /> while other statements of Einstein probably suggest that he was influenced by it.<ref group=A name=dongen /> In any case, the null result of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment helped the notion of the constancy of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance.<ref group=A name=stachel />\n\nIt was later shown by [[Howard Percy Robertson]] (1949) and others<ref name=rob group=A /><ref name=sexl group=A /> (see [[Test theories of special relativity|Robertson\u2013Mansouri\u2013Sexl test theory]]), that it is possible to derive the Lorentz transformation entirely from the combination of three experiments. First, the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment showed that the speed of light is independent of the ''orientation'' of the apparatus, establishing the relationship between longitudinal (\u03b2) and transverse (\u03b4) lengths. Then in 1932, Roy Kennedy and Edward Thorndike modified the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment by making the path lengths of the split beam unequal, with one arm being very short.<ref name=KennedyThorndike/> The [[Kennedy\u2013Thorndike experiment]] took place for many months as the Earth moved around the sun. Their negative result showed that the speed of light is independent of the ''velocity'' of the apparatus in different inertial frames. In addition it established that besides length changes, corresponding time changes must also occur, i.e., it established the relationship between longitudinal lengths (\u03b2) and time changes (\u03b1). So both experiments do not provide the individual values of these quantities. This uncertainty corresponds to the undefined factor <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi</math> as described above. It was clear due to theoretical reasons (the [[Lorentz group|group character]] of the Lorentz transformation as required by the relativity principle) that the individual values of length contraction and time dilation must assume their exact relativistic form. But a direct measurement of one of these quantities was still desirable to confirm the theoretical results. This was achieved by the [[Ives\u2013Stilwell experiment]] (1938), measuring \u03b1 in accordance with time dilation. Combining this value for \u03b1 with the Kennedy\u2013Thorndike null result shows that ''\u03b2'' must assume the value of relativistic length contraction. Combining ''\u03b2'' with the Michelson\u2013Morley null result shows that ''\u03b4'' must be zero. Therefore, the Lorentz transformation with <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi=1</math> is an unavoidable consequence of the combination of these three experiments.<ref name=rob group=A />\n\nSpecial relativity is generally considered the solution to all negative aether drift (or [[isotropy]] of the speed of light) measurements, including the Michelson\u2013Morley null result. Many high precision measurements have been conducted as tests of special relativity and [[modern searches for Lorentz violation]] in the [[photon]], [[electron]], [[nucleon]], or [[neutrino]] sector, all of them confirming relativity.\n\n=== Incorrect alternatives ===\nAs mentioned above, Michelson initially believed that his experiment would confirm Stokes' theory, according to which the aether was fully dragged in the vicinity of the earth (see [[Aether drag hypothesis]]). However, complete aether drag contradicts the observed [[aberration of light]] and was contradicted by other experiments as well. In addition, Lorentz showed in 1886 that Stokes's attempt to explain aberration is contradictory.<ref group=A name=Jan /><ref group=A name=Whittaker />\n\nFurthermore, the assumption that the aether is not carried in the vicinity, but only ''within'' matter, was very problematic as shown by the [[Hammar experiment]] (1935). Hammar directed one leg of his interferometer through a heavy metal pipe plugged with lead. If aether were dragged by mass, it was theorized that the mass of the sealed metal pipe would have been enough to cause a visible effect. Once again, no effect was seen, so aether-drag theories are considered to be disproven.\n\n[[Walther Ritz]]'s [[emission theory]] (or ballistic theory) was also consistent with the results of the experiment, not requiring aether. The theory postulates that light has always the same velocity in respect to the source.<ref name=norton group=A /> However [[De Sitter double star experiment|de Sitter]] noted that emitter theory predicted several optical effects that were not seen in observations of binary stars in which the light from the two stars could be measured in a [[spectrometer]]. If emission theory were correct, the light from the stars should experience unusual fringe shifting due to the velocity of the stars being added to the speed of the light, but no such effect could be seen. It was later shown by [[J. G. Fox]] that the original de Sitter experiments were flawed due to [[Extinction theorem of Ewald and Oseen|extinction]],<ref name=fox65>{{Citation|last=Fox |first=J.

Other versions of the experiment were carried out with increasing sophistication.<ref group=A name=Swenson1 /><ref group=A name=Swenson2 /> Morley was not convinced of his own results, and went on to conduct additional experiments with [[Dayton Miller]] from 1902 to 1904. Again, the result was negative within the margins of error.<ref name=morley1 /><ref name=morley2/>\n\nMiller worked on increasingly larger interferometers, culminating in one with a {{Convert|32|m|adj = on|sp = us}} (effective) arm length that he tried at various sites, including on top of a mountain at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. To avoid the possibility of the aether wind being blocked by solid walls, his mountaintop observations used a special shed with thin walls, mainly of canvas. From noisy, irregular data, he consistently extracted a small positive signal that varied with each rotation of the device, with the [[Sidereal time|sidereal day]], and on a yearly basis. His measurements in the 1920s amounted to approximately {{Convert|10|km/s|abbr = on}} instead of the nearly {{Convert|30|km/s|4 = 1|abbr = on}} expected from the Earth's orbital motion alone. He remained convinced this was due to [[aether drag hypothesis#Partial aether dragging|partial entrainment or aether dragging]], though he did not attempt a detailed explanation. He ignored critiques demonstrating the inconsistency of his results and the refutation by the [[Hammar experiment]].<ref group=A name=Thirring /><ref group=note name=Thirring>Thirring (1926) as well as Lorentz pointed out that Miller's results failed even the most basic criteria required to believe in their celestial origin, namely that the azimuth of supposed drift should exhibit daily variations consistent with the source rotating about the celestial pole. Instead, while Miller's observations showed daily variations, their oscillations in one set of experiments might center, say, around a northwest\u2013southeast line.</ref> Miller's findings were considered important at the time, and were discussed by Michelson, [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] and others at a meeting reported in 1928.<ref group=A name=michel1928 /> There was general agreement that more experimentation was needed to check Miller's results. Miller later built a non-magnetic device to eliminate [[magnetostriction]], while Michelson built one of non-expanding [[Invar]] to eliminate any remaining thermal effects. Other experimenters from around the world increased accuracy, eliminated possible side effects, or both. So far, no one has been able to replicate Miller's results, and modern experimental accuracies have ruled them out.<ref group=A name=shankland /> Roberts (2006) has pointed out that the primitive data reduction techniques used by Miller and other early experimenters, including Michelson and Morley, were capable of ''creating'' apparent periodic signals even when none existed in the actual data. After reanalyzing Miller's original data using modern techniques of quantitative error analysis, Roberts found Miller's apparent signals to be statistically insignificant.<ref name=Roberts2006 group=A>{{cite arxiv |last=Roberts |first=T.J. |title=An Explanation of Dayton Miller's Anomalous \"Ether Drift\" Result |eprint=physics/0608238 |year=2006 }}</ref>\n\nUsing a special optical arrangement involving a 1/20 wave step in one mirror, Roy J. Kennedy (1926) and K.K.

The number of weights added or removed provided a measure of the fringe shift. Different observers could detect changes as little as 1/300 to 1/1500 of a fringe.

The first of these highly accurate experiments was conducted by Brillet & Hall (1979), in which they analyzed a laser frequency stabilized to a resonance of a rotating optical [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer|Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot]] cavity. They set a limit on the anisotropy of the speed of light resulting from the Earth's motions of \u0394''c''/''c''&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;10<sup>\u221215</sup>, where \u0394''c'' is the difference between the speed of light in the ''x''- and ''y''-directions.<ref name=brillet />\n\nAs of 2009, optical and microwave resonator experiments have improved this limit to \u0394''c''/''c''&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;10<sup>\u221217</sup>. In some of them, the devices were rotated or remained stationary, and some were combined with the [[Kennedy\u2013Thorndike experiment]]. In particular, Earth's direction and velocity (ca.&nbsp;{{Convert|368|km/s|abbr = on}}) relative to the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation#CMBR dipole anisotropy|CMB rest frame]] are ordinarily used as references in these searches for anisotropies.\n{{Clear}}\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

However, since the nuclear wave functions for different ''M<sub>J</sub>'' have different orientations in space relative to the magnetic field, any orientation dependence, whether from an aether wind or from a dependence on the large-scale distribution of mass in space (see [[Mach's principle]]), would perturb the energy spacings between the four levels, resulting in an anomalous broadening or splitting of the line.

The experiment was performed between April and July 1887 by [[Albert A. Michelson]] and [[Edward W. Morley]] at what is now [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], and published in November of the same year.<ref name=michel2/> It compared the [[speed of light]] in perpendicular directions, in an attempt to detect the [[relative motion]] of matter through the stationary [[luminiferous aether]] (\"aether wind\"). The result was negative, in that Michelson and Morley found no significant difference between the speed of light in the direction of movement through the presumed aether, and the speed at right angles. This result is generally considered to be the first strong evidence against the then-prevalent [[Aether theories|aether theory]], and initiated a line of research that eventually led to [[special relativity]], which rules out a stationary aether.<ref group=A name=staley/> Of this experiment, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] wrote, \"If the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment had not brought us into serious embarrassment, no one would have regarded the relativity theory as a (halfway) redemption.\"<ref group=A name=Folsing>{{cite book|author=Albrecht F\u00f6lsing|title=Albert Einstein: A Biography|isbn=0-14-023719-4|year=1998|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/alberteinsteinbi0000fols}}</ref>{{rp|219}} \n\nMichelson\u2013Morley type experiments have been repeated many times with steadily increasing sensitivity. These include experiments from 1902 to 1905, and a series of experiments in the 1920s. More recent [[optical resonator]] experiments confirmed the absence of any aether wind at the 10<sup>\u221217</sup> level.<ref name=Eisele /><ref name=Herrmann2 /> Together with the [[Ives\u2013Stilwell experiment|Ives\u2013Stilwell]] and [[Kennedy\u2013Thorndike experiment]]s, Michelson\u2013Morley type experiments form one of the fundamental [[tests of special relativity]] theory.<ref name=rob group=A />\n\n== Detecting the aether ==\n[[Physics]] theories of the late 19th century assumed that just as surface water waves must have a supporting substance, i.e., a \"medium\", to move across (in this case water), and audible [[sound]] requires a medium to transmit its wave motions (such as air or water), so light must also require a medium, the \"[[luminiferous aether]]\", to transmit its wave motions. Because light can travel through a vacuum<!-- the article \"a\" is optional, and grammatically ok, so please do not remove it as a grammar correction. See [[wp:RETAIN]]-->, it was assumed that even a vacuum must be filled with aether. Because the [[speed of light]] is so great, and because material bodies pass through the ''aether'' without obvious friction or drag, it was assumed to have a highly unusual combination of properties. Designing experiments to investigate these properties was a high priority of 19th century physics.<ref group=A name=Whittaker />{{rp|411ff}}\n\n[[Earth]] orbits around the [[Sun]] at a speed of around {{Convert|30|km/s|4 = 2|abbr = on}}, or {{Convert| 108000|km/h|abbr = on}}. The Earth is in motion, so two main possibilities were considered: (1)&nbsp;The aether is stationary and only partially [[drag (physics)|dragged]] by Earth (proposed by [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] in 1818), or (2)&nbsp;the aether is completely dragged by Earth and thus shares its motion at Earth's surface (proposed by [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet]] in 1844).<ref group=A name=Jan /> In addition, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1865) recognized the [[Electrodynamics|electromagnetic]] nature of light and developed what are now called [[Maxwell's equations]], but these equations were still interpreted as describing the motion of waves through an aether, whose state of motion was unknown. Eventually, Fresnel's idea of an (almost) stationary aether was preferred because it appeared to be confirmed by the [[Fizeau experiment]] (1851) and the [[aberration of light|aberration of star light]].<ref group=A name=Jan />\n\n[[Image:aetherWind.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2. A depiction of the concept of the \"aether wind\"]]\nAccording to the stationary and the partially-dragged aether hypotheses, Earth and the aether are in relative motion, implying that a so-called \"aether wind\" (Fig.&nbsp;2) should exist. Although it would be possible, in theory, for the Earth's motion to match that of the aether at one moment in time, it was not possible for the Earth to remain at rest with respect to the aether at all times, because of the variation in both the direction and the speed of the motion. At any given point on the Earth's surface, the magnitude and direction of the wind would vary with time of day and season. By analyzing the return speed of light in different directions at various different times, it was thought to be possible to measure the motion of the Earth relative to the aether. The expected relative difference in the measured speed of light was quite small, given that the velocity of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun has a magnitude of about one hundredth of one percent of the speed of light.<ref group=A name=Whittaker />{{rp|417ff}}\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, measurements of aether wind effects of first order, i.e., effects proportional to ''v''/''c'' (''v'' being Earth's velocity, ''c'' the speed of light) were thought to be possible, but no direct measurement of the speed of light was possible with the accuracy required. For instance, the [[Fizeau\u2013Foucault apparatus]] could measure the speed of light to perhaps 5% accuracy, which was quite inadequate for measuring directly a first-order 0.01% change in the speed of light. A number of physicists therefore attempted to make measurements of indirect first-order effects not of the speed of light itself, but of variations in the speed of light (see [[Luminiferous aether#First order experiments|First order aether-drift experiments]]). The [[Hoek experiment]], for example, was intended to detect [[interferometry|interferometric]] [[fringe shift]]s due to speed differences of oppositely propagating light waves through water at rest. The results of such experiments were all negative.<ref group=\"A\" name=\"laub\" /> This could be explained by using [[Aether drag hypothesis#Partial aether dragging|Fresnel's dragging coefficient]], according to which the aether and thus light are partially dragged by moving matter. Partial aether-dragging would thwart attempts to measure any first order change in the speed of light. As pointed out by Maxwell (1878), only experimental arrangements capable of measuring second order effects would have any hope of detecting aether drift, i.e., effects proportional to ''v''<sup>2</sup>/''c''<sup>2</sup>.<ref group=A name=maxa /><ref group=A name=maxb /> Existing experimental setups, however, were not sensitive enough to measure effects of that size.\n\n== 1881 and 1887 experiments ==\n\n=== Michelson experiment (1881) ===\n[[File:Michelson1881c.png|thumb|300px|Michelson's 1881 interferometer. Although ultimately it proved incapable of distinguishing between differing theories of aether-dragging, its construction provided important lessons for the design of Michelson and Morley's 1887 instrument.<ref group=note>Among other lessons was the need to control for vibration. Michelson (1881) wrote: \"...&nbsp;owing to the extreme sensitiveness of the instrument to vibrations, the work could not be carried on during the day. Next, the experiment was tried at night. When the mirrors were placed half-way on the arms the fringes were visible, but their position could not be measured till after twelve o'clock, and then only at intervals. When the mirrors were moved out to the ends of the arms, the fringes were only occasionally visible. It thus appeared that the experiments could not be performed in Berlin, and the apparatus was accordingly removed to the Astrophysicalisches Observatorium in Potsdam&nbsp;... Here, the fringes under ordinary circumstances were sufficiently quiet to measure, but so extraordinarily sensitive was the instrument that the stamping of the pavement, about 100 meters from the observatory, made the fringes disappear entirely!\"</ref>]]\n{{Wikisource|The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether|The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether (1881)}} \nMichelson had a solution to the problem of how to construct a device sufficiently accurate to detect aether flow. In 1877, while teaching at his alma mater, the [[United States Naval Academy]] in Annapolis, Michelson conducted his first known light speed experiments as a part of a classroom demonstration. In 1881, he left active U.S. Naval service while in Germany concluding his studies. In that year, Michelson used a prototype experimental device to make several more measurements.\n\nThe device he designed, later known as a [[Michelson interferometer]], sent [[yellow]] light from a [[sodium]] flame (for alignment), or [[white]] light (for the actual observations), through a [[beam splitter|half-silvered mirror]] that was used to split it into two beams traveling at right angles to one another. After leaving the splitter, the beams traveled out to the ends of long arms where they were reflected back into the middle by small mirrors. They then recombined on the far side of the splitter in an eyepiece, producing a pattern of constructive and destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] whose transverse displacement would depend on the relative time it takes light to transit the longitudinal ''vs.'' the transverse arms. If the Earth is traveling through an aether medium, a light beam traveling parallel to the flow of that aether will take longer to reflect back and forth than would a beam traveling perpendicular to the aether, because the increase in elapsed time from traveling against the aether wind is more than the time saved by traveling with the aether wind.  Michelson expected that the Earth's motion would produce a [[fringe shift]] equal to 0.04 fringes\u2014that is, of the separation between areas of the same intensity. He did not observe the expected shift; the greatest average deviation that he measured (in the northwest direction) was only 0.018 fringes; most of his measurements were much less. His conclusion was that Fresnel's hypothesis of a stationary aether with partial aether dragging would have to be rejected, and thus he confirmed Stokes' hypothesis of complete aether dragging.<ref name=michel1/>\n\nHowever, [[Alfred Potier]] (and later [[Hendrik Lorentz]]) pointed out to Michelson that he had made an error of calculation, and that the expected fringe shift should have been only 0.02 fringes.  Michelson's apparatus was subject to experimental errors far too large to say anything conclusive about the aether wind. Definitive measurement of the aether wind would require an experiment with greater accuracy and better controls than the original. Nevertheless, the prototype was successful in demonstrating that the basic method was feasible.<ref group=A name=Jan /><ref group=A name=AIMiller />\n\n=== Michelson\u2013Morley experiment (1887) ===\n{{Wikisource|On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether|On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether (1887)}}\n[[Image:On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether - Fig 4.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 5.

''e' '' is a fine adjustment mirror. ''f'' is a telescope.]]\n\nIn 1885, Michelson began a collaboration with [[Edward Morley]], spending considerable time and money to confirm with higher accuracy [[Fizeau experiment|Fizeau's 1851 experiment]] on Fresnel's drag coefficient,<ref name=michel1a /> to improve on Michelson's 1881 experiment,<ref name=michel2 /> and to establish the wavelength of light as a [[Length measurement|standard of length]].<ref name=michel3 /><ref name=michel4 /> At this time Michelson was professor of physics at the Case School of Applied Science, and Morley was professor of chemistry at Western Reserve University (WRU), which shared a campus with the Case School on the eastern edge of Cleveland. Michelson suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] in September 1885, from which he recovered by October 1885. Morley ascribed this breakdown to the intense work of Michelson during the preparation of the experiments. In 1886, Michelson and Morley successfully confirmed Fresnel's drag coefficient \u2013 this result was also considered as a confirmation of the stationary aether concept.<ref group=A name=staley />\n\nThis result strengthened their hope of finding the aether wind. Michelson and Morley created an improved version of the Michelson experiment with more than enough accuracy to detect this hypothetical effect. The experiment was performed in several periods of concentrated observations between April and July 1887, in the basement of Adelbert Dormitory of WRU (later renamed Pierce Hall, demolished in 1962).<ref group=A name=Fickinger /><ref group=A name=hamerla />\n\nAs shown in Fig.&nbsp;5, the light was repeatedly reflected back and forth along the arms of the interferometer, increasing the path length to {{Convert|11|m|abbr = on}}. At this length, the drift would be about 0.4 fringes. To make that easily detectable, the apparatus was assembled in a closed room in the basement of the heavy stone dormitory, eliminating most thermal and vibrational effects. Vibrations were further reduced by building the apparatus on top of a large block of sandstone (Fig.&nbsp;1), about a foot thick and {{convert|5|ft|spell=in}} square, which was then floated in a circular trough of mercury. They estimated that effects of about 0.01 fringe would be detectable.\n\n[[File:MichelsonCoinAirLumiereBlanche.JPG|thumb|Figure 6. Fringe pattern produced with a Michelson interferometer using white light. As configured here, the central fringe is white rather than black.]]\nMichelson and Morley and other early experimentalists using interferometric techniques in an attempt to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether, used (partially) monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment, always switching to white light for the actual measurements. The reason is that measurements were recorded visually. Purely monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern. Lacking modern means of [[air conditioning|environmental temperature control]], experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift even when the interferometer was set up in a basement. Because the fringes would occasionally disappear due to vibrations caused by passing horse traffic, distant thunderstorms and the like, an observer could easily \"get lost\" when the fringes returned to visibility. The advantages of white light, which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern, far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low [[coherence length]]. As [[Dayton Miller]] wrote, \"White light fringes were chosen for the observations because they consist of a small group of fringes having a central, sharply defined black fringe which forms a permanent zero reference mark for all readings.\"<ref group=A name=Miller1933/><ref group=note>If one uses a half-silvered mirror as the beam splitter, the reflected beam will undergo a different number of front-surface reflections than the transmitted beam. At each front-surface reflection, the light will undergo a phase inversion. Because the two beams undergo a different number of phase inversions, when the path lengths of the two beams match or differ by an integral number of wavelengths (e.g. 0, 1, 2&nbsp;...), there will be destructive interference and a weak signal at the detector. If the path lengths of the beams differ by a half-integral number of wavelengths (e.g., 0.5, 1.5, 2.5&nbsp;...), constructive interference will yield a strong signal. The results are opposite if a cube beam-splitter is used, because a cube beam-splitter makes no distinction between a front- and rear-surface reflection.</ref> Use of partially monochromatic light (yellow sodium light) during initial alignment enabled the researchers to locate the position of equal path length, more or less easily, before switching to white light.<ref group=note>Sodium light produces a fringe pattern that displays cycles of fuzziness and sharpness that repeat every several hundred fringes over a distance of approximately a millimeter. This pattern is due to the yellow sodium D line being actually a doublet, the individual lines of which have a limited [[coherence length]]. After aligning the interferometer to display the centermost portion of the sharpest set of fringes, the researcher would switch to white light.</ref>\n\nThe mercury trough allowed the device to turn with close to zero friction, so that once having given the sandstone block a single push it would slowly rotate through the entire range of possible angles to the \"aether wind,\" while measurements were continuously observed by looking through the eyepiece. The hypothesis of aether drift implies that because one of the arms would inevitably turn into the direction of the wind at the same time that another arm was turning perpendicularly to the wind, an effect should be noticeable even over a period of minutes.\n\nThe expectation was that the effect would be graphable as a sine wave with two peaks and two troughs per rotation of the device. This result could have been expected because during each full rotation, each arm would be parallel to the wind twice (facing into and away from the wind giving identical readings) and perpendicular to the wind twice. Additionally, due to the Earth's rotation, the wind would be expected to show periodic changes in direction and magnitude during the course of a [[sidereal day]].\n\nBecause of the motion of the Earth around the Sun, the measured data were also expected to show annual variations.\n\n=== Most famous \"failed\" experiment ===\n[[File:Michelson Morley 1887 Figure 6.png|thumb|300px|Figure 7. Michelson and Morley's results. The upper solid line is the curve for their observations at noon, and the lower solid line is that for their evening observations. Note that the theoretical curves and the observed curves are not plotted at the same scale: the dotted curves, in fact, represent only ''one-eighth of the theoretical displacements.'']]\nAfter all this thought and preparation, the experiment became what has been called the most famous failed experiment in history.<ref group=A name=blum /> Instead of providing insight into the properties of the aether, Michelson and Morley's article in the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'' reported the measurement to be as small as one-fortieth of the expected displacement (Fig.&nbsp;7), but \"since the displacement is proportional to the square of the velocity\" they concluded that the measured velocity was \"probably less than one-sixth\" of the expected velocity of the Earth's motion in orbit and \"certainly less than one-fourth.\"<ref name=michel2 /> Although this small \"velocity\" was measured, it was considered far too small to be used as evidence of speed relative to the aether, and it was understood to be within the range of an experimental error that would allow the speed to actually be zero.<ref group=A name=staley /> For instance, Michelson wrote about the \"decidedly negative result\" in a letter to [[Lord Rayleigh]] in August 1887:<ref group=A name=shankland2 />\n\n{{Quote|The Experiments on the relative motion of the earth and ether have been completed and the result decidedly negative. The expected deviation of the interference fringes from the zero should have been 0.40 of a fringe \u2013 the maximum displacement was 0.02 and the average much less than 0.01 \u2013 and then not in the right place. As displacement is proportional to squares of the relative velocities it follows that if the ether does slip past the relative velocity is less than one sixth of the earth\u2019s velocity.|Albert Abraham Michelson, 1887}}\n\nFrom the standpoint of the then current aether models, the experimental results were conflicting. The [[Fizeau experiment]] and its 1886 repetition by Michelson and Morley apparently confirmed the stationary aether with partial aether dragging, and refuted complete aether dragging. On the other hand, the much more precise Michelson\u2013Morley experiment (1887) apparently confirmed complete aether dragging and refuted the stationary aether.<ref group=A name=Jan /> In addition, the Michelson\u2013Morley null result was further substantiated by the null results of other second-order experiments of different kind, namely the [[Trouton\u2013Noble experiment]] (1903) and the [[experiments of Rayleigh and Brace]] (1902\u20131904). These problems and their solution led to the development of the [[Lorentz transformation]] and [[special relativity]].\n\nAfter the \"failed\" experiment Michelson and Morley ceased their aether drift measurements and started to use their newly developed technique to establish the wavelength of light as a [[Length measurement|standard of length]].<ref name=michel3 /><ref name=michel4 />\n\n== Light path analysis and consequences ==\n=== Observer resting in the aether ===\n[[File:Michelson-morley calculations.svg|thumb|300px|Expected differential phase shift between light traveling the longitudinal versus the transverse arms of the Michelson\u2013Morley apparatus]]\nThe beam travel time in the longitudinal direction can be derived as follows:<ref group=A name=Feynman /> Light is sent from the source and propagates with the speed of light <math display=\"inline\">c</math> in the aether. It passes through the half-silvered mirror at the origin at <math display=\"inline\">T=0</math>.  The reflecting mirror is at that moment at distance <math display=\"inline\">L</math> (the length of the interferometer arm) and is moving with velocity <math display=\"inline\">v</math>. The beam hits the mirror at time <math display=\"inline\">T_1</math> and thus travels the distance <math display=\"inline\">cT_1</math>. At this time, the mirror has traveled the distance <math display=\"inline\">vT_1</math>. Thus <math display=\"inline\">cT_1 =L+vT_1</math> and consequently the travel time <math display=\"inline\">T_1=L/(c-v)</math>. The same consideration applies to the backward journey, with the sign of <math display=\"inline\">v</math> reversed, resulting in <math display=\"inline\">cT_2 =L-vT_2</math> and <math display=\"inline\">T_2 =L/(c+v)</math>. The total travel time <math display=\"inline\">T_\\ell=T_1+T_2</math> is:\n\n:<math>T_\\ell=\\frac{L}{c-v}+\\frac{L}{c+v} =\\frac{2L}{c}\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\approx\\frac{2L}{c} \\left(1+\\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)</math>\n\nMichelson obtained this expression correctly in 1881, however, in transverse direction he obtained the incorrect expression\n\n:<math>T_t=\\frac{2L}{c},</math>\n\nbecause he overlooked the increased path length in the rest frame of the aether. This was corrected by [[Alfred Potier]] (1882) and [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1886). The derivation in the transverse direction can be given as follows (analogous to the derivation of [[time dilation]] using a [[Time dilation#Simple inference of time dilation due to relative velocity|light clock]]): The beam is propagating at the speed of light <math display=\"inline\">c</math> and hits the mirror at time <math display=\"inline\">T_3</math>, traveling the distance <math display=\"inline\">cT_3</math>. At the same time, the mirror has traveled the distance <math display=\"inline\">vT_3</math> in the ''x'' direction. So in order to hit the mirror, the travel path of the beam is <math display=\"inline\">L</math> in the ''y'' direction (assuming equal-length arms) and <math display=\"inline\">vT_3</math> in the ''x'' direction. This inclined travel path follows from the transformation from the interferometer rest frame to the aether rest frame.

So the result would be a delay in one of the light beams that could be detected when the beams were recombined through interference. Any slight change in the spent time would then be observed as a shift in the positions of the interference fringes. The negative result led Michelson to the conclusion that there is no measurable aether drift.<ref name=michel2 />\n\n=== Observer comoving with the interferometer ===\nIf the same situation is described from the view of an observer co-moving with the interferometer, then the effect of aether wind is similar to the effect experienced by a swimmer, who tries to move with velocity <math display=\"inline\">c</math> against a river flowing with velocity <math display=\"inline\">v</math>.<ref group=A name=teller />\n\nIn the longitudinal direction the swimmer first moves upstream, so his velocity is diminished due to the river flow to <math display=\"inline\">c-v</math>. On his way back moving downstream, his velocity is increased to <math display=\"inline\">c+v</math>. This gives the beam travel times <math display=\"inline\">T_1</math> and  <math display=\"inline\">T_2</math> as mentioned above.\n\nIn the transverse direction, the swimmer has to compensate for the river flow by moving at a certain angle against the flow direction, in order to sustain his exact transverse direction of motion and to reach the other side of the river at the correct location. This diminishes his speed to <math display=\"inline\">\\sqrt{c^2-v^2}</math>, and gives the beam travel time <math display=\"inline\">T_3</math> as mentioned above.\n\n=== Mirror reflection ===\nThe classical analysis predicted a relative phase shift between the longitudinal and transverse beams which in Michelson and Morley's apparatus should have been readily measurable. What is not often appreciated (since there was no means of measuring it), is that motion through the hypothetical aether should also have caused the two beams to diverge as they emerged from the interferometer by about 10<sup>\u22128</sup> radians.<ref group=A name=schum94 />\n\nFor an apparatus in motion, the classical analysis requires that the beam-splitting mirror be slightly offset from an exact 45\u00b0 if the longitudinal and transverse beams are to emerge from the apparatus exactly superimposed. In the relativistic analysis, Lorentz-contraction of the beam splitter in the direction of motion causes it to become more perpendicular by precisely the amount necessary to compensate for the angle discrepancy of the two beams.<ref group=A name=schum94 />\n\n=== Length contraction and Lorentz transformation ===\n{{Further|History of special relativity|History of Lorentz transformations}}\nA first step to explaining the Michelson and Morley experiment's null result was found in the [[Length contraction|FitzGerald\u2013Lorentz contraction hypothesis]], now simply called length contraction or Lorentz contraction, first proposed by [[George FitzGerald]] (1889) and [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1892).<ref group=A name=lorentz95 /> According to this law all objects physically contract by <math display=\"inline\">L/\\gamma</math> along the line of motion (originally thought to be relative to the aether), <math display=\"inline\">\\gamma=1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}</math> being the [[Lorentz factor]]. This hypothesis was partly motivated by [[Oliver Heaviside]]'s discovery in 1888 that electrostatic fields are contracting in the line of motion. But since there was no reason at that time to assume that binding forces in matter are of electric origin, length contraction of matter in motion with respect to the aether was considered an [[Ad hoc hypothesis]].<ref group=A name=AIMiller />\n\nIf length contraction of <math display=\"inline\">L</math> is inserted into the above formula for <math display=\"inline\">T_\\ell</math>, then the light propagation time in the longitudinal direction becomes equal to that in the transverse direction:\n\n:<math>T_\\ell=\\frac{2L\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}{c}\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}=\\frac{2L}{c} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=T_t</math>\n\nHowever, length contraction is only a special case of the more general relation, according to which the transverse length is larger than the longitudinal length by the ratio <math display=\"inline\">\\gamma</math>. This can be achieved in many ways. If <math display=\"inline\">L_1</math> is the moving longitudinal length and <math display=\"inline\">L_2</math> the moving transverse length, <math display=\"inline\">L'_1=L'_2</math> being the rest lengths, then it is given:<ref group=A name=lorentz04 />\n\n:<math>\\frac{L_2}{L_1}=\\frac{L'_2}{\\varphi}\\left/\\frac{L'_1}{\\gamma\\varphi}\\right.=\\gamma.</math>\n\n<math display=\"inline\">\\varphi</math> can be arbitrarily chosen, so there are infinitely many combinations to explain the Michelson\u2013Morley null result. For instance, if <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi=1</math> the relativistic value of length contraction of <math display=\"inline\">L_1</math> occurs, but if <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi=1/\\gamma</math> then no length contraction but an elongation of <math display=\"inline\">L_2</math> occurs. This hypothesis was later extended by [[Joseph Larmor]] (1897), Lorentz (1904) and [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1905), who developed the complete [[Lorentz transformation]] including [[time dilation]] in order to explain the [[Trouton\u2013Noble experiment]], the [[Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace]], and [[Kaufmann\u2013Bucherer\u2013Neumann experiments|Kaufmann's experiments]]. It has the form\n\n:<math>x'=\\gamma\\varphi(x-vt),\\ y'=\\varphi y,\\ z'=\\varphi z,\\ t'=\\gamma\\varphi\\left(t-\\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right)</math>\n\nIt remained to define the value of <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi</math>, which was shown by Lorentz (1904) to be unity.<ref group=A name=lorentz04 /> In general, Poincar\u00e9 (1905)<ref group=A name=poincare05 /> demonstrated that only <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi=1</math> allows this transformation to form a [[Lorentz group|group]], so it is the only choice compatible with the [[principle of relativity]], ''i.e.,'' making the stationary aether undetectable. Given this, length contraction and time dilation obtain their exact relativistic values.\n\n=== Special relativity ===\n[[Albert Einstein]] formulated the theory of [[special relativity]] by 1905, deriving the Lorentz transformation and thus length contraction and time dilation from the relativity postulate and the constancy of the speed of light, thus removing the ''ad hoc'' character from the contraction hypothesis. Einstein emphasized the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] foundation of the theory and the modification of the notion of space and time, with the stationary aether no longer playing any role in his theory. He also pointed out the group character of the transformation. Einstein was motivated by [[Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]] (in the form as it was given by Lorentz in 1895) and the lack of evidence for the [[luminiferous aether]].<ref group=A name=einstein />\n\nThis allows a more elegant and intuitive explanation of the Michelson\u2013Morley null result. In a comoving frame the null result is self-evident, since the apparatus can be considered as at rest in accordance with the relativity principle, thus the beam travel times are the same. In a frame relative to which the apparatus is moving, the same reasoning applies as described above in \"Length contraction and Lorentz transformation\", except the word \"aether\" has to be replaced by \"non-comoving inertial frame\". Einstein wrote in 1916:<ref group=A name=einstein2 />\n\n{{Quote|Although the estimated difference between these two times is exceedingly small, Michelson and Morley performed an experiment involving interference in which this difference should have been clearly detectable. But the experiment gave a negative result \u2014 a fact very perplexing to physicists. Lorentz and FitzGerald rescued the theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body relative to the \u00e6ther produces a contraction of the body in the direction of motion, the amount of contraction being just sufficient to compensate for the difference in time mentioned above. Comparison with the discussion in Section 11 shows that also from the standpoint of the theory of relativity this solution of the difficulty was the right one. But on the basis of the theory of relativity the method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory. According to this theory there is no such thing as a \"specially favoured\" (unique) co-ordinate system to occasion the introduction of the \u00e6ther-idea, and hence there can be no \u00e6ther-drift, nor any experiment with which to demonstrate it. Here the contraction of moving bodies follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory, without the introduction of particular hypotheses; and as the prime factor involved in this contraction we find, not the motion in itself, to which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to the body of reference chosen in the particular case in point. Thus for a co-ordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of Michelson and Morley is not shortened, but it is shortened for a co-ordinate system which is at rest relatively to the sun.|Albert Einstein, 1916}}\n\nThe extent to which the null result of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment influenced Einstein is disputed. Alluding to some statements of Einstein, many historians argue that it played no significant role in his path to special relativity,<ref group=A name=stachel /><ref group=A name=Polanyi /> while other statements of Einstein probably suggest that he was influenced by it.<ref group=A name=dongen /> In any case, the null result of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment helped the notion of the constancy of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance.<ref group=A name=stachel />\n\nIt was later shown by [[Howard Percy Robertson]] (1949) and others<ref name=rob group=A /><ref name=sexl group=A /> (see [[Test theories of special relativity|Robertson\u2013Mansouri\u2013Sexl test theory]]), that it is possible to derive the Lorentz transformation entirely from the combination of three experiments. First, the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment showed that the speed of light is independent of the ''orientation'' of the apparatus, establishing the relationship between longitudinal (\u03b2) and transverse (\u03b4) lengths. Then in 1932, Roy Kennedy and Edward Thorndike modified the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment by making the path lengths of the split beam unequal, with one arm being very short.<ref name=KennedyThorndike/> The [[Kennedy\u2013Thorndike experiment]] took place for many months as the Earth moved around the sun. Their negative result showed that the speed of light is independent of the ''velocity'' of the apparatus in different inertial frames. In addition it established that besides length changes, corresponding time changes must also occur, i.e., it established the relationship between longitudinal lengths (\u03b2) and time changes (\u03b1). So both experiments do not provide the individual values of these quantities. This uncertainty corresponds to the undefined factor <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi</math> as described above. It was clear due to theoretical reasons (the [[Lorentz group|group character]] of the Lorentz transformation as required by the relativity principle) that the individual values of length contraction and time dilation must assume their exact relativistic form. But a direct measurement of one of these quantities was still desirable to confirm the theoretical results. This was achieved by the [[Ives\u2013Stilwell experiment]] (1938), measuring \u03b1 in accordance with time dilation. Combining this value for \u03b1 with the Kennedy\u2013Thorndike null result shows that ''\u03b2'' must assume the value of relativistic length contraction. Combining ''\u03b2'' with the Michelson\u2013Morley null result shows that ''\u03b4'' must be zero. Therefore, the Lorentz transformation with <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi=1</math> is an unavoidable consequence of the combination of these three experiments.<ref name=rob group=A />\n\nSpecial relativity is generally considered the solution to all negative aether drift (or [[isotropy]] of the speed of light) measurements, including the Michelson\u2013Morley null result. Many high precision measurements have been conducted as tests of special relativity and [[modern searches for Lorentz violation]] in the [[photon]], [[electron]], [[nucleon]], or [[neutrino]] sector, all of them confirming relativity.\n\n=== Incorrect alternatives ===\nAs mentioned above, Michelson initially believed that his experiment would confirm Stokes' theory, according to which the aether was fully dragged in the vicinity of the earth (see [[Aether drag hypothesis]]). However, complete aether drag contradicts the observed [[aberration of light]] and was contradicted by other experiments as well. In addition, Lorentz showed in 1886 that Stokes's attempt to explain aberration is contradictory.<ref group=A name=Jan /><ref group=A name=Whittaker />\n\nFurthermore, the assumption that the aether is not carried in the vicinity, but only ''within'' matter, was very problematic as shown by the [[Hammar experiment]] (1935). Hammar directed one leg of his interferometer through a heavy metal pipe plugged with lead. If aether were dragged by mass, it was theorized that the mass of the sealed metal pipe would have been enough to cause a visible effect. Once again, no effect was seen, so aether-drag theories are considered to be disproven.\n\n[[Walther Ritz]]'s [[emission theory]] (or ballistic theory) was also consistent with the results of the experiment, not requiring aether. The theory postulates that light has always the same velocity in respect to the source.<ref name=norton group=A /> However [[De Sitter double star experiment|de Sitter]] noted that emitter theory predicted several optical effects that were not seen in observations of binary stars in which the light from the two stars could be measured in a [[spectrometer]]. If emission theory were correct, the light from the stars should experience unusual fringe shifting due to the velocity of the stars being added to the speed of the light, but no such effect could be seen. It was later shown by [[J. G. Fox]] that the original de Sitter experiments were flawed due to [[Extinction theorem of Ewald and Oseen|extinction]],<ref name=fox65>{{Citation|last=Fox |first=J.

Other versions of the experiment were carried out with increasing sophistication.<ref group=A name=Swenson1 /><ref group=A name=Swenson2 /> Morley was not convinced of his own results, and went on to conduct additional experiments with [[Dayton Miller]] from 1902 to 1904. Again, the result was negative within the margins of error.<ref name=morley1 /><ref name=morley2/>\n\nMiller worked on increasingly larger interferometers, culminating in one with a {{Convert|32|m|adj = on|sp = us}} (effective) arm length that he tried at various sites, including on top of a mountain at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. To avoid the possibility of the aether wind being blocked by solid walls, his mountaintop observations used a special shed with thin walls, mainly of canvas. From noisy, irregular data, he consistently extracted a small positive signal that varied with each rotation of the device, with the [[Sidereal time|sidereal day]], and on a yearly basis. His measurements in the 1920s amounted to approximately {{Convert|10|km/s|abbr = on}} instead of the nearly {{Convert|30|km/s|4 = 1|abbr = on}} expected from the Earth's orbital motion alone. He remained convinced this was due to [[aether drag hypothesis#Partial aether dragging|partial entrainment or aether dragging]], though he did not attempt a detailed explanation. He ignored critiques demonstrating the inconsistency of his results and the refutation by the [[Hammar experiment]].<ref group=A name=Thirring /><ref group=note name=Thirring>Thirring (1926) as well as Lorentz pointed out that Miller's results failed even the most basic criteria required to believe in their celestial origin, namely that the azimuth of supposed drift should exhibit daily variations consistent with the source rotating about the celestial pole. Instead, while Miller's observations showed daily variations, their oscillations in one set of experiments might center, say, around a northwest\u2013southeast line.</ref> Miller's findings were considered important at the time, and were discussed by Michelson, [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] and others at a meeting reported in 1928.<ref group=A name=michel1928 /> There was general agreement that more experimentation was needed to check Miller's results. Miller later built a non-magnetic device to eliminate [[magnetostriction]], while Michelson built one of non-expanding [[Invar]] to eliminate any remaining thermal effects. Other experimenters from around the world increased accuracy, eliminated possible side effects, or both. So far, no one has been able to replicate Miller's results, and modern experimental accuracies have ruled them out.<ref group=A name=shankland /> Roberts (2006) has pointed out that the primitive data reduction techniques used by Miller and other early experimenters, including Michelson and Morley, were capable of ''creating'' apparent periodic signals even when none existed in the actual data. After reanalyzing Miller's original data using modern techniques of quantitative error analysis, Roberts found Miller's apparent signals to be statistically insignificant.<ref name=Roberts2006 group=A>{{cite arxiv |last=Roberts |first=T.J. |title=An Explanation of Dayton Miller's Anomalous \"Ether Drift\" Result |eprint=physics/0608238 |year=2006 }}</ref>\n\nUsing a special optical arrangement involving a 1/20 wave step in one mirror, Roy J. Kennedy (1926) and K.K. Illingworth (1927) (Fig.&nbsp;8) converted the task of detecting fringe shifts from the relatively insensitive one of estimating their lateral displacements to the considerably more sensitive task of adjusting the light intensity on both sides of a sharp boundary for equal luminance.<ref name=Kennedy/><ref name=Illingworth/> If they observed unequal illumination on either side of the step, such as in Fig.&nbsp;8e, they would add or remove calibrated weights from the interferometer until both sides of the step were once again evenly illuminated, as in Fig.&nbsp;8d. The number of weights added or removed provided a measure of the fringe shift. Different observers could detect changes as little as 1/300 to 1/1500 of a fringe. Kennedy also carried out an experiment at Mount Wilson, finding only about 1/10 the drift measured by Miller and no seasonal effects.<ref group=A name=michel1928 />\n\nIn 1930, [[Georg Joos]] conducted an experiment using an automated interferometer with {{Convert|21|m|ft|-long|sp = us|adj = mid}} arms forged from pressed quartz having a very low coefficient of thermal expansion, that took continuous photographic strip recordings of the fringes through dozens of revolutions of the apparatus.

The first of these highly accurate experiments was conducted by Brillet & Hall (1979), in which they analyzed a laser frequency stabilized to a resonance of a rotating optical [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer|Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot]] cavity. They set a limit on the anisotropy of the speed of light resulting from the Earth's motions of \u0394''c''/''c''&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;10<sup>\u221215</sup>, where \u0394''c'' is the difference between the speed of light in the ''x''- and ''y''-directions.<ref name=brillet />\n\nAs of 2009, optical and microwave resonator experiments have improved this limit to \u0394''c''/''c''&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;10<sup>\u221217</sup>. In some of them, the devices were rotated or remained stationary, and some were combined with the [[Kennedy\u2013Thorndike experiment]]. In particular, Earth's direction and velocity (ca.&nbsp;{{Convert|368|km/s|abbr = on}}) relative to the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation#CMBR dipole anisotropy|CMB rest frame]] are ordinarily used as references in these searches for anisotropies.\n{{Clear}}\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

The sharp, unsplit NMR line of this isotope of lithium is evidence for the isotropy of mass and space.]]\nExamples of other experiments not based on the Michelson\u2013Morley principle, i.e., non-optical isotropy tests achieving an even higher level of precision, are [[Hughes\u2013Drever experiment|Clock comparison or Hughes\u2013Drever experiments]]. In Drever's 1961 experiment, <sup>7</sup>Li nuclei in the ground state, which has total angular momentum ''J''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3/2, were split into four equally spaced levels by a magnetic field. Each transition between a pair of adjacent levels should emit a photon of equal frequency, resulting in a single, sharp spectral line. However, since the nuclear wave functions for different ''M<sub>J</sub>'' have different orientations in space relative to the magnetic field, any orientation dependence, whether from an aether wind or from a dependence on the large-scale distribution of mass in space (see [[Mach's principle]]), would perturb the energy spacings between the four levels, resulting in an anomalous broadening or splitting of the line. No such broadening was observed. Modern repeats of this kind of experiment have provided some of the most accurate confirmations of the principle of [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]].<ref group=A name=haugan/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Michelson\u2013Morley Award]]\n* [[Moving magnet and conductor problem]]\n* [[The Light (Glass)|''The Light'' (Glass)]]\n* [[LIGO]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist|60em|group=note}}\n\n=== Experiments ===\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=antonini>{{cite journal |last1=Antonini |first1=P. |last2=Okhapkin |first2=M. |last3=G\u00f6kl\u00fc |first3=E. |last4=Schiller |first4=S. |title=Test of constancy of speed of light with rotating cryogenic optical resonators |journal=Physical Review A |volume=71 |issue=5 |year=2005 |page=050101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.71.050101|arxiv=gr-qc/0504109|bibcode = 2005PhRvA..71e0101A }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=brillet>{{cite journal |last1=Brillet |first=A. |last2=Hall |first2=J.

It was first broadcast on television on Saturday, November 3, 1956. The film was shown as the last installment of the CBS [[anthology series]] ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]''. Since that telecast, it has been shown respectively by [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[The WB]], and several of [[Ted Turner]]'s national cable channels. It has never been licensed to any local affiliate broadcast TV station. From 1959 until 1991, it was an annual tradition on American commercial network television. During these years, and for several afterwards, it was always shown as a television special.\n\nAfter the film was shown on television for the second time, network telecasts of it became a much-anticipated family event in the United States, drawing large audiences annually for many years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941895,00.html | work=Time | title=Television: The Oz Bowl Game | date=January 15, 1965 | accessdate=May 25, 2010 | quote= Parents are again preparing for the occasion.

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV program)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year-old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.<ref name=VarReview/><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p.215</ref>\n\nThe film was a ratings success with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Telecasts in the pre-cable era==\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun, Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun, Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], Bert Lahr, and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg.

When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the Library of Congress and the National Film Preservation Board. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p. C16. {{ISSN|0362-4331}}.</ref>\n\n==Move to cable==\nIn the 1980s, [[Ted Turner]] purchased the film from MGM, alongside ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer. In 2002, it was shown five times.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOn November 6, 2011, TBS became the American television channel on which ''The Wizard of Oz'' has been shown most often, when the film had its 32nd showing on that channel, finally breaking CBS' record 31 showings. As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s.

This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily. In addition, the prime time hour generally given to affiliates for local programming was taken back in order to run the movie early. This practice continued until the film was sold to NBC.\n*1959 - CBS - Sunday, December 13 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The first of the film's annual showings. It was the success of this telecast, which gained a wider audience than the first, that persuaded CBS to make the film an annual tradition on television.\n*1960 - CBS - Sunday, December 11 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1961 - CBS - Sunday, December 10 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Only time fully shown in Black & White\n*1962 - CBS - Sunday, December 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.  December 16 in Hawaii - 5:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1964 - CBS - Sunday, January 26 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe reason that the film did not air in December 1963 has never been stated, but some say that it was because of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\n*1965 - CBS - Sunday, January 17 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1966 - CBS - Sunday, January 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1967 - CBS - Sunday, February 12 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nLast airing on CBS until 1976.

The first time that the film was shown at 7:00 P.M instead of 6:00 P.M.\n*1969 - NBC - Sunday, March 9 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1970 - NBC - Sunday, March 15 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1971 - NBC - Sunday, April 18 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1972 - NBC - Tuesday, March 7 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe first time that the film aired in the middle of the week, rather than on a weekend.\n*1973 - NBC - Sunday, April 8 - 7:00 \n*1974 - NBC - Sunday, February 24 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Due to a breaking news story, NBC decided to show the film two weeks later, on March 10, rather than show it too late or in progress.\n*1975 - NBC - Easter Sunday, March 30 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1976 - CBS - Sunday, March 14 - 7 p.m.\nThe year that ''The Wizard Of Oz'' returned to CBS. It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7\u20138 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1\u20138 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6\u20138 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV program)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.<ref name=VarReview/><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p.215</ref>\n\nThe film was a ratings success with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Telecasts in the pre-cable era==\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun, Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun, Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], Bert Lahr, and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg.

When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the Library of Congress and the National Film Preservation Board. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p. C16. {{ISSN|0362-4331}}.</ref>\n\n==Move to cable==\nIn the 1980s, [[Ted Turner]] purchased the film from MGM, alongside ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer. In 2002, it was shown five times.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOn November 6, 2011, TBS became the American television channel on which ''The Wizard of Oz'' has been shown most often, when the film had its 32nd showing on that channel, finally breaking CBS' record 31 showings. As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s.

It was shown in color although very few people owned color TV sets. This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily. In addition, the prime time hour generally given to affiliates for local programming was taken back in order to run the movie early. This practice continued until the film was sold to NBC.\n*1959 - CBS - Sunday, December 13 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The first of the film's annual showings. It was the success of this telecast, which gained a wider audience than the first, that persuaded CBS to make the film an annual tradition on television.\n*1960 - CBS - Sunday, December 11 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1961 - CBS - Sunday, December 10 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Only time fully shown in Black & White\n*1962 - CBS - Sunday, December 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.  December 16 in Hawaii - 5:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1964 - CBS - Sunday, January 26 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe reason that the film did not air in December 1963 has never been stated, but some say that it was because of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\n*1965 - CBS - Sunday, January 17 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1966 - CBS - Sunday, January 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1967 - CBS - Sunday, February 12 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nLast airing on CBS until 1976.

The first time that the film was shown at 7:00 P.M instead of 6:00 P.M.\n*1969 - NBC - Sunday, March 9 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1970 - NBC - Sunday, March 15 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1971 - NBC - Sunday, April 18 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1972 - NBC - Tuesday, March 7 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe first time that the film aired in the middle of the week, rather than on a weekend.\n*1973 - NBC - Sunday, April 8 - 7:00 \n*1974 - NBC - Sunday, February 24 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Due to a breaking news story, NBC decided to show the film two weeks later, on March 10, rather than show it too late or in progress.\n*1975 - NBC - Easter Sunday, March 30 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1976 - CBS - Sunday, March 14 - 7 p.m.\nThe year that ''The Wizard Of Oz'' returned to CBS. It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7\u20138 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1\u20138 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6\u20138 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

He had been the local MP since the constituency was created in 1885. He had started his legal career as the Barrister for the [[Miners' National Union]], giving him a particular affinity with the large number of miners living in the constituency.\n\n==Previous result==\nThe seat had always been a safe Liberal seat, and was so at the last election;\n[[File:Llewellyn_Atherley-Jones.jpg|thumb|140px|Atherley-Jones]]\n{{Election box begin | title=[[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|General election December 1910]]<ref>British parliamentary election results 1885-1918, Craig, F.W.S.

He was Liberal MP for [[Plymouth (UK Parliament constituency)]] between the two general elections of 1910. He was chairman of the executive committee of the Land Nationalisation Society and a director of the [[Garden city movement|First Garden City Ltd]]. He belonged to a [[Middlesbrough]] firm of ironmasters.\n*The Unionist candidate was James Ogden Hardicker. He had been their defeated candidate at the last General Election in December 1910.\n*The Labour Party decided to intervene, having never fielded a candidate here before. Their candidate, 44-year-old [[G. H. Stuart-Bunning]] was well travelled. He had stood at the [[York (UK Parliament constituency)|York]] division of Yorkshire at the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]],<ref>K. D. Brown, ''The First Labour Party, 1906-1914'', p.108</ref> then in the [[1908 Dundee by-election]] in Scotland, then at the January 1910 general election at [[Eccles (UK Parliament constituency)|Eccles]] in Lancashire, before alighting in Durham. In each case he had finished bottom of the poll.<ref>British parliamentary election results 1885-1918, Craig, F.W.S. (1974)</ref> He had no links to the constituency or to the mining industry. He was sponsored by the [[Postmen's Federation]].\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Aneurin_Williams.jpg|thumb|150px|Aneurin Williams]]\nPolling Day was set for 30 January 1914. Given the large number of miners and iron-workers among the electorate, issues affecting those voters were expected to feature.\n\nThe Liberal candidate Aneurin Williams launched his campaign at a public meeting in [[Consett]] on 5 January 1914, at which he was supported by his brother, the Liberal MP for Middlesbrough, [[Penry Williams]].<ref>Dundee Courier, Angus, 6 Jan 1914</ref> On 6 January 1914, Williams spoke at the Co-operative Hall, [[Stanley, County Durham|Stanley]] sharing a platform with Mr. Straughan.<ref>Newcastle Journal, Tyne and Wear, 7 Jan 1914</ref> On 9 January 1914 Williams spoke at a public meeting in [[Quebec, County Durham|Quebec]] alongside the Rev. Thomas Dale of [[Waterhouses, County Durham|Waterhouses]], who said the Liberal party in the division had secured a very worthy candidate.<ref>Newcastle Journal, Tyne and Wear, 10 Jan 1914</ref>\n\nOn 20 January 1914, the Liberal candidate, Aneurin Williams declared that he advocated [[Irish Home Rule]], religious equality in Wales, the abolition of [[Plural voting]], further reform of the [[House of Lords]], land and housing reform and popular control over licences.<ref>Dundee Courier, Angus</ref> Other issues to feature in his campaign included a defence of National Insurance and improvements to the conditions of agricultural labourers.<ref>The Times 2 Feb 1914 p10</ref>\n\nAbout 2,000 Irishmen were electors in the constituency. With the Liberal Government currently steering through parliament, the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|3rd Irish Home Rule Bill]], Home Rule was the main issue of the by-election. The Labour candidate as well as the Liberal candidate agreed with the Liberal Government's policy.<ref>The Nation and Athen\u00e6um, Volume 14</ref> The Unionist candidate was left to defend the actions of the likes of [[Edward Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] who called on Ulster Unionists to resist the British Government \"by any means\".\n\nThe issue of Women's suffrage also featured in the campaign. A combination of the Unionist Party, the Irish Nationalists and a minority of Liberals had defeated the measure earlier in the parliament. The Liberal candidate, Aneurin Williams was a vocal supporter of giving women the vote while his Unionist opponent Hardicker was an opponent. Despite this, the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] chose to enter the campaign in support of the Labour Party candidate, greatly increasing the chances of victory for the anti-suffrage Unionist candidate.<ref>Barry Dackombe, Journal of Liberal History, Volume 57</ref> It was announced on 15 January 1914 that the Militant [[Women's Social and Political Union]] had established campaign headquarters in Consett to also campaign in support of the Labour candidate.<ref>Western Daily Press, Bristol, 16 Jan 1914</ref>\n\nThe influential [[Durham Miners' Association]] had initially withheld their official support from the Labour Party candidate, but their executive committee passed a motion calling on all miners to support the Socialist candidate.<ref>The Times, 8/1/1914 p8</ref> Although there was a sizeable mining community in the constituency, the Association had not pressed to have their own candidate. The fact that the Labour Party candidate was neither local nor a miner, meant he had limited appeal to their members. At this time the Durham Miners were fairly evenly split between those like their President [[William House (trade unionist)|William House]], who supported the Labour Party and those like their General Secretary [[John Wilson (1837\u20131915)|John Wilson]] who supported the Liberal Party. The pro-Labour Party element of the Union were still reeling from the [[1913 Houghton-le-Spring by-election]] when House stood as a DMA endorsed Labour Party candidate and came third, while miners lodges across the constituency supported the Liberal, who won despite not being a miner.<ref>''Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918'' by [[Duncan Tanner]]</ref> However, that did not stop individual miners leaders taking different sides in the campaign. On 20 January, the Liberal Aneurin Williams spoke at the Council School, [[Tanfield Lea]]. He shared the platform with J. J.

He was Liberal MP for [[Plymouth (UK Parliament constituency)]] between the two general elections of 1910. He was chairman of the executive committee of the Land Nationalisation Society and a director of the [[Garden city movement|First Garden City Ltd]]. He belonged to a [[Middlesbrough]] firm of ironmasters.\n*The Unionist candidate was James Ogden Hardicker. He had been their defeated candidate at the last General Election in December 1910.\n*The Labour Party decided to intervene, having never fielded a candidate here before. Their candidate, 44-year-old [[G. H. Stuart-Bunning]] was well travelled. He had stood at the [[York (UK Parliament constituency)|York]] division of Yorkshire at the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]],<ref>K. D. Brown, ''The First Labour Party, 1906-1914'', p.108</ref> then in the [[1908 Dundee by-election]] in Scotland, then at the January 1910 general election at [[Eccles (UK Parliament constituency)|Eccles]] in Lancashire, before alighting in Durham. In each case he had finished bottom of the poll.<ref>British parliamentary election results 1885-1918, Craig, F.W.S. (1974)</ref> He had no links to the constituency or to the mining industry. He was sponsored by the [[Postmen's Federation]].\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Aneurin_Williams.jpg|thumb|150px|Aneurin Williams]]\nPolling Day was set for 30 January 1914. Given the large number of miners and iron-workers among the electorate, issues affecting those voters were expected to feature.\n\nThe Liberal candidate Aneurin Williams launched his campaign at a public meeting in [[Consett]] on 5 January 1914, at which he was supported by his brother, the Liberal MP for Middlesbrough, [[Penry Williams]].<ref>Dundee Courier, Angus, 6 Jan 1914</ref> On 6 January 1914, Williams spoke at the Co-operative Hall, [[Stanley, County Durham|Stanley]] sharing a platform with Mr. Straughan.<ref>Newcastle Journal, Tyne and Wear, 7 Jan 1914</ref> On 9 January 1914 Williams spoke at a public meeting in [[Quebec, County Durham|Quebec]] alongside the Rev. Thomas Dale of [[Waterhouses, County Durham|Waterhouses]], who said the Liberal party in the division had secured a very worthy candidate.<ref>Newcastle Journal, Tyne and Wear, 10 Jan 1914</ref>\n\nOn 20 January 1914, the Liberal candidate, Aneurin Williams declared that he advocated [[Irish Home Rule]], religious equality in Wales, the abolition of [[Plural voting]], further reform of the [[House of Lords]], land and housing reform and popular control over licences.<ref>Dundee Courier, Angus</ref> Other issues to feature in his campaign included a defence of National Insurance and improvements to the conditions of agricultural labourers.<ref>The Times 2 Feb 1914 p10</ref>\n\nAbout 2,000 Irishmen were electors in the constituency. With the Liberal Government currently steering through parliament, the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|3rd Irish Home Rule Bill]], Home Rule was the main issue of the by-election. The Labour candidate as well as the Liberal candidate agreed with the Liberal Government's policy.<ref>The Nation and Athen\u00e6um, Volume 14</ref> The Unionist candidate was left to defend the actions of the likes of [[Edward Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] who called on Ulster Unionists to resist the British Government \"by any means\".\n\nThe issue of Women's suffrage also featured in the campaign. A combination of the Unionist Party, the Irish Nationalists and a minority of Liberals had defeated the measure earlier in the parliament. The Liberal candidate, Aneurin Williams was a vocal supporter of giving women the vote while his Unionist opponent Hardicker was an opponent. Despite this, the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] chose to enter the campaign in support of the Labour Party candidate, greatly increasing the chances of victory for the anti-suffrage Unionist candidate.<ref>Barry Dackombe, Journal of Liberal History, Volume 57</ref> It was announced on 15 January 1914 that the Militant [[Women's Social and Political Union]] had established campaign headquarters in Consett to also campaign in support of the Labour candidate.<ref>Western Daily Press, Bristol, 16 Jan 1914</ref>\n\nThe influential [[Durham Miners' Association]] had initially withheld their official support from the Labour Party candidate, but their executive committee passed a motion calling on all miners to support the Socialist candidate.<ref>The Times, 8/1/1914 p8</ref> Although there was a sizeable mining community in the constituency, the Association had not pressed to have their own candidate. The fact that the Labour Party candidate was neither local nor a miner, meant he had limited appeal to their members. At this time the Durham Miners were fairly evenly split between those like their President [[William House (trade unionist)|William House]], who supported the Labour Party and those like their General Secretary [[John Wilson (1837\u20131915)|John Wilson]] who supported the Liberal Party. The pro-Labour Party element of the Union were still reeling from the [[1913 Houghton-le-Spring by-election]] when House stood as a DMA endorsed Labour Party candidate and came third, while miners lodges across the constituency supported the Liberal, who won despite not being a miner.<ref>''Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918'' by [[Duncan Tanner]]</ref> However, that did not stop individual miners leaders taking different sides in the campaign. On 20 January, the Liberal Aneurin Williams spoke at the Council School, [[Tanfield Lea]]. He shared the platform with J. J.

She performed well against the [[French Navy]] in the 1760 [[Battle of Bishops Court]] and the 1761 [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1761)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]], but was less capable when deployed for bombardment duty off enemy ports. She also captured eight French [[privateer]]s and sank two more during her six years at sea. The Royal Navy decommissioned ''Brilliant'' in 1763. The Navy sold her in 1776 and she became a mercantile vessel for the British [[East India Company]] (EIC).''Brilliant'' she wrecked in August 1782 on the [[Comoro Islands]] while transporting troops to India.\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[File:Sir Thomas Slade.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Sir Thomas Slade, naval architect for ''Brilliant'' in 1756]]\n\n===Design===\n[[Thomas Slade]], the Surveyor of the Navy and former Master Shipwright at Deptford Dockyard, was the designer of the ''Venus''-class of 36-gun frigates. Alongside their smaller cousin, the 32-gun [[Southampton-class frigate|''Southampton'' class]], the ''Venus''-class represented an experiment in ship design; fast, medium-sized and heavily-armed, capable of overhauling smaller craft and single-handedly engaging enemy cruisers or large privateers.{{sfnp|Clowes|1898|p=7}} As a further innovation, Slade borrowed from contemporary French ship design by removing the lower deck gun ports and locating the ship's cannons solely on the upper deck. This permitted the carrying of heavier ordinance without the substantial increase in hull size that would have been required to keep the lower gun ports consistently above the waterline.{{sfnp|Winfield|2007|pp=189\u2013191}} The lower deck carried additional stores, enabling ''Venus''-class frigates to remain at sea for longer periods without resupply.{{sfnp|Lyon|1993|p=62}}\n\nDesigned in 1756 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] the following year, ''Venus'' was one of the first Royal Navy vessels to be built to a [[Frigate#Classic design|classic frigate design]] with a single gun deck and an emphasis on speed. Her principal role was that of a hunter of French [[privateers]]. One naval historian has described the ''Venus''-class frigates, including ''Brilliant'', as \"the best British fighting cruisers\" of their day. However they remained slightly inferior to her French equivalents in both speed and weight of ordinance.\n\nThe Admiralty approved the ''Venus'' class design on 13 July 1756 and ordered three ships.{{sfnp|Winfield|2007|pp=189\u2013191}}{{efn|Other ''Venus'' class vessels were {{HMS|Pallas|1757|6}} and {{HMS|Venus|1758|6}}.}}{{sfnp|Winfield|2007|pp=191\u2013193}} ''Brilliant'' was the last of these, and the only one to be constructed at Plymouth Dockyard.{{sfnp|Winfield|2007|pp=191\u2013193}}\n\n===Construction===\nThomas Bucknall, the Navy's Master Shipwright at Plymouth, oversaw the construction, which commenced with the laying of the [[keel]] on 28 August 1756.

She performed well against the [[French Navy]] in the 1760 [[Battle of Bishops Court]] and the 1761 [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1761)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]], but was less capable when deployed for bombardment duty off enemy ports. She also captured eight French [[privateer]]s and sank two more during her six years at sea. The Royal Navy decommissioned ''Brilliant'' in 1763. The Navy sold her in 1776 and she became a mercantile vessel for the British [[East India Company]] (EIC).''Brilliant'' she wrecked in August 1782 on the [[Comoro Islands]] while transporting troops to India.\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[File:Sir Thomas Slade.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Sir Thomas Slade, naval architect for ''Brilliant'' in 1756]]\n\n===Design===\n[[Thomas Slade]], the Surveyor of the Navy and former Master Shipwright at Deptford Dockyard, was the designer of the ''Venus''-class of 36-gun frigates. Alongside their smaller cousin, the 32-gun [[Southampton-class frigate|''Southampton'' class]], the ''Venus''-class represented an experiment in ship design; fast, medium-sized and heavily-armed, capable of overhauling smaller craft and single-handedly engaging enemy cruisers or large privateers.{{sfnp|Clowes|1898|p=7}} As a further innovation, Slade borrowed from contemporary French ship design by removing the lower deck gun ports and locating the ship's cannons solely on the upper deck. This permitted the carrying of heavier ordinance without the substantial increase in hull size that would have been required to keep the lower gun ports consistently above the waterline.{{sfnp|Winfield|2007|pp=189\u2013191}} The lower deck carried additional stores, enabling ''Venus''-class frigates to remain at sea for longer periods without resupply.{{sfnp|Lyon|1993|p=62}}\n\nDesigned in 1756 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] the following year, ''Venus'' was one of the first Royal Navy vessels to be built to a [[Frigate#Classic design|classic frigate design]] with a single gun deck and an emphasis on speed. Her principal role was that of a hunter of French [[privateers]]. One naval historian has described the ''Venus''-class frigates, including ''Brilliant'', as \"the best British fighting cruisers\" of their day. However they remained slightly inferior to her French equivalents in both speed and weight of ordinance.\n\nThe Admiralty approved the ''Venus'' class design on 13 July 1756 and ordered three ships.{{sfnp|Winfield|2007|pp=189\u2013191}}{{efn|Other ''Venus'' class vessels were {{HMS|Pallas|1757|6}} and {{HMS|Venus|1758|6}}.{{sfnp|Winfield|2007|pp=191\u2013193}} ''Brilliant'' was the last of these, and the only one to be constructed at Plymouth Dockyard.{{sfnp|Winfield|2007|pp=191\u2013193}}\n\n===Construction===\nThomas Bucknall, the Navy's Master Shipwright at Plymouth, oversaw the construction, which commenced with the laying of the [[keel]] on 28 August 1756.

''Diamond'' opened fire on ''Brilliant'' as she approached, but before the British could retaliate the French vessel exploded and sank. The detonation was assumed to have been caused by sparks flying back from the privateer's guns and igniting her [[Magazine (artillery)|powder magazine]]. Only 24 of ''Diamond''{{'}}s 70 crew survived the explosion.

He was generally deployed as a left sided [[midfield]] player but proved himself to be versatile, having also played as a central [[Midfielder#Attacking|attacking midfielder]] and a [[Left back#Full back|left back]] at Southampton.\n\nSk\u00e1cel began his career with [[FC Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] before joining [[Gambrinus liga]] side [[Slavia Prague]], where he caught the attention of [[France|French]] giants [[Olympique de Marseille]]. However, he struggled to establish himself in the first-team during his time with ''L'OM'' and was loaned out to [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] and [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]]. The latter loan spell saw him establish himself as a fan favourite, culminating in him scoring in the [[2006 Scottish Cup Final]] as the ''Jambos'' emerged victorious.

A brief return to [[SK Slavia Prague|Slavia Prague]] and a short spell with [[AEL 1964 FC|Larissa]] followed, before he returned to Hearts. His second spell at the Edinburgh club proved to be just as successful as he ended both seasons as the club's top scorer and scored two goals in the [[2012 Scottish Cup Final]] against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]]' biggest rivals [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] en route to another cup victory.\n\nHe has received infrequent call-ups to the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic national team]] squad, amassing seven caps over a period of seven years.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Czech Republic===\nSk\u00e1cel was born in [[Trutnov]] and began his career with Czech club [[FC Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]], making his senior debut in 1999 and helping his team to gain promotion back to the Czech top flight.

However, he struggled to establish himself in the first-team during his time with ''L'OM'' and was loaned out to [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] and [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]].

A brief return to [[SK Slavia Prague|Slavia Prague]] and a short spell with [[AEL 1964 FC|Larissa]] followed, before he returned to Hearts. His second spell at the Edinburgh club proved to be just as successful as he ended both seasons as the club's top scorer and scored two goals in the [[2012 Scottish Cup Final]] against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]]' biggest rivals [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] en route to another cup victory.\n\nHe has received infrequent call-ups to the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic national team]] squad, amassing seven caps over a period of seven years.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Czech Republic===\nSk\u00e1cel was born in [[Trutnov]] and began his career with Czech club [[FC Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]], making his senior debut in 1999 and helping his team to gain promotion back to the Czech top flight.
