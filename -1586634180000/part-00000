The ships were designed with the goal of increased cruising range, [[anti-aircraft]] armament, [[torpedo]] protection, etc., compared with earlier [[U.S. Navy|U.S. cruiser]]s.<ref>Norman Friedman, ''U.S. Cruisers, An Illustrated Design History''  1984 {{ISBN|978-0-87021-718-0}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cleveland-class cruiser technical drawing.png|thumb|left|Technical drawing of a ''Cleveland''-class cruiser.]]\n\nAfter the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930 passed, the US Navy took up a renewed interest in the 6\" gun armed light cruiser, partially due to the fleet complaining bitterly about the 8\" gun's slow rate of fire,<ref>US Cruisers: An Illustrated History Friedman, Norman pg 270</ref> at 3 rounds per minute compared to the 10 rounds per minute achieved by 6\" guns. At this time, the US Navy began to deploy drones to use as targets for anti-aircraft targets, which could simulate both dive and torpedo bombers. The results were dismaying to the fleet, as the simulations showed that without fire control directors and computers, the ships of the fleet would be almost helpless against the density of aircraft attack they envisioned the future war bringing. The mechanical computers alone could weigh up to 10 tons and had to be housed below decks for both weight and protection measures.<ref>Naval Anti-Aircraft Guns and Gunnery loc 3772 - 3792</ref> As World War II was to prove, the assumptions made pre-war were optimistic. Eventually, every anti-aircraft gun platform above 20mm would end up moving to remote power and aiming with associated fire control and radar.<ref>US Cruisers: An Illustrated History Friedman, Norman pg 259-265</ref> As designed the ''Cleveland'' class was already a tight design but requests to widen the ship were turned down because it would affect production rates.<ref>US Cruisers: An Illustrated History Friedman, Norman pg 259-265</ref> In order to fit the new heavier fire control and radar systems within the allotted tonnage for a cruiser, the No. 3 gun turret was omitted. This also gave room for the enlargement of the bridge spaces to accommodate the new combat information center and the necessary radars, along with enough tonnage to fit an additional pair of [[5\"/38 caliber gun|5\"/38 twin mounts]], which were located fore and aft of the superstructure, granting wider arcs of fire. Despite the loss of three 6-inch guns compared to the proceeding ''Brooklyn'' and ''St. Louis''-class cruisers, the new, more advanced fire control gave the ''Cleveland''-class ships a firepower advantage in practical use. However, the increase of light anti-aircraft artillery made the class top-heavy towards the end of [[World War II]]. To compensate for the weight increase, some ships had one catapult removed, along with the rangefinders from the No. 1 turret.<ref>Stefan Terzibaschitsch: ''Kreuzer der U.S. Navy.'' Koehler, Herford (Germany) 1984, p. 174. {{ISBN|3-7822-0348-8}}</ref> The top weight issues would plague the class with every addition of equipment having to be carefully weighed against what would have to be removed. Fighter control radar installation required the removal of 20mm clipping rooms for instance.<ref>US Cruisers: An Illustrated History Friedman, Norman pg 270</ref>\n\n===Subclasses===\nFifty-two ships of this class were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the [[light aircraft carrier]]s of the {{Sclass-|Independence|aircraft carrier|4}}, and two of them were completed to a somewhat different design, with more compact superstructures and just a single stack. These two were called the {{sclass-|Fargo|cruiser|4}}. Of the 27 ''Cleveland''-class cruisers that were commissioned, one ({{USS|Galveston|CL-93|2}}) was completed as a [[guided missile cruiser]] and five were later modified as {{sclass-|Galveston|cruiser|5}} and {{sclass-|Providence|cruiser|0}} guided missile cruisers. Two of each of the guided missile cruiser-classes had enlarged superstructures to serve as flagships. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for US cities and [[town]]s.<ref>M.J. Whitley, ''Cruisers Of World War Two, An International Encyclopedia'' 1995 {{ISBN|978-1-86019-874-8}}</ref>\n\n==Service==\nThe ''Cleveland''-class cruisers served mainly in the [[War in the Pacific|Pacific Fleet]] during [[World War II]], especially in the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], but some of them served off the coasts of Europe and Africa in the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]]. All of these [[warship]]s, though worked heavily and damaged in some cases, survived the war. All of this class were initially decommissioned by 1950, except for {{USS|Manchester|CL-83|2}}, which remained in service until 1956, but six were later finished or converted to guided missile cruisers, and these served into the 1970s. The ''Cleveland''s suffered from increasing stability problems as anti-aircraft armament and additional radar was added during the war.  None were recommissioned for the [[Korean War]], as they required a crew almost as large as the {{sclass-|Baltimore|cruiser|0}} ships, and those ships were reactivated instead. All non-converted ships were sold off from the reserve fleet for scrapping beginning in 1959. The six that were completed as or converted into guided missile cruisers were reactivated during the 1950s and then served into the 1970s. All, particularly the [[RIM-8 Talos|Talos]]-armed ships, suffered from greater stability problems than the original design due to the extra radar equipment and top weight. This problem was particularly severe in ''Galveston'', leading to its premature decommissioning in 1970. {{USS|Oklahoma City|CL-91|2}} and {{USS|Little Rock|CL-92|2}} had to have a large amount of ballast and internal rearrangement to allow continued service into the 1970s.<ref>Those Cleveland Class Cruisers.

The ships were designed with the goal of increased cruising range, [[anti-aircraft]] armament, [[torpedo]] protection, etc., compared with earlier [[U.S. Navy|U.S. cruiser]]s.<ref>Norman Friedman, ''U.S. Cruisers, An Illustrated Design History''  1984 {{ISBN|978-0-87021-718-0}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cleveland-class cruiser technical drawing.png|thumb|left|Technical drawing of a ''Cleveland''-class cruiser.]]\n\nAfter the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930 passed, the US Navy took up a renewed interest in the 6\" gun armed light cruiser, partially due to the fleet complaining bitterly about the 8\" gun's slow rate of fire,<ref>US Cruisers: An Illustrated History Friedman, Norman pg 270</ref> at 3 rounds per minute compared to the 10 rounds per minute achieved by 6\" guns. At this time, the US Navy began to deploy drones to use as targets for anti-aircraft targets, which could simulate both dive and torpedo bombers. The results were dismaying to the fleet, as the simulations showed that without fire control directors and computers, the ships of the fleet would be almost helpless against the density of aircraft attack they envisioned the future war bringing. The mechanical computers alone could weigh up to 10 tons and had to be housed below decks for both weight and protection measures.<ref>Naval Anti-Aircraft Guns and Gunnery loc 3772 - 3792</ref> As World War II was to prove, the assumptions made pre-war were optimistic. Eventually, every anti-aircraft gun platform above 20mm would end up moving to remote power and aiming with associated fire control and radar.<ref>US Cruisers: An Illustrated History Friedman, Norman pg 259-265</ref> As designed the ''Cleveland'' class was already a tight design but requests to widen the ship were turned down because it would affect production rates.<ref>US Cruisers: An Illustrated History Friedman, Norman pg 259-265</ref> In order to fit the new heavier fire control and radar systems within the allotted tonnage for a cruiser, the No. 3 gun turret was omitted. This also gave room for the enlargement of the bridge spaces to accommodate the new combat information center and the necessary radars, along with enough tonnage to fit an additional pair of [[5\"/38 caliber gun|5\"/38 twin mounts]], which were located fore and aft of the superstructure, granting wider arcs of fire. Despite the loss of three 6-inch guns compared to the proceeding ''Brooklyn'' and ''St. Louis''-class cruisers, the new, more advanced fire control gave the ''Cleveland''-class ships a firepower advantage in practical use. However, the increase of light anti-aircraft artillery made the class top-heavy towards the end of [[World War II]]. To compensate for the weight increase, some ships had one catapult removed, along with the rangefinders from the No. 1 turret.<ref>Stefan Terzibaschitsch: ''Kreuzer der U.S. Navy.'' Koehler, Herford (Germany) 1984, p. 174. {{ISBN|3-7822-0348-8}}</ref> The top weight issues would plague the class with every addition of equipment having to be carefully weighed against what would have to be removed. Fighter control radar installation required the removal of 20mm clipping rooms for instance.<ref>US Cruisers: An Illustrated History Friedman, Norman pg 270</ref>\n\n===Subclasses===\nFifty-two ships of this class were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the [[light aircraft carrier]]s of the {{Sclass-|Independence|aircraft carrier|4}}, and two of them were completed to a somewhat different design, with more compact superstructures and just a single stack. These two were called the {{sclass-|Fargo|cruiser|4}}. Of the 27 ''Cleveland''-class cruisers that were commissioned, one ({{USS|Galveston|CL-93|2}}) was completed as a [[guided missile cruiser]] and five were later modified as {{sclass-|Galveston|cruiser|5}} and {{sclass-|Providence|cruiser|0}} guided missile cruisers. Two of each of the guided missile cruiser-classes had enlarged superstructures to serve as flagships. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for US cities and [[town]]s.<ref>M.J. Whitley, ''Cruisers Of World War Two, An International Encyclopedia'' 1995 {{ISBN|978-1-86019-874-8}}</ref>\n\n==Service==\nThe ''Cleveland''-class cruisers served mainly in the [[War in the Pacific|Pacific Fleet]] during [[World War II]], especially in the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], but some of them served off the coasts of Europe and Africa in the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]]. All of these [[warship]]s, though worked heavily and damaged in some cases, survived the war. All of this class were initially decommissioned by 1950, except for {{USS|Manchester|CL-83|2}}, which remained in service until 1956, but six were later finished or converted to guided missile cruisers, and these served into the 1970s. The ''Cleveland''s suffered from increasing stability problems as anti-aircraft armament and additional radar was added during the war.  None were recommissioned for the [[Korean War]], as they required a crew almost as large as the {{sclass-|Baltimore|cruiser|0}} ships, and those ships were reactivated instead. All non-converted ships were sold off from the reserve fleet for scrapping beginning in 1959. The six that were completed as or converted into guided missile cruisers were reactivated during the 1950s and then served into the 1970s. All, particularly the [[RIM-8 Talos|Talos]]-armed ships, suffered from greater stability problems than the original design due to the extra radar equipment and top weight. This problem was particularly severe in ''Galveston'', leading to its premature decommissioning in 1970. {{USS|Oklahoma City|CL-91|2}} and {{USS|Little Rock|CL-92|2}} had to have a large amount of ballast and internal rearrangement to allow continued service into the 1970s.<ref>Those Cleveland Class Cruisers. An exercise in expediency in N.Wilder Post.' Sea Classics Oct 2013, V46, No 10', pp18-25 & 65</ref> The last of these missile ships in service, ''Oklahoma City'', was decommissioned in December 1979.\n\n===Preserved ships===\nOnly one ''Cleveland''-class ship remains.

After graduating from Carnegie Mellon in 1979, he moved on to receive his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Genetics]] at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], [[California|CA]] in 1985. From 1985-1987, Parker worked in laboratories for his [[doctorate|postdoctoral degree]] at both the University of California, San Francisco and the [[University of California, San Diego]].<ref name=\"ref14\">\u201cParker, Roy\u201d. ''CU Experts''. University of Colorado Boulder.

''Speakers''. iBiology. Retrieved 5 March 2020. https://www.ibiology.org/speakers/roy-parker/</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAt the [[University of Arizona]], Parker taught [[Cell Biology|Molecular and Cellular Biology]] until 2012 when he moved to be a professor at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].<ref name=ref19 /> He is currently the Cech-Leinwand Endowed Chair of Biochemistry as well as professor in chemistry and biochemistry courses. Parker also conducts research at the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].<ref name=ref18 />\n\n==Research Interests==\nThe primary investigations of Parker's research include the analysis of eukaryotic RNA and the effects that flawed types of RNA have on the biochemical mechanisms of the body.<ref name=ref18 /> More technically, Parker aims to explore bodily functions at the [[Molecule|molecular]] level and understand how these processes affect the [[Translation (biology)|translation]], specific placing, and stability of [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]. His lab uses [[yeast]], [[Drosophila|''Drosophila'']], and mice as testing agents to assess the detrimental effects that impaired activity in [[P-bodies|P bodies]] has towards human diseases.<ref name=ref14 />\n===Key Conclusions===\nImportant research findings first began when Parker and his lab team] established the major pathways of eukaryotic mRNA [[cell cycle|turnover]]. These pathways have the potential to generate mRNA degradation and [[Decapping complex|decapping]]. Next, the lab group pinpointed major [[Nuclease|nucleases]] that contribute to mRNA degradation, as well as the molecules that help facilitate this event. Some of these facilitators include decapping [[Enzyme|enzymes]], 3' to 5' decay complexes, and deadenylases. In years following, Parker and his crew collected enough data to conclude that components that trigger decapping interrupt the mechanisms of translation. In other words, Parker determined that decapping and translation could be thought of as rivals, for their mechanisms oppose each other. Finally, most recently, the lab group has discovered [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasmic]] [[Messenger RNP|mRNP]] granules. These contain P bodies and may be critical to biochemical research.<ref name=ref17 />\n\n===Major Contributions===\nIn addition to publishing hundreds of research articles in [[Scientific journal|scientific journals]], Parker has supported the education of students around the country. Some of his talks are published online. These focus on topics including improving graduate training and \"The Life of Eukaryotic mRNA: Localization, Translation, and Degradation\".  These video lectures are published online  aim to teach students, professors, and laboratory researchers.<ref name=ref19 />\n \n==Publications==\nThroughout his education and career, Parker has published 165 original papers and 77 chapters and invited reviews. Some of his most  publications and discoveries include the following:<ref name=ref14 />\n\n'''\u201cPEP4 Gene Function Is Required for Expression of Several Vacuolar Hydrolases in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae\u201d'''(1982) Parker\u2019s first original publication was in 1982 where he worked with two other scientists, Zubenko and Jones, to investigate the role of the PEP4 gene on yeast [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]].<ref name=\"ref11\">Jones, Elizabeth W.; Zubenko, George S.; Parker, Roy R (December 1982). \u201cPEP4 Gene Function Is Required for Expression of Several Vacuolar Hydrolases in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae\u201d.

'''102''' (4): 665-677.</ref>\n\n'''A Turnover Pathway for Both Stable and Unstable mRNAs in Yeast: Evidence for a Requirement for Deadenylation\u201d]'''(1993) The purpose of this investigation was to trace the pathways involved in mRNA turnover in yeast. To do so, Parker and Decker conducted experimentation in four genes by analyzing the degradation of nascent transcripts. They found a connection between both deadenylation rate of mRNA and stability of oligo(A) with mRNA half-lives. More specifically, they looked at the effects of RNA secondary structures and realized that after deadenylation, those without the 5\u2019 sequence began to aggregate. After evaluating these results, they concluded that deadenylation contributes to changes in mRNA, creating an mRNA decay pathway.<ref name=\"ref6\">Decker, Carolyn J.; Parker, Roy (12 April 1993). \u201cA Turnover Pathway for Both Stable and Unstable mRNAs in Yeast: Evidence for a Requirement for Deadenylation\u201d.

They offer evidence that there is a connection between decay rate and turnover pathways of mRNA. After developing conclusions from much observation and research in this study, Parker and Beelman hoped to pinpoint the genetic products that control nucleolytic events and promote degradation pathways.<ref name=\"ref1\">Beelman, Clare A.; Parker, Roy (21 April 1995). \u201cDegradation of mRNA in Eukaryotes\u201d.

They studied yeast models and recognized that P bodies contain [[Protein|proteins]] that initiate decapping, P bodies vanish when mRNA turnover does not occur before decapping, and P bodies are concentrated with intermediates of mRNA degradation. With this information, they concluded that mRNAs move between [[Polysome|polysomes]] and P bodies, and this is a critical aspect of mRNA [[metabolism]] in the cytoplasm.<ref name=\"ref20\">Sheth, Ujwal; Parker, Roy (2 May 2003). \u201cDecapping and Decay of Messenger RNA Occur in Cytoplasmic Processing Bodies\u201d.

These decapping [[Activator (genetics)|activators]] inhibit translation and stimulate the formation of P bodies.

''Speakers''. iBiology. Retrieved 5 March 2020. https://www.ibiology.org/speakers/roy-parker/</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAt the [[University of Arizona]], Parker taught [[Cell Biology|Molecular and Cellular Biology]] until 2012 when he moved to be a professor at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].<ref name=ref19 /> He is currently the Cech-Leinwand Endowed Chair of Biochemistry as well as professor in chemistry and biochemistry courses. Parker also conducts research at the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].<ref name=ref18 />\n\n==Research Interests==\nThe primary investigations of Parker's research include the analysis of eukaryotic RNA and the effects that flawed types of RNA have on the biochemical mechanisms of the body.<ref name=ref18 /> More technically, Parker aims to explore bodily functions at the [[Molecule|molecular]] level and understand how these processes affect the [[Translation (biology)|translation]], specific placing, and stability of [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]. His lab uses [[yeast]], [[Drosophila|''Drosophila'']], and mice as testing agents to assess the detrimental effects that impaired activity in [[P-bodies|P bodies]] has towards human diseases.<ref name=ref14 />\n===Key Conclusions===\nImportant research findings first began when Parker and his lab team] established the major pathways of eukaryotic mRNA [[cell cycle|turnover]]. These pathways have the potential to generate mRNA degradation and [[Decapping complex|decapping]]. Next, the lab group pinpointed major [[Nuclease|nucleases]] that contribute to mRNA degradation, as well as the molecules that help facilitate this event. Some of these facilitators include decapping [[Enzyme|enzymes]], 3' to 5' decay complexes, and deadenylases. In years following, Parker and his crew collected enough data to conclude that components that trigger decapping interrupt the mechanisms of translation. In other words, Parker determined that decapping and translation could be thought of as rivals, for their mechanisms oppose each other. Finally, most recently, the lab group has discovered [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasmic]] [[Messenger RNP|mRNP]] granules. These contain P bodies and may be critical to biochemical research.<ref name=ref17 />\n\n===Major Contributions===\nIn addition to publishing hundreds of research articles in [[Scientific journal|scientific journals]], Parker has supported the education of students around the country. Some of his talks are published online. These focus on topics including improving graduate training and \"The Life of Eukaryotic mRNA: Localization, Translation, and Degradation\".  These video lectures are published online  aim to teach students, professors, and laboratory researchers.<ref name=ref19 />\n \n==Publications==\nThroughout his education and career, Parker has published 165 original papers and 77 chapters and invited reviews. Some of his most  publications and discoveries include the following:<ref name=ref14 />\n\n'''\u201cPEP4 Gene Function Is Required for Expression of Several Vacuolar Hydrolases in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae\u201d'''(1982) Parker\u2019s first original publication was in 1982 where he worked with two other scientists, Zubenko and Jones, to investigate the role of the PEP4 gene on yeast [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]].<ref name=\"ref11\">Jones, Elizabeth W.; Zubenko, George S.; Parker, Roy R (December 1982). \u201cPEP4 Gene Function Is Required for Expression of Several Vacuolar Hydrolases in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae\u201d.

To do so, Parker and Decker conducted experimentation in four genes by analyzing the degradation of nascent transcripts. They found a connection between both deadenylation rate of mRNA and stability of oligo(A) with mRNA half-lives. More specifically, they looked at the effects of RNA secondary structures and realized that after deadenylation, those without the 5\u2019 sequence began to aggregate. After evaluating these results, they concluded that deadenylation contributes to changes in mRNA, creating an mRNA decay pathway.<ref name=\"ref6\">Decker, Carolyn J.; Parker, Roy (12 April 1993). \u201cA Turnover Pathway for Both Stable and Unstable mRNAs in Yeast: Evidence for a Requirement for Deadenylation\u201d.
