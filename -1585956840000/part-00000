In the late 19th and early 20th century, steamship steerage decks were used to provide [[Economy class|the lowest cost and lowest class of travel]], often for European and Chinese immigrants to North America. With limited privacy and security, inadequate sanitary conditions, and poor food, steerage was often decried as inhumane, and was eventually replaced on ocean liners with [[third-class cabin]]s.\n\n==Passenger accommodations==<!-- Other articles link here to \"#Passenger accommodations\". -->\nTraditionally, the steerage was \"that part of the ship next below the [[quarter-deck]], immediately before the bulkhead of the great cabin in most ships of war, [also identified as] the portion of the 'tween-decks just before the gun-room bulkhead.\" The name originates from the steering tackle which ran through the space to connect the rudder to the [[tiller]] or helm. \"In some ships, the second-class passengers are called steerage passengers.

Taken in 1907 on the ''Kaiser Wilhelm II'']]\n\n[[Edward A. Steiner]] described conditions in steerage aboard the [[SS Kaiser Wilhelm II|SS ''Kaiser Wilhelm II'']] in 1906:\n\n{{quote |[...] the 900 steerage passengers crowded into the hold of so elegant and roomy a steamer as the ''Kaiser Wilhelm II'', of the North German Lloyd line, are positively packed like cattle, making a walk on deck when the weather is good, absolutely impossible, while to breathe clean air below in rough weather, when the hatches are down is an equal impossibility. The stenches become unbearable, and many of the emigrants have to be driven down; for they prefer the bitterness and danger of the storm to the pestilential air below. The division between the genders is not carefully looked after, and the young women who are quartered among the married passengers have neither the privacy to which they are entitled nor are they much more protected than if they were living promiscuously.\n\nThe food, which is miserable, is dealt out of huge kettles into the dinner pails provided by the steamship company. When it is distributed, the stronger push and crowd, so that meals are anything but orderly procedures. On the whole, the steerage of the modern ship ought to be condemned as unfit for the transportation of human beings [...] Take for example, the second cabin which costs about twice as much as the steerage and sometimes not twice so much; yet the second cabin passenger on the ''Kaiser Wilhelm II'' has six times as much deck room, much better located and well protected against inclement weather. Two to four sleep in one cabin, which is well and comfortably furnished; while in the steerage from 200 to 400 sleep in one compartment I'M HOTTER THAN YOU on bunks, one above the other, with little light and no comforts.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, steamship steerage decks were used to provide [[Economy class|the lowest cost and lowest class of travel]], often for European and Chinese immigrants to North America. With limited privacy and security, inadequate sanitary conditions, and poor food, steerage was often decried as inhumane, and was eventually replaced on ocean liners with [[third-class cabin]]s.\n\n==Passenger accommodations==<!-- Other articles link here to \"#Passenger accommodations\". -->\nTraditionally, the steerage was \"that part of the ship next below the [[quarter-deck]], immediately before the bulkhead of the great cabin in most ships of war, [also identified as] the portion of the 'tween-decks just before the gun-room bulkhead.\" The name originates from the steering tackle which ran through the space to connect the rudder to the [[tiller]] or helm. \"In some ships, the second-class passengers are called steerage passengers.

The stenches become unbearable, and many of the emigrants have to be driven down; for they prefer the bitterness and danger of the storm to the pestilential air below. The division between the genders is not carefully looked after, and the young women who are quartered among the married passengers have neither the privacy to which they are entitled nor are they much more protected than if they were living promiscuously.\n\nThe food, which is miserable, is dealt out of huge kettles into the dinner pails provided by the steamship company. When it is distributed, the stronger push and crowd, so that meals are anything but orderly procedures. On the whole, the steerage of the modern ship ought to be condemned as unfit for the transportation of human beings [...] Take for example, the second cabin which costs about twice as much as the steerage and sometimes not twice so much; yet the second cabin passenger on the ''Kaiser Wilhelm II'' has six times as much deck room, much better located and well protected against inclement weather. Two to four sleep in one cabin, which is well and comfortably furnished; while in the steerage from 200 to 400 sleep in one compartment on bunks, one above the other, with little light and no comforts. In the second cabin the food is excellent, is partaken of in a luxuriantly appointed dining-room, is well cooked and well served; while in the steerage the unsavory rations are not served, but doled out, with less courtesy than one would find in a charity soup kitchen.\n\nThe steerage ought to be and could be abolished by law [...] On many ships, even drinking water is grudgingly given, and on the steamer ''Staatendam'', four years ago, we had literally to steal water for the steerage from the second cabin, and that of course at night.

Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarking.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.

The most common type is sharply everted with flat lip; the other most common forms are sharply everted with pointed lip, sharply everted and lip thickened to the interior, and sharply everted with flat lip thickened to the exterior.  The most common form of decoration observed on body sherds was medium parallel lines.  This was true for both plain and cordmarked surfaces but the trend was more pronounced with the cordmarked surfaces.  Wide-notched lip decoration was most common; many were medium notched or unnotched but few were fine-notched.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 62.5%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 6%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 1.5%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 23.5%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - about 5% of the assemblage was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Great Lakes]] and was at least partially coterminous with Huber. Fisher pottery is characterized by shell-tempering and predominantly [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surfaces, often decorated with curvilinear designs.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  4% of Fisher sherds/vessels were classified as Fifield Trailed and 1% were Fiflield Bold.\n* Other types - 1%\n\n=== Chronology of Hoxie Farm pottery within the Huber sequence ===\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age. Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips.

Both have shell-tempered pottery but Huber is predominantly plain surface with fine-line decoration and Fisher is predominantly cordmarked surface with wide-line decoration.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |last2=Asch |first2=David L. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 4: Cultural Setting: the Oneota Tradition}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship of Huber and Fisher both with each other and with other Upper Mississippian cultures in the area has long been a matter of debate and speculation among archaeologists.  James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations, felt that Huber was a Component of the Oneota Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the only one that has been found in association with early Historic European trade goods.  Nevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  Hoxie Farm, Griesmer and Moccasin Bluff are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the Oneota tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like Fifield, where Fisher pottery is associated with late Prehistoric artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the Protohistoric or early Historic period.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe artifacts present at Hoxie Farm represent a well-rounded view of life in the Huber culture.  Several items of personal adornment were found here, such as hair accessories, bracelets, and pendants.  Domestic items include knives, scrapers, chisels, needles, and awls.  The bone or antler dice implies games or gambling went on at the site; gambling among Native American tribes has been well-documented.  A bone rasp indicates music was being performed for entertainment or for ceremonial purposes.  The presence of stemmed pipes and several pieces of art with magical or spiritual overtones reflects on the spiritual life of the community.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nThere is direct evidence of cultivated plants at Hoxie Farm. The remains of [[maize]] were found along with hoes made of bison scapula and elk scapula.  Deer bone was also present in abundance, along with arrowheads for bows-and-arrows, indicating the site residents still relied on hunting; and fish and turtle were also present in the animal bone remains, so they were also exploiting food resources of the nearby marshes and creeks.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nWith regards to seasonality of occupation, based on an analysis of the animal bone remains, the researchers determined the site was occupied from at least spring through fall.  In fact the site may have been occupied year-round since there are storage pits to keep food during the winter.  The presence of non-utilitarian items for music, games and religion also implies an extended residence.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nDespite the fact that the Hoxie Farm site had European trade goods and thus was occupied at a very late date in prehistory, the pottery traits indicate an early placement in the Huber sequence.  The answer may be that the site was occupied longer than the other Huber sites, and therefore the pottery from the entire Huber sequence is present, with early and late types intermixed.  Since the site was not stratified, there was no way for the researchers to segregate artifacts from different time periods.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | editor = James A.

Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarking.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>\n\nOf the 7 whole or reconstructed vessels, 5 are of the type Fifield Bold, one of Huber Trailed, and one that is stylistically different from either Fisher or Huber.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n18 different rim profile types were identified but almost all of them are everted, mostly sharply everted, and 4 types make up the vast majority of vessels.  The most common type is sharply everted with flat lip; the other most common forms are sharply everted with pointed lip, sharply everted and lip thickened to the interior, and sharply everted with flat lip thickened to the exterior.  The most common form of decoration observed on body sherds was medium parallel lines.  This was true for both plain and cordmarked surfaces but the trend was more pronounced with the cordmarked surfaces.  Wide-notched lip decoration was most common; many were medium notched or unnotched but few were fine-notched.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 62.5%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 6%, characterized by a smooth surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 1.5%, characterized by a smooth surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 23.5%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - about 5% of the assemblage was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Great Lakes]] and was at least partially coterminous with Huber.

The Braganzas came to rule the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and [[Kingdom of the Algarves|the Algarves]] after successfully deposing the [[Philippine Dynasty]] in the [[Portuguese Restoration War|Restoration War]], resulting in the [[Duke of Braganza]] becoming King [[John IV of Portugal]], in 1640. The Braganzas ruled Portugal and the [[Portuguese Empire]] from 1640 and with the creation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]], in 1815, and the subsequent independence of the [[Empire of Brazil]], in 1822, the Braganzas came to rule as the [[List of monarchs of Brazil|monarchs of Brazil]].\n\nThe House of Braganza produced 15 [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese monarchs]] and all four [[List of Brazilian monarchs|Brazilian monarchs]], numerous consorts to various European kingdoms, such as [[Catherine of Braganza]] (wife of [[Charles II of England]] who introduced [[tea]] to Britain) and [[Maria Isabel of Braganza]] (wife of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] who founded the [[Museo del Prado|El Prado Museum]]), as well as sometime candidates for the thrones of Poland and Greece, [[Infante Manuel, Count of Our\u00e9m]] and [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro, Duke of Braganza]], respectively, and numerous other notable figures in the histories of Europe and the Americas. The Braganzas were deposed from their thrones in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] at the turn of the 19th\u201320th centuries, when [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] was [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|deposed in Brazil]], in 1889, and when [[Manuel II of Portugal|King Manuel II]] was [[5 October 1910 revolution|deposed in Portugal]], in 1910.\n\nFollowing the reign of King [[John VI of Portugal]], the Braganzas were split into three main branches of the family: the [[Brazilian Imperial Family|Brazilian branch]], headed by King John VI's eldest son, Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]], the Constitutional branch, headed by Emperor Pedro I's eldest daughter, Queen [[Maria II of Portugal]], and the [[Miguelist|Miguelist branch]], headed by King John VI's second eldest son, King [[Miguel I of Portugal]]. The Brazilian branch, following 1921, became the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], whose leadership is disputed by two branches of its own: the Vassouras branch, headed by [[Prince Luiz of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], and the Petr\u00f3polis branch, headed by [[Prince Pedro Carlos of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]]. The Constitutional branch died out with the death of King Manuel II in 1932, passing its claim to the Portuguese throne to the Miguelist Branch, by way of [[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza]]. The claim to the Portuguese Crown, and thus to the leadership of the House of Braganza, passed to Duarte Nuno's son, [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza]], who is currently the most recognized pretender to the Portuguese throne.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Feudal establishment ===\n[[File:Afonso first Duke of Braganza.jpg|thumb|left|[[Afonso I, Duke of Braganza|Afonso I]], first [[Duke of Braganza]] and founder of the House of Braganza]]\n[[File:D. Isabel de Barcelos (1402-1465) - Genealogia de D. Manuel Pereira, 3.\u00ba conde da Feira (1534).png|thumb|left|[[Isabel of Barcelos|Isabel of Braganza]] was the first to intermarry with the royal family, as wife of [[John, Constable of Portugal|Infante Jo\u00e3o, Constable of Portugal]].]]\nThe House of Braganza originated with [[Afonso I, Duke of Braganza|Afonso I]], an illegitimate son of King [[John I of Portugal]], founder of the [[House of Aviz]], and In\u00eas Pires.{{efn|name=In\u00eas Pires}} Though Afonso was illegitimate, his father valued and cared for him a great deal, demonstrated by his arrangement of Afonso's marriage to [[Beatriz Pereira de Alvim]], daughter of [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]], Portugal's most important general and a personal friend of King John I. As well as increasing his social status by his marriage into a well-established house, Afonso also became the eighth [[Count of Barcelos]], an honour ceded to him by his father-in-law, who had been made the seventh count by John I.\n\nWith his newly consolidated place in the [[Portuguese nobility|nobility of Portugal]], Afonso commenced what would be a highly successful political and social career. In 1415 he took part in the [[Conquest of Ceuta]], alongside his father, his brothers, and the leading members of the nobility and military. By the time of his father's death in 1433, Afonso had won favour with his brother, King [[Duarte I of Portugal|Duarte I]] and the rest of high Portuguese society. With his brother's premature death in 1438, a regency was established for Afonso's nephew, the 6&nbsp;year old King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]], under the leadership of the king's mother, [[Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Portugal|Leonor of Aragon]], and later Afonso's brother, [[Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra]]. The Duke of Coimbra's regency, however, soon proved unpopular and Afonso quickly became the King's preferred advisor. On 30 December 1442, the Duke of Coimbra, still the King's regent and thus acting in his name, created Afonso as the [[Duke of Braganza]], as a gesture of good will and reconciliation between the two brothers.  Afonso's elevation to the dukedom, the highest level of nobility, marked the foundation of the House of Braganza, which was to become a key family in Portuguese history.\n\nAs a result of the hard work and success of Afonso I, his children all secured successful positions and lived privileged lives. Afonso I's first son, [[Afonso of Braganza, 1st Marquis of Valen\u00e7a|Afonso of Braganza]], was a prominent member of the nobility, having been ceded, by his grandfather, Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira, the lucrative and powerful title of [[Count of Our\u00e9m]], in 1422. He was an accomplished diplomat, and served as the king's representative at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1436, and the [[Council of Florence]] in 1439. In 1451, the Count of Our\u00e9m was made [[Marquis of Valen\u00e7a]] and escorted [[Eleanor of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress|Infanta Leonor of Portugal]] to her husband [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Later, in 1458, he participated in the capture and conquest of [[Alc\u00e1cer-Ceguer]]. The Marquis of Valen\u00e7a, however, died in 1460, one year before his father and therefore did not succeed him. Afonso I's first daughter, [[Isabel of Braganza, Lady of Reguengos de Monsaraz|Isabel of Braganza]], married [[Infante Jo\u00e3o, Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz]], thus relinking the House of Braganza to the Royal House of Portugal. Isabel's strategic marriage proved successful, and produced four children, whose descendants would be some of the most important in Iberian history. Afonso I's last child and successor, [[Fernando I, Duke of Braganza]], continued his legacy of prominence in the military and society.\n\nWhen Fernando I was born, in 1403, his grandfather, Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira, ceded him the title of [[Count of Arraiolos]]. Fernando became an accomplished military man, participating in various [[Moroccan\u2013Portuguese conflicts|Portuguese imperial campaigns]]. Though Fernando I was a popular and powerful member of the nobility, he did not always find himself in the favour of the king, most notably exemplified when Fernando I openly declaimed King Duarte I, at the [[Portuguese Cortes]], on the topic of the rescue and recovery of the King's brother, [[Ferdinand the Holy Prince|Infante Fernando, Lord of Salvaterra de Magos]] from the Moors. However, Fernando I became a favourite of both the royal and imperial government and of King Afonso V, earning him the position of Governor of Ceuta and the titles of [[Marquis of Vila Vi\u00e7osa]] and [[Count of Neiva]].\n[[File:Pa\u00e7o dos Duques 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Palace of the Dukes of Braganza|Palace of the Dukes]], in [[Guimar\u00e3es]], was [[Family seat|seat]] of the House of Braganza from 1420 until [[Fernando II, Duke of Braganza|Fernando II of Braganza]] was executed for treason by [[John II of Portugal|King Jo\u00e3o II]] in 1483.]]\nFernando I's children, by his wife, Joana de Castro, Lady of Cadaval, continued to enlarge the influence of the House of Braganza. Of his nine children, all six who survived to adulthood established themselves either through positions or marriages, though the actions of King [[Jo\u00e3o II of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o II]] would seek to weaken their influence. Fernando I's first son and successor, [[Fernando II, Duke of Braganza|Fernando II]], was initially a bright and popular nobleman, but his conflict with King Jo\u00e3o II would see his and the House's downfall. His second son, [[Jo\u00e3o of Braganza, 1st Marquis of Montemor-o-Novo]], was an accomplished military man and was made [[Constable of Portugal]]. Fernando's third son, Afonso of Braganza, became a popular nobleman of society and was made 1st [[Count of Faro]]. The Duke's fourth son, [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], inherited the fiefs of his mother, becoming the 5th Lord of Ferreira, 4th Lord of Cadaval, and 1st Lord of Tent\u00fagal. Fernando's eldest surviving daughter, Beatriz of Braganza, married Pedro de Meneses, 1st [[Marquis of Vila Real]]. Fernando's last surviving child, Guiomar of Braganza, married Henrique de Meneses, 4th [[Count of Viana do Alentejo]]. Ultimately, however, Fernando I's children and grandchildren would suffer great difficulty under the reign of King Jo\u00e3o II.\n\nBy the tenure of the third duke, [[Fernando II, Duke of Braganza|Fernando II]], the House of Braganza was undoubtedly one of the greatest noble houses of Portugal and Iberia as a whole. Fernando II continued the House's legacy of acquisition and gained the title of [[Duke of Guimar\u00e3es]]. To the Duke and the House's downfall, however, King Jo\u00e3o II's reign concerned itself with the royal consolidation of power and the diminishment of the nobility. In his mission to centralize power, the King executed many nobleman of the great houses of Portugal, alongside confiscating their properties and exiling their families. Fernando II, having been a prominent and powerful nobleman, was accused of treason and executed by King Jo\u00e3o II; the House's titles and properties were merged into the crown and its members exiled to Castile.\n\nDue to their father's misfortunes, Fernando II's children, from his marriage to [[Isabella of Viseu|Isabel of Viseu]], daughter of [[Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu|Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu and Beja]], initially  had a tumultuous childhood; but King Jo\u00e3o II's successor, King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], who had previously himself been the [[Duke of Beja]], chose to forgive the House and re-grant them all their properties in exchange for their loyalty. Fernando II's oldest surviving son and successor, [[Jaime I, Duke of Braganza|Jaime I]], returned to Portugal and reestablished himself at [[Vila Vi\u00e7osa]], the former seat of the Dukes. Fernando II's only other surviving son, [[Denis of Braganza, Count of Lemos|Dinis of Braganza]], married  Beatriz de Castro Os\u00f3rio, Countess of Lemos, and had four children with her.\n\n=== Portuguese Renaissance ===\n[[File:Jaime I Braganca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jaime I, Duke of Braganza|Jaime I]] restored the Braganzas' status after his father's execution and built the [[Ducal Palace of Vila Vi\u00e7osa]].]]\n[[File:D.

Upon his return to Portugal from exile, Jaime took possession of the House's formerly confiscated properties. In order to establish a new image for the House, he ordered the construction of a new seat for the House, which would become one of the largest palaces in Iberia, the [[Ducal Palace of Vila Vi\u00e7osa]]. Jaime I's restoration also continued with the House's relations with the King, Jaime I having becoming a favourite of King Manuel I and even once his temporary heir. The Duke also had his share of scandal, having funded the conquest of the city of [[Azamor]], for the royal crown as, as punishment for his ordering the murder of his first wife, Leonor P\u00e9rez de Guzman, daughter of [[Juan Alfonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 3rd Duke of Medina Sidonia]].\n\nThe children of Jaime I, both the two first children by his first wife, Leonor of P\u00e9rez de Guzman, and the later eight children by his second wife, Joana of Mendo\u00e7a, all saw successful lives under the restored House of Braganza. Jaime I's first daughter, [[Isabella of Braganza, Duchess of Guimar\u00e3es|Isabel of Braganza]], married [[Infante Edward, 4th Duke of Guimar\u00e3es|Infante Duarte, Duke of Guimar\u00e3es]], and had three children, while his first son and successor, [[Teod\u00f3sio I, Duke of Braganza|Teod\u00f3sio I]], was a successful prince of the [[Portuguese Renaissance]]. Five of Jaime I's children, Jaime, Maria, Fulg\u00eancio, Teot\u00f3nio, and Vic\u00eancia, all entered into religious orders. The Duke's second daughter, Joana of Braganza, married Bernardino de Cardenas, 3rd Marquis of Elche, and his third daughter, Eug\u00e9nia of Braganza, married Francisco de Melo, 2nd [[Marquis of Ferreira]]. Jaime I's only other son, other than Teod\u00f3sio I, to not enter into the church, [[Constantino of Braganza]], married Maria de Melo, daughter of D. Rodrigo de Melo, 1st [[Marquis of Ferreira]], but had no children. Constantino was famed as a great officer of the [[Portuguese Empire]], having served as the [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Viceroy of Portuguese India]] and [[List of colonial governors of Cape Verde#Ribeira Grande|Captain of Ribeira Grande]], among other positions.\n[[File:ConstantinoBraganca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constantino of Braganza]] was [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Viceroy of Portuguese India]] & led the [[Portuguese invasion of Jaffna kingdom (1560)|1st Portuguese invasion of Sri Lanka]].]]\nThe fifth Duke, [[Teod\u00f3sio I, Duke of Braganza|Teod\u00f3sio I]], is remembered for being the personification of the [[Portuguese Renaissance]]. A patron of the arts and scholarly noble, Teod\u00f3sio I maintained the prestige of the House of Braganza, although not leaving a significant mark on the House's history. The Duke notably ceded the Dukedom of Guimar\u00e3es to [[Infante Edward, 4th Duke of Guimar\u00e3es|Infante Duarte of Portugal]] as the dowry of his sister, [[Isabella of Braganza, Duchess of Guimar\u00e3es|Isabel of Braganza]].\n\nTeod\u00f3sio I's first son, Jaime of Braganza, died before he could inherit his father's titles, fighting alongside King [[Sebastian I of Portugal|Sebasti\u00e3o I]] at the [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]]. The Duke's only daughter, Isabel of Braganza, married Miguel Luis de Meneses, 1st [[Duke of Caminha]], though their union had no issue. Teod\u00f3sio I's last child and successor, [[Jo\u00e3o I, Duke of Braganza|Jo\u00e3o I]], lived a very different life from Teod\u00f3sio I's calm and relatively peaceful tenure, having been involved in the controversies of the [[Portuguese succession crisis of 1580]] and the subsequent [[War of the Portuguese Succession]].\n\n[[Jo\u00e3o I, Duke of Braganza|Jo\u00e3o I]]'s tenure as Duke was one intertwined with controversy and intrigue. Having been married to [[Catherine, Duchess of Braganza|Infanta Catarina]], daughter of [[Infante Edward, 4th Duke of Guimar\u00e3es|Infante Duarte, Duke of Guimar\u00e3es]], and thus a grandchild of King Manuel I, during the succession crisis of 1580, the couple pressed their claims to the Portuguese throne. Though Infanta Catarina was a popular claimant, her [[Philippine Dynasty|Habsburg]] cousin was eventually crowned [[Philip I of Portugal]] and the [[Iberian Union]] was established. In an attempt at reconciliation with the Brigantine House, King Philip I renewed the title of Constable of Portugal, which Jo\u00e3o I had held previously, to the Duke's first son, [[Teod\u00f3sio II, Duke of Braganza|Teod\u00f3sio II]], alongside other title and land grants to the Duke and the House.\n\nJo\u00e3o I's daughters, Maria, Serefina, Querubina, and Ang\u00e9lica, were some of the most eligible ladies of Portugal and all Iberia, though the only one to marry was Serefina of Braganza, who married Castilian [[Juan Fernandez Pacheco, 5th Duke of Escalona]]. The Duke's oldest son and successor, Teod\u00f3sio II, famously fought in the Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir at the age of ten and later became an accomplished general. Jo\u00e3o I's second son, Duarte of Braganza, was made 1st Marquis of Frechilla, and the Duke's third son, Alexandre of Braganza, became [[Archbishop of \u00c9vora]], both receiving their titles and many concessions from King Philip I when the monarch was making amends with the House of Braganza. Unlike his other sons, Jo\u00e3o I's last son, Filipe of Braganza, died without marriage, children, or titles.\n[[File:Rubens John, Duke of Braganza.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In 1640, [[John IV of Portugal]] became the first Braganza to reign as [[list of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]], starting the [[Portuguese Restoration War]].]]\nThe seventh Duke, Teod\u00f3sio II, became famous at a young age, having been made page to King [[Sebastian I of Portugal|Sebasti\u00e3o I]] and having marched into the Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir, alongside the King and his uncle, Jaime of Braganza, at the age of ten. Teod\u00f3sio II later pledged his allegiance and became a faithful countryman to the Philippine Dynasty, having even defended [[Lisbon]] against King Philip I's rival claimant to the throne, [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]], who had been acclaimed, by his supporters, as King Ant\u00f3nio I of Portugal. In recognition for his military prowess, Teod\u00f3sio II was made Constable of Portugal. The Duke's support and service to the Philippine Dynasty, earned the Braganzas more lands and titles and, by 1640, the House had amassed around 80,000 vassals, alongside numerous churches, orders, and institutions under its patronage.{{sfn|McMurdo|1889|p=363}}\n\nIn 1603, Teod\u00f3sio II married [[Ana de Velasco y Gir\u00f3n]], daughter of Castilian [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Velasco, 5th Duke of Fr\u00edas]], and had four children with her. The Duke's first son and successor, [[Jo\u00e3o IV of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o II]], raise the House of Braganza to new heights of power, having launched the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] and been acclaimed King Jo\u00e3o IV of Portugal, thus installing the House as the ruling dynasty of Portugal. Teod\u00f3sio II's second son, Duarte of Braganza, was made Lord of Vila do Conde and became a diplomat, serving at the court of [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor]], but later died a prisoner as a cost of the Restoration War. Teod\u00f3sio II's two other children, Alexandre and Catarina, both died without children, titles, or marriage.\n\n=== Throne of Portugal ===\n[[File:Catherine of Braganza, Queen of England.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Catherine of Braganza]], wife of [[Charles II of England]], credited with introducing the [[English people|English]] to [[tea]]-drinking, popular with the [[Portuguese nobility]].]]\nBy 1640 the wise policies of D. Philip I in respect of Portugal were long past. The country was overtaxed, Portuguese colonies were left unprotected, and the King [[Philip III of Portugal]] no longer had the trust or support of most [[Portuguese nobility]]. He was especially loathed by the powerful Portuguese guild of merchants. Portugal, like the rest of Philip's kingdoms, was on the verge of rebellion.\n\nThe eighth Duke of Braganza, D. [[Jo\u00e3o IV of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o II of Braganza]], had inherited the claim of his grandmother, Infanta Catarina of Portugal, and the remoter claim through of his grandfather Jo\u00e3o I of Braganza. Because of his claims, the discontent Portuguese nobility asked Jo\u00e3o II to lead their restoration as their king.\n\nAccording to court historians, D. Jo\u00e3o II was a modest man without particular ambitions to the crown. Legend says that his wife, Dona [[Luisa de Guzm\u00e1n]], daughter of the duke of Medina-Sidonia, urged him to accept the offer, saying \"I'd rather be queen for one day than duchess for a lifetime.\" He accepted the leadership of the rebellion, which was successful, and was acclaimed Jo\u00e3o IV of Portugal on 1 December 1640.\n\nAfter the accession of the Braganzas to the throne, the duchy was linked to the Crown. \"Duke of Braganza\" became the traditional title of the heir to the throne, together with [[Prince of Brazil]] and, later, [[Prince Royal of Portugal]], much as [[Prince of Wales]] is in the United Kingdom or [[Prince of Asturias]] in Spain.\n\nUnder D. Jo\u00e3o's sons D. [[Afonso VI of Portugal|Afonso VI]] and D. [[Pedro II of Portugal|Pedro II]], the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial empire]], part of which was lost during the Spanish occupation, was restored and expanded, bringing new wealth to Portugal.\n\nThe zenith of the Braganza dynasty came with the long reign of D. [[Jo\u00e3o V of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o V]] (1706\u20131750), who ruled with grandeur and piety. The reign of D. [[Joseph I of Portugal|Jos\u00e9 I]], son of D. Jo\u00e3o V, was marked by the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|great earthquake]], which struck [[Lisbon]] in 1755. The political genius of his reign was the [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal|1st Marquis of Pombal]]. The end of the 18th century was characterized by stability, under the rule of Dona [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]] (1777\u20131816), who discharged Pombal at her accession. Unfortunately Dona Maria became psychologically unstable, displaying similar symptoms to [[George III of the United Kingdom]] in his later years.\n\n=== Realm in Brazil ===\n[[File:Maria I (stockholm gripsholms slott).jpg|thumb|right|[[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]] became the first [[list of monarchs of Brazil|monarch of Brazil]] with the creation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] in 1815.]]\nIn 1808, faced with impending [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic invasion]], the Braganzas [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|transferred their royal court]] to the [[State of Brazil]], Portugal's largest colony. Some time after they had crossed the Atlantic, a royal decree changed the status of Brazil from a Portuguese [[colony]] into kingdom alongside Portugal, and the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] was formed. In 1821, D. [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o VI]], who succeeded in 1816, returned to Portugal.\n\nD. [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro, Prince Royal of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]], the eldest son of D. Jo\u00e3o VI and also regent in Brazil, sided with the Brazilian rebels in January 1822. He [[Brazilian independence|was acclaimed]] [[Emperor of Brazil|Emperor D. Pedro I]] of an independent Brazil in 1822, founding the [[Empire of Brazil]]. D. Pedro I ruled Brazil until 1831, when he abdicated in favor of his young son D. [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], and returned to Portugal to aid his daughter D. Maria II (see below).\n\nD. Pedro II, being only 6&nbsp;years old at the time of his coronation, had a regency established. The regency would rule until 1840, when the Emperor turned 14&nbsp;years old. His reign would last until 1889, when the Brazilian monarchy was abolished. His reign would see the [[slavery in Brazil|abolition of slavery]] in Brazil, economic growth, and very long periods of tranquility and development in his empire.\n\n=== Warring branches ===\n[[File:Dom Jo\u00e3o, Pr\u00edncipe Regente, passando revista \u00e0s tropas na Azambuja - Domingos Sequeira, 1803.png|thumb|left|King-Emperor [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o VI]]'s children split the Braganzas into 3 branches: the [[Brazilian imperial family|Brazilian Imperial]] branch, the Portuguese Constitutional branch, and the exiled [[Miguelist]] branch.]]\nIn Portugal, D. Pedro I of Brazil became King as D. Pedro IV (1826), but no one wanted to re-establish the union of Portugal and Brazil. Pedro abdicated the Portuguese throne in favor of his daughter Princess [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria da Gl\u00f3ria]], then seven years old. D. Pedro's brother D. [[Miguel of Portugal|Miguel]] was to act as Regent, and to marry Maria when she came of age. In 1828, Miguel instead proclaimed himself King of Portugal and repudiated the liberal constitution granted by D. Jo\u00e3o VI, trying to establish an [[absolute monarchy]].\n\nIn 1828, Maria II was forced into exile by her uncle, the new King Miguel I. Her father D. Pedro IV of Portugal returned from Brazil, launched a successful military campaign, from the [[Azores]], against Miguel I. He finally defeated and exiled Miguel I in 1834. Though exiled, Miguel would not give up his claim to the throne and would establish the '''[[Miguelist#The Miguelist branch of the Braganzas|Miguelist branch]]''' of the House of Braganza. The strategic marriages of his children to the various royal houses of Europe would earn him the nickname the \"Grandfather of Europe\" (''see [[Descendants of Miguel I of Portugal]]'').\n\n=== First Reign of Brazil ===\n[[File:DpedroI-brasil-full.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Emperor-King [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I & IV]] achieved [[Independence of Brazil|Brazil's Independence]] as [[Emperor of Brazil]] & won the [[Liberal Wars]] as [[King of Portugal]].]]\nOn 7 September 1822, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro of Braganza, Prince Royal of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]], member of the House of Braganza, heir apparent to the Portuguese throne and Regent of the [[Kingdom of Brazil]], declared the country's independence from the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] and was acclaimed [[Emperor of Brazil]]. On 12 October, the prince was acclaimed Pedro I, first Emperor of the newly created Empire of Brazil, a constitutional monarchy. In 1825, signing the [[Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825)|treaty of Rio de Janeiro]] of this date, his father, King Dom [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o VI]], recognized the independence of the new state, the former Portuguese dominion, now [[Empire of Brazil]].\n\nPedro&nbsp;I encountered a number of crises during his reign. A secessionist rebellion in the [[Cisplatine Province]] in early 1825 and the subsequent attempt by the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] (later [[Argentina]]) to annex Cisplatina led the Empire into the failed [[Cisplatine War]]. In March 1826, Jo\u00e3o&nbsp;VI died and Pedro&nbsp;I inherited the Portuguese crown, briefly becoming King Pedro&nbsp;IV of Portugal before abdicating in favor of his eldest daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]. The situation worsened in 1828 when the war in the south ended with Brazil's loss of Cisplatina, which would become the independent republic of [[Uruguay]]. During the same year in Lisbon, Maria&nbsp;II's throne was usurped by [[Miguel I of Portugal|Prince Miguel]], Pedro&nbsp;I's younger brother.\n\nOther difficulties arose when the Empire's parliament opened in 1826. Pedro&nbsp;I, along with a significant percentage of the legislature, argued for an independent judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance.\n\nThe struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro&nbsp;II]], on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to [[Liberal Wars|restore his daughter to her throne]].\n\n=== Second Reign of Brazil===\n[[File:Pedro II Admiral Brazil 1870.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] was the last [[Emperor of Brazil]] after the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil]] in 1889.]]\n[[File:Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Isabel of Braganza, Princess Imperial of Brazil]] signed the ''[[Lei \u00c1urea]]'' in 1888, abolishing [[slavery in Brazil]].]]\nPedro I's successor in Brazil was his five-year-old son, Pedro II. As the latter was still a minor, a weak regency was created. The power vacuum resulting from the absence of a ruling monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro II, once he was declared of age in 1840, at 14 years old, managed to bring peace and stability to the country, which eventually became an emerging international power. Brazil was victorious in three international conflicts (the [[Platine War]], the [[Uruguayan War]] and the [[Paraguayan War]]) under Pedro II's rule, and the Empire prevailed in several other international disputes and outbreaks of domestic strife. With prosperity and economic development came an influx of European immigration, including Protestants and Jews, although Brazil remained mostly Catholic. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888 by [[Isabel of Brazil|Princess Isabel]].\n\nEven though the last four decades of Pedro II's reign were marked by continuous internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither Pedro II nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. Although there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government, republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the [[First Brazilian Republic]]. Throughout the coup Pedro II dismissed all suggestions put forward by politicians and military leaders for quelling the rebellion. The Emperor and his family were exiled to the Portuguese kingdom and France. Although there was significant monarchist reaction after the fall of the Empire,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} this was thoroughly suppressed, and neither Pedro II nor his daughter and heiress supported a forced restoration.\n\n=== Constitutional Kings ===\n[[File:SMF Manoel II.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], last [[King of Portugal]] and the last Braganza to rule as a monarch.]]\nIn 1835, Queen Maria II of Portugal married Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, later King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal]]. Despite the tradition of following the custom of patrilineal descent of royal houses, common throughout Europe, Article 5 of the Portuguese constitution of 1826 stated that \"''The Reigning Dynasty of the Most Serene House of Braganza Shall Continue in the Person of Lady Princess Maria da Gl\u00f3ria, by the Abdication and Cession of Her August Father Lord Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil, Legitimate Heir and Successor of Lord Jo\u00e3o VI.''\".<ref>[http://www.fd.unl.pt/Anexos/Investigacao/1533.pdf Portuguese Constitution of 1826] p. Title 1, Article 5.</ref>\n\nMaria II was succeeded in 1853 by her son D. [[Pedro V of Portugal|Pedro V]], a hard-working reformer who died prematurely in 1861 due to cholera. D. Pedro V was succeeded by his brother D. [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal|Lu\u00eds]], as D. Pedro V had no children.\n\nD. Lu\u00eds I was succeeded in 1889 by his son D. [[Carlos I of Portugal|Carlos I]]. Carlos I's popularity dramatically declined after an unfavorable deal from an incident known as the [[British Ultimatum]], whereby the [[Portuguese Empire]] ceded its claim to territories (known as the ''[[Pink Map]]'') between [[Portuguese West Africa]] and [[Portuguese East Africa]] to the British. Pursuant to his unpopularity, the monarchy became increasingly unpopular in the country.\n\nKing Carlos I was [[Lisbon Regicide|assassinated in 1908 together with his eldest son]], D. [[Lu\u00eds Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Lu\u00eds Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal and Duke of Braganza]], by republicans. His younger son, D. [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel, Duke of Beja]], survived the attack on his father and elder brother and became king as Manuel II, but was toppled two years later in the [[5 October 1910 revolution|1910 republican revolution]]. After the revolution, Manuel was forced into exile in England by the [[Portuguese First Republic]], but he would continue to support his [[Portugal|fatherland]] until his death.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== Modern Braganzas ===\n==== Portuguese Braganzas ====\n[[File:Jantar dos Conjurados.2008 029 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|D.

He was childless, and descendants of Miguel of Braganza (the usurper of 1826) claimed the throne. In 1920\u201322, the two (of the now four) branches of the House of Braganza negotiated an alleged pact under which Manuel II named as his heir [[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza|Duarte Nuno of Braganza]], grandson of Miguel. Duarte Nuno, now Duke of Braganza, remained the Braganza pretender until his death in 1976. In 1942, he married a great-granddaughter of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]], uniting the two lines of the House.\n\nIn 1950 Portugal repealed the law of exile against the Braganzas,<ref>Law no. 2040 (published in the [[Di\u00e1rio do Governo]] no. 99/1950, Series I of 1950-05-27, page 323)</ref> and D. Duarte Nuno moved to the country in 1952.\n\nDuarte Nuno was succeeded as pretender by his son, [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza|Duarte Pio of Braganza]] (born 1945). Duarte Pio served in the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] and took the customary oath of allegiance to the Republic, but Portuguese monarchists recognize him as the pretender to the Portuguese throne. In 1995 he married [[Isabel de Her\u00e9dia]], a Portuguese businesswoman and descendant of the Viscount of Ribeira Brava. He worked actively in support of the independence of [[East Timor]] from [[Indonesia]].\n\nDuarte Pio and Isabel have three children. Duarte Pio's oldest son is [[Afonso, Prince of Beira|Afonso de Santa Maria]], who bears the traditional titles of [[Prince of Beira]] (as heir apparent to the Portuguese pretender) and [[Duke of Barcelos]] (as heir apparent to the Duke of Braganza).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} He has a brother [[Dinis, Duke of Porto]], and a sister, [[Infanta Maria Francisca of Portugal (b. 1997)|Infanta Maria Francisca]].\n[[File:Dom Bertrand de Orleans e Bragan\u00e7a.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Prince Bertrand of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], [[Prince Imperial of Brazil]] and speaker on behalf of his brother [[Prince Luiz of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], Head of the [[Brazilian Imperial Family]] since 1981.]]\n[[Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragan\u00e7a|Maria Pia of Saxe-Coburg and Braganza]], who claimed she was an illegitimate daughter of King Carlos I of Portugal, began asserting that she was the heir to the throne from 1957.

It is famously found atop the Portuguese Crown Sceptre, the [[Sceptre of the Dragon]] and the Sceptre of the Emperor of Brazil.\n\nThe wyvern is also sometimes used as a [[supporter]] in the coat of arms of both the Brazilian and Portuguese branches of the family.\n\nBecause of its use in heraldry by the Braganza as the ruling house, and given Pedro IV's link with [[Porto]], a dragon was added to the old coat of arms of the municipality of Porto<ref name=\"Barbosa\"/> and is still a part of [[FC Porto]]'s coat of arms, who are nicknamed \"The Dragons\".\n\n=== Curse of the Braganzas ===\n{{main|Curse of the Braganzas}}\n\nSince the 17th century, the House of Braganza has allegedly suffered from the Curse of the Braganzas ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Maldi\u00e7\u00e3o dos Bragan\u00e7as''). For supposedly mistreating a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] friar, a curse was purportedly placed on King [[John IV of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o IV of Portugal]], stating that never again would a first-born male of the Braganza Dynasty would live long enough to succeed to the throne. Since the reign of King Jo\u00e3o IV, all first-born Braganza males, with only three exceptions, have died before they had the opportunity to reign as monarch, either in Portugal or

'''Brigantine Dynasty''' (''Dinastia Brigantina''), is a [[dynasty]] of emperors, kings, princes, and dukes of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] origin which reigned in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]]. \n\nThe house was founded by [[Afonso I, Duke of Braganza|Afonso I, 1st Duke of Braganza]], illegitimate son of King [[John I of Portugal]] of the [[House of Aviz]], and would eventually grow into one of the wealthiest and most powerful noble houses of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] of the [[Portuguese Renaissance|Renaissance]] period. The Braganzas came to rule the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and [[Kingdom of the Algarves|the Algarves]] after successfully deposing the [[Philippine Dynasty]] in the [[Portuguese Restoration War|Restoration War]], resulting in the [[Duke of Braganza]] becoming King [[John IV of Portugal]], in 1640. The Braganzas ruled Portugal and the [[Portuguese Empire]] from 1640 and with the creation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]], in 1815, and the subsequent independence of the [[Empire of Brazil]], in 1822, the Braganzas came to rule as the [[List of monarchs of Brazil|monarchs of Brazil]].\n\nThe House of Braganza produced 15 [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese monarchs]] and all four [[List of Brazilian monarchs|Brazilian monarchs]], numerous consorts to various European kingdoms, such as [[Catherine of Braganza]] (wife of [[Charles II of England]] who introduced [[tea]] to Britain) and [[Maria Isabel of Braganza]] (wife of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] who founded the [[Museo del Prado|El Prado Museum]]), as well as sometime candidates for the thrones of Poland and Greece, [[Infante Manuel, Count of Our\u00e9m]] and [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro, Duke of Braganza]], respectively, and numerous other notable figures in the histories of Europe and the Americas. The Braganzas were deposed from their thrones in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] at the turn of the 19th\u201320th centuries, when [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] was [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|deposed in Brazil]], in 1889, and when [[Manuel II of Portugal|King Manuel II]] was [[5 October 1910 revolution|deposed in Portugal]], in 1910.\n\nFollowing the reign of King [[John VI of Portugal]], the Braganzas were split into three main branches of the family: the [[Brazilian Imperial Family|Brazilian branch]], headed by King John VI's eldest son, Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]], the Constitutional branch, headed by Emperor Pedro I's eldest daughter, Queen [[Maria II of Portugal]], and the [[Miguelist|Miguelist branch]], headed by King John VI's second eldest son, King [[Miguel I of Portugal]]. The Brazilian branch, following 1921, became the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], whose leadership is disputed by two branches of its own: the Vassouras branch, headed by [[Prince Luiz of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], and the Petr\u00f3polis branch, headed by [[Prince Pedro Carlos of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]]. The Constitutional branch died out with the death of King Manuel II in 1932, passing its claim to the Portuguese throne to the Miguelist Branch, by way of [[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza]]. The claim to the Portuguese Crown, and thus to the leadership of the House of Braganza, passed to Duarte Nuno's son, [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza]], who is currently the most recognized pretender to the Portuguese throne.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Feudal establishment ===\n[[File:Afonso first Duke of Braganza.jpg|thumb|left|[[Afonso I, Duke of Braganza|Afonso I]], first [[Duke of Braganza]] and founder of the House of Braganza]]\n[[File:D. Isabel de Barcelos (1402-1465) - Genealogia de D. Manuel Pereira, 3.\u00ba conde da Feira (1534).png|thumb|left|[[Isabel of Barcelos|Isabel of Braganza]] was the first to intermarry with the royal family, as wife of [[John, Constable of Portugal|Infante Jo\u00e3o, Constable of Portugal]].]]\nThe House of Braganza originated with [[Afonso I, Duke of Braganza|Afonso I]], an illegitimate son of King [[John I of Portugal]], founder of the [[House of Aviz]], and In\u00eas Pires.{{efn|name=In\u00eas Pires}} Though Afonso was illegitimate, his father valued and cared for him a great deal, demonstrated by his arrangement of Afonso's marriage to [[Beatriz Pereira de Alvim]], daughter of [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]], Portugal's most important general and a personal friend of King John I. As well as increasing his social status by his marriage into a well-established house, Afonso also became the eighth [[Count of Barcelos]], an honour ceded to him by his father-in-law, who had been made the seventh count by John I.\n\nWith his newly consolidated place in the [[Portuguese nobility|nobility of Portugal]], Afonso commenced what would be a highly successful political and social career. In 1415 he took part in the [[Conquest of Ceuta]], alongside his father, his brothers, and the leading members of the nobility and military. By the time of his father's death in 1433, Afonso had won favour with his brother, King [[Duarte I of Portugal|Duarte I]] and the rest of high Portuguese society. With his brother's premature death in 1438, a regency was established for Afonso's nephew, the 6&nbsp;year old King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]], under the leadership of the king's mother, [[Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Portugal|Leonor of Aragon]], and later Afonso's brother, [[Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra]]. The Duke of Coimbra's regency, however, soon proved unpopular and Afonso quickly became the King's preferred advisor. On 30 December 1442, the Duke of Coimbra, still the King's regent and thus acting in his name, created Afonso as the [[Duke of Braganza]], as a gesture of good will and reconciliation between the two brothers.  Afonso's elevation to the dukedom, the highest level of nobility, marked the foundation of the House of Braganza, which was to become a key family in Portuguese history.\n\nAs a result of the hard work and success of Afonso I, his children all secured successful positions and lived privileged lives. Afonso I's first son, [[Afonso of Braganza, 1st Marquis of Valen\u00e7a|Afonso of Braganza]], was a prominent member of the nobility, having been ceded, by his grandfather, Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira, the lucrative and powerful title of [[Count of Our\u00e9m]], in 1422. He was an accomplished diplomat, and served as the king's representative at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1436, and the [[Council of Florence]] in 1439. In 1451, the Count of Our\u00e9m was made [[Marquis of Valen\u00e7a]] and escorted [[Eleanor of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress|Infanta Leonor of Portugal]] to her husband [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Later, in 1458, he participated in the capture and conquest of [[Alc\u00e1cer-Ceguer]]. The Marquis of Valen\u00e7a, however, died in 1460, one year before his father and therefore did not succeed him. Afonso I's first daughter, [[Isabel of Braganza, Lady of Reguengos de Monsaraz|Isabel of Braganza]], married [[Infante Jo\u00e3o, Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz]], thus relinking the House of Braganza to the Royal House of Portugal. Isabel's strategic marriage proved successful, and produced four children, whose descendants would be some of the most important in Iberian history. Afonso I's last child and successor, [[Fernando I, Duke of Braganza]], continued his legacy of prominence in the military and society.\n\nWhen Fernando I was born, in 1403, his grandfather, Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira, ceded him the title of [[Count of Arraiolos]]. Fernando became an accomplished military man, participating in various [[Moroccan\u2013Portuguese conflicts|Portuguese imperial campaigns]]. Though Fernando I was a popular and powerful member of the nobility, he did not always find himself in the favour of the king, most notably exemplified when Fernando I openly declaimed King Duarte I, at the [[Portuguese Cortes]], on the topic of the rescue and recovery of the King's brother, [[Ferdinand the Holy Prince|Infante Fernando, Lord of Salvaterra de Magos]] from the Moors. However, Fernando I became a favourite of both the royal and imperial government and of King Afonso V, earning him the position of Governor of Ceuta and the titles of [[Marquis of Vila Vi\u00e7osa]] and [[Count of Neiva]].\n[[File:Pa\u00e7o dos Duques 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Palace of the Dukes of Braganza|Palace of the Dukes]], in [[Guimar\u00e3es]], was [[Family seat|seat]] of the House of Braganza from 1420 until [[Fernando II, Duke of Braganza|Fernando II of Braganza]] was executed for treason by [[John II of Portugal|King Jo\u00e3o II]] in 1483.]]\nFernando I's children, by his wife, Joana de Castro, Lady of Cadaval, continued to enlarge the influence of the House of Braganza. Of his nine children, all six who survived to adulthood established themselves either through positions or marriages, though the actions of King [[Jo\u00e3o II of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o II]] would seek to weaken their influence. Fernando I's first son and successor, [[Fernando II, Duke of Braganza|Fernando II]], was initially a bright and popular nobleman, but his conflict with King Jo\u00e3o II would see his and the House's downfall. His second son, [[Jo\u00e3o of Braganza, 1st Marquis of Montemor-o-Novo]], was an accomplished military man and was made [[Constable of Portugal]]. Fernando's third son, Afonso of Braganza, became a popular nobleman of society and was made 1st [[Count of Faro]]. The Duke's fourth son, [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], inherited the fiefs of his mother, becoming the 5th Lord of Ferreira, 4th Lord of Cadaval, and 1st Lord of Tent\u00fagal. Fernando's eldest surviving daughter, Beatriz of Braganza, married Pedro de Meneses, 1st [[Marquis of Vila Real]]. Fernando's last surviving child, Guiomar of Braganza, married Henrique de Meneses, 4th [[Count of Viana do Alentejo]]. Ultimately, however, Fernando I's children and grandchildren would suffer great difficulty under the reign of King Jo\u00e3o II.\n\nBy the tenure of the third duke, [[Fernando II, Duke of Braganza|Fernando II]], the House of Braganza was undoubtedly one of the greatest noble houses of Portugal and Iberia as a whole. Fernando II continued the House's legacy of acquisition and gained the title of [[Duke of Guimar\u00e3es]]. To the Duke and the House's downfall, however, King Jo\u00e3o II's reign concerned itself with the royal consolidation of power and the diminishment of the nobility. In his mission to centralize power, the King executed many nobleman of the great houses of Portugal, alongside confiscating their properties and exiling their families. Fernando II, having been a prominent and powerful nobleman, was accused of treason and executed by King Jo\u00e3o II; the House's titles and properties were merged into the crown and its members exiled to Castile.\n\nDue to their father's misfortunes, Fernando II's children, from his marriage to [[Isabella of Viseu|Isabel of Viseu]], daughter of [[Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu|Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu and Beja]], initially  had a tumultuous childhood; but King Jo\u00e3o II's successor, King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], who had previously himself been the [[Duke of Beja]], chose to forgive the House and re-grant them all their properties in exchange for their loyalty. Fernando II's oldest surviving son and successor, [[Jaime I, Duke of Braganza|Jaime I]], returned to Portugal and reestablished himself at [[Vila Vi\u00e7osa]], the former seat of the Dukes. Fernando II's only other surviving son, [[Denis of Braganza, Count of Lemos|Dinis of Braganza]], married  Beatriz de Castro Os\u00f3rio, Countess of Lemos, and had four children with her.\n\n=== Portuguese Renaissance ===\n[[File:Jaime I Braganca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jaime I, Duke of Braganza|Jaime I]] restored the Braganzas' status after his father's execution and built the [[Ducal Palace of Vila Vi\u00e7osa]].]]\n[[File:D.

Upon his return to Portugal from exile, Jaime took possession of the House's formerly confiscated properties. In order to establish a new image for the House, he ordered the construction of a new seat for the House, which would become one of the largest palaces in Iberia, the [[Ducal Palace of Vila Vi\u00e7osa]]. Jaime I's restoration also continued with the House's relations with the King, Jaime I having becoming a favourite of King Manuel I and even once his temporary heir. The Duke also had his share of scandal, having funded the conquest of the city of [[Azamor]], for the royal crown as, as punishment for his ordering the murder of his first wife, Leonor P\u00e9rez de Guzman, daughter of [[Juan Alfonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 3rd Duke of Medina Sidonia]].\n\nThe children of Jaime I, both the two first children by his first wife, Leonor of P\u00e9rez de Guzman, and the later eight children by his second wife, Joana of Mendo\u00e7a, all saw successful lives under the restored House of Braganza. Jaime I's first daughter, [[Isabella of Braganza, Duchess of Guimar\u00e3es|Isabel of Braganza]], married [[Infante Edward, 4th Duke of Guimar\u00e3es|Infante Duarte, Duke of Guimar\u00e3es]], and had three children, while his first son and successor, [[Teod\u00f3sio I, Duke of Braganza|Teod\u00f3sio I]], was a successful prince of the [[Portuguese Renaissance]]. Five of Jaime I's children, Jaime, Maria, Fulg\u00eancio, Teot\u00f3nio, and Vic\u00eancia, all entered into religious orders. The Duke's second daughter, Joana of Braganza, married Bernardino de Cardenas, 3rd Marquis of Elche, and his third daughter, Eug\u00e9nia of Braganza, married Francisco de Melo, 2nd [[Marquis of Ferreira]]. Jaime I's only other son, other than Teod\u00f3sio I, to not enter into the church, [[Constantino of Braganza]], married Maria de Melo, daughter of D. Rodrigo de Melo, 1st [[Marquis of Ferreira]], but had no children. Constantino was famed as a great officer of the [[Portuguese Empire]], having served as the [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Viceroy of Portuguese India]] and [[List of colonial governors of Cape Verde#Ribeira Grande|Captain of Ribeira Grande]], among other positions.\n[[File:ConstantinoBraganca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constantino of Braganza]] was [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Viceroy of Portuguese India]] & led the [[Portuguese invasion of Jaffna kingdom (1560)|1st Portuguese invasion of Sri Lanka]].]]\nThe fifth Duke, [[Teod\u00f3sio I, Duke of Braganza|Teod\u00f3sio I]], is remembered for being the personification of the [[Portuguese Renaissance]]. A patron of the arts and scholarly noble, Teod\u00f3sio I maintained the prestige of the House of Braganza, although not leaving a significant mark on the House's history. The Duke notably ceded the Dukedom of Guimar\u00e3es to [[Infante Edward, 4th Duke of Guimar\u00e3es|Infante Duarte of Portugal]] as the dowry of his sister, [[Isabella of Braganza, Duchess of Guimar\u00e3es|Isabel of Braganza]].\n\nTeod\u00f3sio I's first son, Jaime of Braganza, died before he could inherit his father's titles, fighting alongside King [[Sebastian I of Portugal|Sebasti\u00e3o I]] at the [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]]. The Duke's only daughter, Isabel of Braganza, married Miguel Luis de Meneses, 1st [[Duke of Caminha]], though their union had no issue. Teod\u00f3sio I's last child and successor, [[Jo\u00e3o I, Duke of Braganza|Jo\u00e3o I]], lived a very different life from Teod\u00f3sio I's calm and relatively peaceful tenure, having been involved in the controversies of the [[Portuguese succession crisis of 1580]] and the subsequent [[War of the Portuguese Succession]].\n\n[[Jo\u00e3o I, Duke of Braganza|Jo\u00e3o I]]'s tenure as Duke was one intertwined with controversy and intrigue. Having been married to [[Catherine, Duchess of Braganza|Infanta Catarina]], daughter of [[Infante Edward, 4th Duke of Guimar\u00e3es|Infante Duarte, Duke of Guimar\u00e3es]], and thus a grandchild of King Manuel I, during the succession crisis of 1580, the couple pressed their claims to the Portuguese throne. Though Infanta Catarina was a popular claimant, her [[Philippine Dynasty|Habsburg]] cousin was eventually crowned [[Philip I of Portugal]] and the [[Iberian Union]] was established. In an attempt at reconciliation with the Brigantine House, King Philip I renewed the title of Constable of Portugal, which Jo\u00e3o I had held previously, to the Duke's first son, [[Teod\u00f3sio II, Duke of Braganza|Teod\u00f3sio II]], alongside other title and land grants to the Duke and the House.\n\nJo\u00e3o I's daughters, Maria, Serefina, Querubina, and Ang\u00e9lica, were some of the most eligible ladies of Portugal and all Iberia, though the only one to marry was Serefina of Braganza, who married Castilian [[Juan Fernandez Pacheco, 5th Duke of Escalona]]. The Duke's oldest son and successor, Teod\u00f3sio II, famously fought in the Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir at the age of ten and later became an accomplished general. Jo\u00e3o I's second son, Duarte of Braganza, was made 1st Marquis of Frechilla, and the Duke's third son, Alexandre of Braganza, became [[Archbishop of \u00c9vora]], both receiving their titles and many concessions from King Philip I when the monarch was making amends with the House of Braganza. Unlike his other sons, Jo\u00e3o I's last son, Filipe of Braganza, died without marriage, children, or titles.\n[[File:Rubens John, Duke of Braganza.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In 1640, [[John IV of Portugal]] became the first Braganza to reign as [[list of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]], starting the [[Portuguese Restoration War]].]]\nThe seventh Duke, Teod\u00f3sio II, became famous at a young age, having been made page to King [[Sebastian I of Portugal|Sebasti\u00e3o I]] and having marched into the Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir, alongside the King and his uncle, Jaime of Braganza, at the age of ten. Teod\u00f3sio II later pledged his allegiance and became a faithful countryman to the Philippine Dynasty, having even defended [[Lisbon]] against King Philip I's rival claimant to the throne, [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]], who had been acclaimed, by his supporters, as King Ant\u00f3nio I of Portugal. In recognition for his military prowess, Teod\u00f3sio II was made Constable of Portugal. The Duke's support and service to the Philippine Dynasty, earned the Braganzas more lands and titles and, by 1640, the House had amassed around 80,000 vassals, alongside numerous churches, orders, and institutions under its patronage.{{sfn|McMurdo|1889|p=363}}\n\nIn 1603, Teod\u00f3sio II married [[Ana de Velasco y Gir\u00f3n]], daughter of Castilian [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Velasco, 5th Duke of Fr\u00edas]], and had four children with her. The Duke's first son and successor, [[Jo\u00e3o IV of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o II]], raise the House of Braganza to new heights of power, having launched the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] and been acclaimed King Jo\u00e3o IV of Portugal, thus installing the House as the ruling dynasty of Portugal. Teod\u00f3sio II's second son, Duarte of Braganza, was made Lord of Vila do Conde and became a diplomat, serving at the court of [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor]], but later died a prisoner as a cost of the Restoration War. Teod\u00f3sio II's two other children, Alexandre and Catarina, both died without children, titles, or marriage.\n\n=== Throne of Portugal ===\n[[File:Catherine of Braganza, Queen of England.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Catherine of Braganza]], wife of [[Charles II of England]], credited with introducing the [[English people|English]] to [[tea]]-drinking, popular with the [[Portuguese nobility]].]]\nBy 1640 the wise policies of D. Philip I in respect of Portugal were long past. The country was overtaxed, Portuguese colonies were left unprotected, and the King [[Philip III of Portugal]] no longer had the trust or support of most [[Portuguese nobility]]. He was especially loathed by the powerful Portuguese guild of merchants. Portugal, like the rest of Philip's kingdoms, was on the verge of rebellion.\n\nThe eighth Duke of Braganza, D. [[Jo\u00e3o IV of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o II of Braganza]], had inherited the claim of his grandmother, Infanta Catarina of Portugal, and the remoter claim through of his grandfather Jo\u00e3o I of Braganza. Because of his claims, the discontent Portuguese nobility asked Jo\u00e3o II to lead their restoration as their king.\n\nAccording to court historians, D. Jo\u00e3o II was a modest man without particular ambitions to the crown. Legend says that his wife, Dona [[Luisa de Guzm\u00e1n]], daughter of the duke of Medina-Sidonia, urged him to accept the offer, saying \"I'd rather be queen for one day than duchess for a lifetime.\" He accepted the leadership of the rebellion, which was successful, and was acclaimed Jo\u00e3o IV of Portugal on 1 December 1640.\n\nAfter the accession of the Braganzas to the throne, the duchy was linked to the Crown. \"Duke of Braganza\" became the traditional title of the heir to the throne, together with [[Prince of Brazil]] and, later, [[Prince Royal of Portugal]], much as [[Prince of Wales]] is in the United Kingdom or [[Prince of Asturias]] in Spain.\n\nUnder D. Jo\u00e3o's sons D. [[Afonso VI of Portugal|Afonso VI]] and D. [[Pedro II of Portugal|Pedro II]], the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial empire]], part of which was lost during the Spanish occupation, was restored and expanded, bringing new wealth to Portugal.\n\nThe zenith of the Braganza dynasty came with the long reign of D. [[Jo\u00e3o V of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o V]] (1706\u20131750), who ruled with grandeur and piety. The reign of D. [[Joseph I of Portugal|Jos\u00e9 I]], son of D. Jo\u00e3o V, was marked by the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|great earthquake]], which struck [[Lisbon]] in 1755. The political genius of his reign was the [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal|1st Marquis of Pombal]]. The end of the 18th century was characterized by stability, under the rule of Dona [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]] (1777\u20131816), who discharged Pombal at her accession. Unfortunately Dona Maria became psychologically unstable, displaying similar symptoms to [[George III of the United Kingdom]] in his later years.\n\n=== Realm in Brazil ===\n[[File:Maria I (stockholm gripsholms slott).jpg|thumb|right|[[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]] became the first [[list of monarchs of Brazil|monarch of Brazil]] with the creation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] in 1815.]]\nIn 1808, faced with impending [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic invasion]], the Braganzas [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|transferred their royal court]] to the [[State of Brazil]], Portugal's largest colony. Some time after they had crossed the Atlantic, a royal decree changed the status of Brazil from a Portuguese [[colony]] into kingdom alongside Portugal, and the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] was formed. In 1821, D. [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o VI]], who succeeded in 1816, returned to Portugal.\n\nD. [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro, Prince Royal of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]], the eldest son of D. Jo\u00e3o VI and also regent in Brazil, sided with the Brazilian rebels in January 1822. He [[Brazilian independence|was acclaimed]] [[Emperor of Brazil|Emperor D. Pedro I]] of an independent Brazil in 1822, founding the [[Empire of Brazil]]. D. Pedro I ruled Brazil until 1831, when he abdicated in favor of his young son D. [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], and returned to Portugal to aid his daughter D. Maria II (see below).\n\nD. Pedro II, being only 6&nbsp;years old at the time of his coronation, had a regency established. The regency would rule until 1840, when the Emperor turned 14&nbsp;years old. His reign would last until 1889, when the Brazilian monarchy was abolished. His reign would see the [[slavery in Brazil|abolition of slavery]] in Brazil, economic growth, and very long periods of tranquility and development in his empire.\n\n=== Warring branches ===\n[[File:Dom Jo\u00e3o, Pr\u00edncipe Regente, passando revista \u00e0s tropas na Azambuja - Domingos Sequeira, 1803.png|thumb|left|King-Emperor [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o VI]]'s children split the Braganzas into 3 branches: the [[Brazilian imperial family|Brazilian Imperial]] branch, the Portuguese Constitutional branch, and the exiled [[Miguelist]] branch.]]\nIn Portugal, D. Pedro I of Brazil became King as D. Pedro IV (1826), but no one wanted to re-establish the union of Portugal and Brazil. Pedro abdicated the Portuguese throne in favor of his daughter Princess [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria da Gl\u00f3ria]], then seven years old. D. Pedro's brother D. [[Miguel of Portugal|Miguel]] was to act as Regent, and to marry Maria when she came of age. In 1828, Miguel instead proclaimed himself King of Portugal and repudiated the liberal constitution granted by D. Jo\u00e3o VI, trying to establish an [[absolute monarchy]].\n\nIn 1828, Maria II was forced into exile by her uncle, the new King Miguel I. Her father D. Pedro IV of Portugal returned from Brazil, launched a successful military campaign, from the [[Azores]], against Miguel I. He finally defeated and exiled Miguel I in 1834. Though exiled, Miguel would not give up his claim to the throne and would establish the '''[[Miguelist#The Miguelist branch of the Braganzas|Miguelist branch]]''' of the House of Braganza. The strategic marriages of his children to the various royal houses of Europe would earn him the nickname the \"Grandfather of Europe\" (''see [[Descendants of Miguel I of Portugal]]'').\n\n=== First Reign of Brazil ===\n[[File:DpedroI-brasil-full.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Emperor-King [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I & IV]] achieved [[Independence of Brazil|Brazil's Independence]] as [[Emperor of Brazil]] & won the [[Liberal Wars]] as [[King of Portugal]].]]\nOn 7 September 1822, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro of Braganza, Prince Royal of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]], member of the House of Braganza, heir apparent to the Portuguese throne and Regent of the [[Kingdom of Brazil]], declared the country's independence from the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] and was acclaimed [[Emperor of Brazil]]. On 12 October, the prince was acclaimed Pedro I, first Emperor of the newly created Empire of Brazil, a constitutional monarchy. In 1825, signing the [[Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825)|treaty of Rio de Janeiro]] of this date, his father, King Dom [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o VI]], recognized the independence of the new state, the former Portuguese dominion, now [[Empire of Brazil]].\n\nPedro&nbsp;I encountered a number of crises during his reign. A secessionist rebellion in the [[Cisplatine Province]] in early 1825 and the subsequent attempt by the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] (later [[Argentina]]) to annex Cisplatina led the Empire into the failed [[Cisplatine War]]. In March 1826, Jo\u00e3o&nbsp;VI died and Pedro&nbsp;I inherited the Portuguese crown, briefly becoming King Pedro&nbsp;IV of Portugal before abdicating in favor of his eldest daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]. The situation worsened in 1828 when the war in the south ended with Brazil's loss of Cisplatina, which would become the independent republic of [[Uruguay]]. During the same year in Lisbon, Maria&nbsp;II's throne was usurped by [[Miguel I of Portugal|Prince Miguel]], Pedro&nbsp;I's younger brother.\n\nOther difficulties arose when the Empire's parliament opened in 1826. Pedro&nbsp;I, along with a significant percentage of the legislature, argued for an independent judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance.\n\nThe struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro&nbsp;II]], on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to [[Liberal Wars|restore his daughter to her throne]].\n\n=== Second Reign of Brazil===\n[[File:Pedro II Admiral Brazil 1870.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] was the last [[Emperor of Brazil]] after the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil]] in 1889.]]\n[[File:Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Isabel of Braganza, Princess Imperial of Brazil]] signed the ''[[Lei \u00c1urea]]'' in 1888, abolishing [[slavery in Brazil]].]]\nPedro I's successor in Brazil was his five-year-old son, Pedro II. As the latter was still a minor, a weak regency was created. The power vacuum resulting from the absence of a ruling monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro II, once he was declared of age in 1840, at 14 years old, managed to bring peace and stability to the country, which eventually became an emerging international power. Brazil was victorious in three international conflicts (the [[Platine War]], the [[Uruguayan War]] and the [[Paraguayan War]]) under Pedro II's rule, and the Empire prevailed in several other international disputes and outbreaks of domestic strife. With prosperity and economic development came an influx of European immigration, including Protestants and Jews, although Brazil remained mostly Catholic. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888 by [[Isabel of Brazil|Princess Isabel]].\n\nEven though the last four decades of Pedro II's reign were marked by continuous internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither Pedro II nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. Although there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government, republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the [[First Brazilian Republic]]. Throughout the coup Pedro II dismissed all suggestions put forward by politicians and military leaders for quelling the rebellion. The Emperor and his family were exiled to the Portuguese kingdom and France. Although there was significant monarchist reaction after the fall of the Empire,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} this was thoroughly suppressed, and neither Pedro II nor his daughter and heiress supported a forced restoration.\n\n=== Constitutional Kings ===\n[[File:SMF Manoel II.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], last [[King of Portugal]] and the last Braganza to rule as a monarch.]]\nIn 1835, Queen Maria II of Portugal married Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, later King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal]]. Despite the tradition of following the custom of patrilineal descent of royal houses, common throughout Europe, Article 5 of the Portuguese constitution of 1826 stated that \"''The Reigning Dynasty of the Most Serene House of Braganza Shall Continue in the Person of Lady Princess Maria da Gl\u00f3ria, by the Abdication and Cession of Her August Father Lord Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil, Legitimate Heir and Successor of Lord Jo\u00e3o VI.''\".<ref>[http://www.fd.unl.pt/Anexos/Investigacao/1533.pdf Portuguese Constitution of 1826] p. Title 1, Article 5.</ref>\n\nMaria II was succeeded in 1853 by her son D. [[Pedro V of Portugal|Pedro V]], a hard-working reformer who died prematurely in 1861 due to cholera. D. Pedro V was succeeded by his brother D. [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal|Lu\u00eds]], as D. Pedro V had no children.\n\nD. Lu\u00eds I was succeeded in 1889 by his son D. [[Carlos I of Portugal|Carlos I]]. Carlos I's popularity dramatically declined after an unfavorable deal from an incident known as the [[British Ultimatum]], whereby the [[Portuguese Empire]] ceded its claim to territories (known as the ''[[Pink Map]]'') between [[Portuguese West Africa]] and [[Portuguese East Africa]] to the British. Pursuant to his unpopularity, the monarchy became increasingly unpopular in the country.\n\nKing Carlos I was [[Lisbon Regicide|assassinated in 1908 together with his eldest son]], D. [[Lu\u00eds Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Lu\u00eds Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal and Duke of Braganza]], by republicans. His younger son, D. [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel, Duke of Beja]], survived the attack on his father and elder brother and became king as Manuel II, but was toppled two years later in the [[5 October 1910 revolution|1910 republican revolution]]. After the revolution, Manuel was forced into exile in England by the [[Portuguese First Republic]], but he would continue to support his [[Portugal|fatherland]] until his death.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== Modern Braganzas ===\n==== Portuguese Braganzas ====\n[[File:Jantar dos Conjurados.2008 029 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|D. [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza]], Head of the House of Braganza and recognized pretender to the [[Crown of Portugal]] since 1976.]]\nAfter the revolution of 1910, King Manuel II settled in England until his death in 1932. He was childless, and descendants of Miguel of Braganza (the usurper of 1826) claimed the throne. In 1920\u201322, the two (of the now four) branches of the House of Braganza negotiated an alleged pact under which Manuel II named as his heir [[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza|Duarte Nuno of Braganza]], grandson of Miguel. Duarte Nuno, now Duke of Braganza, remained the Braganza pretender until his death in 1976. In 1942, he married a great-granddaughter of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]], uniting the two lines of the House.\n\nIn 1950 Portugal repealed the law of exile against the Braganzas,<ref>Law no. 2040 (published in the [[Di\u00e1rio do Governo]] no. 99/1950, Series I of 1950-05-27, page 323)</ref> and D. Duarte Nuno moved to the country in 1952.\n\nDuarte Nuno was succeeded as pretender by his son, [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza|Duarte Pio of Braganza]] (born 1945). Duarte Pio served in the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] and took the customary oath of allegiance to the Republic, but Portuguese monarchists recognize him as the pretender to the Portuguese throne. In 1995 he married [[Isabel de Her\u00e9dia]], a Portuguese businesswoman and descendant of the Viscount of Ribeira Brava. He worked actively in support of the independence of [[East Timor]] from [[Indonesia]].\n\nDuarte Pio and Isabel have three children. Duarte Pio's oldest son is [[Afonso, Prince of Beira|Afonso de Santa Maria]], who bears the traditional titles of [[Prince of Beira]] (as heir apparent to the Portuguese pretender) and [[Duke of Barcelos]] (as heir apparent to the Duke of Braganza).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} He has a brother [[Dinis, Duke of Porto]], and a sister, [[Infanta Maria Francisca of Portugal (b. 1997)|Infanta Maria Francisca]].\n[[File:Dom Bertrand de Orleans e Bragan\u00e7a.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Prince Bertrand of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], [[Prince Imperial of Brazil]] and speaker on behalf of his brother [[Prince Luiz of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], Head of the [[Brazilian Imperial Family]] since 1981.]]\n[[Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragan\u00e7a|Maria Pia of Saxe-Coburg and Braganza]], who claimed she was an illegitimate daughter of King Carlos I of Portugal, began asserting that she was the heir to the throne from 1957.

His eldest daughter and family went to live in the [[Chateau d'Eu]] in French [[Normandy]]. She was recognized by Brazilian monarchists as Empress-in-Exile as [[Isabel of Brazil|Dona Isabel I of Brazil]] until her death in 1921.\n\nShe was succeeded by her grandson, [[Prince Pedro Henrique of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], as [[House of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza|Head of the Imperial House of Brazil]], and he by his son and current Head, [[Prince Luiz of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]].\n\nWith the end of the banishment of the Imperial Family in 1920, some princes returned to live in Brazil, while another remained in Europe. After the end of [[World War II]], Prince Pedro Henrique, then Head of the Imperial House and married to [[Princess Maria Elisabeth of Bavaria]], returned to Brazil with his family.\n\nThe Imperial House of Brazil divided into rival branches because of the renunciation of [[Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara, Prince of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1]] in 1908 and the subsequent repudiation of that act by his descendants.<ref name=post>Podesta, Don. 20 April 1993.

[[Jochebed|Yochabel]] saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the [[Nile]]. [[Bithiah]], the Pharaoh's recently widowed daughter, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew. Bithiah names the baby [[Moses]].\n\nPrince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with [[Ethiopia]] and establishing an alliance. Moses and princess [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]] fall in love, but she must marry the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh [[Seti I|Sethi]]'s jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter [[Joshua]], who tells him of the [[Yahweh|Hebrew God]]. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yochabel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.\n\nMoses reforms the treatment of [[slaves]] on the project, but Prince [[Ramesses II|Rameses]], Moses's adoptive brother, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.\n\nNefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of [[Levite]] cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yochabel's house where he meets his biological mother, brother Aaron, and sister Miriam.\n\nMoses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer [[Dathan]], who then reports to Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi banishes Moses to the desert leaving Rameses as the sole heir. Yochabel dies sometime later.\n\nMoses makes his way across the desert to a well in [[Midian]]. After defending seven sisters from [[Amalekites]], Moses is housed with the girls' father [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro's eldest daughter [[Zipporah|Sephora]]. Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped hard labor. While farming, Moses sees the [[burning bush]] on the summit of [[Mount Sinai]] and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.\n\nMoses comes before Rameses, now pharaoh, to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a [[cobra]]. [[Jannes and Jambres|Jannes]] performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.\n\nEgypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of [[Khnum]] and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins [[the Exodus]] from Egypt.\n\nAfter being taunted by Nefretiri, Rameses takes his army and pursues the Hebrews to the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] and [[Crossing the Red Sea|parts the Red Sea]]. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.\n\nMoses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. He sees the [[Ten Commandments]] created by God in [[Tablets of Stone|two stone tablets]]. Meanwhile, an impatient Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a [[golden calf]] idol. A wild and decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.\n<!-- DO NOT add biblical information here. This film is not about the book of Exodus; making historical/biblical comparisons here is not relevant, and it does not contribute to the completeness of the article. DO NOT add it again. -->\n\nAfter God informs Moses of the orgy, the latter descends from the mountain and reunites with Joshua. Enraged at the sight of decadence, he throws the tablets at the golden calf, which explodes, killing the wicked revelers, and causing the others to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.\n\nForty years later, an elderly Moses leads the Hebrews towards [[Canaan]]. However, he could not enter the Promised land due to a mentioned previous disobedience to the Lord. He instead names Joshua as leader, and bids farewell to the Hebrews at Mount Nebo.\n\n==Cast==\nIn the film's [[title sequence]], the cast is credited in the following order:\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Moses]] (and the voice of God at the Burning Bush)<ref name=\"Charlton Heston: The EW Q&A\" />\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as [[Ramesses II|Rameses II]]\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]]\n* [[Edward G.

Katherine Orrison says that many details of Moses' life left out of the Bible are present in the [[Quran]], which was sometimes used as a source.  She also presents some coincidences in production. The man who designed Moses' distinctive rust-white-and-black-striped robe used those colors because they looked impressive, and only later discovered that these are the actual colors of the Tribe of Levi. [[Arnold Friberg]] would later state that he was the one who designed Moses' costume. As a gift, after the production, DeMille gave Moses' robe to Friberg, who had it in his possession until his death in 2010. Moses' robe as worn by Charlton Heston was hand-woven by Dorothea Hulse, one of the world's finest weavers. She also created costumes for [[The Robe (film)|''The Robe'']], as well as textiles and costume fabrics for ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', ''[[David and Bathsheba (film)|David and Bathsheba]]'', and others.\n\nJesse Lasky Jr., a co-writer on ''The Ten Commandments'', described how DeMille would customarily spread out prints of paintings by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] to inform his set designers on the look he wanted to achieve. Arnold Friberg, in addition to designing sets and costumes, also contributed the manner in which Moses ordained [[Joshua]] to his mission at the end of the film: by the laying on of hands, placing his hands on Joshua's head. Friberg, a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], demonstrated the LDS manner of performing such ordinations, and DeMille liked it.\n\nThe Pharaoh is usually shown wearing the [[Pschent|red-and-white crown]] of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] or the [[nemes]] royal headdress. For his pursuit of the Israelites, he wears the blue [[Khepresh]] helmet-crown, which the pharaohs wore for battle.\n\nSets, costumes and props from the film ''[[The Egyptian (film)|The Egyptian]]'' were bought and re-used for ''The Ten Commandments'' - including the red-and-white double crown. As the events in ''The Egyptian'' take place 70 years before the reign of Rameses II, an unintentional sense of continuity was created.\n\nAn Egyptian wall painting was also the source for the lively dance performed by a circle of young women at Sethi's birthday gala. Their movements and costumes are based on art from the Tomb of the Sixth Dynasty Grand Vizier [[Mehu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/partytime.htm|title=Party Time in Ancient Egypt|publisher=}}</ref>\nSome of the film's cast members, such as [[Anne Baxter|Baxter]], [[Debra Paget|Paget]], [[John Derek|Derek]], and [[Nina Foch|Foch]], wore brown [[contact lens]]es, at the behest of DeMille, in order to conceal their light-colored eyes which were considered inadequate for their roles.<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\">{{cite news |last=Belser |first=Emily |title=Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19550601&id=BtUzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EesFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3432,38731 |accessdate=March 28, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |date=June 1, 1955}}</ref> Paget once said that, \"If it hadn't been for the lenses I wouldn't have got the part.\"<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> However, she also said that the lenses were \"awful to work in because the [[Klieg light|kleig light]]s heat them up\".<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> When DeMille cast [[Yvonne De Carlo]] as [[Zipporah|Sephora]], she was worried about having to wear these contact lenses; she also believed that her gray eyes were her best feature.<ref name=\"Katherine Orrison's audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)\">[[Katherine Orrison]]'s audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)</ref> She asked DeMille to make an exception for her.

Initially, DeMille hired Bernstein, then a relatively unknown film composer, to write and record only the [[diegetic music]] required for the film's dance sequences and other onscreen musical passages, with the intention of employing frequent collaborator [[Victor Young]] to write the score proper. However, Young turned down the assignment due to his own failing health, causing DeMille to hire Bernstein to write the underscore as well.<ref name=\"DeWald\">{{cite news|last1=DeWald|first1=Frank K.|title=So Let It Be Written.

The score is written in a highly [[Romantic music|Romantic]] style, featuring unique musical [[leitmotif]]s for the film's characters (God, Moses, Rameses, Nefretiri, etc.) used in a manner inspired, at DeMille's direction, by the opera scores of [[Richard Wagner]].<ref name=\"DeWald\"/> Bernstein recorded both the diegetic music and the  score at the Paramount Studios Recording Stage in sessions spread from April 1955 to August 1956.<ref>{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Technical Notes|work=The Ten Commandments: 60th Anniversary Soundtrack Collection|publisher=Intrada Records|date=2016}}</ref>\n\nA double-LP [[monaural]] soundtrack album was released in 1957 by [[Dot Records]], utilizing excerpts from the original film recordings.

Since 2006 the network has typically aired ''The Ten Commandments'' on the Saturday night prior to Easter, with the broadcast starting at 7&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s and 6&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]/[[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]]/[[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]]/[[Hawaii Time Zone|Hawaii]]. The film is one of only two pre-scheduled ''[[ABC Saturday Movie of the Week|ABC Saturday Movies of the Week]]'' every year, the other being ''[[The Sound of Music (1965 film)|The Sound of Music]]''.\n\nUnlike many lengthy films of the day, which were usually broken up into separate airings over at least two nights, ABC elected to show ''The Ten Commandments'' in one night and has done so every year it has carried the film, with one exception; in 1997, ABC elected to split the movie in two and aired half of it in its normal Easter Sunday slot, which that year was March 30, with the second half airing on Monday, March 31 as counterprogramming to the other networks' offerings, which included [[CBS]]' coverage of the [[1997 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game]].<ref>''TV Guide'' listings for March 29 \u2013 April 4, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe length of the film combined with the necessary advertisement breaks has caused its broadcast window to vary over the years; today, ABC's total run time for ''The Ten Commandments'' stands at four hours and forty-four minutes, just above one hour longer its three-hour and thirty-nine-minute length. This requires the network to overrun into the 11&nbsp;p.m./10&nbsp;p.m. timeslot that belongs to the local affiliates, thus delaying their late [[local news]] and any other programming they may air in the overnight hours. Affiliates may also delay the film to the usual start of [[prime time]] at 8&nbsp;p.m./7&nbsp;p.m. to keep their schedules in line for early evening, at the cost of further delaying their local newscasts or forgoing them entirely.\n\nIn 2010, the film was broadcast in [[high-definition television|high definition]] for the first time, which allowed the television audience to see it in its original VistaVision aspect ratio. It is also broadcast with its original [[Spanish language]] dub over the [[second audio program]] channel. In 2015, for the first time in several years, the network undertook a one-off airing of the film on Easter Sunday night, which fell on April 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2015/02/27/abc-to-broadcast-the-ten-commandments-on-easter/|title=ABC to Broadcast \"The Ten Commandments\" on Easter|work=Channel Guide Magazine|date=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n;Ratings by year (since 2007)\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

[[Jochebed|Yochabel]] saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the [[Nile]]. [[Bithiah]], the Pharaoh's recently widowed daughter, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew. Bithiah names the baby [[Moses]].\n\nPrince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with [[Ethiopia]] and establishing an alliance. Moses and princess [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]] fall in love, but she must marry the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh [[Seti I|Sethi]]'s jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter [[Joshua]], who tells him of the [[Yahweh|Hebrew God]]. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yochabel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.\n\nMoses reforms the treatment of [[slaves]] on the project, but Prince [[Ramesses II|Rameses]], Moses's adoptive brother, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.\n\nNefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of [[Levite]] cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yochabel's house where he meets his biological mother, brother Aaron, and sister Miriam.\n\nMoses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer [[Dathan]], who then reports to Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi banishes Moses to the desert leaving Rameses as the sole heir. Yochabel dies sometime later.\n\nMoses makes his way across the desert to a well in [[Midian]]. After defending seven sisters from [[Amalekites]], Moses is housed with the girls' father [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro's eldest daughter [[Zipporah|Sephora]]. Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped hard labor. While farming, Moses sees the [[burning bush]] on the summit of [[Mount Sinai]] and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.\n\nMoses comes before Rameses, now pharaoh, to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a [[cobra]]. [[Jannes and Jambres|Jannes]] performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.\n\nEgypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of [[Khnum]] and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins [[the Exodus]] from Egypt.\n\nAfter being taunted by Nefretiri, Rameses takes his army and pursues the Hebrews to the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] and [[Crossing the Red Sea|parts the Red Sea]]. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.\n\nMoses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. He sees the [[Ten Commandments]] created by God in [[Tablets of Stone|two stone tablets]]. Meanwhile, an impatient Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a [[golden calf]] idol. A wild and decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.\n<!-- DO NOT add biblical information here. This film is not about the book of Exodus; making historical/biblical comparisons here is not relevant, and it does not contribute to the completeness of the article. DO NOT add it again. -->\n\nAfter God informs Moses of the orgy, the latter descends from the mountain and reunites with Joshua. Enraged at the sight of decadence, he throws the tablets at the golden calf, which explodes, killing the wicked revelers, and causing the others to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.\n\nForty years later, an elderly Moses leads the Hebrews towards [[Canaan]]. However, he could not enter the Promised land due to a mentioned previous disobedience to the Lord. He instead names Joshua as leader, and bids farewell to the Hebrews at Mount Nebo.\n\n==Cast==\nIn the film's [[title sequence]], the cast is credited in the following order:\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Moses]] (and the voice of God at the Burning Bush)<ref name=\"Charlton Heston: The EW Q&A\" />\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as [[Ramesses II|Rameses II]]\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]]\n* [[Edward G.

Katherine Orrison says that many details of Moses' life left out of the Bible are present in the [[Quran]], which was sometimes used as a source.  She also presents some coincidences in production. The man who designed Moses' distinctive rust-white-and-black-striped robe used those colors because they looked impressive, and only later discovered that these are the actual colors of the Tribe of Levi. [[Arnold Friberg]] would later state that he was the one who designed Moses' costume. As a gift, after the production, DeMille gave Moses' robe to Friberg, who had it in his possession until his death in 2010. Moses' robe as worn by Charlton Heston was hand-woven by Dorothea Hulse, one of the world's finest weavers. She also created costumes for [[The Robe (film)|''The Robe'']], as well as textiles and costume fabrics for ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', ''[[David and Bathsheba (film)|David and Bathsheba]]'', and others.\n\nJesse Lasky Jr., a co-writer on ''The Ten Commandments'', described how DeMille would customarily spread out prints of paintings by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] to inform his set designers on the look he wanted to achieve. Arnold Friberg, in addition to designing sets and costumes, also contributed the manner in which Moses ordained [[Joshua]] to his mission at the end of the film: by the laying on of hands, placing his hands on Joshua's head. Friberg, a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], demonstrated the LDS manner of performing such ordinations, and DeMille liked it.\n\nThe Pharaoh is usually shown wearing the [[Pschent|red-and-white crown]] of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] or the [[nemes]] royal headdress. For his pursuit of the Israelites, he wears the blue [[Khepresh]] helmet-crown, which the pharaohs wore for battle.\n\nSets, costumes and props from the film ''[[The Egyptian (film)|The Egyptian]]'' were bought and re-used for ''The Ten Commandments'' - including the red-and-white double crown. As the events in ''The Egyptian'' take place 70 years before the reign of Rameses II, an unintentional sense of continuity was created.\n\nAn Egyptian wall painting was also the source for the lively dance performed by a circle of young women at Sethi's birthday gala. Their movements and costumes are based on art from the Tomb of the Sixth Dynasty Grand Vizier [[Mehu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/partytime.htm|title=Party Time in Ancient Egypt|publisher=}}</ref>\nSome of the film's cast members, such as [[Anne Baxter|Baxter]], [[Debra Paget|Paget]], [[John Derek|Derek]], and [[Nina Foch|Foch]], wore brown [[contact lens]]es, at the behest of DeMille, in order to conceal their light-colored eyes which were considered inadequate for their roles.<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\">{{cite news |last=Belser |first=Emily |title=Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19550601&id=BtUzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EesFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3432,38731 |accessdate=March 28, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |date=June 1, 1955}}</ref> Paget once said that, \"If it hadn't been for the lenses I wouldn't have got the part.\"<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> However, she also said that the lenses were \"awful to work in because the [[Klieg light|kleig light]]s heat them up\".<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> When DeMille cast [[Yvonne De Carlo]] as [[Zipporah|Sephora]], she was worried about having to wear these contact lenses; she also believed that her gray eyes were her best feature.<ref name=\"Katherine Orrison's audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)\">[[Katherine Orrison]]'s audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)</ref> She asked DeMille to make an exception for her.

In fact, many of the supposed inaccuracies were actually adopted by DeMille from extra-biblical ancient sources, such as [[Josephus]], the Sepher ha-Yashar, and the [[Chronicle of Moses]]. Moses's career in Ethiopia, for instance, is based on ancient [[midrash]]im.<ref>L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, Philadelphia 1967; A.

Since 2006 the network has typically aired ''The Ten Commandments'' on the Saturday night prior to Easter, with the broadcast starting at 7&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s and 6&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]/[[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]]/[[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]]/[[Hawaii Time Zone|Hawaii]]. The film is one of only two pre-scheduled ''[[ABC Saturday Movie of the Week|ABC Saturday Movies of the Week]]'' every year, the other being ''[[The Sound of Music (1965 film)|The Sound of Music]]''.\n\nUnlike many lengthy films of the day, which were usually broken up into separate airings over at least two nights, ABC elected to show ''The Ten Commandments'' in one night and has done so every year it has carried the film, with one exception; in 1997, ABC elected to split the movie in two and aired half of it in its normal Easter Sunday slot, which that year was March 30, with the second half airing on Monday, March 31 as counterprogramming to the other networks' offerings, which included [[CBS]]' coverage of the [[1997 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game]].<ref>''TV Guide'' listings for March 29 \u2013 April 4, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe length of the film combined with the necessary advertisement breaks has caused its broadcast window to vary over the years; today, ABC's total run time for ''The Ten Commandments'' stands at four hours and forty-four minutes, just above one hour longer its three-hour and thirty-nine-minute length. This requires the network to overrun into the 11&nbsp;p.m./10&nbsp;p.m. timeslot that belongs to the local affiliates, thus delaying their late [[local news]] and any other programming they may air in the overnight hours. Affiliates may also delay the film to the usual start of [[prime time]] at 8&nbsp;p.m./7&nbsp;p.m. to keep their schedules in line for early evening, at the cost of further delaying their local newscasts or forgoing them entirely.\n\nIn 2010, the film was broadcast in [[high-definition television|high definition]] for the first time, which allowed the television audience to see it in its original VistaVision aspect ratio. It is also broadcast with its original [[Spanish language]] dub over the [[second audio program]] channel. In 2015, for the first time in several years, the network undertook a one-off airing of the film on Easter Sunday night, which fell on April 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2015/02/27/abc-to-broadcast-the-ten-commandments-on-easter/|title=ABC to Broadcast \"The Ten Commandments\" on Easter|work=Channel Guide Magazine|date=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n;Ratings by year (since 2007)\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The Mona-19 spores latch themselves directly onto the lower portion of the heart. \n\nMona-19 has an incubation period of approximately 5 years and the patient will begin to show symptoms at that time. \n\n'''Symptoms'''\n\nThey begin with a feeling of love and extreme lust. The patient may feel that they are a goldfishy. This remains however anxiety develops when the patient is separated from the host. This progresses into a feeling of euphoria and bliss when reunited. Mona-19 causes hallucinations and causes the patient to believe they have extreme purpose, love and power. The hallucinations will begin to transform into a feeling of ultimate content and peace. \n\nMeanwhile the Mona-19 virus is growing stronger and becoming unstable in the bloodstream. Due to the hallucinations the patient is experiencing and the imperceptibly small changes in the virus, it is impossible for the patient to feel this instability growing. \n\n'''Progression'''\n\nApproximately 10 months after the symptoms began, the instability can now be felt. It begins very mildly but it will very quickly become overwhelming. The patient will experience physical symptoms such as;\n\nHeadache\n\nInsomnia\n\nVomiting\n\nBody tremors\n\nLack of hunger. \n\nThe mental symptoms are much more extreme. They include;\n\nConfusion\n\nSevere depression \n\nAnxiety\n\nSuspicion\n\nSevere guilt\n\nLoneliness\n\nDesperation\n\nBroken heartedness \n\nSuicidal thoughts\n\n'''Treatment'''\n\nAlthough there is no known cure for Mona-19, treatment of the symptoms may include alchohol therapy, yelling \u201cfuck it\u201d when necessary and working out to the point of blackout. Scientists in the field believe that a cure may be found In the future with the proper resource management and approval. However the Mona-19 virus is chronic and the one patient will experience relapses of the symptoms for the rest of their life.\n\n== Influenza D virus ==\n\nThe influenza viruses are members of the family ''[[Orthomyxoviridae]]''.<ref name=\"Influenza D\">{{cite journal|author1=Shuo Su|author2=Xinliang Fu|author3=Gairu Li|author4=Fiona Kerlin|author5=Michael Veit|date=25 August 2017|title=Novel Influenza D virus: Epidemiology, pathology, evolution and biological characteristics|journal=Virulence|volume=8|issue=8|pages=1580\u20131591|doi=10.1080/21505594.2017.1365216|pmc=5810478|pmid=28812422}}</ref> Influenza viruses A, B, C, and D represent the four [[antigen]]ic types of influenza viruses.<ref name=ref2>\u201cSeasonal Influenza (Flu)\u201d Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

However, this is not the case.  In fact the need for, use of, and discussion of toll roads can be traced back to 1939. According to Richard Weingroff at the [[Federal Highway Administration]]:\n<blockquote>In the 1939 report to Congress, Toll Roads and Free Roads, the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) rejected the toll option for financing Interstate construction because most Interstate corridors would not generate enough toll revenue to retire the bonds that would be issued to finance them. In part, the report attributed this conclusion to \"the traffic-repelling tendency of the proposed toll-road system.\" Although some corridors had enough traffic to support bond financing, the report predicted that motorists would stay on the parallel toll-free roads to a large extent. That conclusion was called into question when the first segment of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, from Carlisle to Irwin, opened on October 1, 1940. It was an instant financial success. Following World War II, the turnpike's continued success prompted other States to use the same financing method. Each State established a toll authority to issue bonds. Revenue from the bonds provided the funds, up front, to pay for construction. Toll revenue allowed the toll authority to repay bond holders with interest and finance administration, maintenance, and operation of the highway.<ref>{{cite web |first = Richard |last = Weingroff |department = Highway History |title = Ask the Rambler: Why Does the Interstate System Include Toll Facilities? |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/INFRASTRUCTURE/tollroad.cfm |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = November 21, 2014 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe use of this toll system is related to the state of Texas as one might infer.  For the state of Texas, and more specifically Central Texas has seen a significant growth in recent years.  The United States Census Bureau reports that in 2010 Texas had a population just over 25 million citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts: Texas |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48000.html |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=October 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023121850/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48000.html |archivedate=October 23, 2013 }}</ref>  It is estimated that the population grew over five percent in just three years to nearly 26.5 million people.  This growth is great for the state of Texas, but has exposed an area of concern.  This area of concern is the infrastructure; specifically the lack of thoroughfares that can effectively move the increased vehicle traffic. An answer that that has been provided to address this concern is the implementation of toll roads.  While not a recent phenomena toll road construction is more prevalent now than in recent years.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe toll roads in Central Texas are governed through the [[Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority]] (CTRMA), which is stated to be the creating agency for transportation models to keep up with today's population growth. to promote future road construction which is to alleviate traffic issues within Travis and Williamson Counties<ref name=\"Mobility Authority\">{{cite web |title = About the Mobility Authority |url = http://www.mobilityauthority.com/about/index.php |publisher = Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority |accessdate = November 2, 2014 }}</ref>  Texas is one of few states that has allowed private toll roads.\n\nThe idea that toll roads should be privatized, is an idea that stemmed from European models that are evident in Spain, Italy, and England.

The moratorium effectively banned all new proposals for toll roads for two years, until 2009. However, this moratorium was deemed the \"Swiss cheese moratorium,\" as it had a multitude of exemptions placed in it.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/legislature/stories/061207dntextollroads.352325f.html |title = Perry Signs Legislation to Halt Private Toll Roads |work = Dallas Morning News }}{{full|date= November 2014}}</ref> Specifically, the exemptions allowed almost all the projects in the North Texas/Dallas regions to go forward. The primary concern leading to the moratorium was that the state was hurting taxpayers in the long run by deviating from its tollway authority model and contracting out roads entirely to private companies. Many legislators saw this as problematic, as the primary function of these toll roads would not be to serve the public but to serve as an instrument of profit for private corporations. These companies could raise tolls to whatever the market could bear with little or virtually no public input, and the tolls would continue long after the construction costs were paid for.\n\n==Operating agencies==\n\n===State-operated toll roads===\n[[Image:Texas45.jpg|thumb|Interchange between [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]] and [[Texas State Highway 45|State Highway 45]]]]\nThe Toll Operations Division of the [[Texas Department of Transportation]] (TxDOT) operates the [[Central Texas Turnpike System]] (CTTS) as well as other toll roads around the state.

However, this is not the case.  In fact the need for, use of, and discussion of toll roads can be traced back to 1939. According to Richard Weingroff at the [[Federal Highway Administration]]:\n<blockquote>In the 1939 report to Congress, Toll Roads and Free Roads, the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) rejected the toll option for financing Interstate construction because most Interstate corridors would not generate enough toll revenue to retire the bonds that would be issued to finance them. In part, the report attributed this conclusion to \"the traffic-repelling tendency of the proposed toll-road system.\" Although some corridors had enough traffic to support bond financing, the report predicted that motorists would stay on the parallel toll-free roads to a large extent. That conclusion was called into question when the first segment of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, from Carlisle to Irwin, opened on October 1, 1940. It was an instant financial success. Following World War II, the turnpike's continued success prompted other States to use the same financing method. Each State established a toll authority to issue bonds. Revenue from the bonds provided the funds, up front, to pay for construction. Toll revenue allowed the toll authority to repay bond holders with interest and finance administration, maintenance, and operation of the highway.<ref>{{cite web |first = Richard |last = Weingroff |department = Highway History |title = Ask the Rambler: Why Does the Interstate System Include Toll Facilities? |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/INFRASTRUCTURE/tollroad.cfm |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = November 21, 2014 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe use of this toll system is related to the state of Texas as one might infer.  For the state of Texas, and more specifically Central Texas has seen a significant growth in recent years.  The United States Census Bureau reports that in 2010 Texas had a population just over 25 million citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts: Texas |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48000.html |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=October 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023121850/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48000.html |archivedate=October 23, 2013 }}</ref>  It is estimated that the population grew over five percent in just three years to nearly 26.5 million people.  This growth is great for the state of Texas, but has exposed an area of concern.  This area of concern is the infrastructure; specifically the lack of thoroughfares that can effectively move the increased vehicle traffic. An answer that that has been provided to address this concern is the implementation of toll roads.  While not a recent phenomena toll road construction is more prevalent now than in recent years.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe toll roads in Central Texas are governed through the [[Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority]] (CTRMA), which is stated to be the creating agency for transportation models to keep up with today's population growth. to promote future road construction which is to alleviate traffic issues within Travis and Williamson Counties<ref name=\"Mobility Authority\">{{cite web |title = About the Mobility Authority |url = http://www.mobilityauthority.com/about/index.php |publisher = Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority |accessdate = November 2, 2014 }}</ref>  Texas is one of few states that has allowed private toll roads.\n\nThe idea that toll roads should be privatized, is an idea that stemmed from European models that are evident in Spain, Italy, and England. The European model is called a, BOT or build operate transfer; which is simply a public\u2013private ownership of a roadway (toll road). The idea of a BOT is that a private company will fund, design and construct the planned toll roads and will operate them at the beginning of a project until their contract is fulfilled with a government, in which at the end of the contract the toll road will go under the ownership of...[such] government.<ref name=Poole>{{cite web |last1 = Poole |first1 = Robert |title = How Private Toll Roads Work |url = http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/ |website = LexisNexis Academic |accessdate = November 2, 2014 }}</ref>   Despite the fact for which the CTRMA stands for or wishes to promote, there are many opposers to the expansion of toll roads within Central Texas.\n\n===Opinions===\n{{tone|section|date=December 2014}}\nA reason in favor of toll roads mentioned in ''[[The Texas Tribune]]'' was, \"that tolls: are \"vital\" to the state's future mobility planning as Texas tries to close the gap on road funding shortfall.<ref name=Batheja>{{cite news |last1 = Batheja |first1 = Aman |title = State Invites More Toll Roads Amid Signs of Resistance |url = http://www.texastribune.org/2014/09/19/texas-leaders-say-more-toll-roads-way/ |work = The Texas Tribune |accessdate = September 19, 2014 }}</ref>  The article explains how the gas tax (38.4 cents per gallon of gas) hasn't been increased since 1993 and costs of building roadways has increased throughout time supporting the construction of toll roads.<ref name=Batheja />\n\nA reason against one of the Central Texas toll projects is that the company that runs the SH&nbsp;130 toll road has been said by Moody's business rating to have the possibility of defaulting on its debt in 2014 therefore Moody's lowered the business rating to B1.<ref name=\"SH 130\">{{cite web |title = SH 130 Sponsors Plan Contingent Equity Draw |url = http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/ |website = LexisNexis Academic |accessdate = November 2, 2014 }}</ref> A B1 classification \"indicates that the business is pretty risky to lend money to\".<ref name=moodys>{{cite web |title = Rating Definitions |url = https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_79004 |publisher = Moody's |accessdate = November 2, 2014 }}</ref> The sponsors of the toll road are Zachary (a San Antonio, Texas based company), which sponsored 65%, and Cintra (a company based out of Spain) that sponsored 35%.

The moratorium effectively banned all new proposals for toll roads for two years, until 2009. However, this moratorium was deemed the \"Swiss cheese moratorium,\" as it had a multitude of exemptions placed in it.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/legislature/stories/061207dntextollroads.352325f.html |title = Perry Signs Legislation to Halt Private Toll Roads |work = Dallas Morning News }}{{full|date= November 2014}}</ref> Specifically, the exemptions allowed almost all the projects in the North Texas/Dallas regions to go forward. The primary concern leading to the moratorium was that the state was hurting taxpayers in the long run by deviating from its tollway authority model and contracting out roads entirely to private companies. Many legislators saw this as problematic, as the primary function of these toll roads would not be to serve the public but to serve as an instrument of profit for private corporations. These companies could raise tolls to whatever the market could bear with little or virtually no public input, and the tolls would continue long after the construction costs were paid for.\n\n==Operating agencies==\n\n===State-operated toll roads===\n[[Image:Texas45.jpg|thumb|Interchange between [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]] and [[Texas State Highway 45|State Highway 45]]]]\nThe Toll Operations Division of the [[Texas Department of Transportation]] (TxDOT) operates the [[Central Texas Turnpike System]] (CTTS) as well as other toll roads around the state. TxDOT established the Grand Parkway Transportation Corporation for the purpose of developing the Grand Parkway toll project, a portion of which is now open.\n\n===Regional tollway authorities===\nRegional tollway authorities are political subdivisions of the state established by two or more counties. The [[North Texas Tollway Authority]] (NTTA) is the only regional tollway authority.  NTTA operates all toll roads in the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Metroplex]].  NTTA provides tolling services for the managed lanes in the region, but does not own or operate any managed lanes.\n\n===County toll road authorities===\nCounty toll road authorities (TRAs) are established by single counties.

These authorities are designed as a means for individual or multiple counties to build, operate, and maintain local toll roads or other transportation projects. These authorities are authorized to issue bonds as well as designate local revenue sources to pay for the initial costs of the projects. The primary purpose for creating the RMAs was to reduce the time and bureaucratic \"red tape\" in the toll road building process.\n\n{{#section:Regional mobility authority|list}}<!-- This table is transcluded from the other article.

Not all costs are considered when the need for a road is required in a geographic area. Financing tolls collected help the ''end'' be reached.  The Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority is charged with the management and construction of toll ways in central Texas.  According to the CTRMA's ''Financial/Investor Information'' information page, \"The Mobility Authority uses innovative financial strategies to expedite the funding of needed transportation projects. Our nationally recognized, award-winning approach is using a mix of toll revenue bonds, government loans, toll equity grants, right-of-way donations and other funding sources to develop a transportation network that will help address the region's growing congestion problems.\"<ref>{{cite web |title = Financial/Investor Information |url = http://www.mobilityauthority.com/about/fin-inv-info2.php |publisher = Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority |accessdate = November 3, 2014 }}</ref>\nDetailed earnings and investment statements are available for each road under the CTRMA's authority.\nUse of funds generated by the commuters in central Texas are explained here, as well.
