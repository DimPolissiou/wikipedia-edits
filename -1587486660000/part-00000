[[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]] from 1969 to 1974.\n\nDespite doubt from critics, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, then-[[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The team received further attention when it chose [[teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Chris|title=A closer look at the uniforms and logos of the 90s|url=https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/537646|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> The team's uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014[[pin stripes]]. Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer as the team's first President and General Manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1988.html|title=1988 NBA Draft|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1988\u20131992: Early seasons====\n[[File:1988-89 Charlotte Hornets Season Ticket Book 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Season tickets for the Hornets' inaugural season.]]\nThe Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], losing 133\u201393 to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 4, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], 117\u2013105.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811080CHH.html |title=Los Angeles Clippers 105, Charlotte Hornets 117 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 8, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] 103\u2013101 in Jordan's first return to [[North Carolina]] as a professional.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Armstrong |title=1988 Charlotte Hornets started off with a bang, became wildly popular with their fans |url=http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905123227/http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20\u201362. Scheer left prior to the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following an 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record.\n\nThe team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|following season]]. They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31\u201351 record.\n\n====1992\u20131995: Johnson/Mourning era====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. Charlotte now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], the Hornets upset the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith, Jr. |first=Pat |title=ESPN \u2013 The Mourning After \u2013 Classic |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_mourning_alonzo |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the [[New York Knicks]], falling in five games in the second round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1993.html|title=1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets Roster and Stats|publisher=Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Hornets finished the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] with a 41\u201341 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game.\n\nIn the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]], the Hornets finished with a 50\u201332 record, returning to [[1995 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1995.html|title=Charlotte Hornets 1994\u20131995 Summary|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.com|access-date=December 14, 2016}}</ref> Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in four games. Following the season, the Hornets traded Mourning to the [[Miami Heat]] for forward [[Glen Rice]], center [[Matt Geiger]], and guard [[Khalid Reeves]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-11-04-9511040064-story.html|title=Mourning OFF To Miami|last=Smith|first=Sam|date=November 4, 1995|publisher=Chicago Tribune|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====1995\u20131998: Glen Rice era====\n[[Glen Rice]] would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] ran the point for the injured [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Hornets were competitive but failed to qualify for the playoffs, again finishing with a 41\u201341 record. [[Allan Bristow]] resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by [[Dave Cowens]].\n\nThe 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and the team made a trade on [[1996 NBA draft|draft day 1996]], acquiring center [[Vlade Divac]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in exchange for the rights to rookie and future Hall of Famer [[Kobe Bryant]], whom the Hornets picked 13th overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-and-the-draft-day-trade-that-changed-nba-history/|title=Kobe Bryant and the draft day trade that changed NBA history|last=Harper|first=Zach|date=April 4, 2016|publisher=CBS Sports|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing 54\u201328, and making it [[1997 NBA Playoffs|back to the playoffs]]. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]] was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331 record. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, advancing to the second round, only to be stopped by the Bulls.\n\n====1998\u20132002: Final years of original personnel====\nThe [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]] was shortened. The season did not start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the team's fifth head coach. The team finished with a 26\u201324 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe next three seasons ([[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000]], [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]] and [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302]]) saw the Hornets in the playoffs each year, reaching the conference semifinals twice. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the 2002 playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season. The move came mainly because attendance tailed off dramatically, reportedly due to Shinn's declining popularity in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Move To New Orleans Approved|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/New_Orleans_Approved.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=May 10, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020805150133/http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/New_Orleans_Approved.html|archivedate=August 5, 2002|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&dat=19900329&id=7fweAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZlIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6688,3395525}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/charhorn/charhornets.html |title=Charlotte Hornets (1988\u20132002) |publisher=SportsECyclopedia.com |date=February 28, 2015 |accessdate=February 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2004\u20132014: Charlotte Bobcats===\nShortly after the relocation of the team to New Orleans, the NBA opened itself to the possibility of adding a replacement team in Charlotte for the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]], given an arena deal could be reached.<ref>{{cite web |title=Belkin's potential ownership group includes Bird, Carr |url=http://a.espncdn.com/nba/news/2002/0619/1396833.html |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=June 19, 2002 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref> Several ownership groups, including one led by former [[Boston Celtics]] star [[Larry Bird]], made bids for the franchise.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bird, Carr thinking pro hoops in Charlotte? |agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today |date=May 23, 2002 |accessdate=June 30, 2009 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/stories/2002-05-20-bird-carr-charlotte.htm}}</ref> On December 18, 2002, a group led by [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] founder [[Robert L.

Inside the 'C' was a smaller white letter 'H' outlined in teal, with a black colored hornet holding a basketball from birds-eye view placed in the center. The 'H' portion of the logo remained on the warm-ups and waistband of the jerseys until the 1991\u201392 season.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Bobcats primary logo from 2004 to 2012 consisted of a snarling orange bobcat facing to the right with the indented name 'Bobcats' above in silver on a blue background, with 'Charlotte' (also indented) appearing above it in the same blue color. A change to a less vibrant orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007. Further color changes in 2012 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue background up to the 'Charlotte' name, which changed from blue to orange. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added. In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2012 rebranding, the colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to orange. This logo would become prominent in the team's marketing and be featured at center court from 2007\u201308 until 2013\u201314.\n\nCharlotte's second Hornets logo features a teal and purple forward-facing hornet with the words 'Charlotte Hornets' on its torso.

The team chose teal and purple as its primary colors and featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014pinstripes. While most teams feature team names on home jerseys and their home city on away jerseys, the Hornets' uniforms had \"Charlotte\" on both home and away jerseys. Home uniforms were white with pinstripes in teal, green, blue and purple, while the away jerseys were teal with pinstripes in white, green, blue and purple. The '[[Hugo (mascot)|Hugo]]' logo was prominently featured on the shorts' beltline, beginning in early 1992.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1994, the Hornets unveiled a purple alternate uniform, with pinstripes in white, green, blue and teal.

Hugo was moved from the beltline to the left leg, while side stripes with pinstripes were added, in purple (away) and teal (home) colors. A tricolor featuring teal, purple and blue was featured on the beltline and the piping.\n\n====Bobcats====\nThe Bobcats' first home [[Jersey (clothing)|jerseys]] were white, reading \"Bobcats\" in orange with blue and black trimming.

The home uniforms were white and featured an arched \"Bobcats\" in blue with orange and white trim. Road uniforms were blue and featured an arched \"Charlotte\" in white with blue and orange trim. Both designs featured silver pinstripes, similar to what the Hornets wore. The NASCAR uniform was also updated to include the pinstripes.

The navy away uniforms featured 'Charlotte' in white and Carolina blue trim, with the numbers featured the same trim as the city name, with Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were relegated to the sides. The uniforms bore a close resemblance to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] uniforms. The addition of Carolina blue was seen as way to connect owner Michael Jordan's [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|collegiate roots]], while the formal adoption of 'Cats' for marketing purposes reflected a popular nickname.\n\n====Hornets====\nThe newly renamed Hornets unveiled the team's uniforms on June 19, 2014, consisting of white home and purple road uniforms with the \"Hornets\" wordmark across the chest.

The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. When the team was known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{main|List of Charlotte Hornets broadcasters}}\nFrom 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] fronted by [[WCCB]] in Charlotte. WCCB's longtime owner, [[Cy Bahakel]], was a minority partner in the Hornets' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990\u201391 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of [[Fox Sports South]], for customers in North and South Carolina. [[WJZY]] became the Hornets' over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY's sister station, WFVT-TV (now [[WMYT-TV]]). [[WAXN-TV]] became the flagship for the 1998\u201399 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.\n\nWhen the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create [[Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television]] (C-SET), a [[regional sports network]]. It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on [[Comporium Communications|Comporium Cable]] in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its [[digital cable|digital package]] as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]] to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as [[western North Carolina]] and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.\n\nC-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to [[News 14 Carolina]], a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable's systems in Charlotte, the [[Piedmont Triad|Triad]] and the [[Research Triangle|Triangle]]. However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as [[Eastern North Carolina|eastern]] and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.\n\nAs part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007\u201308 season, about 70 games per season were shown on [[Fox Sports Carolinas]] (Fox Sports South's new regional feed) and sister network Sportsouth (renamed [[Fox Sports Southeast]] in 2015) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports.<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\" /> Since the 2008\u201309 season, all Bobcats/Hornets games that are not slated for national broadcast have aired on either Fox Sports Carolinas or Sportsouth/Fox Sports Southeast.\n\nFor the team's first four seasons after their return to the league, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.\n\nThe team's radio flagship is all-sports station [[WFNZ]]. Before 2010, games had aired on [[WOLS]]. WOLS switched its non-sports programming from [[oldies]] to Spanish language on January 1, 2009, making Bobcats and Duke basketball the station's only non-Spanish language programming. [[WBT (radio station)|WBT]] was the Hornets' radio flagship during the original franchise's entire run.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Charlotte Hornets}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Charlotte Bobcats}}\n{{Navboxes|titlestyle = {{NBA color cell|Charlotte Hornets|border=2}}|list =\n{{Charlotte Bobcats seasons}}\n{{NBA}}\n{{North Carolina Sports}}\n{{Charlotte, North Carolina}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|Sports|United States}}\n\n[[Category:Charlotte Hornets| ]]\n[[Category:Charlotte Bobcats| ]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association teams]]\n[[Category:Basketball teams established in 1988]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in North Carolina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{short description|American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Infobox basketball club\n| name = Charlotte Hornets\n| current = 2019\u201320 Charlotte Hornets season\n| logo = Charlotte Hornets (2014).svg\n| imagesize = 200px\n| conference = [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern]]\n| division = [[Southeast Division (NBA)|Southeast]]\n| founded = 1988\n| history = '''Charlotte Hornets'''<br />1988\u20132002, 2014\u2013present<br />'''Charlotte Bobcats'''<br />2004\u20132014<!-- Please DO NOT change the history in the infobox; it is official. --><ref name=hornets_name_returns>{{cite news|title=Charlotte Hornets Name Returns to Carolinas|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/charlotte-hornets-name-returns-carolinas|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=May 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522200148/http://www.nba.com/hornets/charlotte-hornets-name-returns-carolinas|archive-date=May 22, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NBA.com/Stats\u2013Charlotte Hornets seasons|url=http://stats.nba.com/team/#!/1610612766/seasons/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Stats.NBA.com|access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History: Team by Team|url=https://cdn.nba.net/assets/pdfs/2018-19-NBA-Guide-10-8.pdf#page=105|publisher=NBA Properties, Inc.|work=2018-19 Official NBA Guide|date=October 8, 2018|access-date=June 1, 2019}}</ref>\n| arena = [[Spectrum Center (arena)|Spectrum Center]]\n| location = [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]\n| colors = Teal, dark purple, gray<ref name=\"HornetsColors2014\">{{cite news|title=Purple and Teal Color Palette to Re-Join Hornets Name in Charlotte|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/purple-and-teal-color-palette-re-join-hornets-name-charlotte/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=November 24, 2013|access-date=January 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|last=Wash|first=Quinton|title=NBA Unveils Logo For 2019 All-Star Weekend In Charlotte|url=https://www.nba.com/hornets/press-releases/nba-unveils-logo-2019-all-star-weekend-charlotte|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=January 31, 2018|access-date=February 18, 2019|quote=The NBA today unveiled the logo for NBA All-Star 2019, which will take place February 15\u201317, 2019, in Charlotte.

[[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]] from 1969 to 1974.\n\nDespite doubt from critics, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, then-[[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The team received further attention when it chose [[teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Chris|title=A closer look at the uniforms and logos of the 90s|url=https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/537646|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> The team's uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014[[pin stripes]]. Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer as the team's first President and General Manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1988.html|title=1988 NBA Draft|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1988\u20131992: Early seasons====\n[[File:1988-89 Charlotte Hornets Season Ticket Book 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Season tickets for the Hornets' inaugural season.]]\nThe Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], losing 133\u201393 to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 4, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], 117\u2013105.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811080CHH.html |title=Los Angeles Clippers 105, Charlotte Hornets 117 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 8, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] 103\u2013101 in Jordan's first return to [[North Carolina]] as a professional.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Armstrong |title=1988 Charlotte Hornets started off with a bang, became wildly popular with their fans |url=http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905123227/http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20\u201362. Scheer left prior to the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following an 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record.\n\nThe team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|following season]]. They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31\u201351 record.\n\n====1992\u20131995: Johnson/Mourning era====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. Charlotte now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], the Hornets upset the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith, Jr. |first=Pat |title=ESPN \u2013 The Mourning After \u2013 Classic |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_mourning_alonzo |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the [[New York Knicks]], falling in five games in the second round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1993.html|title=1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets Roster and Stats|publisher=Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Hornets finished the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] with a 41\u201341 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game.\n\nIn the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]], the Hornets finished with a 50\u201332 record, returning to [[1995 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1995.html|title=Charlotte Hornets 1994\u20131995 Summary|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.com|access-date=December 14, 2016}}</ref> Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in four games. Following the season, the Hornets traded Mourning to the [[Miami Heat]] for forward [[Glen Rice]], center [[Matt Geiger]], and guard [[Khalid Reeves]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-11-04-9511040064-story.html|title=Mourning OFF To Miami|last=Smith|first=Sam|date=November 4, 1995|publisher=Chicago Tribune|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====1995\u20131998: Glen Rice era====\n[[Glen Rice]] would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] ran the point for the injured [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Hornets were competitive but failed to qualify for the playoffs, again finishing with a 41\u201341 record. [[Allan Bristow]] resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by [[Dave Cowens]].\n\nThe 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and the team made a trade on [[1996 NBA draft|draft day 1996]], acquiring center [[Vlade Divac]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in exchange for the rights to rookie and future Hall of Famer [[Kobe Bryant]], whom the Hornets picked 13th overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-and-the-draft-day-trade-that-changed-nba-history/|title=Kobe Bryant and the draft day trade that changed NBA history|last=Harper|first=Zach|date=April 4, 2016|publisher=CBS Sports|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing 54\u201328, and making it [[1997 NBA Playoffs|back to the playoffs]]. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]] was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331 record. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, advancing to the second round, only to be stopped by the Bulls.\n\n====1998\u20132002: Final years of original personnel====\nThe [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]] was shortened. The season did not start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the team's fifth head coach. The team finished with a 26\u201324 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe next three seasons ([[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000]], [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]] and [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302]]) saw the Hornets in the playoffs each year, reaching the conference semifinals twice. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the 2002 playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season. The move came mainly because attendance tailed off dramatically, reportedly due to Shinn's declining popularity in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Move To New Orleans Approved|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/New_Orleans_Approved.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=May 10, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020805150133/http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/New_Orleans_Approved.html|archivedate=August 5, 2002|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&dat=19900329&id=7fweAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZlIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6688,3395525}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/charhorn/charhornets.html |title=Charlotte Hornets (1988\u20132002) |publisher=SportsECyclopedia.com |date=February 28, 2015 |accessdate=February 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2004\u20132014: Charlotte Bobcats===\nShortly after the relocation of the team to New Orleans, the NBA opened itself to the possibility of adding a replacement team in Charlotte for the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]], given an arena deal could be reached.<ref>{{cite web |title=Belkin's potential ownership group includes Bird, Carr |url=http://a.espncdn.com/nba/news/2002/0619/1396833.html |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=June 19, 2002 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref> Several ownership groups, including one led by former [[Boston Celtics]] star [[Larry Bird]], made bids for the franchise.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bird, Carr thinking pro hoops in Charlotte? |agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today |date=May 23, 2002 |accessdate=June 30, 2009 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/stories/2002-05-20-bird-carr-charlotte.htm}}</ref> On December 18, 2002, a group led by [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] founder [[Robert L.

The words 'Charlotte Hornets' were in teal and curved across the top and bottom of the logo. An alternate logo, used only for the 1988\u201389 season, featured a large teal letter 'C', with 'Charlotte' in black letters curved upwards underneath. Inside the 'C' was a smaller white letter 'H' outlined in teal, with a black colored hornet holding a basketball from birds-eye view placed in the center. The 'H' portion of the logo remained on the warm-ups and waistband of the jerseys until the 1991\u201392 season.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Bobcats primary logo from 2004 to 2012 consisted of a snarling orange bobcat facing to the right with the indented name 'Bobcats' above in silver on a blue background, with 'Charlotte' (also indented) appearing above it in the same blue color. A change to a less vibrant orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007. Further color changes in 2012 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue background up to the 'Charlotte' name, which changed from blue to orange. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added. In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2012 rebranding, the colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to orange. This logo would become prominent in the team's marketing and be featured at center court from 2007\u201308 until 2013\u201314.\n\nCharlotte's second Hornets logo features a teal and purple forward-facing hornet with the words 'Charlotte Hornets' on its torso.

The team chose teal and purple as its primary colors and featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014pinstripes. While most teams feature team names on home jerseys and their home city on away jerseys, the Hornets' uniforms had \"Charlotte\" on both home and away jerseys. Home uniforms were white with pinstripes in teal, green, blue and purple, while the away jerseys were teal with pinstripes in white, green, blue and purple. The '[[Hugo (mascot)|Hugo]]' logo was prominently featured on the shorts' beltline, beginning in early 1992.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1994, the Hornets unveiled a purple alternate uniform, with pinstripes in white, green, blue and teal. Likewise Hugo was featured in the beltline.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2002, the Hornets made slight changes to their uniforms. Hugo was moved from the beltline to the left leg, while side stripes with pinstripes were added, in purple (away) and teal (home) colors. A tricolor featuring teal, purple and blue was featured on the beltline and the piping.\n\n====Bobcats====\nThe Bobcats' first home [[Jersey (clothing)|jerseys]] were white, reading \"Bobcats\" in orange with blue and black trimming.

The home uniforms were white and featured an arched \"Bobcats\" in blue with orange and white trim. Road uniforms were blue and featured an arched \"Charlotte\" in white with blue and orange trim. Both designs featured silver pinstripes, similar to what the Hornets wore. The NASCAR uniform was also updated to include the pinstripes.

Overall, they featured less emphasis on orange. The white home uniforms sported the shorter nickname 'Cats' in navy and [[Carolina blue]] trim, while the numbers were in Carolina blue and navy trim, with navy side stripes. The navy away uniforms featured 'Charlotte' in white and Carolina blue trim, with the numbers featured the same trim as the city name, with Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were relegated to the sides. The uniforms bore a close resemblance to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] uniforms. The addition of Carolina blue was seen as way to connect owner Michael Jordan's [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|collegiate roots]], while the formal adoption of 'Cats' for marketing purposes reflected a popular nickname.\n\n====Hornets====\nThe newly renamed Hornets unveiled the team's uniforms on June 19, 2014, consisting of white home and purple road uniforms with the \"Hornets\" wordmark across the chest.

The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. When the team was known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{main|List of Charlotte Hornets broadcasters}}\nFrom 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] fronted by [[WCCB]] in Charlotte. WCCB's longtime owner, [[Cy Bahakel]], was a minority partner in the Hornets' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990\u201391 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of [[Fox Sports South]], for customers in North and South Carolina. [[WJZY]] became the Hornets' over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY's sister station, WFVT-TV (now [[WMYT-TV]]). [[WAXN-TV]] became the flagship for the 1998\u201399 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.\n\nWhen the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create [[Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television]] (C-SET), a [[regional sports network]]. It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on [[Comporium Communications|Comporium Cable]] in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its [[digital cable|digital package]] as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]] to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as [[western North Carolina]] and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.\n\nC-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to [[News 14 Carolina]], a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable's systems in Charlotte, the [[Piedmont Triad|Triad]] and the [[Research Triangle|Triangle]]. However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as [[Eastern North Carolina|eastern]] and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.\n\nAs part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007\u201308 season, about 70 games per season were shown on [[Fox Sports Carolinas]] (Fox Sports South's new regional feed) and sister network Sportsouth (renamed [[Fox Sports Southeast]] in 2015) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports.<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\" /> Since the 2008\u201309 season, all Bobcats/Hornets games that are not slated for national broadcast have aired on either Fox Sports Carolinas or Sportsouth/Fox Sports Southeast.\n\nFor the team's first four seasons after their return to the league, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.\n\nThe team's radio flagship is all-sports station [[WFNZ]]. Before 2010, games had aired on [[WOLS]]. WOLS switched its non-sports programming from [[oldies]] to Spanish language on January 1, 2009, making Bobcats and Duke basketball the station's only non-Spanish language programming. [[WBT (radio station)|WBT]] was the Hornets' radio flagship during the original franchise's entire run.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Charlotte Hornets}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Charlotte Bobcats}}\n{{Navboxes|titlestyle = {{NBA color cell|Charlotte Hornets|border=2}}|list =\n{{Charlotte Bobcats seasons}}\n{{NBA}}\n{{North Carolina Sports}}\n{{Charlotte, North Carolina}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|Sports|United States}}\n\n[[Category:Charlotte Hornets| ]]\n[[Category:Charlotte Bobcats| ]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association teams]]\n[[Category:Basketball teams established in 1988]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in North Carolina]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: on May 2014 \u2192 in May 2014, twelth \u2192 twelfth", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets"}

Peralta shows \"class clown\" traits, constantly pulling pranks and making immature jokes at the expense of his colleagues, particularly his partner, Amy Santiago. He is fun-loving and sarcastic but is often motivated by his emotions more than his colleagues. Despite his goofy traits, Peralta is extremely smart, perceptive and quick thinking, and as such has the best arrest rate in the precinct. In the pilot, Terry Jeffords explains to Captain Holt that Peralta is his best detective, that he likes putting away bad guys, and that he loves puzzles, although \"the only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.\" As of season seven, he is 38 years old and has been a detective with the 9-9 since 2005.<ref name=\"Unsolvable\">{{Cite episode|title=Unsolvable|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=March 18, 2014|season=1|number=21}}</ref>\n\nHis father left his family during his childhood and, as a result, he feels a strong tie to memories involving his father, such as his favorite Brooklyn pizza joint. He also initially refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving, since he associates the holiday with his father's absenteeism. He has a strong emotional tie to his muscle car, a 1967 Ford Mustang, which he bought outright on his first day as a cop and always carries a positive association for him (until he sold it to help pay for Terry's new child). He often quotes and makes references to his favorite movie trilogy, ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]''. In \"Boyle-Linetti Wedding\" it is revealed that Jake is Jewish, having lost his childhood sweetheart Jenny Gildenhorn to Eddie Fung at his [[Bar Mitzvah]].\n\nPeralta's best friend is Charles Boyle, who works along with him at the precinct and admires Peralta and encourages his eventual romance with Santiago. Peralta and Gina Linetti are childhood friends, which resulted in him helping Gina get a job at the precinct. Diaz and Peralta were classmates at the police academy.\n\nJake began his career as a patrol officer with the 74th Precinct and was partnered with Stevie Schillens and the two nicknamed themselves the \"Beatsie Boys\"; in 2016, Jake was forced to arrest Stevie, now a detective with the neighboring 98th Precinct for planting evidence.<ref name=\"The 9-8\">{{Cite episode|title=The 9-8|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 9, 2016|season=3|number=15}}</ref> \n\nWhile Jake doesn't initially approve of Captain Holt's strict management, he eventually matures under Holt's supervision and comes to see Holt as a father-figure; even calling him \"Dad\" on many occasions. In \"The Oolong Slayer\", Jake achieves his lifelong dream to catch a serial killer, the Oolong Slayer, but gives up the credit for the arrest to the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives in exchange for effecting Holt's transfer back to the 99th Precinct.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\">{{Cite episode|title=The Oolong Slayer|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=October 18, 2015|season=3|number=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of season four, Jake and Rosa Diaz are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Although he is eager to return to work, his time in prison left him with post-traumatic stress and newfound empathy that affects his job performance.\n\nPeralta continuously pranks and teases his partner Amy Santiago, masking his secret romantic feelings for her. Peralta confesses his feelings to her in \"[[Charges and Specs]]\" before going undercover for a mafia operation. His romantic feelings for her develop further throughout season two and they share their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]].<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\">{{Cite episode|title=Johnny and Dora|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=May 17, 2015|season=2|number=23}}</ref> Jake and Amy start dating in \"[[New Captain]]\" and decide to move in together in the \"[[Greg and Larry]]\", but don't make it official until season four's \"[[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]\".

She attended [[parochial school]], later studied [[ballet]], and was a classmate of Jake's in the police academy.<ref name=\"castlist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/devwatch/brooklyn-nine-nine/|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine (FOX)|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref> When she was younger, the pressure for her to succeed at ballet school eventually led her to commit several crimes before landing in juvenile detention. Her parents provided little support, leaving Rosa to turn her life around by herself. \n\nThough Diaz is a loyal and effective member of the squad, her anger management issues and lack of empathy terrify most of her coworkers. She is highly secretive about her personal life \u2013 should anyone discover a secret of hers, she normally threatens them with death should they disclose it. It is also made clear that she does not stay in her apartments for long periods of time, and her neighbors know her by both a different name and a completely different personality. As revealed in \"Cop-Con\", she and Amy are younger than most of the other precinct members as they are hurt by a device that emits a loud noise to those under 35, whereas Jake and Boyle only pretend to be affected by it. In \"White Whale\", she reveals to Amy that she's attended medical school, business school, and has a pilot's license. Rosa also briefly mentions in \"Greg and Larry\" that her name \"Rosa Diaz\" may be an alias to cover up her real name from the rest of the 9-9.\n\nIn season two, Rosa dates Captain Holt's nephew, Marcus, but breaks up with him in season three. Later in the season, she finds love with former undercover detective Adrian Pimento; the two get engaged in \"Paranoia\" while chasing a drug dealer through an alley, but their wedding is delayed when Pimento is targeted by Figgis and forced to leave the state. Once he returns, they try to have their wedding the next day but decide to go steady after realizing they were rushing their relationship.\n\nAt the end of season four, Rosa and Jake are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Following her months of isolation, she starts spending more time with her family and ends her relationship with Pimento. Later in the season, she comes out as bisexual to the precinct and her family, and has a brief relationship with an unseen woman that the squad never meet or learn the name of, nicknamed \"Becky\". She has a brief flirtation with one of Gina's friends, but this does not lead anywhere. On the day of Jake and Amy's wedding, she and Terry meet a cab driver named Alicia that she becomes interested in. The two begin a relationship off-screen. However, it's short-lived, as Rosa mentions in \"The Tattler\" that they broke up because Alicia was moving to London. \n\nIn season six, Rosa begins dating a cosmetologist named Jocelyn and begins to patch up her relationship with her mother, who was initially disapproving of her bisexuality. In season seven, Rosa and Jocelyn broke up prior to the season's Jimmy Jab Games.\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Diaz.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", she received a commendation for her work as the leader of a drug task force.\n\nFirst three-time winner of the Halloween Heist.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Terry Jeffords ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Terry Jeffords\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Sergeant {{small|(seasons 1\u20136)}}|[[Lieutenant]] {{small|(season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Terry Crews]]|Theodore Barnes (child)}}\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Terrence Vincent Jeffords\n| family      = \n| spouse      = [[#Sharon Jeffords|Sharon Jeffords]] (wife)\n| significant_other = {{ubl|[[#Chiaki|Chiaki]] (ex-girlfriend)|[[#Veronica Hopkins|Veronica Hopkins]] (ex-girlfriend)}}\n| children    = {{ubl|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Cagney Jeffords]] (daughter)|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Lacey Jeffords]] (daughter)|Ava Jeffords (daughter)}}\n| relatives   = {{ubl|Lawrence Jeffords (brother)|[[#Zeke|Zeke]] (brother-in-law)|Unnamed father (deceased)|Unnamed grandmother (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Terry Crews by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Terry Crews]]]]\n[[Terry Crews]] portrays Lieutenant (previously Sergeant) '''Terrence \"Terry\" Vincent Jeffords''', the supervisor of the 9-9's Detective Squad. An avid [[bodybuilder]] who stands at more than six feet tall, with a [[linebacker]]'s build, Terry's intimidating size and appearance is contrasted by his caring, protective nature and paternal instincts. Jeffords is devoted to his wife and three young daughters Cagney, Lacey (named after the [[Cagney & Lacey|1980s TV series]]), and Ava. He fears the danger of police work because of the possibility that he could leave his children fatherless. Following a panic attack prior to the show's beginning, Terry was removed from field work, but he has since cautiously returned. He is high-strung, prone to nervous excitement, loves yogurt, and has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person. He is an effective and caring leader to the detective squad, often having to play the mature adult in order to keep them in line.\n\nA running gag throughout the series is for Terry to break things (examples include a Magic 8 Ball, a phone and Captain Holt's office) because of his incredible strength. He has been a detective since 1995 and used to be assigned to the 65th Precinct (as seen in \"Terry Kitties\"), where he was constantly mocked for a botched case which he and Jake later proved he was correct in. In S1.Ep.1. Holt mentions that he and Terry have worked together in the 18th Precinct years prior. In 2005, he was the senior detective at the 9-9 (the position Jake now holds since Terry's promotion). He was a linebacker at [[Syracuse University]], where he graduated ''magna cum laude'', as revealed in \"The Swedes\". He also studied abroad in Japan while in college and dated a Japanese student named Chiaki who broke his heart. He speaks Japanese infrequently throughout the show.\n\nIn season two, Terry nearly gets a [[vasectomy]] at his wife's request, but Jake convinces him not to when he finds out Terry secretly wants to have more kids. His wife becomes pregnant later in the season and gives birth to their third daughter, Ava, in season three. He entrusts Jake to be Ava's godfather.\n\nWhile Terry is satisfied with his role as Sergeant, he aimed to become a Lieutenant during the first six seasons. As revealed in \"The Honeypot\", he brought a new pair of suspenders that he planned to put on after he passed the Lieutenant's Exam but kept them in the box when he ended up failing and held onto them as a reminder of his higher goals. In \"Moo Moo\", he attempted to apply to be a city council liaison to take on more responsibilities but was rejected after reporting that another cop racially profiled him. In season six, Terry reveals to the group that he passed the Lieutenant's Exam weeks before the annual Halloween Heist (which they hosted on Cinco de Mayo).\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Lieutenant Jeffords.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd bronze.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Commendation or Commendation\u2014Integrity\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD Unit Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD Unit Citation\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Amy Santiago===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Amy Santiago\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* Detective {{small|(seasons 1\u20135)}} \n* Sergeant {{small|(season 5\u2013present)}}\n}}\n| portrayer          = [[Melissa Fumero]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| alias              = Isabel Cortez (undercover alias)\n| family             = \n| spouse             = [[#Jake Peralta|Jake Peralta]]\n| significant_other  = {{ubl|[[#Teddy Wells|Teddy Wells]] (ex-boyfriend)|[[#Constantine Kane|Constantine Kane]] (ex-boyfriend)|Luke Mueller (ex-boyfriend)}}\n| children           = \n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Victor Santiago|Victor Santiago]] (father)|[[#Camila Santiago|Camila Santiago]] (mother)|Tony Santiago (brother)|[[#David Santiago|David Santiago]] (brother)|Mason Santiago (nephew)|[[#Roger Peralta|Roger Peralta]] (father-in-law)|[[#Karen Peralta|Karen Peralta]] (mother-in-law)|[[#Kate Peralta|Kate Peralta]] (half sister-in-law)|Five unnamed brothers|Two unnamed half sisters-in-law|An unknown number of half brothers-in-law|Unnamed niece}}\n| religion           = \n| nationality        = Cuban-American\n}}\n[[File:Melissa Fumero May 2018.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Melissa Fumero]]]]\n[[Melissa Fumero]] portrays Sergeant (previously Detective) '''Amy Santiago''', Jake's uptight, by-the-book, rule-following [[Cuban-American]] partner, and later wife.<ref name=castlist/> A self-acknowledged [[Type A and Type B personality theory|type A personality]] and neurotic overachiever, she is continually trying to ingratiate herself with Captain Holt, and any authority figure in arm's reach of her. In the pilot, Terry cites Amy's competitiveness to Holt as a result of her having seven brothers. Amy is a stickler for department protocol and is frequently exasperated by Jake's childishness, as well as the ease with which he succeeds as a detective. She is initially seen as Holt's teacher's pet, but over time is shown to command respect from others. \n\nAmy was originally a patrol officer at the 64th precinct but requested a transfer to the 99th when her captain almost sexually assaulted her shortly after her promotion to detective. She didn't tell anyone for years out of fear for what it would do to her career until she revealed it to Jake when they were investigating a sexual assault case in \"He Said, She Said\". \n\nIn [[Charges and Specs]], the season one finale, Jake confesses that he wishes something romantic could happen between them. She confesses to having feelings for Jake in \"[[The Road Trip (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Road Trip]]\", which instigated issues in Amy and Teddy Wells' relationship and is shown to still have feelings for Jake in \"[[Det. Dave Majors]]\". The two share their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]]<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> and begin dating in [[New Captain]], although their working relationship does not change at all. They decide to move in together in the season three finale [[Greg and Larry]], but don't make it official until season four's [[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]. Jake proposes to Amy at the end of their annual Halloween heist in [[HalloVeen]] and the two eventually marry in [[Jake & Amy]]. In \"Ding Dong\", Amy reveals she is pregnant with Jake's child. In \"Admiral Peralta\", it is revealed that Jake and Amy's child is a boy. \n\nNear the end of season three, Amy goes undercover as a pregnant inmate in a women's prison in Texas to obtain information from Maura Figgis. This was done to cover Melissa Fumero's actual pregnancy at the time without making her character pregnant.\n\nAfter some uncertainty in taking the Sergeant's Exam as depicted in \"[[Chasing Amy (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Chasing Amy]]\", she passes the exam and begins wearing her Sergeant's uniform as well as commanding her own uniformed officers in \"[[NutriBoom]]\".\n\nIn season five's \"Casecation\", she is revealed to be 36 years old. In season six's \"The Golden Child\", it is revealed that Amy had a relatively strained relationship with her brother and fellow NYPD Lieutenant David Santiago, chiding her mother for glorifying David's accomplishments over Amy's. Amy enjoys solving crosswords and attending trivia sessions, to the expense of Jake, who often embarrasses himself when attempting to participate or becomes awkwardly excluded in conversation. \n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Sergeant Santiago.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD Baby Delivery Citation.jpg|100px]]\n|Citation bar for delivering a baby\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Charles Boyle ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Charles Boyle\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Male\n| occupation         = Detective\n| portrayer          = [[Joe Lo Truglio]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| spouse             = [[#Eleanor Horstweil|Eleanor Hortsweil]] (ex-wife)\n| significant_other   = {{ubl||[[#Genevieve Mirren-Carter|Genevieve Mirren-Carter]] (girlfriend)|[[#Vivian Ludley|Vivian Ludley]] (ex-fianc\u00e9e)|[[#Gina Linetti|Gina Linetti]] (ex-lover)|[[#Lt.

He is divorced from his wife Eleanor, who had numerous affairs during their marriage, to the point where she has to pay alimony to him. He is also a huge, unapologetic [[foodie]], maintaining a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email and often relishing bizarre foreign cuisine that disgusts his coworkers. \n\nFor saving Detective Diaz's life during \"Christmas\" (during which he was shot in the buttocks), he was awarded the [[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]] in \"The Bet\", though he was overshadowed by a revered and heroic NYPD horse named Sgt Peanut Butter.  In \"The Swedes\", it is revealed that Boyle is a graduate of [[Sarah Lawrence College]].\n\nIn the show's first season, Charles has a crush on Rosa, but he eventually gets over her when he starts dating Vivian Ludley, whom he met at Captain Holt's birthday party. They get engaged but break up after Charles refuses to move to Canada with her. He and Gina start to see each other in season two, and their brief relationship results in his father and Gina's mother's marriage. In season three, he starts dating Genevieve Mirren-Carter after he and Jake clear her name from an art thief. They eventually move in together and adopt a son from Latvia named Nikolaj. \n\nIn season five, Charles starts his own food truck business called \"The One Thing\", which specializes in meatball subs. The truck is burned down by one of Charles' ex-employees, but he's thankful it happened as running the food truck made him spend less time with his family and built up a large debt.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Boyle.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation 1.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:Fictional Police Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar\n|}\n \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Gina Linetti ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Gina Linetti\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| last               = \"Return of the King\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{ubl|[[Administrator (business)|Administrator]] {{small|(Seasons 1\u20136)}}|Internet personality {{small|(Season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer          = [[Chelsea Peretti]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name          = Regina Linetti\n| significant_other   = {{ubl|[[#Charles Boyle|Charles Boyle]] (ex-lover)|[[#Milton Boyle|Milton Boyle]] (lover, father of her child)|Eight unnamed ex-fianc\u00e9s}}\n| children           = The Enigma \"Iggy\" Boyle (daughter)\n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Darlene Linetti|Darlene Linetti]] (mother)|[[#Lynn Boyle|Lynn Boyle]] (stepfather)|Charles Boyle (stepbrother)|Susan Grapecoat (great-aunt)|Anthony (nephew)|Unnamed sibling|Unnamed father}}\n| nationality        = American\n}}\n[[File:Chelsea Peretti at Meltdown (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Chelsea Peretti]]]]\n[[Chelsea Peretti]] portrays '''Regina \"Gina\" Linetti''', the 99th Precinct's sardonic and egomaniacal civilian administrator and Captain Holt's assistant.<ref name=castlist/> Despite maintaining a clueless and dimwitted disposition most of the time, she can be surprisingly observant and has demonstrated traits of being more intelligent than she likes to show. Gina is obsessed with social media and is constantly on her phone. It is a running gag to try to pry her from her phone, to the point where Captain Holt becomes involved. She is extremely narcissistic and constantly praises and exalts herself, such as claiming to be a better dancer than [[Britney Spears]] in the episode \"Karen Peralta\". As the only civilian in the precinct, Gina often uses her outsider's perspective to assist the other detectives. In the episode \"The Party\", to prevent the mostly [[working class]] detectives from embarrassing themselves in front of a crowd of [[academia|academics]], Rosa tricks Gina into talking to a group of psychology professors at Holt's birthday party, who then take copious notes about her narcissistic personality. They conclude that she has a complete overlap of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], a condition previously thought to be purely theoretical.\n\nShe casually admits on myriad occasions that she doesn't value her colleagues \u2013 except for Jake \u2013 as people. She was also childhood friends with Jake, who got her the job at the precinct. Gina also ruined Jake's senior year of high school by framing him as \"The Tattler\", though she did it to avoid Jake getting involved with the wrong crowd. She transferred to the Public relations Division with Captain Holt in \"Johnny and Dora\", and returns to the 9-9 with him in \"The Oolong Slayer\".<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/><ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> In the episode \"The Apartment\", it is revealed that she has been engaged eight times, but never married. At the end of \"The Fugitive Pt. 2\", she gets hit by a bus after receiving a text from Charles. The penultimate episode of season four reveals she has become pregnant following a relationship with Charles' cousin, Milton (which coincided with Chelsea Peretti's actual pregnancy). She is absent for the first half of season five on maternity leave after giving birth to a girl she nicknames \"Iggy\" (short for Enigma). \n\nIn the episode \"Halloween IV\", Gina reveals that in the fourth grade at a classmate's birthday party, a bowling ball fell onto her face. This incident knocked out her two front teeth; she's been wearing false teeth since.\n\nIn season six, Jake helps Gina realize that her talents would be better spent elsewhere and she quits her job. She becomes an internet celebrity and hosts a web show called \"The G-Hive,\" in which she gives her viewers life advice. Her work has made it too busy to spend time with her former coworkers, but she is aiming to improve after Jake confronts her for not talking to them for months. \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Raymond Holt ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Raymond Holt\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Commanding Officer, NYPD 99th Precinct {{small|(seasons 1\u20136; season 7-present)}} \n<br>Head of NYPD public relations {{small| (season 3)}}|Patrol officer {{small|(season 6\u20137)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Andre Braugher]]|Seth Carr (child)}}\n| alias       = Greg Stickney ([[WITSEC]] alias)\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Raymond Jacob Holt\n| spouse      = [[#Kevin Cozner|Kevin Cozner]]\n| significant_other = [[#Frederick|Frederick]] (ex-boyfriend)\n| relatives   = {{ubl|[[#Laverne Holt|Laverne Holt]] (mother)|Unnamed father (deceased)|[[#Debbie|Debbie]] (sister)| [[#Marcus|Marcus]] (nephew)<br>Geoffrey Holt (uncle)<br>Martin Cozner (brother-in-law)<br>Carol Wilg (goddaughter)<br>Gary (ex-brother-in-law)<br>Unnamed uncle (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Andre Braugher 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andre Braugher]]]]\n[[Andre Braugher]] portrays Captain '''Raymond Jacob Holt''', the 99th Precinct's strict Commanding Officer. Holt is known for his cold, calm and robotic manner of speaking, overly formal demeanor and lack of outwardly visible emotion, although his non-work friends frequently refer to him having a much more fun persona that is very rarely seen by either the Nine-Nine members or the viewer. He has sophisticated and cultured interests, enjoying classical music, opera and attending dinner parties with his husband's academic friends, amongst other things. The Nine-Nine is Holt's first command despite many years of outstanding service, and he attributes the delay to prejudice against both his [[race (human classification)|race]] and [[homosexuality]]. He came out in 1987 and until recently led a group that supported LGBT African-American NYPD members, which he himself created.<ref name=castlist/> He was a homicide detective in the 1980s, and spent twelve years in the Community Affairs Bureau immediately prior to commanding the Nine-Nine. \n\nHolt is married to Kevin Cozner, the Chair of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Classics]] Department,<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Party|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 4, 2014|season=1|number=16}}</ref> and has a longstanding professional rivalry with Madeline Wuntch, with whom he came up through the ranks; while his career stalled, she kept advancing and is now his immediate superior. After he and Peralta successfully solved a major case in \"The Chopper\", Bureau Chief Wuntch nominated him for a promotion to head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, a promotion he accepted lest Wuntch transfer his staff to horrible posts around New York City.<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> During the number of weeks he was in charge of Public Affairs, Holt was unable to accomplish anything significant thanks to Chief Wuntch's constant micromanaging. After helping Peralta solve a serial killer case, Holt found himself transferred back to command of the 9-9 by the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> He owned a burgundy [[Chevrolet Corvair]] named Gertie which was his prized possession until it was stolen in \"The Fugitive\". Doug Judy purchased him a new identical one and named it Sexarella.\n\nAt the end of season three, Holt is forced to go into witness protection in Florida with Jake when they are threatened by crime boss Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis. He worked at a family entertainment center called the Fun Zone under the alias of Greg until he and Jake baited Figgis into coming to Florida and took the criminal down with the Nine-Nine. In season five, his life and career are put at risk when he makes a deal with mobster Seamus Murphy in exchange for information to clear Jake and Rosa's names from Lt. Hawkins.\n\nDuring season five, Holt learns that the [[New York City Police Commissioner]] is retiring at the end of the year and that he is on the shortlist of candidates to replace him. He spends the rest of the season campaigning to win the Commissioner title but ends up losing to John Kelly.\n\nIn season six, Holt is encouraged by Jake and Amy to stand up to Kelly's regressive policies, leading the Commissioner to retaliate against the Nine-Nine. However, Peralta and Wuntch team up, without Holt's knowledge, to take Kelly down, resulting in Wuntch being named interim Commissioner. This detente becomes short-lived as Holt is demoted to a uniformed officer by Commissioner Wuntch after she realized he was promoted to detective too soon earlier in his career. Shortly after Wuntch's death, however, he is quickly promoted back to captain in the middle of the seventh season.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Captain Holt.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Meritorious Police Duty (with numeral \"10\")\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", he received a commendation for his supervision of Det.

Despite their inept nature, Hitchcock and Scully have both shown on occasion to be competent and even good detectives, though their laziness tends to keep them from demonstrating this most of the time. As revealed in \"Hitchcock and Scully\", the two were excellent detectives in their youths and had well-built bodies, but their careers and their physiques went downhill after they tried the wings at their eventual favorite restaurant, Wing Slutz.\n\nThe majority of the precinct tends to be disgusted by Hitchcock's more perverted nature and attitude towards women. It's revealed in \"The Last Ride\" (Season 4) that Hitchcock held the all-time record for closed cases at the 99th Precinct, one more than Sgt. Jeffords as of that episode. This is mainly due to Hitchcock being at the 99th twenty years longer than Terry.

He also displayed an uncanny ability to reassemble shredded documents in one episode. Scully routinely discloses disgusting medical issues like the entire bottom of his foot being a wart or having various strains of [[fungi]]. He claims to constantly have medical emergencies, and despite having a [[pacemaker]] fitted, he frequently suffers from [[heart attack]]s. He often embarrasses himself either unintentionally or willingly and admits to being indifferent to the judgment of others (most frequently, the fellow members of his squad.) In the early seasons, Scully is married and has a dog. The team are unsure which one of them is called Kelly, though it is later revealed in season 7 that both of them were named Kelly.

He claims to have changed but Jake and Amy agree that he is still \"The most boring man in America\". He also admits to Amy that he still loves her and proposes to her twice; once in front of his new girlfriend and Jake, and the second time in front of the entire squad.

Wuntch constantly went out of her way to undermine the 99th Precinct, and appeared to take great pleasure in its and Holt's failures; Holt, in turn, gleefully insulted and belittled Wuntch every time their paths cross.  In \"The Chopper\" and \"Johnny and Dora\", she culminated her victory over Holt when she makes him head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, where she humiliated him by making him do menial jobs, although he is eventually transferred back to the 99 thanks to Jake. In \"Suicide Squad\", she helped Jake and the Nine-Nine expose Commissioner Kelly's illegal wiretapping activity and became the acting commissioner until a new one was decided on.

Peralta shows \"class clown\" traits, constantly pulling pranks and making immature jokes at the expense of his colleagues, particularly his partner, Amy Santiago. He is fun-loving and sarcastic but is often motivated by his emotions more than his colleagues. Despite his goofy traits, Peralta is extremely smart, perceptive and quick thinking, and as such has the best arrest rate in the precinct. In the pilot, Terry Jeffords explains to Captain Holt that Peralta is his best detective, that he likes putting away bad guys, and that he loves puzzles, although \"the only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.\" As of season seven, he is 38 years old and has been a detective with the 9-9 since 2005.<ref name=\"Unsolvable\">{{Cite episode|title=Unsolvable|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=March 18, 2014|season=1|number=21}}</ref>\n\nHis father left his family during his childhood and, as a result, he feels a strong tie to memories involving his father, such as his favorite Brooklyn pizza joint. He also initially refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving, since he associates the holiday with his father's absenteeism. He has a strong emotional tie to his muscle car, a 1967 Ford Mustang, which he bought outright on his first day as a cop and always carries a positive association for him (until he sold it to help pay for Terry's new child). He often quotes and makes references to his favorite movie trilogy, ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]''. In \"Boyle-Linetti Wedding\" it is revealed that Jake is Jewish, having lost his childhood sweetheart Jenny Gildenhorn to Eddie Fung at his [[Bar Mitzvah]].\n\nPeralta's best friend is Charles Boyle, who works along with him at the precinct and admires Peralta and encourages his eventual romance with Santiago. Peralta and Gina Linetti are childhood friends, which resulted in him helping Gina get a job at the precinct. Diaz and Peralta were classmates at the police academy.\n\nJake began his career as a patrol officer with the 74th Precinct and was partnered with Stevie Schillens and the two nicknamed themselves the \"Beatsie Boys\"; in 2016, Jake was forced to arrest Stevie, now a detective with the neighboring 98th Precinct for planting evidence.<ref name=\"The 9-8\">{{Cite episode|title=The 9-8|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 9, 2016|season=3|number=15}}</ref> \n\nWhile Jake doesn't initially approve of Captain Holt's strict management, he eventually matures under Holt's supervision and comes to see Holt as a father-figure; even calling him \"Dad\" on many occasions. In \"The Oolong Slayer\", Jake achieves his lifelong dream to catch a serial killer, the Oolong Slayer, but gives up the credit for the arrest to the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives in exchange for effecting Holt's transfer back to the 99th Precinct.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\">{{Cite episode|title=The Oolong Slayer|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=October 18, 2015|season=3|number=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of season four, Jake and Rosa Diaz are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Although he is eager to return to work, his time in prison left him with post-traumatic stress and newfound empathy that affects his job performance.\n\nPeralta continuously pranks and teases his partner Amy Santiago, masking his secret romantic feelings for her. Peralta confesses his feelings to her in \"[[Charges and Specs]]\" before going undercover for a mafia operation. His romantic feelings for her develop further throughout season two and they share their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]].<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\">{{Cite episode|title=Johnny and Dora|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=May 17, 2015|season=2|number=23}}</ref> Jake and Amy start dating in \"[[New Captain]]\" and decide to move in together in the \"[[Greg and Larry]]\", but don't make it official until season four's \"[[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]\".

She attended [[parochial school]], later studied [[ballet]], and was a classmate of Jake's in the police academy.<ref name=\"castlist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/devwatch/brooklyn-nine-nine/|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine (FOX)|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref> When she was younger, the pressure for her to succeed at ballet school eventually led her to commit several crimes before landing in juvenile detention. Her parents provided little support, leaving Rosa to turn her life around by herself. \n\nThough Diaz is a loyal and effective member of the squad, her anger management issues and lack of empathy terrify most of her coworkers. She is highly secretive about her personal life \u2013 should anyone discover a secret of hers, she normally threatens them with death should they disclose it. It is also made clear that she does not stay in her apartments for long periods of time, and her neighbors know her by both a different name and a completely different personality. As revealed in \"Cop-Con\", she and Amy are younger than most of the other precinct members as they are hurt by a device that emits a loud noise to those under 35, whereas Jake and Boyle only pretend to be affected by it. In \"White Whale\", she reveals to Amy that she's attended medical school, business school, and has a pilot's license. Rosa also briefly mentions in \"Greg and Larry\" that her name \"Rosa Diaz\" may be an alias to cover up her real name from the rest of the 9-9.\n\nIn season two, Rosa dates Captain Holt's nephew, Marcus, but breaks up with him in season three. Later in the season, she finds love with former undercover detective Adrian Pimento; the two get engaged in \"Paranoia\" while chasing a drug dealer through an alley, but their wedding is delayed when Pimento is targeted by Figgis and forced to leave the state. Once he returns, they try to have their wedding the next day but decide to go steady after realizing they were rushing their relationship.\n\nAt the end of season four, Rosa and Jake are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Following her months of isolation, she starts spending more time with her family and ends her relationship with Pimento. Later in the season, she comes out as bisexual to the precinct and her family, and has a brief relationship with an unseen woman that the squad never meet or learn the name of, nicknamed \"Becky\". She has a brief flirtation with one of Gina's friends, but this does not lead anywhere. On the day of Jake and Amy's wedding, she and Terry meet a cab driver named Alicia that she becomes interested in. The two begin a relationship off-screen. However, it's short-lived, as Rosa mentions in \"The Tattler\" that they broke up because Alicia was moving to London. \n\nIn season six, Rosa begins dating a cosmetologist named Jocelyn and begins to patch up her relationship with her mother, who was initially disapproving of her bisexuality. In season seven, Rosa and Jocelyn broke up prior to the season's Jimmy Jab Games.\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Diaz.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", she received a commendation for her work as the leader of a drug task force.\n\nFirst three-time winner of the Halloween Heist.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Terry Jeffords ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Terry Jeffords\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Sergeant {{small|(seasons 1\u20136)}}|[[Lieutenant]] {{small|(season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Terry Crews]]|Theodore Barnes (child)}}\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Terrence Vincent Jeffords\n| family      = \n| spouse      = [[#Sharon Jeffords|Sharon Jeffords]] (wife)\n| significant_other = {{ubl|[[#Chiaki|Chiaki]] (ex-girlfriend)|[[#Veronica Hopkins|Veronica Hopkins]] (ex-girlfriend)}}\n| children    = {{ubl|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Cagney Jeffords]] (daughter)|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Lacey Jeffords]] (daughter)|Ava Jeffords (daughter)}}\n| relatives   = {{ubl|Lawrence Jeffords (brother)|[[#Zeke|Zeke]] (brother-in-law)|Unnamed father (deceased)|Unnamed grandmother (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Terry Crews by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Terry Crews]]]]\n[[Terry Crews]] portrays Lieutenant (previously Sergeant) '''Terrence \"Terry\" Vincent Jeffords''', the supervisor of the 9-9's Detective Squad. An avid [[bodybuilder]] who stands at more than six feet tall, with a [[linebacker]]'s build, Terry's intimidating size and appearance is contrasted by his caring, protective nature and paternal instincts. Jeffords is devoted to his wife and three young daughters Cagney, Lacey (named after the [[Cagney & Lacey|1980s TV series]]), and Ava. He fears the danger of police work because of the possibility that he could leave his children fatherless. Following a panic attack prior to the show's beginning, Terry was removed from field work, but he has since cautiously returned. He is high-strung, prone to nervous excitement, loves yogurt, and has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person. He is an effective and caring leader to the detective squad, often having to play the mature adult in order to keep them in line.\n\nA running gag throughout the series is for Terry to break things (examples include a Magic 8 Ball, a phone and Captain Holt's office) because of his incredible strength. He has been a detective since 1995 and used to be assigned to the 65th Precinct (as seen in \"Terry Kitties\"), where he was constantly mocked for a botched case which he and Jake later proved he was correct in. In S1.Ep.1. Holt mentions that he and Terry have worked together in the 18th Precinct years prior. In 2005, he was the senior detective at the 9-9 (the position Jake now holds since Terry's promotion). He was a linebacker at [[Syracuse University]], where he graduated ''magna cum laude'', as revealed in \"The Swedes\". He also studied abroad in Japan while in college and dated a Japanese student named Chiaki who broke his heart. He speaks Japanese infrequently throughout the show.\n\nIn season two, Terry nearly gets a [[vasectomy]] at his wife's request, but Jake convinces him not to when he finds out Terry secretly wants to have more kids. His wife becomes pregnant later in the season and gives birth to their third daughter, Ava, in season three. He entrusts Jake to be Ava's godfather.\n\nWhile Terry is satisfied with his role as Sergeant, he aimed to become a Lieutenant during the first six seasons. As revealed in \"The Honeypot\", he brought a new pair of suspenders that he planned to put on after he passed the Lieutenant's Exam but kept them in the box when he ended up failing and held onto them as a reminder of his higher goals. In \"Moo Moo\", he attempted to apply to be a city council liaison to take on more responsibilities but was rejected after reporting that another cop racially profiled him. In season six, Terry reveals to the group that he passed the Lieutenant's Exam weeks before the annual Halloween Heist (which they hosted on Cinco de Mayo).\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Lieutenant Jeffords.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd bronze.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Commendation or Commendation\u2014Integrity\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD Unit Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD Unit Citation\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Amy Santiago===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Amy Santiago\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* Detective {{small|(seasons 1\u20135)}} \n* Sergeant {{small|(season 5\u2013present)}}\n}}\n| portrayer          = [[Melissa Fumero]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| alias              = Isabel Cortez (undercover alias)\n| family             = \n| spouse             = [[#Jake Peralta|Jake Peralta]]\n| significant_other  = {{ubl|[[#Teddy Wells|Teddy Wells]] (ex-boyfriend)|[[#Constantine Kane|Constantine Kane]] (ex-boyfriend)|Luke Mueller (ex-boyfriend)}}\n| children           = \n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Victor Santiago|Victor Santiago]] (father)|[[#Camila Santiago|Camila Santiago]] (mother)|Tony Santiago (brother)|[[#David Santiago|David Santiago]] (brother)|Mason Santiago (nephew)|[[#Roger Peralta|Roger Peralta]] (father-in-law)|[[#Karen Peralta|Karen Peralta]] (mother-in-law)|[[#Kate Peralta|Kate Peralta]] (half sister-in-law)|Five unnamed brothers|Two unnamed half sisters-in-law|An unknown number of half brothers-in-law|Unnamed niece}}\n| religion           = \n| nationality        = Cuban-American\n}}\n[[File:Melissa Fumero May 2018.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Melissa Fumero]]]]\n[[Melissa Fumero]] portrays Sergeant (previously Detective) '''Amy Santiago''', Jake's uptight, by-the-book, rule-following [[Cuban-American]] partner, and later wife.<ref name=castlist/> A self-acknowledged [[Type A and Type B personality theory|type A personality]] and neurotic overachiever, she is continually trying to ingratiate herself with Captain Holt, and any authority figure in arm's reach of her. In the pilot, Terry cites Amy's competitiveness to Holt as a result of her having seven brothers. Amy is a stickler for department protocol and is frequently exasperated by Jake's childishness, as well as the ease with which he succeeds as a detective. She is initially seen as Holt's teacher's pet, but over time is shown to command respect from others. \n\nAmy was originally a patrol officer at the 64th precinct but requested a transfer to the 99th when her captain almost sexually assaulted her shortly after her promotion to detective. She didn't tell anyone for years out of fear for what it would do to her career until she revealed it to Jake when they were investigating a sexual assault case in \"He Said, She Said\". \n\nIn [[Charges and Specs]], the season one finale, Jake confesses that he wishes something romantic could happen between them. She confesses to having feelings for Jake in \"[[The Road Trip (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Road Trip]]\", which instigated issues in Amy and Teddy Wells' relationship and is shown to still have feelings for Jake in \"[[Det. Dave Majors]]\". The two share their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]]<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> and begin dating in [[New Captain]], although their working relationship does not change at all. They decide to move in together in the season three finale [[Greg and Larry]], but don't make it official until season four's [[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]. Jake proposes to Amy at the end of their annual Halloween heist in [[HalloVeen]] and the two eventually marry in [[Jake & Amy]]. In \"Ding Dong\", Amy reveals she is pregnant with Jake's child. In \"Admiral Peralta\", it is revealed that Jake and Amy's child is a boy. \n\nNear the end of season three, Amy goes undercover as a pregnant inmate in a women's prison in Texas to obtain information from Maura Figgis. This was done to cover Melissa Fumero's actual pregnancy at the time without making her character pregnant.\n\nAfter some uncertainty in taking the Sergeant's Exam as depicted in \"[[Chasing Amy (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Chasing Amy]]\", she passes the exam and begins wearing her Sergeant's uniform as well as commanding her own uniformed officers in \"[[NutriBoom]]\".\n\nIn season five's \"Casecation\", she is revealed to be 36 years old. In season six's \"The Golden Child\", it is revealed that Amy had a relatively strained relationship with her brother and fellow NYPD Lieutenant David Santiago, chiding her mother for glorifying David's accomplishments over Amy's. Amy enjoys solving crosswords and attending trivia sessions, to the expense of Jake, who often embarrasses himself when attempting to participate or becomes awkwardly excluded in conversation. \n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Sergeant Santiago.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD Baby Delivery Citation.jpg|100px]]\n|Citation bar for delivering a baby\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Charles Boyle ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Charles Boyle\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Male\n| occupation         = Detective\n| portrayer          = [[Joe Lo Truglio]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| spouse             = [[#Eleanor Horstweil|Eleanor Hortsweil]] (ex-wife)\n| significant_other   = {{ubl||[[#Genevieve Mirren-Carter|Genevieve Mirren-Carter]] (girlfriend)|[[#Vivian Ludley|Vivian Ludley]] (ex-fianc\u00e9e)|[[#Gina Linetti|Gina Linetti]] (ex-lover)|[[#Lt.

He is divorced from his wife Eleanor, who had numerous affairs during their marriage, to the point where she has to pay alimony to him. He is also a huge, unapologetic [[foodie]], maintaining a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email and often relishing bizarre foreign cuisine that disgusts his coworkers. \n\nFor saving Detective Diaz's life during \"Christmas\" (during which he was shot in the buttocks), he was awarded the [[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]] in \"The Bet\", though he was overshadowed by a revered and heroic NYPD horse named Sgt Peanut Butter.  In \"The Swedes\", it is revealed that Boyle is a graduate of [[Sarah Lawrence College]].\n\nIn the show's first season, Charles has a crush on Rosa, but he eventually gets over her when he starts dating Vivian Ludley, whom he met at Captain Holt's birthday party. They get engaged but break up after Charles refuses to move to Canada with her. He and Gina start to see each other in season two, and their brief relationship results in his father and Gina's mother's marriage. In season three, he starts dating Genevieve Mirren-Carter after he and Jake clear her name from an art thief. They eventually move in together and adopt a son from Latvia named Nikolaj. \n\nIn season five, Charles starts his own food truck business called \"The One Thing\", which specializes in meatball subs. The truck is burned down by one of Charles' ex-employees, but he's thankful it happened as running the food truck made him spend less time with his family and built up a large debt.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Boyle.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation 1.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:Fictional Police Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar\n|}\n \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Gina Linetti ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Gina Linetti\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| last               = \"Return of the King\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{ubl|[[Administrator (business)|Administrator]] {{small|(Seasons 1\u20136)}}|Internet personality {{small|(Season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer          = [[Chelsea Peretti]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name          = Regina Linetti\n| significant_other   = {{ubl|[[#Charles Boyle|Charles Boyle]] (ex-lover)|[[#Milton Boyle|Milton Boyle]] (lover, father of her child)|Eight unnamed ex-fianc\u00e9s}}\n| children           = The Enigma \"Iggy\" Boyle (daughter)\n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Darlene Linetti|Darlene Linetti]] (mother)|[[#Lynn Boyle|Lynn Boyle]] (stepfather)|Charles Boyle (stepbrother)|Susan Grapecoat (great-aunt)|Anthony (nephew)|Unnamed sibling|Unnamed father}}\n| nationality        = American\n}}\n[[File:Chelsea Peretti at Meltdown (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Chelsea Peretti]]]]\n[[Chelsea Peretti]] portrays '''Regina \"Gina\" Linetti''', the 99th Precinct's sardonic and egomaniacal civilian administrator and Captain Holt's assistant.<ref name=castlist/> Despite maintaining a clueless and dimwitted disposition most of the time, she can be surprisingly observant and has demonstrated traits of being more intelligent than she likes to show. Gina is obsessed with social media and is constantly on her phone. It is a running gag to try to pry her from her phone, to the point where Captain Holt becomes involved. She is extremely narcissistic and constantly praises and exalts herself, such as claiming to be a better dancer than [[Britney Spears]] in the episode \"Karen Peralta\". As the only civilian in the precinct, Gina often uses her outsider's perspective to assist the other detectives. In the episode \"The Party\", to prevent the mostly [[working class]] detectives from embarrassing themselves in front of a crowd of [[academia|academics]], Rosa tricks Gina into talking to a group of psychology professors at Holt's birthday party, who then take copious notes about her narcissistic personality. They conclude that she has a complete overlap of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], a condition previously thought to be purely theoretical.\n\nShe casually admits on myriad occasions that she doesn't value her colleagues \u2013 except for Jake \u2013 as people. She was also childhood friends with Jake, who got her the job at the precinct. Gina also ruined Jake's senior year of high school by framing him as \"The Tattler\", though she did it to avoid Jake getting involved with the wrong crowd. She transferred to the Public relations Division with Captain Holt in \"Johnny and Dora\", and returns to the 9-9 with him in \"The Oolong Slayer\".<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/><ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> In the episode \"The Apartment\", it is revealed that she has been engaged eight times, but never married. At the end of \"The Fugitive Pt. 2\", she gets hit by a bus after receiving a text from Charles. The penultimate episode of season four reveals she has become pregnant following a relationship with Charles' cousin, Milton (which coincided with Chelsea Peretti's actual pregnancy). She is absent for the first half of season five on maternity leave after giving birth to a girl she nicknames \"Iggy\" (short for Enigma). \n\nIn the episode \"Halloween IV\", Gina reveals that in the fourth grade at a classmate's birthday party, a bowling ball fell onto her face. This incident knocked out her two front teeth; she's been wearing false teeth since.\n\nIn season six, Jake helps Gina realize that her talents would be better spent elsewhere and she quits her job. She becomes an internet celebrity and hosts a web show called \"The G-Hive,\" in which she gives her viewers life advice. Her work has made it too busy to spend time with her former coworkers, but she is aiming to improve after Jake confronts her for not talking to them for months. \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Raymond Holt ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Raymond Holt\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Commanding Officer, NYPD 99th Precinct {{small|(seasons 1\u20136; season 7-present)}} \n<br>Head of NYPD public relations {{small| (season 3)}}|Patrol officer {{small|(season 6\u20137)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Andre Braugher]]|Seth Carr (child)}}\n| alias       = Greg Stickney ([[WITSEC]] alias)\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Raymond Jacob Holt\n| spouse      = [[#Kevin Cozner|Kevin Cozner]]\n| significant_other = [[#Frederick|Frederick]] (ex-boyfriend)\n| relatives   = {{ubl|[[#Laverne Holt|Laverne Holt]] (mother)|Unnamed father (deceased)|[[#Debbie|Debbie]] (sister)| [[#Marcus|Marcus]] (nephew)<br>Geoffrey Holt (uncle)<br>Martin Cozner (brother-in-law)<br>Carol Wilg (goddaughter)<br>Gary (ex-brother-in-law)<br>Unnamed uncle (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Andre Braugher 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andre Braugher]]]]\n[[Andre Braugher]] portrays Captain '''Raymond Jacob Holt''', the 99th Precinct's strict Commanding Officer. Holt is known for his cold, calm and robotic manner of speaking, overly formal demeanor and lack of outwardly visible emotion, although his non-work friends frequently refer to him having a much more fun persona that is very rarely seen by either the Nine-Nine members or the viewer. He has sophisticated and cultured interests, enjoying classical music, opera and attending dinner parties with his husband's academic friends, amongst other things. The Nine-Nine is Holt's first command despite many years of outstanding service, and he attributes the delay to prejudice against both his [[race (human classification)|race]] and [[homosexuality]]. He came out in 1987 and until recently led a group that supported LGBT African-American NYPD members, which he himself created.<ref name=castlist/> He was a homicide detective in the 1980s, and spent twelve years in the Community Affairs Bureau immediately prior to commanding the Nine-Nine. \n\nHolt is married to Kevin Cozner, the Chair of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Classics]] Department,<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Party|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 4, 2014|season=1|number=16}}</ref> and has a longstanding professional rivalry with Madeline Wuntch, with whom he came up through the ranks; while his career stalled, she kept advancing and is now his immediate superior. After he and Peralta successfully solved a major case in \"The Chopper\", Bureau Chief Wuntch nominated him for a promotion to head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, a promotion he accepted lest Wuntch transfer his staff to horrible posts around New York City.<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> During the number of weeks he was in charge of Public Affairs, Holt was unable to accomplish anything significant thanks to Chief Wuntch's constant micromanaging. After helping Peralta solve a serial killer case, Holt found himself transferred back to command of the 9-9 by the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> He owned a burgundy [[Chevrolet Corvair]] named Gertie which was his prized possession until it was stolen in \"The Fugitive\". Doug Judy purchased him a new identical one and named it Sexarella.\n\nAt the end of season three, Holt is forced to go into witness protection in Florida with Jake when they are threatened by crime boss Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis. He worked at a family entertainment center called the Fun Zone under the alias of Greg until he and Jake baited Figgis into coming to Florida and took the criminal down with the Nine-Nine. In season five, his life and career are put at risk when he makes a deal with mobster Seamus Murphy in exchange for information to clear Jake and Rosa's names from Lt. Hawkins.\n\nDuring season five, Holt learns that the [[New York City Police Commissioner]] is retiring at the end of the year and that he is on the shortlist of candidates to replace him. He spends the rest of the season campaigning to win the Commissioner title but ends up losing to John Kelly.\n\nIn season six, Holt is encouraged by Jake and Amy to stand up to Kelly's regressive policies, leading the Commissioner to retaliate against the Nine-Nine. However, Peralta and Wuntch team up, without Holt's knowledge, to take Kelly down, resulting in Wuntch being named interim Commissioner. This detente becomes short-lived as Holt is demoted to a uniformed officer by Commissioner Wuntch after she realized he was promoted to detective too soon earlier in his career. Shortly after Wuntch's death, however, he is quickly promoted back to captain in the middle of the seventh season.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Captain Holt.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Meritorious Police Duty (with numeral \"10\")\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", he received a commendation for his supervision of Det.

As revealed in \"Hitchcock and Scully\", the two were excellent detectives in their youths and had well-built bodies, but their careers and their physiques went downhill after they tried the wings at their eventual favorite restaurant, Wing Slutz.\n\nThe majority of the precinct tends to be disgusted by Hitchcock's more perverted nature and attitude towards women. It's revealed in \"The Last Ride\" (Season 4) that Hitchcock held the all-time record for closed cases at the 99th Precinct, one more than Sgt. Jeffords as of that episode. This is mainly due to Hitchcock being at the 99th twenty years longer than Terry.

He also displayed an uncanny ability to reassemble shredded documents in one episode. Scully routinely discloses disgusting medical issues like the entire bottom of his foot being a wart or having various strains of [[fungi]]. He claims to constantly have medical emergencies, and despite having a [[pacemaker]] fitted, he frequently suffers from [[heart attack]]s. He often embarrasses himself either unintentionally or willingly and admits to being indifferent to the judgment of others (most frequently, the fellow members of his squad.) In the early seasons, Scully is married and has a dog. The team are unsure which one of them is called Kelly, though it is later revealed in season 7 that both of them were named Kelly.

The article briefly summarized the music's history, at least in the United States, saying that in the early 1980s, several punk and new wave bands had begun collecting classic country records, and soon thereafter began performing high-tempo cover versions of their favorite songs, and that new bands had also formed around the idea. By 1984, there were dozens of bands in both the U.S. and England \"personalizing country music and making it palatable for the [[MTV Generation]].\" \n\nA ''New York Times'' writer stated that one issue with the \"cowpunk\" term was that \"...no single term really describes the music of all these bands.\"<ref>Crystal, David.
