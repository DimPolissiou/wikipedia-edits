The next day, Charlie and Rodney were having a drink in the [[Woolpack]], and [[Diane Sugden]] ([[Elizabeth Estensen]]) realised that this was the 'famous' Charlie that Rodney used to talk about years ago. Charlie clearly fancies Diane, making [[Douglas Potts]] ([[Duncan Preston]]) dislike him, seeing him as a rival for Diane's affections.\n\nCharlie returns from France with presents for Diane and Douglas. When Douglas sees that his present is a box of cigars, he tells Charlie he doesn't smoke so Charlie buys the drinks to apologise. Later that week, Diane invites Charlie to dinner as Douglas had to work late. After the meal, the pair kiss. A couple of weeks later, Diane and Charlie have become a couple and go to France on holiday to see where Charlie lives, taking Diane's stepdaughter, [[Victoria Sugden]] ([[Isabel Hodgins]]). Weeks on, Charlie tells Diane he is returning to France for good so when Diane has to decide whether to stay in Emmerdale or move to France. She decides to go to France with Charlie, despite his having an inoperable brain tumour.\n\nCharlie returned on 23 July while Diane and [[Val Pollard]] ([[Charlie Hardwick]]) are searching for him. They go to his chateau and ask to see Charlie, but no one appears to have heard of, let alone seen him. Diane and Val wonder what is going on. They then ask to see the owner (thinking this will get them further) but then meet the truthful owner who also has not heard of Charlie. Diane finally puts two and two together and she breaks down in Val's arms, devastated at Charlie's actions, leaving her practically penniless.  Charlie is seen later on in a restaurant with another woman returning a handbag, which was seemingly stolen by a mugger, much similar to the scenario with Diane. This scene confirms the fact that Charlie is, in fact, a conman, and preys on lonely women for their cash.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Sue Hastings==\n<!--{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Emmerdale\n|name=Sue Hastings\n|introducer=Gavin Blyth\n|portrayer=[[Jan Francis]]\n|years=2010\n|first=8 March 2010 \n|last=18 March 2010\n|classification= [[List of past Emmerdale characters#Last appeared in 2010|Former; guest]]\n}} -->\n'''Susan \"Sue\" Hastings''' was introduced as a love interest for [[Rodney Blackstock]] ([[Patrick Mower]]).\n\nThey first met at a posh restaurant where he plucked up the courage to introduce himself to her.

On 18 March 2010, Sue wants to go to the Grange Restaurant in the village despite Rodney wanting to hide his cover as the restaurant is owned by [[Eric Pollard|Eric]] ([[Chris Chittell]]) and [[Val Pollard]] ([[Charlie Hardwick]]). Sue asks some questions about his job, which catches him out. Sue knows about the law and he doesn't which becomes apparent.

At first she appeared to be just a typical normal teenager but is later seen to be giving drugs to Holly. On Holly's 19th birthday Roz gives her some drugs in The Woolpack, when Holly's parents find out that Holly has been kicked out of college they confront her and tell Roz to leave. Holly is later banned from seeing or calling Roz. When Holly's father, [[John Barton (Emmerdale)|John]] ([[James Thornton (actor)|James Thornton]]), accuses Holly of stealing ketamine, Holly stays at Roz's house. Holly later swaps the ketamine with Roz for [[cocaine]]. Holly later runs away from home and her parents John and [[Moira Barton|Moira]] ([[Natalie J.

Roz and Holly go for a walk in the fields and talk but Holly then begins asking Roz for more drugs and they argue. John and Holly's brother [[Adam Barton (Emmerdale)|Adam]] ([[Adam Thomas]]) witness the argument and Roz tells them about Holly's request for drugs. In November Roz returns again to see Holly but is sent away by Moira and Adam.

Believing Roz, Adam tries to ring John to tell him about the situation but Moira tries to stop him. Adam and Roz both realise that Moira has been buying heroin for Holly and Roz leaves in shock.\n\nRoz returns on 16 December to see how Holly is doing. Moira apologises to Roz for misjudging her and Roz accepts it. Holly comes downstairs and is pleased to see Roz. Roz remarks that Holly looks better than when she last saw her. Holly asks Moira if Roz can take her to the clinic to get her methadone but Roz and Moira both decline, thinking it is too soon for her. Roz offers to come with her and Moira so they can catch up with each other's news and Moira agrees. When they return home Roz and Holly sit on the sofa, and after Moira leaves the house, Roz asks Holly how she is getting on and Holly tells her that she still suffers from withdrawal symptoms but doesn't want to hurt her family any more than she already has. Roz tells Holly that she has also given up using drugs.

After questioning the Wylde and Lamb families, the detectives arrest [[Nathan Wylde]] ([[Lyndon Ogbourne]]) on suspicion of his father's murder but is released, due to a lack of evidence. Nathan's half-brother, [[Ryan Lamb (Emmerdale)|Ryan Lamb]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]), is arrested after Nathan frames him by planting the murder weapon at the garage where he works and a gold chain with Ryan's DNA at the murder scene. After questioning Ryan, Prior and Henshall charge him with Mark's murder.\n\nPrior returns on 14 January 2011 to investigate the arson attack in which [[Viv Hope]] ([[Deena Payne]]) and [[Terry Woods (Emmerdale)|Terry Woods]] ([[Billy Hartman]]) are killed. She is unaware that Nick Henshall is responsible for the blaze but his frequent mood swings make Prior suspect he is overworked. Together, they question [[Katie Sugden]] ([[Sammy Winward]]), [[Chas Dingle]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]) and [[Genesis Walker|Gennie Walker]] ([[Sian Reese-Williams]]). Katie tells Prior that she thinks the arsonist has also been making prank telephone calls and broke into their home. Chas, however, thinks her ex-boyfriend, [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]), could be responsible but Gennie believes [[Andy Sugden]] ([[Kelvin Fletcher]]) is the culprit. After stating that Carl and Andy will be interviewed, the detectives leave. Henshall and Prior go to Butler's Farm and question Andy at the police station, where he protests his innocence. After the interview, Prior remarks to Henshall that they have no evidence against Andy, only hearsay and speculation.\n\nOn 20 January, Prior attends Terry's funeral with Henshall and notices Henshall's discomfort, asking if he is all right but he brushes off her concerns. On 1 February, Andy goes to the police station and makes a complaint about Henshall harassing him. Initially Prior insists that Henshall is just doing his job and has not broken any rules until he tells her Henshall and Katie are dating and he suspects Henshall is trying to frame him. Prior is surprised by Andy's revelation and confronts Henshall, who admits his relationship with Katie. Realising Henshall is jeopardizing the case, Prior reports him and Henshall is taken off the case. He angrily confronts Prior in the locker room, frightening her with his rage, accusing her of ruining his further promotion chances and being jealous of Katie. The following day, Prior goes to Victoria Cottage to review Katie, Chas and Gennie's witness statements and finds Henshall there. Katie tells her that on the night of the attack, she had been out for dinner with Henshall and after a confrontation with Andy, they ended their relationship.\n\nPrior also visits Carl to review his statement and discovers a key piece of information missing from Carl's original statement. Carl had revealed that he nearly crashed into a car as he drove into the village in his van, just before he saw the fire. Carl says that he was not shown his statement to sign, surprising Prior, as this was police procedure. On 7 February, Prior confronts Henshall in The Woolpack and demands an explanation but he insists that he did not think the evidence was reliable. Prior warns Henshall that if she discovers the truth then she will not defend him.\n\nOn 15 February, Henshall spots Prior speaking to DC Darren Foster at the police station. He tells Henshall that Prior has found a CCTV camera across the road from the shop where the phone used to make the nuisance calls to Victoria Cottage was bought from. They find footage of Henshall leaving the shop, making Prior search for Henshall and warn Katie. On arrival in the village, Chas tells her that they have gone, first to Henshall's house for his luggage and then away for a while. Prior gives Chas her mobile number and asks her to call if either Katie or Henshall contact her. She and Foster go to Henshall's house and knock on the door, knowing that he and Katie are there, but no one answers. Realising the danger Katie is in, it soon turns into hostage situation and the area is cordoned off. Prior waits by the cordon when Andy and Gennie arrive and she reassures them that the situation is under control, and asks for Katie's mobile number. Prior calls Katie's mobile and Henshall answers. She tells him that she knows he was responsible for the prank calls and asks for his side of the story but he refuses to say anything or let her speak to Katie. On Prior's request to see that Katie is alive, he drags her to the window for her to see.\n\nAs night falls, Prior continues to call Henshall's phone but he doesn't answer. Prior's boss tells her that as she cannot handle Henshall, he will send a team in. Foster suggests they storm the place but she overrules him, reminding him that Henshall has already killed two people so they should not risk Katie's life. She tries again to speak to Henshall, putting Foster's mobile through the letterbox when he won't answer the door and calling it repeatedly but he doesn't answer that either so Prior gets a loudspeaker and asks Henshall to answer the phone but he ignores her. The Chief Inspector tells Prior that she did her best and they will send a team in. Andy tries breaking through the cordon and has to be dragged away, warning Prior that he will hold her responsible if anything happens to Katie. Gennie asks what will happen next and Prior tells her that she will try to talk to Henshall for as long as possible, reassuring her that the armed response teams are trained for the type of situation they were in. A shot later rings out and Prior is apprehensive, thinking Henshall has killed Katie but she emerges unharmed. Katie tells Prior that Henshall has shot himself and she is overcome with shock.\n\n==Isaac Nuttall==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Emmerdale\n|name = Isaac Nuttall\n|introducer = Gavin Blyth (2010)<br />Kate Brooks (2018)\n|portrayer = [[Jake Roche]] (2010)<br />Benedict Shaw (2018\u20132019)\n|classification = [[List of Emmerdale characters#Present cast|Former; recurring]]\n|occupation = Student\n|first = {{Start date|2010|08|10|df=y}}\n|last = {{End date|2019|01|01|df=y}}\n|years = 2010, 2018\u20132019\n}}\n'''Isaac Nuttall''' made his first appearance on 10 August 2010, originally played by [[Jake Roche]].<ref name=\"Roche\"/> The character and Roche's casting was announced on 5 July 2010.

At the party, Isaac takes Hannah upstairs and they have sex. They are spotted coming downstairs by [[Diane Sugden]] ([[Elizabeth Estensen]]) when she breaks the party up. Hannah panics when Isaac tells her the following day that the condom he used split. Hannah gets the morning after pill from a chemist and orders Isaac to stay away from her, but they make up and remain friends. Isaac later flirts with Victoria, so Hannah accuses Victoria of trying to steal him. Hannah meets up with Isaac in the caf\u00e9 to discuss their relationship, but when Hannah spots her sister [[Holly Barton]] ([[Sophie Powles]]) leaving the pub, she goes after her leaving Isaac alone at the table. Isaac breaks up with Hannah via text message, as he does not want to be second best to her family.\n\nEight years later, Isaac and some friends attend a New Year's Eve party in Emmerdale. He meets Victoria and make it clear he is attracted to her, which angers her boyfriend [[Ellis Chapman (Emmerdale)|Ellis Chapman]] (Asan N'Jie).

Justin is unhappy to see his sister-in-law, [[Leyla Harding|Leyla]] (Roxy Shahidi), at the funeral. When Leyla later visits them, he asks her to leave as he thought it was a bad idea. Justin later visited Leyla and her boyfriend [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]) and asked her to scatter her mother's ashes. Leyla carried on meeting Justin secretly and David believed that they were having an affair. Whilst David was away on a business trip, Justin visited Leyla and told her that his marriage had broken down and that Alicia blamed Leyla. It was later revealed during an argument between Leyla and Alicia that Justin was unhappy with the way that Alicia treated her sister because their son [[#Jacob Gallagher|Jacob]] (Joe-Warren Plant) was actually Leyla's son. Alicia moved in with Leyla and David and on 23 September, Justin visited Jacob and Alicia but she wasn't pleased to see him and they argued. Justin returned on 30 November to visit Jacob as he was leaving for school and gave him an advent calendar. Alicia comes downstairs in her dressing gown, hungover and argues with Justin over Christmas plans. Justin wanted Jacob to spend Christmas with him but Alicia refused. She had earlier told Leyla that Justin had a new girlfriend. He then told Leyla that this was not true and that Alicia was trying to manipulate people to get her own way. Justin also tells Leyla that he doesn't want to be left out of Jacob's life. Justin returns on 17 December when Jacob goes missing. He immediately accuses Alicia of deliberately not telling him about Jacob's nativity play in revenge for him wanting to have Jacob for Christmas. He also blames her for the situation in front of the police. He gives DS [[Nick Henshall]] ([[Michael McKell]]) a picture of Jacob and reveals that his mother is waiting at his house in case Jacob goes there, as they believe Jacob had wanted to show his father his costume for the play. During another argument, Justin reveals that he is Jacob's biological father and that Leyla had slept with him in their flat when Jacob was conceived, leaving Alicia feeling betrayed by her sister again. Justin helps search for Jacob and when he is found, goes to hospital with him. He later suggests that Jacob come to stay with him after his recovery but Alicia refuses. In January, Justin tells Leyla that he misses Jacob and tells Alicia that he is going to fight for custody. Leyla supports her sister and tells Justin to leave. Leyla convinces Alicia to agree on access to Jacob on condition that he drop his custody battle and he does so.\n\nIn June 2012, Justin returns to the village with his new fianc\u00e9, [[Talia Brice]] ([[Carolynne Poole]]), in order to introduce her to Jacob.

Leyla had one-night-stand with Justin, the husband of her sister [[Alicia Gallagher|Alicia]] ([[Natalie Anderson]]), resulting in her pregnancy with Jacob. Alicia adopted Jacob, believing that Leyla gave him to her out of kindness as she had fertility problems. He was later adopted by Alicia's second husband, [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]). Jacob first appeared on 12 August 2010 at his grandmother's funeral. He is played by Joe-Warren Plant.\n\nWhen Alicia and Justin's marriage breaks down, Alicia and Jacob confront Leyla in Emmerdale. Whilst the sisters argue, [[Eric Pollard]] ([[Chris Chittell]]) and [[Douglas Potts]] ([[Duncan Preston]]) keep Jacob occupied. When Alicia reveals she is homeless, Leyla invites them to stay with her. Alicia later becomes paranoid that Leyla will take Jacob away and tell him the truth about his parentage. Alicia and Jacob leave the next day but return, after failing to find somewhere else to stay. Alicia enrols Jacob in the local school and he befriends [[T.J. Woods]] (Connor Lee), [[Noah Dingle]] (Jack Downham), [[Sarah Dingle|Sarah Sugden]] (Sophia Amber Moore) and [[Samson Dingle]] (Sam Hall). On his first day, Jacob is bullied for being new and T.J. sticks up for him. Alicia encourages Jacob to fight back if anyone picks a fight. Leyla's boyfriend, David, becomes concerned that Leyla is too maternal.\n\nAt T.J.'s seventh birthday party, Jacob accidentally eats cake with nut traces, which he is allergic to. He goes into anaphalytic shock and Leyla is forced to inject him with his medication. Alicia and [[Terry Woods (Emmerdale)|Terry Woods]] ([[Billy Hartman]]) take Jacob to hospital. Alicia is furious and accuses Leyla of being neglectful.\n\nIn December, Jacob takes part in his school's nativity play. He is disappointed when Justin does not come, saying that he wanted his father to see his costume. Whilst Leyla is babysitting, Jacob sneaks out of the house, intending to go to his father's. The following morning, Alicia discovers he is not in his room and panics. The police are called and Jacob is reported missing. On the moors, Jacob finds shelter in a disused building. As he tries to leave, he is knocked unconscious after falling when part of the floor collapses. Jacob's helmet from his nativity play costume is found and the search focuses on the area where it was found. David finds Jacob and has him winched to safety by a rescue team and taken to hospital where he makes a full recovery. Emotions run high while Jacob is missing and Justin reveals to Alicia that he is Jacob's biological father as he and Leyla had a one night stand. Leyla admits that Justin is telling the truth and had planned to have an abortion but her mother persuaded her not to, because of Alicia's fertility problems.\n\nIn November 2013, Alicia tells him that she adopted him and that Leyla is his birth mother. Jacob is shocked and feels betrayed so he runs away. Alicia and David notice that he's gone and call the police. David goes looking for Jacob, assisted by the Sharmas and [[Rachel Breckle]] (Gemma Oaten). [[Priya Sharma]] ([[Fiona Wade]]) also offers to help and finds him hiding at Holdgate farm, assisted by Noah. Priya tells David and Alicia and they rush over. They ask Jacob to come home but he insists on staying with the Sharmas. Jacob eventually forgives Alicia and goes home and eventually moves to Portugal with them. They return, but he leaves again due to David and Alicia's separation in 2015. He returns soon after and is shocked to overhear David telling Leyla that he loves her. Wrongly assuming that the two are a new couple, he confronts them about it the next day. David explains that he and Leyla are not together and reveals his recent testicular cancer diagnosis. Jacob supports David in his diagnosis and celebrates his marriage to [[Tracy Shankley]] later that year.\n\nIn February 2016, Jacob develops feelings for [[Gabby Thomas]] ([[Rosie Bentham]]). They attempt to have sex but are caught by her stepmother [[Laurel Thomas|Laurel]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]) who bruises Jacob's arm. He and [[Liv Flaherty]] ([[Isobel Steele]]) clash but soon become friends. Over time, he begins to develop a crush on Liv. In February 2018, Gabby asks Liv to figure out if Jacob still has feelings for her. Jacob wrongly assumes that Liv is asking him out, but is slightly embarrassed when Liv tells him that she was trying to set him with Gabby. She explains to him that she isn't sure whether she likes boys or girls and he confirms that they will still be friends.\n\nJacob is crushed when Leyla leaves for Greece in early 2018. He is further dismayed to learn of David and Tracey's breakup in 2018 and is furious to learn of David's one-night stand with Leyla. David's tumultuous love life becomes a source of irritation for Jacob around this time. David begins dating Jacob's teacher [[Maya Stepney]] ([[Louisa Clein]]) following the breakup of her marriage to [[Liam Cavanagh|Liam]]. Jacob starts to spend time with Liam's daughter Leanna but is turned off by her trouble-making attitude and takes Maya's side in her feud with Leanna. When Leyla returns from her time in Greece, Jacob is less than thrilled at her return. He quickly accepts Maya as a part of his life and she begins a pattern of grooming behavior with him, establishing a deep emotional connection.\n\nJacob develops a crush on Maya and kisses her on her birthday. She tells him to forget it the kiss but leaves the door open for future interactions. Jacob starts spending more time with Liv and tells David and Maya that they are sleeping together in an attempt to make Maya jealous. Liv finds out and calls him out in front of David and Maya. Jacob and Maya talk and kiss again and she tries to put boundaries between them, swearing him to secrecy. Jacob starts getting distracted at school and football practice. He tells [[Ellis Chapman (Emmerdale)|Ellis]] (Asan N'Jie) that he has a crush on someone older, who Ellis assumes to be a girl in sixth form. Ellis tells David and Maya about Jacob's crush and, fearing for her job, Maya angrily rejects Jacob, calling him a \"stupid, needy little boy\". Jacob makes a pass at Liv at a party and sleeps with Gabby later that night but rejects her after, causing Bernice to storm over to David's shop and shout at him. Maya and Jacob begin an affair, but the stress of keeping the relationship secret begins to wear on Jacob. He ends things after he discovers her controlling, manipulative streak. Despairing at losing his affections, Maya tries to leave the village, but falls and hits her head trying to reach items from the top of her dresser. She ends up in the hospital and the incident pushes Jacob to restart their affair. Maya advises Jacob to be seen dating someone as cover for their activities. He starts dating Liv, who is not interested in having sex, but Maya gets jealous. Jacob arranges for him and Maya to have sex in the cricket pavilion on his sixteenth birthday, but Liv finds the spot first and he is forced to pretend that he arranged it for the two of them. Maya sees the two of them through the window and leaves. Liv takes off as well and Jacob gets drunk and nearly reveals the affair at his birthday party in the cafe but throws up before he can tell the truth. Jacob and Maya patch things up and a few days later, they go to a hotel where they have sex for the first time. Jacob confesses his love to Maya and dreams of leaving the village with her but worries about how to tell David. \n\nLiv invites Jacob over to try and have sex, but he breaks up with her saying that he's not interested in her and leaves. She goes to his house to figure out why and catches him and Maya together. He temporarily convinces her not to say anything. Liv tells Aaron and Robert that Jacob is cheating on her but doesn't say who with. They tell David, who defends Jacob, but privately says that he is ashamed of him. Jacob lies that Liv's drinking contributed to the breakup. Liv blackmails Maya for money in exchange for her silence. Maya is forced to sell her car to get the money and Jacob tries to steal Val Pollard's ring to pawn it for cash. He is caught by Eric who brings him to David's house demanding an explanation. Maya lies and says that Jacob was being bullied at school by some older boys. David sends Jacob to Alicia in Portugal to get away from the village. Jacob doesn't get on the plane and goes to Hotten instead where he meets with Maya. They kiss, but are seen by Tracy who is out with Priya and Leyla.

Towards the end of 2010 he forms a close relationship with [[Lisa Dingle]] ([[Jane Cox]]), it becomes apparent that he has feelings for her. Lisa's husband [[Zak Dingle|Zak]] ([[Steve Halliwell]]), is oblivious to this but forms a good friendship with Derek as he finds jobs for Zak for his delivery van business. On 6 January, Derek and Lisa are both working overtime in the factory together, while everyone else is out at the pub. During this time Derek attacks and rapes Lisa and calls her \"a cheap little hussey\" when she rejects him. He locks Lisa in the factory and tells her to keep it as their little secret, just after Jai and [[Charity Dingle]] ([[Emma Atkins]]), attempt to enter the factory and believe Derek and Lisa have gone home as the factory is locked. After Lisa demands to be allowed to go home, Derek lets her out just as Zak and their daughter [[Belle Dingle|Belle]] ([[Eden Taylor-Draper]]) arrive but Lisa does not tell Zak about the rape. Zak offers Derek a drink at the pub but Lisa wishes to go home. Afterwards Derek goes to the pub and Jai confronts him and asks him why the factory was locked and Derek tells him that Lisa was a bit jumpy from being on her own so they locked the factory to feel secure. The following day, Lisa orders Derek to stay away from her and her family. Derek acts as if nothing has happened and Lisa is openly hostile towards him, noticed by her colleagues and friends. Derek attends a school play in which his nephew is a member of the cast.

Lisa tries to convince Lizzie to stay clear of Derek but she is unsuccessful and Lizzie accuses her of being jealous. The following day, Lisa begs Lizzie to give up her overtime and the women argue and Derek gets involved. Lisa then reveals to Lizzie that Derek raped her. Derek attempts to deny Lisa's accusation and claims that she made a pass at him and that he turned her down, not wanting to betray Zak, but the other factory workers are not convinced and believe Lisa. Jai and his brother [[Nikhil Sharma|Nikhil]] ([[Rik Makarem]]) then suspend Derek from work and tell him to go home and he threatens to sue them. The following day Derek returns to the factory to the astonishment of the other workers and asks Jai and Nikhil if he can talk to them in their office but they refuse and tell Derek to go home. In frustration, Derek resigns from his job and leaves. On 14 March, the police reveal that there is not enough evidence to prosecute Derek for the rape. A furious Zak tracks Derek down to his home. He forces his way into the house and attacks Derek. Lisa follows Zak and manages to stop him from killing Derek. Zak then demands that Derek admits to raping Lisa but he refuses. Derek lies to Zak, claiming that Lisa was obsessed with him, which angers Lisa and she also demands that Derek admits to raping her. She then describes the details of the attack in front of Zak. Zak then tells Derek that he has not got away with his crime and that he will get his comeuppance one day. Zak and Lisa then leave and Derek is clearly shaken by their words. The following week, Lisa receives a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service telling her that Derek has raped another woman and has been arrested and charged and that her rape case was under review. Lisa tells Zak that the CPS want to charge Derek with her rape and intend to hold a joint trial for both offences. Lisa then explains to Zak that she wants to give evidence in order to make sure Derek is imprisoned. In May 2011, Derek stands trial and Lisa faces him in court. She gives evidence but is cross-examined and Derek denies raping her whilst giving evidence in his defence, still insisting that they had consensual sex.

This scene confirms the fact that Charlie is, in fact, a conman, and preys on lonely women for their cash.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Sue Hastings==\n<!--{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Emmerdale\n|name=Sue Hastings\n|introducer=Gavin Blyth\n|portrayer=[[Jan Francis]]\n|years=2010\n|first=8 March 2010 \n|last=18 March 2010\n|classification= [[List of past Emmerdale characters#Last appeared in 2010|Former; guest]]\n}} -->\n'''Susan \"Sue\" Hastings''' was introduced as a love interest for [[Rodney Blackstock]] ([[Patrick Mower]]).\n\nThey first met at a posh restaurant where he plucked up the courage to introduce himself to her.

After questioning the Wylde and Lamb families, the detectives arrest [[Nathan Wylde]] ([[Lyndon Ogbourne]]) on suspicion of his father's murder but is released, due to a lack of evidence. Nathan's half-brother, [[Ryan Lamb (Emmerdale)|Ryan Lamb]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]), is arrested after Nathan frames him by planting the murder weapon at the garage where he works and a gold chain with Ryan's DNA at the murder scene. After questioning Ryan, Prior and Henshall charge him with Mark's murder.\n\nPrior returns on 14 January 2011 to investigate the arson attack in which [[Viv Hope]] ([[Deena Payne]]) and [[Terry Woods (Emmerdale)|Terry Woods]] ([[Billy Hartman]]) are killed. She is unaware that Nick Henshall is responsible for the blaze but his frequent mood swings make Prior suspect he is overworked. Together, they question [[Katie Sugden]] ([[Sammy Winward]]), [[Chas Dingle]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]) and [[Genesis Walker|Gennie Walker]] ([[Sian Reese-Williams]]). Katie tells Prior that she thinks the arsonist has also been making prank telephone calls and broke into their home. Chas, however, thinks her ex-boyfriend, [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]), could be responsible but Gennie believes [[Andy Sugden]] ([[Kelvin Fletcher]]) is the culprit. After stating that Carl and Andy will be interviewed, the detectives leave. Henshall and Prior go to Butler's Farm and question Andy at the police station, where he protests his innocence. After the interview, Prior remarks to Henshall that they have no evidence against Andy, only hearsay and speculation.\n\nOn 20 January, Prior attends Terry's funeral with Henshall and notices Henshall's discomfort, asking if he is all right but he brushes off her concerns. On 1 February, Andy goes to the police station and makes a complaint about Henshall harassing him. Initially Prior insists that Henshall is just doing his job and has not broken any rules until he tells her Henshall and Katie are dating and he suspects Henshall is trying to frame him. Prior is surprised by Andy's revelation and confronts Henshall, who admits his relationship with Katie. Realising Henshall is jeopardizing the case, Prior reports him and Henshall is taken off the case. He angrily confronts Prior in the locker room, frightening her with his rage, accusing her of ruining his further promotion chances and being jealous of Katie. The following day, Prior goes to Victoria Cottage to review Katie, Chas and Gennie's witness statements and finds Henshall there. Katie tells her that on the night of the attack, she had been out for dinner with Henshall and after a confrontation with Andy, they ended their relationship.\n\nPrior also visits Carl to review his statement and discovers a key piece of information missing from Carl's original statement. Carl had revealed that he nearly crashed into a car as he drove into the village in his van, just before he saw the fire. Carl says that he was not shown his statement to sign, surprising Prior, as this was police procedure. On 7 February, Prior confronts Henshall in The Woolpack and demands an explanation but he insists that he did not think the evidence was reliable. Prior warns Henshall that if she discovers the truth then she will not defend him.\n\nOn 15 February, Henshall spots Prior speaking to DC Darren Foster at the police station. He tells Henshall that Prior has found a CCTV camera across the road from the shop where the phone used to make the nuisance calls to Victoria Cottage was bought from. They find footage of Henshall leaving the shop, making Prior search for Henshall and warn Katie. On arrival in the village, Chas tells her that they have gone, first to Henshall's house for his luggage and then away for a while. Prior gives Chas her mobile number and asks her to call if either Katie or Henshall contact her. She and Foster go to Henshall's house and knock on the door, knowing that he and Katie are there, but no one answers. Realising the danger Katie is in, it soon turns into hostage situation and the area is cordoned off. Prior waits by the cordon when Andy and Gennie arrive and she reassures them that the situation is under control, and asks for Katie's mobile number. Prior calls Katie's mobile and Henshall answers. She tells him that she knows he was responsible for the prank calls and asks for his side of the story but he refuses to say anything or let her speak to Katie. On Prior's request to see that Katie is alive, he drags her to the window for her to see.\n\nAs night falls, Prior continues to call Henshall's phone but he doesn't answer. Prior's boss tells her that as she cannot handle Henshall, he will send a team in. Foster suggests they storm the place but she overrules him, reminding him that Henshall has already killed two people so they should not risk Katie's life. She tries again to speak to Henshall, putting Foster's mobile through the letterbox when he won't answer the door and calling it repeatedly but he doesn't answer that either so Prior gets a loudspeaker and asks Henshall to answer the phone but he ignores her. The Chief Inspector tells Prior that she did her best and they will send a team in. Andy tries breaking through the cordon and has to be dragged away, warning Prior that he will hold her responsible if anything happens to Katie. Gennie asks what will happen next and Prior tells her that she will try to talk to Henshall for as long as possible, reassuring her that the armed response teams are trained for the type of situation they were in. A shot later rings out and Prior is apprehensive, thinking Henshall has killed Katie but she emerges unharmed. Katie tells Prior that Henshall has shot himself and she is overcome with shock.\n\n==Isaac Nuttall==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Emmerdale\n|name = Isaac Nuttall\n|introducer = Gavin Blyth (2010)<br />Kate Brooks (2018)\n|portrayer = [[Jake Roche]] (2010)<br />Benedict Shaw (2018\u20132019)\n|classification = [[List of Emmerdale characters#Present cast|Former; recurring]]\n|occupation = Student\n|first = {{Start date|2010|08|10|df=y}}\n|last = {{End date|2019|01|01|df=y}}\n|years = 2010, 2018\u20132019\n}}\n'''Isaac Nuttall''' made his first appearance on 10 August 2010, originally played by [[Jake Roche]].<ref name=\"Roche\"/> The character and Roche's casting was announced on 5 July 2010.

Justin later visited Leyla and her boyfriend [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]) and asked her to scatter her mother's ashes. Leyla carried on meeting Justin secretly and David believed that they were having an affair. Whilst David was away on a business trip, Justin visited Leyla and told her that his marriage had broken down and that Alicia blamed Leyla. It was later revealed during an argument between Leyla and Alicia that Justin was unhappy with the way that Alicia treated her sister because their son [[#Jacob Gallagher|Jacob]] (Joe-Warren Plant) was actually Leyla's son. Alicia moved in with Leyla and David and on 23 September, Justin visited Jacob and Alicia but she wasn't pleased to see him and they argued. Justin returned on 30 November to visit Jacob as he was leaving for school and gave him an advent calendar. Alicia comes downstairs in her dressing gown, hungover and argues with Justin over Christmas plans. Justin wanted Jacob to spend Christmas with him but Alicia refused.

Wrongly assuming that the two are a new couple, he confronts them about it the next day. David explains that he and Leyla are not together and reveals his recent testicular cancer diagnosis. Jacob supports David in his diagnosis and celebrates his marriage to [[Tracy Shankley]] later that year.\n\nIn February 2016, Jacob develops feelings for [[Gabby Thomas]] ([[Rosie Bentham]]). They attempt to have sex but are caught by her stepmother [[Laurel Thomas|Laurel]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]) who bruises Jacob's arm. He and [[Liv Flaherty]] ([[Isobel Steele]]) clash but soon become friends. Over time, he begins to develop a crush on Liv. In February 2018, Gabby asks Liv to figure out if Jacob still has feelings for her. Jacob wrongly assumes that Liv is asking him out, but is slightly embarrassed when Liv tells him that she was trying to set him with Gabby. She explains to him that she isn't sure whether she likes boys or girls and he confirms that they will still be friends.\n\nJacob is crushed when Leyla leaves for Greece in early 2018. He is further dismayed to learn of David and Tracey's breakup in 2018 and is furious to learn of David's one-night stand with Leyla. David's tumultuous love life becomes a source of irritation for Jacob around this time. David begins dating Jacob's teacher [[Maya Stepney]] ([[Louisa Clein]]) following the breakup of her marriage to [[Liam Cavanagh|Liam]]. Jacob starts to spend time with Liam's daughter Leanna but is turned off by her trouble-making attitude and takes Maya's side in her feud with Leanna. When Leyla returns from her time in Greece, Jacob is less than thrilled at her return. He quickly accepts Maya as a part of his life and she begins a pattern of grooming behavior with him, establishing a deep emotional connection.\n\nJacob develops a crush on Maya and kisses her on her birthday. She tells him to forget it the kiss but leaves the door open for future interactions. Jacob starts spending more time with Liv and tells David and Maya that they are sleeping together in an attempt to make Maya jealous. Liv finds out and calls him out in front of David and Maya. Jacob and Maya talk and kiss again and she tries to put boundaries between them, swearing him to secrecy. Jacob starts getting distracted at school and football practice. He tells [[Ellis Chapman (Emmerdale)|Ellis]] (Asan N'Jie) that he has a crush on someone older, who Ellis assumes to be a girl in sixth form. Ellis tells David and Maya about Jacob's crush and, fearing for her job, Maya angrily rejects Jacob, calling him a \"stupid, needy little boy\". Jacob makes a pass at Liv at a party and sleeps with Gabby later that night but rejects her after, causing Bernice to storm over to David's shop and shout at him. Maya and Jacob begin an affair, but the stress of keeping the relationship secret begins to wear on Jacob. He ends things after he discovers her controlling, manipulative streak. Despairing at losing his affections, Maya tries to leave the village, but falls and hits her head trying to reach items from the top of her dresser. She ends up in the hospital and the incident pushes Jacob to restart their affair. Maya advises Jacob to be seen dating someone as cover for their activities. He starts dating Liv, who is not interested in having sex, but Maya gets jealous. Jacob arranges for him and Maya to have sex in the cricket pavilion on his sixteenth birthday, but Liv finds the spot first and he is forced to pretend that he arranged it for the two of them. Maya sees the two of them through the window and leaves. Liv takes off as well and Jacob gets drunk and nearly reveals the affair at his birthday party in the cafe but throws up before he can tell the truth. Jacob and Maya patch things up and a few days later, they go to a hotel where they have sex for the first time. Jacob confesses his love to Maya and dreams of leaving the village with her but worries about how to tell David. \n\nLiv invites Jacob over to try and have sex, but he breaks up with her saying that he's not interested in her and leaves. She goes to his house to figure out why and catches him and Maya together. He temporarily convinces her not to say anything. Liv tells Aaron and Robert that Jacob is cheating on her but doesn't say who with. They tell David, who defends Jacob, but privately says that he is ashamed of him. Jacob lies that Liv's drinking contributed to the breakup. Liv blackmails Maya for money in exchange for her silence. Maya is forced to sell her car to get the money and Jacob tries to steal Val Pollard's ring to pawn it for cash. He is caught by Eric who brings him to David's house demanding an explanation. Maya lies and says that Jacob was being bullied at school by some older boys. David sends Jacob to Alicia in Portugal to get away from the village. Jacob doesn't get on the plane and goes to Hotten instead where he meets with Maya. They kiss, but are seen by Tracy who is out with Priya and Leyla. The three women drive off with Maya to confront her over the affair with Jacob. After a fight in the woods, she escapes with a head injury and calls Jacob for help. They hide out in a hotel for a few days while she recuperates.\n\nJacob sneaks back to the village to get Maya's passport and some money so they can run away together. He is caught by Tracy, Leyla, and Priya, who take him to David where they reveal everything that has happened. David takes the news badly and lashes out at Jacob in anger. Jacob runs away and leaves by bus before Leyla can catch up with him. David keeps trying to call Jacob to talk but Maya refuses contact. David and Leyla enlist Liv's help and they manage to contact Jacob.

They remained in the WCAC until joining the Pacific Coast Athletic Association, now known as the [[Big West Conference]], in 1969 for football and 1971 for other sports. Pacific dropped football after the 1995 season, and returned to the WCC in 2013.\n\nFacilities on the Stockton Campus include the 2,500-seat Klein Family Field for baseball, the 350-seat Bill Simoni Field for softball, the 6,150-seat [[Alex G.

After over 40 years of being in a conference (the PCAA/Big West) in which they were the only private school ever to have been a member, they returned to a league that is now composed exclusively of private, faith-based schools.

After the establishment of the 1954 amended Police Law, these departments are supervised by the [[National Police Agency (Japan)#Criminal Affairs Bureau|Criminal Affairs Bureau of the National Police Agency]].{{Sfn|National Police Agency|1977|p=320}}\n\nCriminal investigation departments or criminal investigation bureaus maintain two {{Nihongo|investigation divisions|\u635c\u67fb\u8ab2|sousa-ka}} (third or even fourth divisions are established in some urban prefecture), an {{Nihongo|organised crime investigation division|[[:ja:\u7d44\u7e54\u72af\u7f6a\u5bfe\u7b56\u90e8|\u7d44\u7e54\u72af\u7f6a\u5bfe\u7b56\u8ab2]]|soshikihanzai-taisaku-ka}} (reinforced as an independent department or headquarters in the TMPD and some prefectures), a mobile investigation unit, and an {{Nihongo|identification division|\u9451\u8b58\u8ab2|kanshiki-ka}}.

But at this point, the uniforms of the National Rural Police and the municipal police differed in details.{{Sfn|National Police Agency|1977|p=309}}\n\nDuring a reorganization in 1954, uniforms were to be unified across the country, but because that would take time, only the class chapter was unified at this time. After that, in 1956, a new uniform was adopted. The jacket became the turned-down collar style with three buttons, and the vent was done away with. Also, at this time, the summer clothes became grey, but in 1968 it was changed to greyish blue.{{Sfn|National Police Agency|1977|pp=523-528}}\n\nThrough the campaign against the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan]] at the end of the 1960s, [[helmet]]s and protective gear for riot police officers were improved.{{Sfn|National Police Agency|1977|pp=518-520}} On the other hand, general police officers were wearing blade-deflecting vests under uniforms so that they would not be noticeable, but since the 2000s, a strong [[stab vest]] to overlay on the uniform was adopted.

Only some elite [[detective]]s, [[bodyguard]]s, or [[SWAT]] units such as the [[Tokubetsu-keibi-tai (Metropolitan Police Department)|Emergency Service Unit]] of the TMPD were issued pistols. [[FN Model 1910]] or [[Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless|Colt Model 1903]] were used for open-carry uses, and [[Colt Model 1908 Vest Pocket]] or [[FN M1905]] for [[concealed carry]]. During the [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation]], the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]] suggested them to be equipped with firearms. Because of the insufficient stocks of the domestic handguns, Japanese police started to receive service pistols leased from the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] from 1949, and by 1951, all officers were issued pistols.<ref name=\"GHQ\">{{Cite book|author=[[:ja:\u7af9\u524d\u6804\u6cbb|Eiji Takemae]]|year=2000|title=History of the non-military activities of the Occupation of Japan, 1945-1951 (15)|publisher=[[:ja:\u65e5\u672c\u56f3\u66f8\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc|Nihon Tosho Center]]|isbn=978-4820565376|language=Japanese|page=58}}</ref>\n\nIn the beginning, types of sidearm varied, but [[M1911 pistol]]s and [[M1917 revolver]]s, [[Smith & Wesson Model 10|Smith & Wesson Military & Police]] and [[Colt Official Police]] were used as their main sidearm. The .38&nbsp;calibre revolvers were well-received, but .45&nbsp;calibre handguns were too large to carry for somewhat small officers especially [[Women in law enforcement|women]]. And especially M1917 revolvers were obsolete, deteriorated significantly, so malfunction or reduced accuracy had been a problem. As a response to these issues, the National Rural Police Headquarters started to import small [[.38 Special|.38&nbsp;Special]]&nbsp;calibre revolvers such as [[Smith & Wesson Model 36|Smith & Wesson Chiefs Special]] and [[Colt Detective Special]]. And from the 1960s, procurement began to migrate to the domestic [[New Nambu M60|Minebea \"New Nambu\" M60]]. When the production of the M60 was completed in the 1990s, deployment of small [[semi-automatic pistol]]s was considered, but this plan was abandoned after small numbers of [[SIG Sauer P230]] were deployed. Finally, imports from the United States was resumed, S&W M37 and M360 revolvers have been purchased for uniformed officers. And some elite detectives, bodyguards, or [[counter-terrorism]] units such as the [[Special Assault Team]] are equipped with [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm&nbsp;Parabellum]]&nbsp;calibre semi-automatic pistols, [[Heckler & Koch USP]], for example.{{Sfn|Otsuka|2009}}\n\nFrom sometime in the 1970s, the Special Armed Police (ancestor of the Special Assault Team of the TMPD) introduced [[Heckler & Koch MP5]]A5/SD6/K [[submachine gun]]s. And from 2002, local counter-terrorism units (anti-firearms squads) were started to be equipped with MP5F, and there are also [[assault rifle]]s in the SAT and urban AFS units. [[SWAT]] units of crime branches ([[Special Investigation Team]] of the TMPD, for example) also introduced [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] [[Carbine#Pistol-caliber carbine|pistol-caliber carbine]] variant of MP5K (named as MP5SFK unofficially).{{Sfn|Otsuka|2009}}\n\nInitially, the [[sniper]] team was established in the 1960s, the Howa Golden Bear (original model of the [[Weatherby#Rifles|Weatherby Vanguard]]) has been used as a sniper rifle, then, it has been updated to the [[Howa M1500]].

During the [[occupation of Japan]], the principle of [[decentralization|decentralisation]] was introduced by the 1947 Police Law ([[:ja:\u8b66\u5bdf\u6cd5|ja]]).

In addition, excessive fragmentation of the police organisation reduced the efficiency of police activities.{{Sfn|National Police Agency|1977|pp=399-416}}\n\nAs a response to these problems, complete restructuring created a more centralized system under the 1954 amended {{Nihongo|Police Law|[[:ja:\u8b66\u5bdf\u6cd5|\u8b66\u5bdf\u6cd5]]|Keisatsu-h\u014d}}. All operational units except for the [[National Police Agency (Japan)#Imperial Guard|Imperial Guard]] were reorganized into the Prefectural Police Departments for each prefecture and the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] was established as the central coordinating agency for these police departments.{{Sfn|National Police Agency|1977|pp=435-448}}\n\n==Organisation==\nEach Prefectural Polices comprises a [[police authority]] and operational units: Prefectural Public Safety Commissions (PPSC) and Prefectural Police Headquarters (PPH).{{Sfn|National Police Agency|1977|pp=442-448}}\n\n===Prefectural Public Safety Commission===\n[[File:Keishicho.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]] headquarters building in [[Kasumigaseki]]]]\n\n{{Nihongo|Prefectural Public Safety Commissions|[[:ja:\u516c\u5b89\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a|\u90fd\u9053\u5e9c\u770c\u516c\u5b89\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a]]|tod\u014dfuken k\u014dan \u012bnkai}} are administrative committees established under the jurisdiction of prefectural governors to provide [[citizen oversight]] for police activities.

In order to fulfil this responsibility, [[criminal investigation department]]s or criminal investigation bureaus ([[Judicial police|judiciary police]]) were set up in each police organisation.

In 1946, the jacket was changed to four-buttons, open-collar style with [[Vent (tailoring)|vent]] and in 1950, a new [[police duty belt]] to wear gun and baton was adopted. But at this point, the uniforms of the National Rural Police and the municipal police differed in details.{{Sfn|National Police Agency|1977|p=309}}\n\nDuring a reorganization in 1954, uniforms were to be unified across the country, but because that would take time, only the class chapter was unified at this time. After that, in 1956, a new uniform was adopted. The jacket became the turned-down collar style with three buttons, and the vent was done away with. Also, at this time, the summer clothes became grey, but in 1968 it was changed to greyish blue.{{Sfn|National Police Agency|1977|pp=523-528}}\n\nThrough the campaign against the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan]] at the end of the 1960s, [[helmet]]s and protective gear for riot police officers were improved.{{Sfn|National Police Agency|1977|pp=518-520}} On the other hand, general police officers were wearing blade-deflecting vests under uniforms so that they would not be noticeable, but since the 2000s, a strong [[stab vest]] to overlay on the uniform was adopted.

Only some elite [[detective]]s, [[bodyguard]]s, or [[SWAT]] units such as the [[Tokubetsu-keibi-tai (Metropolitan Police Department)|Emergency Service Unit]] of the TMPD were issued pistols. [[FN Model 1910]] or [[Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless|Colt Model 1903]] were used for open-carry uses, and [[Colt Model 1908 Vest Pocket]] or [[FN M1905]] for [[concealed carry]]. During the [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation]], the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]] suggested them to be equipped with firearms. Because of the insufficient stocks of the domestic handguns, Japanese police started to receive service pistols leased from the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] from 1949, and by 1951, all officers were issued pistols.<ref name=\"GHQ\">{{Cite book|author=[[:ja:\u7af9\u524d\u6804\u6cbb|Eiji Takemae]]|year=2000|title=History of the non-military activities of the Occupation of Japan, 1945-1951 (15)|publisher=[[:ja:\u65e5\u672c\u56f3\u66f8\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc|Nihon Tosho Center]]|isbn=978-4820565376|language=Japanese|page=58}}</ref>\n\nIn the beginning, types of sidearm varied, but [[M1911 pistol]]s and [[M1917 revolver]]s, [[Smith & Wesson Model 10|Smith & Wesson Military & Police]] and [[Colt Official Police]] were used as their main sidearm. The .38&nbsp;calibre revolvers were well-received, but .45&nbsp;calibre handguns were too large to carry for somewhat small officers especially [[Women in law enforcement|women]]. And especially M1917 revolvers were obsolete, deteriorated significantly, so malfunction or reduced accuracy had been a problem. As a response to these issues, the National Rural Police Headquarters started to import small [[.38 Special|.38&nbsp;Special]]&nbsp;calibre revolvers such as [[Smith & Wesson Model 36|Smith & Wesson Chiefs Special]] and [[Colt Detective Special]]. And from the 1960s, procurement began to migrate to the domestic [[New Nambu M60|Minebea \"New Nambu\" M60]]. When the production of the M60 was completed in the 1990s, deployment of small [[semi-automatic pistol]]s was considered, but this plan was abandoned after small numbers of [[SIG Sauer P230]] were deployed. Finally, imports from the United States was resumed, S&W M37 and M360 revolvers have been purchased for uniformed officers. And some elite detectives, bodyguards, or [[counter-terrorism]] units such as the [[Special Assault Team]] are equipped with [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm&nbsp;Parabellum]]&nbsp;calibre semi-automatic pistols, [[Heckler & Koch USP]], for example.{{Sfn|Otsuka|2009}}\n\nFrom sometime in the 1970s, the Special Armed Police (ancestor of the Special Assault Team of the TMPD) introduced [[Heckler & Koch MP5]]A5/SD6/K [[submachine gun]]s. And from 2002, local counter-terrorism units (anti-firearms squads) were started to be equipped with MP5F, and there are also [[assault rifle]]s in the SAT and urban AFS units. [[SWAT]] units of crime branches ([[Special Investigation Team]] of the TMPD, for example) also introduced [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] [[Carbine#Pistol-caliber carbine|pistol-caliber carbine]] variant of MP5K (named as MP5SFK unofficially).{{Sfn|Otsuka|2009}}\n\nInitially, the [[sniper]] team was established in the 1960s, the Howa Golden Bear (original model of the [[Weatherby#Rifles|Weatherby Vanguard]]) has been used as a sniper rifle, then, it has been updated to the [[Howa M1500]]. In the [[Special Assault Team]]s, [[Heckler & Koch PSG1]] and [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|L96A1]] also been deployed.{{Sfn|Otsuka|2009}}\n\nFor Japanese police, service pistols are generally left at work when they are not on duty.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=C6ArNjB-oG8C&pg=PA214&lpg=PA214&dq=japanese+police+service+weapon#v=onepage&q=japanese%20police%20service%20weapon&f=false| author=Richard J.

Pursuit vehicles depend on prefectures with the [[Honda NSX]], [[Subaru Impreza]], [[Subaru Legacy]], [[Mitsubishi Lancer]], [[Nissan Skyline]], [[Mazda RX-7]], and [[Nissan Fairlady Z]] are all used in various prefectures for [[highway patrol]]s and pursuit uses.\n\nWith the exception of unmarked vehicles, all PPHs vechicles are painted and marked in the same ways. Ordinary police vehicles are painted [[Black and white (slang)|black and white]] with the upper parts of the vehicle painted white. Motorcycles are usually all white. Vehicles for riot police units are painted blue and white, and especially vehicles for the Rescue Squads of the TMPD are painted green and white.{{Sfn|Kodansha BC|2010|pp=36-59}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Policeofficeronabike-shimbashi-may11-2017.jpg|[[Police bicycle]]\nFile: Japanese HONDA VFR800P police motorcycle.jpg|[[Honda VFR800]]P: [[Police motorcycle]]\nFile:Kanagawa-200Crown.JPG|[[Toyota Crown]]: [[Police car#Patrol car|Radio mobile patrol]]{{refn|Official name is {{Nihongo||\u8b66\u3089\u7528\u7121\u7dda\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca|Keira-you-musen-jid\u014dsha}}.|group=Note}}\nFile:Japanese police car 1.jpg|Toyota Crown: [[Police car#Traffic car|Mobile traffic patrol]]{{refn|Official name is {{Nihongo||\u4ea4\u901a\u53d6\u7de0\u7528\u56db\u8f2a\u8eca|K\u014dtsu-torishimari-you-yonrinsha}}.|group=Note}}\nFile:Allion-unmarkedcar.jpg|[[Toyota Allion]]: [[Police car#Unmarked car|Unmarked car]] for MIU\nFile:Mercedes-Benz W221 S600 long security police.JPG|[[Mercedes-Benz W221|Mercedes-Benz S600]]: Unmarked car for [[Security Police (Japan)|SP]]\nFile:MPD Oogata yusousha, ERGAmio by ISUZU Front Perspective View.jpg| [[Isuzu Erga Mio]]: [[Police bus]]{{refn|Official name is {{Nihongo||[[:ja:\u4eba\u54e1\u8f38\u9001\u8eca#\u5927\u578b\u8f38\u9001\u8eca|\u5927\u578b\u8f38\u9001\u8eca]]|\u014cgata-yus\u014d-sha}}, mainly used as troop transportation.|group=Note}}\nImage:Jochukeibi.jpg|[[Isuzu Giga]]: [[Armoured bus]]{{refn|Official name is {{Nihongo||[[:ja:\u5e38\u99d0\u8b66\u5099\u8eca|\u5e38\u99d0\u8b66\u5099\u8eca]]|J\u014dch\u016b-keibi-sha}}, mainly used as mobile barriers and shelters for police units.|group=Note}}\nImage:Yuugekihousui.jpg| [[Mitsubishi Fuso Fighter]]: Mobile [[water cannon]] vehicle\nFile:MPD-rescuesha.jpg|[[Hino Ranger]]: [[Heavy rescue vehicle]]\nFile:Unimog-Tamokutekisaigaikatudou.jpg|[[Unimog]]: [[Off-road vehicle|Off-road emergency vehicle]]{{refn|Official name is {{Nihongo||\u591a\u76ee\u7684\u707d\u5bb3\u6d3b\u52d5\u8eca|Tamokuteki-saigai-katudou-sha}}.|group=Note}}\nFile:MPD-tokugatakeibi.jpg|[[Mitsubishi Fuso Canter]]: [[SWAT vehicle]]{{refn|Official name is {{Nihongo||[[:ja:\u7279\u578b\u8b66\u5099\u8eca|\u7279\u578b\u8b66\u5099\u8eca]]|Tokugata-keibi-sha}}.|group=Note}}\n</gallery>\n\n====Aviation====\nIn Japan, the deployment of police helicopters began in 1960.

As the day wore on, Feldmarschall-Leutnant [[Johann von Hiller]] arrived with reinforcements to take command of the three corps that formed the Austrian left wing. The action ended in a complete Franco-German victory. The battlefield was southeast of [[Abensberg]] and included clashes at Offenstetten, [[Biburg]]-[[Siegenburg]], [[Rohr in Niederbayern]], and [[Rottenburg an der Laaber]]. On the same day, the French garrison of [[Regensburg]] capitulated.\n\nAfter [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Louis-Nicolas Davout]]'s hard-fought victory at [[Battle of Teugen-Hausen]] the previous day, Napoleon determined to break through the Austrian defenses behind the [[Abens|Abens River]]. The emperor assembled a provisional corps consisting of part of Davout's corps plus cavalry and gave Marshal [[Jean Lannes]] command over it. Napoleon directed his German allies from the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] and the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] to attack across the Abens from the west, while Lannes thrust from the north toward Rohr.\n\nWhile the Austrians initially held the river line, Lannes' strike force crashed through Louis' defenses farther east. On the left, the Austrians managed to conduct a capable rear guard action, but during the day the French smashed their opponents' right flank and captured thousands of soldiers. The day ended with the Austrians barely holding onto a line behind the [[Gro\u00dfe Laber]] River.\n\nThe next day, Hiller withdrew to [[Landshut]], separating the left wing from the main army under [[Generalissimo]] [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen]] near [[Regensburg]] (Ratisbon).\n\nThe French surrender of Regensburg on 20 April allowed Charles' army a retreat route to the north bank of the Danube. The [[Battle of Landshut (1809)|Battle of Landshut]] was fought on 21 April.\n\n==Background==\n===Operations===\nArchduke Charles stole a march on Napoleon when his army invaded the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] on 10 April 1809. Even though the Austrian army took six days to slowly march from the [[Inn (river)|Inn River]] at the frontier to the [[Isar|Isar River]], the move placed the army of France and their German allies in grave danger.<ref>Chandler ''Campaigns'', p 677</ref> Napoleon's deputy commander, Marshal [[Louis Alexandre Berthier]] mismanaged the [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'s concentration, leaving its units scattered across a broad front in a confused state.<ref>Chandler ''Campaigns'', p 678-679</ref>\n\n[[Image:Archdukecharles1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|alt=Archduke Charles missed a chance to crush Marshal Davout.|Archduke Charles]]\nThe central mass of Archduke Charles' 209,600-man host<ref>Bowden & Tarbox, p 73</ref> crossed the Isar at [[Landshut]] on 16 April, but the next day Emperor Napoleon arrived at the front from [[Paris]]. Desperately trying to wrest the initiative back from the archduke, Napoleon consolidated his forces and ordered Marshal [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]]'s IV Corps and General of Division [[Nicolas Oudinot]]'s II Corps on the right flank to march on Landshut to cut the Austrian line of communications. He planned for Marshal [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Lefebvre]]'s Bavarian VII Corps to hold in the center at Abensberg while Davout's left flank III Corps withdrew west to escape being trapped between Charles' main body and the [[Danube]].<ref>Chandler ''Campaigns'', pp 682\u2013683</ref>\n\nOn 19 April, Charles realized he had an opportunity to destroy Davout. He launched 65,000 troops in three powerful columns northwest as Davout attempted a flank march across his front. Luckily for the French, General of Cavalry [[Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein]]'s 20,000 troops found no opposition on the Austrian right.<ref>Arnold, pp 83\u201384</ref> In the center, [[General of Division]] [[Louis-Pierre Montbrun]]'s 3,800 cavalry and infantry skilfully held off Feldmarschall-Leutnant [[Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini]]'s much stronger IV Armeekorps for most of the day.<ref>Arnold, p 90</ref>\n\nOn the left flank, Feldmarschall-Leutnant [[Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen]]'s III Armeekorps crashed into General of Division [[Louis Vincent Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire]]'s division and a terrific fight blazed up. Both sides fed in reinforcements as the infantry battled over a pair of parallel ridges in the [[Battle of Teugen-Hausen]]. Ultimately, Davout brought superior forces to bear in the late afternoon and pushed back the Austrians a short ways. That night, Charles ordered Hohenzollern to withdraw a little to the east, closer to his main body.<ref>Arnold, pp 85\u201393</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 19 April, Archduke Charles requested that Hohenzollern provide a link between the III and V Armeekorps. Accordingly, the III Armeekorps commander detached General-Major Ludwig Thierry's 6,000-man infantry brigade to his left. As an additional link between Thierry and III Armeekorps, Hohenzollern detached General-Major Joseph Freiherr von Pfanzelter with a [[Grenz infantry]] battalion and two squadrons of hussars, about 1,000 men.<ref>Arnold, p 84</ref> While the Battle of Teugen-Hausen raged, Thierry clashed with Bavarian troops near Arnhofen and fell back to Offenstetten.<ref>Smith, p 289</ref>\n\n===Austrian deployment===\n[[Image:Johann Kolowrat.jpg|right|thumb|120px|alt=Johann Kollowrat's II Armeekorps attacked Regensburg.|Johann Kollowrat]]\nOn 20 April, Archduke Charles' main body consisted of the III, IV, and I Reserve Armeekorps.

On the evening of the 19th, the bulk of Hiller's VI Armeekorps reached [[Mainburg]] to the south.<ref name=Arnold107/> Like V and II Reserve Armeekorps, the VI suffered from detachments. At the beginning of the war, Charles sent the division of Feldmarschall-Leutnant [[Franz Jellacic]] to hold [[Munich]], the Bavarian capital, where it remained.<ref>Arnold, p 78</ref> Hiller also posted General-Major [[Armand von Nordmann]] with a small force at [[Moosburg an der Isar]] to watch his south flank.<ref name=Arnold105/> The official returns of Hiller's three corps totalled 75,880 troops,<ref name=\"Arnold, p 235\"/> but after detachments, the left wing numbered only 42,000.<ref name=Petre139/>\n\n===French deployment===\n[[Image:Siegenburg Kupferstich Wening 1700.jpeg|left|thumb|300px|alt=Siegenburg from a c. 1700 woodcut|Siegenburg from a c. 1700 woodcut]]\nWhen Lannes arrived at the front, Napoleon immediately placed him in command of a provisional corps. This ad hoc formation consisted largely of III Corps units that escaped Archduke Charles' trap the day before, namely General of Division [[Charles Antoine Morand]]'s 1st Division, General of Division [[Charles-\u00c9tienne Gudin de La Sablonni\u00e8re]]'s 3rd Division, General of Division [[Raymond-Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice]]'s 2nd Heavy Cavalry Division, and [[General of Brigade]] Charles Claude Jacquinot's light cavalry brigade of Montbrun's division. Also added was General of Division [[Etienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty]]'s 1st Heavy Cavalry Division from the cavalry reserve.<ref name=Arnold110>Arnold, p 110</ref> One of Saint-Sulpice's brigades was detailed to guard [[Saal an der Donau]], a defile between Lannes and Davout.<ref>Petre, p 133n</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 20 April, Napoleon mistakenly assumed that the bulk of Archduke Charles' army lay in front of him. Accordingly, he gave orders for a drive southeast in the direction of Landshut. Lannes' mission was to turn the Austrian right flank by pushing south toward Rohr. General of Division [[Dominique Vandamme]] would attack Siegenburg with his small Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg corps. Lefebvre's other VII Corps divisions, together with General of Division Joseph Laurent Demont's Reserve Division of the III Corps, would link Lannes and Vandamme. Napoleon ordered Mass\u00e9na's IV Corps to capture Landshut and the Isar River crossings, cutting the Austrian line of communications.<ref>Arnold, pp 104\u2013105</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n===Abensberg===\nArchduke Charles sent orders to his brother Archduke Louis at 7:30 AM on 20 April. He instructed Louis to fall back to Rottenburg and defend behind the Gro\u00dfe Laber. Charles intended Hiller to take position on Louis' left at [[Pfeffenhausen]]. Charles erred in sending the orders so late and in not informing Louis of Hohenzollern's withdrawal to the east. The latter move left the V Armeekorps' right flank exposed.<ref name=Arnold104/>\n\nPfanzelter held Bachl on the extreme right flank. To the west of Bachl, Thierry held Offenstetten with three and one-third battalions. His other two and two-thirds battalions had become separated the previous day and joined General-Major [[Frederick Bianchi, Duke of Casalanza]] who had six battalions near Biburg. Louis posted Schustekh with four squadrons of hussars and one and one-third battalions at Rohr.<ref>Petre, p 134</ref> Schustekh's infantry had just rejoined V Armeekorps after marching from Mainburg with General-Major [[Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Fels\u00f6-Kubiny]]'s detachment.<ref>Petre, p 136</ref>\n\n[[Image:Battle of Abensberg 1809.JPG|left|thumb|400px|alt=Battle of Abensberg map showing Lannes breakthrough at Bachl and Rohr|Battle of Abensberg map showing Lannes breakthrough at Bachl and Rohr]]\nIn one account, Lannes' advance guard approached Bachl in the late morning of 20 April, forcing Pfanzelter\u2019s small detachment from the Austrian III Armeekorps eastward. The 1st Bavarian Division under Lieutenant General [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria]] and the 3rd Bavarian Division led by Lieutenant General [[Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy]], together with Demont\u2019s III Corps Division advanced on Offenstetten. Around 10:00 AM, they defeated Thierry\u2019s brigade, forcing him back on Bachl as Lannes approached from the north. Thierry hastily withdrew to Rohr, which he reached at 2:00 PM.<ref>Castle, p 41</ref>\n\nHistorian James R. Arnold offers a different narrative. He writes that Pfanzelter's command was withdrawn on the III Armeekorps commander Hohenzollern's orders, leaving the north-south road through Bachl wide open. Meanwhile, Thierry's attached dragoons discovered that Abensberg and its nearby roads were alive with moving columns of enemy troops. Around 8:00 AM, Thierry fell back on Bachl and found to his dismay that French cavalry already occupied the village. Having become separated from his supporting dragoons, Thierry's men were chased into the woods by Jacquinot's horsemen. From there the Austrians hiked cross-country toward Rohr.<ref name=\"Arnold110\"/>\n\nAuthor [[Francis Loraine Petre]] states that Gudin encountered Pfanzelter north of Bachl and brushed him aside about 9:00 AM. The 1st Bavarian division and General-Major H\u00fcgel's W\u00fcrttemberg brigade drove Thierry from Offenstetten around 10:00 AM. When the Austrians reached Bachl they stumbled upon Jacquinot who attacked and they \"scattered through the woods\".<ref>Petre, pp 134\u2013135</ref> Pfanzelter marched east to [[Langquaid]] where he rejoined Hohenzollern's corps.\n\nBecause he feared that the woods to his left might contain Austrians, Lannes slowed his march so he could scout the terrain to the east. Even so, his column arrived at Rohr before Thierry's infantry. Without Pfanzelter's detachment to warn him, the arrival of Lannes' column surprised Schustekh. The Austrian commander gamely threw four squadrons of hussars at Jacquinot's advance guard. Eventually, Jacquinot got his entire brigade into action and pressed the Austrian hussars back on the supporting battalion and one-third of [[Grenz infantry]] south of Rohr. At this time, Thierry's winded infantry appeared on the scene. With the help of Gudin's 17th Light Infantry and a battery of artillery, Jacquinot's chasseurs broke Thierry's foot soldiers and hounded them into the woods again.<ref>Arnold, pp 110\u2013111</ref>\n\n[[Image:Napoleon Cuirassier in 1809 by Bellange.jpg|right|thumb|150px|alt=French Cuirassier in 1809|French Cuirassier in 1809]]\nTo take the pressure off the infantry, Schustekh charged again, just as Thierry's lost dragoons showed up. At first, the attack went well, but then the Austrian horsemen came up against a mass of cuirassiers. The result was a rout of the Habsburg cavalry, who rode through the ranks of their own foot soldiers. The French chasseurs and cuirassiers rode roughshod over the troops of Thierry and Mesko, cutting down the fugitives. Over 3,000 Austrians became prisoners, including Thierry, and four cannon were lost.<ref>Arnold, pp 111\u2013112</ref>\n\nThe previous evening, Hiller's VI Armeekorps bivouacked at Mainburg. Though a road ran directly from Mainburg to Louis' left flank at Siegenburg, a distance of only 13 kilometers, Hiller elected to join his colleague by a roundabout march via Pfeffenhausen. Once he arrived, Hiller was authorized to take command of all three left wing corps.<ref>Arnold, p 108</ref> Hiller personally arrived in Siegenburg to confer with Archduke Louis around midday. Hearing troubling reports from the right flank, he sent Feldmarschall-Leutnant [[Karl von Vincent]] toward [[Rottenburg an der Laaber|Rottenburg]] with the line brigades of Generals-Major Josef Hoffmeister and Nikolaus Weissenwolf, plus four squadrons of the ''Rosenberg'' Chevauxlegers Regiment # 6.<ref>Arnold, p 112</ref><ref>Petre, p 137. Petre names the two line infantry brigade commanders.</ref>\n\nArchduke Louis posted Prince Reuss and General-Major [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]] with four battalions and 12 cavalry squadrons at Siegenburg. Bianchi held the east bank of the Abens opposite Biburg. Lieutenant-General [[Karl Philipp von Wrede]] probed at Siegenburg but his 2nd Bavarian Division was easily fended off by Radetzky and a battery of 12-pdr cannon. At this time, Louis heard that the French attacked Thierry, so he ordered Radetzky to send two battalions to the right flank and called up Kienmayer's command from Ludmannsdorf.<ref>Arnold, pp 107\u2013108</ref>\n\nWrede moved north to Biburg, where he tried to get across the Abens again. At first he was not successful, but Bianchi withdrew to [[Kirchdorf, Lower Bavaria|Kirchdorf]], allowing the 2nd Bavarian Division to cross to the east bank of the stream. Meanwhile, General of Division [[Dominique Vandamme]]'s W\u00fcrttemberg contingent (later known as the VIII Corps) replaced Wrede in front of Siegenburg. Vandamme soon realized that crossing at Siegenburg was futile, so he too marched north, crossed the river at Abensberg and moved south to Kirchdorf. Here the Bavarians and W\u00fcrttembergers found Bianchi with his reinforced brigade and a cavalry squadron.<ref>Arnold, pp 114\u2013115</ref> Reuss soon arrived with Radetzky's two battalions.<ref name=Petre138>Petre, p 138</ref> Around 2:00 PM a sharp combat took place after which the Austrians retreated to the southeast.<ref>Arnold, p 115</ref> According to one account, General of Division [[Jean Victor Tharreau]]'s cavalry of the II Corps also became involved at Kirchdorf.<ref name=Castle46>Castle, p 46</ref>\n\nPressed by Wrede's 7th Bavarian Infantry Regiment, plus two of H\u00fcgel's W\u00fcrttemberg battalions,<ref name=Petre138/> Radetzky conducted an orderly retreat on the Siegenburg road, covered by the grenzers and Kienmayer's grenadiers under General-Major [[Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspr\u00e9]]. He managed to shepherd the V Armeekorps trains safely through Pfeffenhausen before the Bavarians cut him off. Wrede pursued aggressively and scooped up many prisoners but failed to capture the bridge, which the Austrians burned.<ref>Arnold, p 116</ref> Even so, the Bavarians kept up the pressure, crossing the shallow Gro\u00dfe Laber at 11:00 PM to attack. Radetzky fell back to a hill called the Hornbach where his rear guard skirmished with the Bavarians into the early morning hours.<ref>Arnold, p 137</ref>\n\nWhen Vincent's column neared Rottenburg, he found the road jammed with the III Armeekorps trains. A charge by the ''Rosenberg'' Chevauxlegers halted the French cuirassiers long enough for his infantry to gain solid positions on the east side of the Gro\u00dfe Laber. Hiller arrived at Rottenburg in the late afternoon and ordered a counterattack at 7:00 PM. Vincent swung his left brigade forward and quickly overran a Bavarian unit, capturing 300 troops. Soon after, the ''Deutschmeister'' Infantry Regiment # 4 got into a vicious firefight with Bavarian and French infantry. In the twilight, the Austrians were forced back by superior numbers with 600 casualties, but they had finally stopped their enemies.<ref>Arnold, pp 113\u2013114</ref>\n\n===Regensburg===\n[[Image:Johann Josef I von Liechtenstein.jpg|right|thumb|120px|alt=Prince Johann Liechtenstein secured the surrender of Regensburg.|Prince Liechtenstein]]\nOn 20 April, the Austrian II Armeekorps continued attacking Colonel Louis Coutard's 65th Line Infantry Regiment at Regensburg. A French convoy sent to replenish the critically low ammunition supply was ambushed by Austrian cavalry at 8:00 AM.<ref>Arnold, pp 119\u2013120</ref> The French troops finally ran out of ammunition and Coutard asked Kollowrat for a 24-hour truce after which he promised to surrender if not relieved. The Austrian commander foolishly agreed to the terms.<ref name=Arnold119>Arnold, p 119</ref>\n\nHowever, Liechtenstein's column soon appeared from the south. Liechtenstein pointed out that the existing truce did not apply to him and demanded an immediate surrender. Coutard thereupon capitulated at 5:00 PM.<ref name=Arnold119/> The French sappers had found it impossible to demolish the sturdily-built Regensburg bridge. The intact bridge later played a key factor in the escape of Charles' army.<ref>Arnold, p 100</ref> In two days of fighting, the French lost 11 officers and about 200 soldiers killed and wounded, plus 1,988 captured. Austrian losses were 73 dead, 220 wounded, and 85 missing for a total of 378 casualties. During the struggle the French captured 75 troops and one color, all of which were recovered.<ref>Smith, pp 288\u2013289</ref>\n\nWhen Kollowrat finally reported the II Armeekorps available for duty that evening, the headquarters ordered his troops to make an overnight march west to [[Hemau]] on the north bank of the Danube. In the morning, the tired troops were recalled to Regensburg from their pointless ramble.<ref>Arnold, p 125</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nArnold lists 1,107 Allied casualties, including 746 Bavarians. He gives Austrian losses as 492 killed, 2,219 wounded, and nearly 4,000 captured, or a total of 6,711. The French also captured eight colors and 12 cannons.<ref name=Arnold120/> [[Digby Smith]] notes Allied casualties as 34 dead and 438 wounded, but this seems to count only the German allied troops. Austrian total losses are given as 6,872, including 3,000 to 4,000 captured. The 2nd battalion of the ''Broder'' Grenz (Mesko's brigade) was annihilated, with 18 officers and 1,040 rank and file counted as lost.<ref>Smith, p 290. Smith gives killed, wounded, captured, and missing, but the numbers only add up to 5,824 so they are not listed.</ref> Petre lists 2,710 Austrians killed and wounded, plus about 4,000 captured. Altogether, the 42,000 troops of Hiller's three-corps left wing faced 55,000 French and their German allies. Only about 25,000 Austrians and an equal number of Allies were engaged in action.<ref name=Petre139/>\n\n[[Image:Louis-Nicolas Davout.jpg|left|thumb|110px|alt=Louis Davout's outnumbered force was not disturbed by Austrians on 20 April.|Davout was not disturbed on 20 April.]]\nThat evening, as the extent of Thierry and Schustekh's disaster became known, Hiller resolved to pull his three corps behind the Isar at Landshut. In this decision, he was also influenced by Mass\u00e9na's move against his left rear and unfavorable reports from Archduke Louis. This crucial decision meant that the Austrian left wing would in the near future operate independently from Archduke Charles' main body. Hiller would only reunite with his army commander on 15 May north of [[Vienna]].<ref>Arnold, pp 116\u2013117</ref>\n\nWhile Napoleon savaged his left wing, Archduke Charles remained amazingly inert.<ref name=Arnold118>Arnold, p 118</ref> At 6:00 AM, the archduke was with Prince Rosenberg and at 7:30 AM he sent orders to Archduke Louis and then wrote a letter to Emperor [[Francis I of Austria]]. But from 11:00 AM until 6:30 PM, the Austrian generalissimo failed to issue any orders. He either became obsessed with capturing Regensburg or he had an [[Epilepsy|epileptic seizure]] during which he is supposed to have locked himself in his quarters.<ref>Petre, pp 143\u2013144</ref> The epileptic attack is probable, but there is a possibility it may be a cover story for Charles' failure to exercise command.<ref>Arnold, p 213</ref> What is known is that the Austrian III, IV, and I Reserve Armeekorps did not disturb Davout's remaining three divisions under Generals of Division [[Louis Friant]], Saint-Hilaire, and Montbrun on 20 April.<ref name=Arnold118/>\n\nDespite being outnumbered, Napoleon's 113,000 troops split the 161,000 strung-out Austrians into two forces. Charles five corps, including 48,000 additional troops of the I and II Armeekorps north of Regensburg, lay to the north while Hiller's three corps fell back to Landshut. (Massena and Oudinot's 57,000 soldiers are not counted in Napoleon's total.)<ref>Chandler ''Campaigns'', p 685 map</ref> Both Austrian forces had to fight a second major battle each.

As the day wore on, Feldmarschall-Leutnant [[Johann von Hiller]] arrived with reinforcements to take command of the three corps that formed the Austrian left wing. The action ended in a complete Franco-German victory. The battlefield was southeast of [[Abensberg]] and included clashes at Offenstetten, [[Biburg]]-[[Siegenburg]], [[Rohr in Niederbayern]], and [[Rottenburg an der Laaber]]. On the same day, the French garrison of [[Regensburg]] capitulated.\n\nAfter [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Louis-Nicolas Davout]]'s hard-fought victory  at [[Battle of Teugen-Hausen]] the previous day, Napoleon determined to break through the Austrian defenses behind the [[Abens|Abens River]]. The emperor assembled a provisional corps consisting of part of Davout's corps plus cavalry and gave Marshal [[Jean Lannes]] command over it. Napoleon directed his German allies from the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] and the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] to attack across the Abens from the west, while Lannes thrust from the north toward Rohr.\n\nWhile the Austrians initially held the river line, Lannes' strike force crashed through Louis' defenses farther east. On the left, the Austrians managed to conduct a capable rear guard action, but during the day the French smashed their opponents' right flank and captured thousands of soldiers. The day ended with the Austrians barely holding onto a line behind the [[Gro\u00dfe Laber]] River.\n\nThe next day, Hiller withdrew to [[Landshut]], separating the left wing from the main army under [[Generalissimo]] [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen]] near [[Regensburg]] (Ratisbon).\n\nThe French surrender of Regensburg on 20 April allowed Charles' army a retreat route to the north bank of the Danube. The [[Battle of Landshut (1809)|Battle of Landshut]] was fought on 21 April.\n\n==Background==\n===Operations===\nArchduke Charles stole a march on Napoleon when his army invaded the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] on 10 April 1809. Even though the Austrian army took six days to slowly march from the [[Inn (river)|Inn River]] at the frontier to the [[Isar|Isar River]], the move placed the army of France and their German allies in grave danger.<ref>Chandler ''Campaigns'', p 677</ref> Napoleon's deputy commander, Marshal [[Louis Alexandre Berthier]] mismanaged the [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'s concentration, leaving its units scattered across a broad front in a confused state.<ref>Chandler ''Campaigns'', p 678-679</ref>\n\n[[Image:Archdukecharles1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|alt=Archduke Charles missed a chance to crush Marshal Davout.|Archduke Charles]]\nThe central mass of Archduke Charles' 209,600-man host<ref>Bowden & Tarbox, p 73</ref> crossed the Isar at [[Landshut]] on 16 April, but the next day Emperor Napoleon arrived at the front from [[Paris]]. Desperately trying to wrest the initiative back from the archduke, Napoleon consolidated his forces and ordered Marshal [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]]'s IV Corps and General of Division [[Nicolas Oudinot]]'s II Corps on the right flank to march on Landshut to cut the Austrian line of communications. He planned for Marshal [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Lefebvre]]'s Bavarian VII Corps to hold in the center at Abensberg while Davout's left flank III Corps withdrew west to escape being trapped between Charles' main body and the [[Danube]].<ref>Chandler ''Campaigns'', pp 682\u2013683</ref>\n\nOn 19 April, Charles realized he had an opportunity to destroy Davout. He launched 65,000 troops in three powerful columns northwest as Davout attempted a flank march across his front. Luckily for the French, General of Cavalry [[Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein]]'s 20,000 troops found no opposition on the Austrian right.<ref>Arnold, pp 83\u201384</ref> In the center, [[General of Division]] [[Louis-Pierre Montbrun]]'s 3,800 cavalry and infantry skilfully held off Feldmarschall-Leutnant [[Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini]]'s much stronger IV Armeekorps for most of the day.<ref>Arnold, p 90</ref>\n\nOn the left flank, Feldmarschall-Leutnant [[Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen]]'s III Armeekorps crashed into General of Division [[Louis Vincent Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire]]'s division and a terrific fight blazed up. Both sides fed in reinforcements as the infantry battled over a pair of parallel ridges in the [[Battle of Teugen-Hausen]]. Ultimately, Davout brought superior forces to bear in the late afternoon and pushed back the Austrians a short ways. That night, Charles ordered Hohenzollern to withdraw a little to the east, closer to his main body.<ref>Arnold, pp 85\u201393</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 19 April, Archduke Charles requested that Hohenzollern provide a link between the III and V Armeekorps. Accordingly, the III Armeekorps commander detached General-Major Ludwig Thierry's 6,000-man infantry brigade to his left. As an additional link between Thierry and III Armeekorps, Hohenzollern detached General-Major Joseph Freiherr von Pfanzelter with a [[Grenz infantry]] battalion and two squadrons of hussars, about 1,000 men.<ref>Arnold, p 84</ref> While the Battle of Teugen-Hausen raged, Thierry clashed with Bavarian troops near Arnhofen and fell back to Offenstetten.<ref>Smith, p 289</ref>\n\n===Austrian deployment===\n[[Image:Johann Kolowrat.jpg|right|thumb|120px|alt=Johann Kollowrat's II Armeekorps attacked Regensburg.|Johann Kollowrat]]\nOn 20 April, Archduke Charles' main body consisted of the III, IV, and I Reserve Armeekorps.

This ad hoc formation consisted largely of III Corps units that escaped Archduke Charles' trap the day before, namely General of Division [[Charles Antoine Morand]]'s 1st Division, General of Division [[Charles-\u00c9tienne Gudin de La Sablonni\u00e8re]]'s 3rd Division, General of Division [[Raymond-Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice]]'s 2nd Heavy Cavalry Division, and [[General of Brigade]] Charles Claude Jacquinot's light cavalry brigade of Montbrun's division. Also added was General of Division [[Etienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty]]'s 1st Heavy Cavalry Division from the cavalry reserve.<ref name=Arnold110>Arnold, p 110</ref> One of Saint-Sulpice's brigades was detailed to guard [[Saal an der Donau]], a defile between Lannes and Davout.<ref>Petre, p 133n</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 20 April, Napoleon mistakenly assumed that the bulk of Archduke Charles' army lay in front of him. Accordingly, he gave orders for a drive southeast in the direction of Landshut. Lannes' mission was to turn the Austrian right flank by pushing south toward Rohr. General of Division [[Dominique Vandamme]] would attack Siegenburg with his small Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg corps. Lefebvre's other VII Corps divisions, together with General of Division Joseph Laurent Demont's Reserve Division of the III Corps, would link Lannes and Vandamme. Napoleon ordered Mass\u00e9na's IV Corps to capture Landshut and the Isar River crossings, cutting the Austrian line of communications.<ref>Arnold, pp 104\u2013105</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n===Abensberg===\nArchduke Charles sent orders to his brother Archduke Louis at 7:30 AM on 20 April. He instructed Louis to fall back to Rottenburg and defend behind the Gro\u00dfe Laber. Charles intended Hiller to take position on Louis' left at [[Pfeffenhausen]]. Charles erred in sending the orders so late and in not informing Louis of Hohenzollern's withdrawal to the east. The latter move left the V Armeekorps' right flank exposed.<ref name=Arnold104/>\n\nPfanzelter held Bachl on the extreme right flank. To the west of Bachl, Thierry held Offenstetten with three and one-third battalions. His other two and two-thirds battalions had become separated the previous day and joined General-Major [[Frederick Bianchi, Duke of Casalanza]] who had six battalions near Biburg. Louis posted Schustekh with four squadrons of hussars and one and one-third battalions at Rohr.<ref>Petre, p 134</ref> Schustekh's infantry had just rejoined V Armeekorps after marching from Mainburg with General-Major [[Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Fels\u00f6-Kubiny]]'s detachment.<ref>Petre, p 136</ref>\n\n[[Image:Battle of Abensberg 1809.JPG|left|thumb|400px|alt=Battle of Abensberg map showing Lannes breakthrough at Bachl and Rohr|Battle of Abensberg map showing Lannes breakthrough at Bachl and Rohr]]\nIn one account, Lannes' advance guard approached Bachl in the late morning of 20 April, forcing Pfanzelter\u2019s small detachment from the Austrian III Armeekorps eastward. The 1st Bavarian Division under Lieutenant General [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria]] and the 3rd Bavarian Division led by Lieutenant General [[Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy]], together with Demont\u2019s III Corps Division advanced on Offenstetten. Around 10:00 AM, they defeated Thierry\u2019s brigade, forcing him back on Bachl as Lannes approached from the north. Thierry hastily withdrew to Rohr, which he reached at 2:00 PM.<ref>Castle, p 41</ref>\n\nHistorian James R. Arnold offers a different narrative. He writes that Pfanzelter's command was withdrawn on the III Armeekorps commander Hohenzollern's orders, leaving the north-south road through Bachl wide open. Meanwhile, Thierry's attached dragoons discovered that Abensberg and its nearby roads were alive with moving columns of enemy troops. Around 8:00 AM, Thierry fell back on Bachl and found to his dismay that French cavalry already occupied the village. Having become separated from his supporting dragoons, Thierry's men were chased into the woods by Jacquinot's horsemen. From there the Austrians hiked cross-country toward Rohr.<ref name=\"Arnold110\"/>\n\nAuthor [[Francis Loraine Petre]] states that Gudin encountered Pfanzelter north of Bachl and brushed him aside about 9:00 AM. The 1st Bavarian division and General-Major H\u00fcgel's W\u00fcrttemberg brigade drove Thierry from Offenstetten around 10:00 AM. When the Austrians reached Bachl they stumbled upon Jacquinot who attacked and they \"scattered through the woods\".<ref>Petre, pp 134\u2013135</ref> Pfanzelter marched east to [[Langquaid]] where he rejoined Hohenzollern's corps.\n\nBecause he feared that the woods to his left might contain Austrians, Lannes slowed his march so he could scout the terrain to the east. Even so, his column arrived at Rohr before Thierry's infantry. Without Pfanzelter's detachment to warn him, the arrival of Lannes' column surprised Schustekh. The Austrian commander gamely threw four squadrons of hussars at Jacquinot's advance guard. Eventually, Jacquinot got his entire brigade into action and pressed the Austrian hussars back on the supporting battalion and one-third of [[Grenz infantry]] south of Rohr. At this time, Thierry's winded infantry appeared on the scene. With the help of Gudin's 17th Light Infantry and a battery of artillery, Jacquinot's chasseurs broke Thierry's foot soldiers and hounded them into the woods again.<ref>Arnold, pp 110\u2013111</ref>\n\n[[Image:Napoleon Cuirassier in 1809 by Bellange.jpg|right|thumb|150px|alt=French Cuirassier in 1809|French Cuirassier in 1809]]\nTo take the pressure off the infantry, Schustekh charged again, just as Thierry's lost dragoons showed up. At first, the attack went well, but then the Austrian horsemen came up against a mass of cuirassiers. The result was a rout of the Habsburg cavalry, who rode through the ranks of their own foot soldiers. The French chasseurs and cuirassiers rode roughshod over the troops of Thierry and Mesko, cutting down the fugitives. Over 3,000 Austrians became prisoners, including Thierry, and four cannon were lost.<ref>Arnold, pp 111\u2013112</ref>\n\nThe previous evening, Hiller's VI Armeekorps bivouacked at Mainburg. Though a road ran directly from Mainburg to Louis' left flank at Siegenburg, a distance of only 13 kilometers, Hiller elected to join his colleague by a roundabout march via Pfeffenhausen. Once he arrived, Hiller was authorized to take command of all three left wing corps.<ref>Arnold, p 108</ref> Hiller personally arrived in Siegenburg to confer with Archduke Louis around midday. Hearing troubling reports from the right flank, he sent Feldmarschall-Leutnant [[Karl von Vincent]] toward [[Rottenburg an der Laaber|Rottenburg]] with the line brigades of Generals-Major Josef Hoffmeister and Nikolaus Weissenwolf, plus four squadrons of the ''Rosenberg'' Chevauxlegers Regiment # 6.<ref>Arnold, p 112</ref><ref>Petre, p 137. Petre names the two line infantry brigade commanders.</ref>\n\nArchduke Louis posted Prince Reuss and General-Major [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]] with four battalions and 12 cavalry squadrons at Siegenburg. Bianchi held the east bank of the Abens opposite Biburg. Lieutenant-General [[Karl Philipp von Wrede]] probed at Siegenburg but his 2nd Bavarian Division was easily fended off by Radetzky and a battery of 12-pdr cannon. At this time, Louis heard that the French attacked Thierry, so he ordered Radetzky to send two battalions to the right flank and called up Kienmayer's command from Ludmannsdorf.<ref>Arnold, pp 107\u2013108</ref>\n\nWrede moved north to Biburg, where he tried to get across the Abens again. At first he was not successful, but Bianchi withdrew to [[Kirchdorf, Lower Bavaria|Kirchdorf]], allowing the 2nd Bavarian Division to cross to the east bank of the stream. Meanwhile, General of Division [[Dominique Vandamme]]'s W\u00fcrttemberg contingent (later known as the VIII Corps) replaced Wrede in front of Siegenburg. Vandamme soon realized that crossing at Siegenburg was futile, so he too marched north, crossed the river at Abensberg and moved south to Kirchdorf. Here the Bavarians and W\u00fcrttembergers found Bianchi with his reinforced brigade and a cavalry squadron.<ref>Arnold, pp 114\u2013115</ref> Reuss soon arrived with Radetzky's two battalions.<ref name=Petre138>Petre, p 138</ref> Around 2:00 PM a sharp combat took place after which the Austrians retreated to the southeast.<ref>Arnold, p 115</ref> According to one account, General of Division [[Jean Victor Tharreau]]'s cavalry of the II Corps also became involved at Kirchdorf.<ref name=Castle46>Castle, p 46</ref>\n\nPressed by Wrede's 7th Bavarian Infantry Regiment, plus two of H\u00fcgel's W\u00fcrttemberg battalions,<ref name=Petre138/> Radetzky conducted an orderly retreat on the Siegenburg road, covered by the grenzers and Kienmayer's grenadiers under General-Major [[Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspr\u00e9]]. He managed to shepherd the V Armeekorps trains safely through Pfeffenhausen before the Bavarians cut him off. Wrede pursued aggressively and scooped up many prisoners but failed to capture the bridge, which the Austrians burned.<ref>Arnold, p 116</ref> Even so, the Bavarians kept up the pressure, crossing the shallow Gro\u00dfe Laber at 11:00 PM to attack. Radetzky fell back to a hill called the Hornbach where his rear guard skirmished with the Bavarians into the early morning hours.<ref>Arnold, p 137</ref>\n\nWhen Vincent's column neared Rottenburg, he found the road jammed with the III Armeekorps trains. A charge by the ''Rosenberg'' Chevauxlegers halted the French cuirassiers long enough for his infantry to gain solid positions on the east side of the Gro\u00dfe Laber. Hiller arrived at Rottenburg in the late afternoon and ordered a counterattack at 7:00 PM. Vincent swung his left brigade forward and quickly overran a Bavarian unit, capturing 300 troops. Soon after, the ''Deutschmeister'' Infantry Regiment # 4 got into a vicious firefight with Bavarian and French infantry. In the twilight, the Austrians were forced back by superior numbers with 600 casualties, but they had finally stopped their enemies.<ref>Arnold, pp 113\u2013114</ref>\n\n===Regensburg===\n[[Image:Johann Josef I von Liechtenstein.jpg|right|thumb|120px|alt=Prince Johann Liechtenstein secured the surrender of Regensburg.|Prince Liechtenstein]]\nOn 20 April, the Austrian II Armeekorps continued attacking Colonel Louis Coutard's 65th Line Infantry Regiment at Regensburg. A French convoy sent to replenish the critically low ammunition supply was ambushed by Austrian cavalry at 8:00 AM.<ref>Arnold, pp 119\u2013120</ref> The French troops finally ran out of ammunition and Coutard asked Kollowrat for a 24-hour truce after which he promised to surrender if not relieved. The Austrian commander foolishly agreed to the terms.<ref name=Arnold119>Arnold, p 119</ref>\n\nHowever, Liechtenstein's column soon appeared from the south. Liechtenstein pointed out that the existing truce did not apply to him and demanded an immediate surrender. Coutard thereupon capitulated at 5:00 PM.<ref name=Arnold119/> The French sappers had found it impossible to demolish the sturdily-built Regensburg bridge. The intact bridge later played a key factor in the escape of Charles' army.<ref>Arnold, p 100</ref> In two days of fighting, the French lost 11 officers and about 200 soldiers killed and wounded, plus 1,988 captured. Austrian losses were 73 dead, 220 wounded, and 85 missing for a total of 378 casualties. During the struggle the French captured 75 troops and one color, all of which were recovered.<ref>Smith, pp 288\u2013289</ref>\n\nWhen Kollowrat finally reported the II Armeekorps available for duty that evening, the headquarters ordered his troops to make an overnight march west to [[Hemau]] on the north bank of the Danube. In the morning, the tired troops were recalled to Regensburg from their pointless ramble.<ref>Arnold, p 125</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nArnold lists 1,107 Allied casualties, including 746 Bavarians. He gives Austrian losses as 492 killed, 2,219 wounded, and nearly 4,000 captured, or a total of 6,711. The French also captured eight colors and 12 cannons.<ref name=Arnold120/> [[Digby Smith]] notes Allied casualties as 34 dead and 438 wounded, but this seems to count only the German allied troops. Austrian total losses are given as 6,872, including 3,000 to 4,000 captured. The 2nd battalion of the ''Broder'' Grenz (Mesko's brigade) was annihilated, with 18 officers and 1,040 rank and file counted as lost.<ref>Smith, p 290. Smith gives killed, wounded, captured, and missing, but the numbers only add up to 5,824 so they are not listed.</ref> Petre lists 2,710 Austrians killed and wounded, plus about 4,000 captured. Altogether, the 42,000 troops of Hiller's three-corps left wing faced 55,000 French and their German allies. Only about 25,000 Austrians and an equal number of Allies were engaged in action.<ref name=Petre139/>\n\n[[Image:Louis-Nicolas Davout.jpg|left|thumb|110px|alt=Louis Davout's outnumbered force was not disturbed by Austrians on 20 April.|Davout was not disturbed on 20 April.]]\nThat evening, as the extent of Thierry and Schustekh's disaster became known, Hiller resolved to pull his three corps behind the Isar at Landshut. In this decision, he was also influenced by Mass\u00e9na's move against his left rear and unfavorable reports from Archduke Louis. This crucial decision meant that the Austrian left wing would in the near future operate independently from Archduke Charles' main body. Hiller would only reunite with his army commander on 15 May north of [[Vienna]].<ref>Arnold, pp 116\u2013117</ref>\n\nWhile Napoleon savaged his left wing, Archduke Charles remained amazingly inert.<ref name=Arnold118>Arnold, p 118</ref> At 6:00 AM, the archduke was with Prince Rosenberg and at 7:30 AM he sent orders to Archduke Louis and then wrote a letter to Emperor [[Francis I of Austria]]. But from 11:00 AM until 6:30 PM, the Austrian generalissimo failed to issue any orders. He either became obsessed with capturing Regensburg or he had an [[Epilepsy|epileptic seizure]] during which he is supposed to have locked himself in his quarters.<ref>Petre, pp 143\u2013144</ref> The epileptic attack is probable, but there is a possibility it may be a cover story for Charles' failure to exercise command.<ref>Arnold, p 213</ref> What is known is that the Austrian III, IV, and I Reserve Armeekorps did not disturb Davout's remaining three divisions under Generals of Division [[Louis Friant]], Saint-Hilaire, and Montbrun on 20 April.<ref name=Arnold118/>\n\nDespite being outnumbered, Napoleon's 113,000 troops split the 161,000 strung-out Austrians into two forces. Charles five corps, including 48,000 additional troops of the I and II Armeekorps north of Regensburg, lay to the north while Hiller's three corps fell back to Landshut. (Massena and Oudinot's 57,000 soldiers are not counted in Napoleon's total.)<ref>Chandler ''Campaigns'', p 685 map</ref> Both Austrian forces had to fight a second major battle each. Hiller fought the [[Battle of Landshut (1809)|Battle of Landshut]] on 21 April, while Charles engaged in the [[Battle of Eckm\u00fchl]] on the 22nd.<ref>Smith, pp 290\u2013291</ref>\n\n==Order of battle==\n''The following is an abbreviated order of battle.
