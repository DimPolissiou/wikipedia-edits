After a notable performance at the [[FIFA U-17 World Cup|U-17 World Championships]] he was signed by Dutch [[Eredivisie]] [[AFC Ajax]] in 1993 for an undisclosed fee. He made his Ajax debut that year and went on to score 25 goals in 54 appearances. Kanu also came on as a sub in Ajax's 1995 [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] final win over [[A.C. Milan]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Inter===\nIn 1996, Ajax sold Kanu to [[Serie A]] side [[Inter Milan]] for around $4.7 million. That summer he captained the [[Nigeria national football team|Nigerian team]] that won gold at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympics]], and scored two late goals in the semi-finals against powerhouses Brazil to overturn a 2\u20133 scoreline into a 4\u20133 win in extra time.

In interviews, Kanu frequently cites his faith as a Christian,<ref>{{Cite news| last = Wilson| first = Jeremy| title = Portsmouth thrive on power of prayer and goals from born-again Kanu| url = http://football.guardian.co.uk/Match_Report/0,,1934705,00.html| publisher = The Guardian| date = 30 October 2006| accessdate = 11 March 2008}}</ref> and has often mentioned this trying time of his career as an occasion when he prayed to God. Kanu's experience also led to his founding the Kanu Heart Foundation, an organisation that helps predominantly young African children who suffer heart defects and whose work was expanded to provide aid for homeless children in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last=Okeleji |first=Oluwashina |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/7485713.stm |title=Kanu to tackle homeless problem |website=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Arsenal===\nIn February 1999, after just twelve games and one goal for Inter, Kanu was signed by Arsenal for approximately \u00a34.15 million. He made his debut for Arsenal, against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[FA Cup]]. With the score 1\u20131 and ten minutes to go, the Sheffield United goalkeeper [[Alan Kelly, Jr.|Alan Kelly]] kicked the ball out of touch so that treatment could be given to [[Lee Morris (footballer)|Lee Morris]]. When the ball was thrown back into play by [[Ray Parlour]], although it was intended for Kelly, Kanu chased the throw-in down the right wing unchallenged and centered the ball for [[Marc Overmars]], who scored to make the match 2\u20131. After the match, Arsenal manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] accepted that it was not correct sportsmanship and offered to re-play the match<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HfxOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xhQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5223,4037100&dq=arsenal+sheffield+fa+cup&hl=en |title=Sport-wise it's not right |publisher=New Straits Times |date=15 February 1999 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> which was again won by Arsenal.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shaw |first=Phil |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-overmars-seals-action-replay-1072977.html |title=Football: Overmars seals action replay \u2013 Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=24 February 1999 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite the events overshadowing his debut, Kanu's career was quickly revived at Arsenal.

In the [[1999\u20132000 FA Premier League|1999\u20132000 season]] he scored 17 times in 50 matches for the Gunners, including a hat-trick in fifteen minutes against Chelsea to turn a 2\u20130 deficit into a 3\u20132 victory.

He played 197 games for Arsenal, scoring 44 goals. In the summer of 2004, after his contract with Arsenal ended, he moved to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on a free transfer. In 2008, Kanu was voted 13th in the \"Gunners' Greatest 50 Players\" poll.<ref name=\"greatest50\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-13.-kanu|title=Gunners' Greatest Players \u2013 13.

The game was tied 1\u20131 when Kanu scored the winning goal, making him the third person to score in the stadium.

Kanu started as a regular for the club, making his debut in a 1\u20131 draw away at Blackburn Rovers on 14 August 2004. He scored his first goal for Albion on 18 September 2004, an 88th-minute equalizer in a 1\u20131 home draw against Fulham. In a match against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 14 November 2004, Kanu was guilty of an incredible miss in injury time, with Albion 2\u20131 down. Kanu had sent a low cross over the bar from a yard away from the goal line. Manager [[Bryan Robson]] was seen in TV footage mouthing the words \"How did he miss that?\", and Kanu's howler was crowned \"Miss of the Season\" by many media outlets in their end-of-season reviews. Nevertheless, the [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] season was ultimately a memorable one for West Brom, as they became the first club to avoid relegation from the Premier League after being bottom of the table at Christmas.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOne of the most memorable games of the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] season for Kanu came with the visit of his former club Arsenal to [[The Hawthorns]] on 15 October 2005. [[Philippe Senderos]] put the visitors ahead in the 17th minute, but Kanu equalised shortly before half time. West Brom went on to win the match 2\u20131 with a spectacular strike from [[Darren Carter]].

Kanu made his debut for Portsmouth as a substitute against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 19 August 2006, the opening day of the 2006\u201307 Premier League season.

After a notable performance at the [[FIFA U-17 World Cup|U-17 World Championships]] he was signed by Dutch [[Eredivisie]] [[AFC Ajax]] in 1993 for an undisclosed fee. He made his Ajax debut that year and went on to score 25 goals in 54 appearances. Kanu also came on as a sub in Ajax's 1995 [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] final win over [[A.C.

That summer he captained the [[Nigeria national football team|Nigerian team]] that won gold at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympics]], and scored two late goals in the semi-finals against powerhouses Brazil to overturn a 2\u20133 scoreline into a 4\u20133 win in extra time.

He made his debut for Arsenal, against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[FA Cup]]. With the score 1\u20131 and ten minutes to go, the Sheffield United goalkeeper [[Alan Kelly, Jr.|Alan Kelly]] kicked the ball out of touch so that treatment could be given to [[Lee Morris (footballer)|Lee Morris]]. When the ball was thrown back into play by [[Ray Parlour]], although it was intended for Kelly, Kanu chased the throw-in down the right wing unchallenged and centered the ball for [[Marc Overmars]], who scored to make the match 2\u20131.

He played 197 games for Arsenal, scoring 44 goals. In the summer of 2004, after his contract with Arsenal ended, he moved to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on a free transfer.

Kanu started as a regular for the club, making his debut in a 1\u20131 draw away at Blackburn Rovers on 14 August 2004. He scored his first goal for Albion on 18 September 2004, an 88th-minute equalizer in a 1\u20131 home draw against Fulham. In a match against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 14 November 2004, Kanu was guilty of an incredible miss in injury time, with Albion 2\u20131 down. Kanu had sent a low cross over the bar from a yard away from the goal line. Manager [[Bryan Robson]] was seen in TV footage mouthing the words \"How did he miss that?\", and Kanu's howler was crowned \"Miss of the Season\" by many media outlets in their end-of-season reviews. Nevertheless, the [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] season was ultimately a memorable one for West Brom, as they became the first club to avoid relegation from the Premier League after being bottom of the table at Christmas.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOne of the most memorable games of the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] season for Kanu came with the visit of his former club Arsenal to [[The Hawthorns]] on 15 October 2005. [[Philippe Senderos]] put the visitors ahead in the 17th minute, but Kanu equalised shortly before half time. West Brom went on to win the match 2\u20131 with a spectacular strike from [[Darren Carter]].

The ''Ganga [[aarti]]'' is also performed in the evening.\n\nThe 5 day festivals starts on [[Prabodhini Ekadashi]] (11th lunar day of Kartika) and concludes on [[Kartik Poornima]].

Houses and flats built for public or social housing use are built by or for [[Municipality|local authorities]] and known as [[council house]]s, though since the 1980s the role of non-profit [[Housing association|housing associations]] became more important and subsequently the term \"social housing\" became more widely used, as technically council housing only refers to housing owned by a local authority, though the terms are largely used interchangeably. Before 1865, housing for the poor was provided solely by the private sector. Council houses were built on council estates, where other amenities, like schools and shops, were often also provided. From the 1950s, blocks of [[Apartment|flat]]s and three- or four-storey blocks of [[Apartment#Maisonette|maisonette]]s were widely built, alongside large developments of terraced housing, while the 1960s and (to some degree) the 1970s saw construction of many [[High-rise building|high-rise tower blocks]]. Flats and houses were also built in mixed estates.\n\nCouncil homes were built to supply uncrowded, well-built homes on [[Secure tenancy|secure tenancies]] at reasonable rents to primarily [[working-class]] people. Council housing in the mid-20th century included many large suburban \"council estates\", featuring terraced and semi-detached houses, where other amenities like schools and shops were often also provided.{{sfn|Hollow|2011}} By the late 1970s almost a third of UK households lived in social housing: some of these developments did not live up to the hopes of their supporters, and now suffer from [[urban blight]], while others became desirable locations.\n\nSince 1979, the role of council housing has changed. Housing stock has been sold under [[Right to Buy]] legislation, and new social housing has mainly been developed and managed by [[housing association]]s. A substantial part of the UK population still lives in council housing: in 2010, about 17% of UK households.<!-- later figures welcome--> Approximately 55% of the country's social housing stock is owned by local authorities \u2013 of which 15% is managed on a day-to-day basis by [[arms-length management organisation]]s, rather than the authority, and 45% by [[housing association]]s.<ref>{{citation |last=Cowan |first=David |year=2009 |title=Trust, Distrust and Betrayal |journal=[[Modern Law Review]] |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=157\u2013181 |issn= |doi= }}</ref> In Scotland, council estates are known as 'schemes'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/heritage/marking-100-years-of-scotland-s-council-houses-1-5006388|title=Marking 100 years of Scotland's council houses|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe history of public housing is the history of the housing of the poor. Even that statement is controversial, as before 1890 the state was not involved in housing policy. Public housing became needed to provide \"[[homes fit for heroes]]\" in 1919,{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 3 para. 1}}{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=60}} then to enable [[slum clearance]]. Standards were set to ensure high-quality homes. [[Aneurin Bevan]], a Labour politician, passionately believed that council houses should be provided for all, while the Conservative politician [[Harold Macmillan]] saw council housing \"as a stepping stone to home ownership\".{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=92}} The Labour government of [[Harold Wilson]] built houses and flats to the point where there was a surplus in the late 1960s. The Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] introduced Right to Buy in 1979, with the millionth council house being sold within seven years. In time the transfer of public housing stock to the private sector reached the point where councils had to rent back their own houses in order to house the homeless.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=134,135}}\n\n===Before council housing===\nEven in the stable medieval model of landowner and peasant, where estate workers lived at the landowner's whim in a tied cottage, the aged and infirm needed provision from their former employer, the church or the state.{{sfn|de Pennington|2011}} <!-- could be more focussed -->\n\n====Almshouses====\n[[File:Dorset sherbone almshouses.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Almshouse]] at [[Sherborne]], [[Dorset]]]]\nThe documented history of social housing in Britain starts with [[almshouse]]s, which were established from the 10th century, to provide a place of residence for \"poor, old and distressed folk\". The first recorded almshouse was founded in [[York]] by King [[King \u00c6thelstan of England|\u00c6thelstan]]; the oldest still in existence is the [[Hospital of St Cross|Hospital of St. Cross]] in [[Winchester]], dating to {{circa}} 1133.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 7 para. 3}}\n\n====Workhouses====\nThe public [[workhouse]] was the final fallback solution for the destitute.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 7 para. 3}} Rural poverty had been greatly increased by the [[Inclosure Act]]s leaving many in need of assistance. This was divided into outside relief, or handouts to keep the family together, and inside relief, which meant submitting to the workhouse. The workhouse provided for two groups of people \u2013 the transient population roaming the country looking for seasonal work, and the long-term residents. The two were kept separate where possible. The long term residents included single elderly men incapable of further labour, and young women with their children\u2014often women who had been abandoned by their husbands, single mothers and servant-girls who had been dismissed from residential positions.{{sfn|de Pennington|2011}}\n\n====Migration to the city====\nThe pressure for decent housing was increased by overcrowding in the large cities during the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th century; many social commentators (such as [[Octavia Hill]]) reported on the squalor, sickness and immorality that arose. Some industrialists and independent organisations provided housing in [[Apartment building|tenement block]]s, while some [[philanthropist]] factory owners built entire villages for their workers, such as [[Saltaire]] (1853), [[Bournville]] (1879) and [[Port Sunlight]] (1888).{{sfn|UWE|2008|section=Before Council Housing}}\n\n===Council-built housing===\nThe [[City of London Corporation]] built [[tenement]]s in [[Farringdon Road]] in 1865,<ref>Tarn, J.

The [[World War I|First World War]] indirectly provided a new impetus, when the poor physical health and condition of many urban recruits to the [[British Army|army]] was noted with alarm. This led to a campaign under the slogan \"Homes fit for heroes\". In 1919, the Government first required councils to provide housing, built to the Tudor Walters standards, under the [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919]] (Addison Act), helping them to do so through the provision of subsidies.{{sfn|UK Parliament- Acts|2015}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newcastleareas.wordpress.com/2019/08/11/100-years-exhibition-the-1919-act/|title=100 years exhibition \u2013 the 1919 Act|last=Geography|first=Kay's|date=2019-08-11|website=Newcastle residential areas|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref> London County Council embraced these freedoms and planned eight 'cottage estates' in the peripheries of London: [[Becontree]], [[St Helier, London|St Helier]], [[Downham]] for example; seven further followed including [[Bellingham, London|Bellingham]]. Houses were built on green field land on the peripheries of the urban area. The war had caused house building costs to rise enormously: [[Ernest Simon, 1st Baron Simon of Wythenshawe|Sir Ernest Simon]] reported to the Manchester Housing Committee in 1910 that \"houses that had cost \u00a3250 to build pre war were then costing \u00a31,250, so the economic rent was 30/- a week but had to be let at 12/6d\".\n\nThe provision of local authority housing varied throughout the UK; in the period 1919-39 67% of the houses built in Scotland were in the public sector, compared to 26% in England.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scran.ac.uk/scotland/pdf/SP2_4Housing.pdf|title=URBAN HOUSING IN SCOTLAND 1840-1940|last=Knox|first=W.W.|website=SCRAN|publisher=Historic Environment Scotland|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===LCC cottage estates===\n{{main|London County Council cottage estate}}\n{{LCC cottage estates}}\nThe Addison Act provided subsidies solely to local authorities and not to private builders.

Act 1923]] ([[Nevil Chamberlain|Chamberlain Act]]) of 1923 stopped subsidies going to council houses but extended the subsidies to private builders. Following the line of the railways, predominantly private estates were built on cheap agricultural land; building houses that the professional classes with an income of \u00a3300- \u00a3500 a year were able to afford. <!-- Cheadle Hume, Sale, Timperley --> These pattern-book houses, put up speculatively by companies such as [[George Wimpey|Wimpey]], [[Costain Group|Costain]], [[John Laing Group|Laing]] and [[Taylor Woodrow]], were mocked by [[Osbert Lancaster]], as 'Mock Tudor' and 'By-pass variegated'.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=154}}\nLarge council estates following the line of the radial roads. <!--Kingsway, Princess Parkway, Withington, Chorlton cum Hardy--> This marked a further movement out of the city, first by the middle classes and then the blue-collar workers, leaving just the poorest layer of society living in the urban area.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=155}}\n\nThe first Labour government was returned in 1924. The [[Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1924|Wheatley Act of 1924]] restored subsidies to municipal housing but at a lower level, it failed to make any provision for lower paid, who were living in the worse conditions, and could not afford to pay the higher rents of the new houses, or travel to or from them to work.

Still looking for that-- but that is a tertiary source--> The bomb damage from the war only worsened the condition of Britain's housing stock, which was in poor condition before its outbreak. Before the war many social housing projects, such as the [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill Flats]] (pictured, right) in [[Leeds]] were built. However the bomb damage meant that much greater progress had to be made with [[slum clearance]] projects. In heavily bombed cities like [[London]], [[Coventry]] and [[Kingston upon Hull]], the redevelopment schemes were often larger and more radical.\n\nIn the immediate post-war years, and well into the 1950s, council house provision was shaped by the [[New Towns Act 1946]] and the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]]{{sfn|UK Parliament-New Towns|2015}} of the 1945\u201351 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government. Simultaneously, this government introduced housing legislation that removed [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] references to housing for the [[working class]] and introduced the concept of \"general needs\" construction (i.e., that council housing should aim to fill the needs of a wide range of society). In particular, [[Aneurin Bevan]], the [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister for Health and Housing]], promoted a vision of new estates where \"the working man, the doctor and the clergyman will live in close proximity to each other\". {{sfn|Panagidis|Savva|2015}}\n\nWhile a number of large cities tentatively erected their first [[high-rise]] developments (e.g., Aston Cross in [[Birmingham]], [[Churchill Gardens]] in [[Westminster]]), in [[England]] and [[Wales]] homes were typically [[semi-detached]] or in small [[Terraced house|terrace]]s. A three-bedroom semi-detached council house was typically built on a square grid {{convert|21|ft|m}} on the side, with a maximum density of houses of no more than {{Convert|12|/acre|/ha}}, that is to say around {{Convert|337|m2|sqyd}} per house. As a result, most houses had generous space around them. The [[new town]]s and many existing towns had countless estates built to this basic model. In [[Scotland]], the tradition of [[tenement]] living meant that most homes of this period were built in low-rise (3\u20134) storey blocks of [[Apartment|flat]]s.\n\nFor many working-class people, this housing model provided their first experience of private indoor toilets, private bathrooms and hot running water, as well as gardens and electric lighting. For [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] in England and Wales it also usually provided the first experience of private garden space (usually front and rear). The quality of these houses, and in particular the existence of small gardens in England and Wales, compared very favourably with social housing being built on the European continent in this period.\n\n===Focusing on a new urban vision===\nThe 1951 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government began to re-direct the building programme back from \"general needs\" towards \"welfare accommodation for low income earners\" The principal focus was on [[inner-city]] [[slum clearance]], completing the job that was started in the 1930s. \n[[Harold Macmillan#Housing Minister (1951\u201354)|Harold Macmillan]]'s task, as Minister for Housing, was to deliver 300,000 houses a year. These were {{convert|700|sqft|m2}}, 20% smaller than a Tudor Walters Bevan house, usually built as a two-bedroom terrace called \"[[People's house (United Kingdom)|The Peoples House]]\".{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=88-93}} {{sfn|Gimson|2013}}\nFrom 1956, with the [[Housing Subsidy Act 1956]] the government subsidy was confined to new houses built to replace those removed by slum clearance. There was more money available for blocks of more than six storeys high.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=93}} Helped by this focused subsidy, neighbourhoods throughout the country were demolished and rebuilt as mixed estates with low and high-rise building.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 6.}}\nAt the same time the rising influence of [[modernism|modernist]] architecture, the development of new cheaper construction techniques, such as [[system building]] (a form of [[prefabrication]]), and a growing desire by many towns and cities to retain [[population]] (and thus rental income and local rates) within their own boundaries (rather than \"export\" people to New Towns and \"out of boundary\" [[peripheral]] estates) led to this model being adopted; abandoned inner-city areas were demolished, and estates of high-rise apartments blocks proliferated on vacant sites.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 6.}} Whole working class communities were scattered, and the tenants either relocated themselves to neighbouring overcrowded properties or became isolated away from friends in flats and houses, on estates without infrastructure or a bus-route.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=68, 69, 71}}\n\n[[Glasgow]] led the way and others followed. [[High-rise building|Tower block]]s became the preferred model. The councils visited Marseille and saw the results of [[Le Corbusier|Charles \u00c9douard Jenneret]]'s (Le Corbusier's) vision.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=103}} The argument was advanced that more generously sized dwellings could be provided this way, that communities could be re-housed close to existing [[employment]] opportunities and there would be far less disruption to local [[shopping]] and [[leisure]] patterns. During the 1950s and 1960s, the number of high-rise dwellings rose significantly. In 1953, just 23% of public-sector approvals were for flats, with only 3% high-rise (defined as blocks of six stories or more). By 1966, however, high-rise housing accounted for 26% of all homes started.<ref>''The Five Giants: A Biography of the Welfare State'' by Nicholas Timmins.</ref> A National Dwelling and Housing Survey carried out in 1977 also found higher levels of housing satisfaction amongst owner occupiers than council housing tenants. The survey found that 90% of owner occupiers were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with their accommodation and only 4% \"dissatisfied\" or \"very dissatisfied\", while for council tenants the equivalent figures were 74% and 14%, respectively.<ref>Labour and Inequality: A Fabian Study of Labour in Power, 1974-79 edited by Nick Bosanquet and Peter Townsend</ref>\n\nSubsequent research at the [[London School of Economics]] has tried to cast doubt on claims that only high rise developments could accommodate the [[population density]] required for these policies.<ref>R. Burdett, T. Travers, D. Czischke, P. Rode and B. Moser, ''Density and Urban Neighbourhoods in London: Summary Report'' (Enterprise [[LSE Cities]], 2004), pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nThe post-war governments considered the provision of as much new housing as possible to be a major part of post-war policy, and provided subsidies for local authorities to build such housing. The Conservatives competed with Labour for the popular vote over who could build more houses, abandoning Bevan's principle that numbers weren't enough - that the homes had to be spacious and well built, too.\n\nThe use of [[system building]] methods was later seen as possibly being a short-sighted, false economy, as many of the later houses are in a poor state of repair or have been demolished. On many estates, older council houses, with their largely superior build quality, have outlived them \u2013 more incredibly, they have even been outlasted by a large percentage of Edwardian and late Victorian private houses.{{sfn|Meek|2014|loc= page 3.}}\n\nA number of types of system building used in flats have serious flaws. They were initially very popular with tenants due to their generous space standards, and with [[councillor]]s and housing officials due to their speed of construction<ref>Glendenning, Miles, and Muthesius, Stefan (1994), ''Tower Block: Modern Public Housing in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland''.</ref> \u2013 but have suffered problems, especially poor protection from damp and weather ingress, as well as other design defects and poor management. Also, studies such as ''[[Family and Kinship in East London]]'' found that people moving to such estates lost their old social networks and failed to develop new ones.{{sfn|Meek|2014|loc= page 3}} As noted by one study:\n\n\"There was, however, one way in which slum clearance rather than enhancing housing standards actually threatened to reduce them: the building by experimented prefabricated methods, of large impersonal estates of high-rise buildings, lacking many of the amenities common in similar developments on the continent.\"<ref>The Welfare State in Britain since 1945 by Rodney Lowe</ref>\n\nThe last major push in council home provision was made under the Wilson government of 1964. The energetic Minister of Housing [[Richard Crossman]] accepted the truth that the provision rate was too slow and instructed authorities to exercise their compulsory purchase powers and construct large overspill estates. In [[Birmingham]] he forced the building of [[Castle Vale]] and the 15,590 dwelling [[Chelmsley Wood]] estate, [[Solihull]].{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=29}}<ref name=cw-hist>{{cite web|title=History of Chelmsley Wood|url=http://www.solihull.gov.uk/Resident/Libraries/Local-family-history/localhistory/chelmsleywoodhistory|publisher=Metropolitan Borough of Solihull|accessdate=14 January 2016|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Right to buy===\n[[File:Dwellings completed in England 1946-2015.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Permanent dwellings completed in England by tenure type, showing the effect of the 1980 Housing Act in curtailing council house construction and reducing total new build numbers]]\nLaws restricted councils' investment in housing, preventing them subsidising it from local taxes, but more importantly, council tenants were given the [[Right to Buy]] in the [[Housing Act 1980]] offering a discount price on their council house.

A similar incident caused significant damage to one side of a block in [[Manchester]].\nAlthough these incidents were due to a series of failures (not least being the illegal connection of gas cookers by unqualified friends of tenants{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}), subsequently all system-built tower blocks were usually built with \"all electric\" heating, to prevent the occurrence of such an explosion.\n\nThe same year Manchester started the construction of the [[Hulme Crescents]]. Thirteen tower blocks connected by aerial walkways and the four long curving south facing blocks of flats and maisonettes connected by walkways and bridges. Five thousand homes were constructed in eight years. Three thousand of these were the deck access flats, almost immediately the constructional problems became apparent:they leaked, ducting failed and they were too expensive to heat. A child died falling from a deck and by 1975, and they were declared unsuitable for families with children, the elderly and the disabled. In 1975, 96.3% of the residents wanted to leave. 643 families petitioned to be rehoused. {{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|pp=194\u2013195}} They were demolished between 1991 and 1994.\n\nProportion of houses and flats built by local authorities and New Towns in England and Wales, 1960-80 (a)\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse sortable\"\n|-\n!

The North Hull HAT was set up to regenerate a large area of predominantly interwar council housing in the north of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Humberside]]. [[Liverpool]] HAT covered 67 of the worst tower blocks on [[Merseyside]]; 54 of these blocks were demolished and replaced by new public or private sector housing developments, while the remaining 13 blocks were refurbished. [[Stonebridge, London|Stonebridge]] HAT in [[Harlesden]], [[London]], was the final HAT to cease to exist when it was wound up in 2007, mostly covering an area of council housing built during the 1960s and 1970s. [[Waltham Forest]] HAT in [[South London]] covered several council estates, mostly built during the 1960s, and lasted until 2002, with the final phase of the regeneration being completed several years later by [[English Partnerships]]. [[Tower Hamlets]] HAT involved the regeneration of three council estates, mostly consisting of flats, in [[East London]]. Perhaps the most notable HAT was the one founded in 1993 to regenerate the [[Castle Vale]] estate in [[Birmingham]], which had been built in the 1960s.  The original master plan for the redevelopment of Castle Vale saw 17 out of 34 tower blocks on the estate earmarked for demolition, as well as 24 of the estate's 27 maisonette blocks, but by the time of the HAT's demise in 2005 all but two of the 34 tower blocks had been demolished, as well as all of the maisonette blocks and more than 100 bungalows. Community facilities on the estate were also improved, and the main shopping centre was completely redeveloped.\n\n[[File:BWFE panorama from northwest.JPG|thumb|centre|600px|[[Broadwater Farm]] in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], north London]] One of the most ambitious post-war council housing developments, the complex of [[housing estate|estate]]s at [[Broadwater Farm]] (shown above), became a national symbol of perceived failures in the council housing system following the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] in 1985.

In [[Greater Manchester]], this included [[Wythenshawe]] in the 1920s and then [[Hattersley]] in the 1960s. Later, infill estates were created on small pieces of brown field land that had been vacated by contracting heavy industry. <!-- write first and find references at leisure.-->\n\nSome pit villages, such as [[Grimethorpe]] in [[Yorkshire]], are almost entirely composed of original council housing.

Act 1909|1910 Town Planning Act]],<!-- is this the act--> removed some of the restrictions imposed by the 1875s byelaws. The [[Progress Estate]], Well Hall Road, had an open spaced layout that gave a pleasant environment to residents.{{sfn|Progress|1915}}\n\nThe [[Tudor Walters Report|Tudor Walters report]] was adopted and council estates opened up. They were designed to [[Radburn design housing|Radburn principles]] with wide feeder roads joining short cul-de-sacs. Houses were separated by at least {{convert|70|ft|m}} from the facing houses. The former gridiron street pattern was deprecated.\n\nThe [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919]] (also known as the Addison Act after [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]], [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Dr Christopher Addison]], the-then Minister for Housing), and the resulting wave of mass council housing in the early 1920s was among the first generation of houses in the country to feature electricity, running water, bathrooms, indoor toilets and front/rear gardens. However, some council houses were still being built with outdoor toilets, attached to the house, until well into the 1930s. Some of the earliest council houses did not feature an actual bathroom; the bath could often be found in the kitchen with a design that allowed it to double as a work surface. These new houses had two, three, four or five bedrooms, and generously sized back gardens intended for vegetable growing. At the best they were built at a density of houses of {{Convert|12|/acre|/ha}}. However, later in the [[20th century]] these houses were modernised to feature modern bathrooms and indoor toilets.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 3.}}\n\n<!-- Throttling back of funding- decline in standard- cul-de-sac to increase density and the \n  -- this section needs to give information to folks researching the purchases of 'ex-locals'\n  -->\nThe [[Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1924|Wheatley Act 1924]], reduced the expected standard in a council built house. Under the Addison Act a house would be {{convert|1000|sqft|m2}} but after 1924 it would be {{convert|620|sqft|m2}}.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 4.}}\nFlats and bungalows were first built by local councils during the interwar years, but in relatively low volumes. Most interwar council houses were built on completely new estates.\n\nThe [[Housing Act 1930]] encouraged further mass slum clearance. There was a cut in funding and the housing density on the [[peripheral estate]]s was increased; leading to a poorer build quality. The former tenants of the inner city properties, were displaced far from their workplaces unable to afford the higher rents (though reduced from the 1919 levels) or the cost of transport. Although the standard of housing improved, stable communities were broken up, and with it, support networks.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 4.}}\n\n===System build estates===\n[[File:Red Road flats at Balornock - geograph.org.uk - 119968.jpg|thumb|Glasgow's Red Road flats]]\nIt was not until the 1950s that mixed estates of multi-storey flats and houses became a common sight. Until then it was rare to see blocks of flats that were more than three or four storeys high. An early and famous development of council flats was at [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill]] in Leeds. Modelled on [[Karl-Marx-Hof]] flats in Vienna, the complex was built by Leeds City Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/image_galleries/image_gallery_quarry_hill_gallery.shtml?9|title=Leeds - In Pictures Quarry Hill's history |publisher=BBC}}</ref> At the time they were considered revolutionary: each flat had a motorized rubbish chute leading to a central incinerator. The complex had its own offices, shops and [[gasworks]]. The 1970s sitcom [[Queenie's Castle]] was filmed there. Long-term problems with the steel-frame structure led to demolition, beginning in 1978 and there is now no evidence of their existence. Though not in UK, the Oliver Bond flats in Dublin,Ireland were built in 1936 and have a similar design to many of the council estates in the UK today. The [[Red Road (flats)|Red Road flats]] in Glasgow were once the tallest residential buildings in Europe; but all eight towers were demolished in the 2010s.\n<!--Garages were provided on new housing developments, although these were usually in separate blocks to houses, as car ownership increased.-->\n\nBy the 1990s, many multi-storey flats and low-rise flats and maisonettes (mostly built in the 1950s and 1960s) were being demolished, due to their deteriorating condition, structural problems and a difficulty in finding new tenants when these properties became empty.\n\nOne notable regeneration programme featuring tower blocks was that of the [[Castle Vale]] estate in Birmingham, built between 1964 and 1969 to rehouse families from inner city 'slums' in areas including [[Aston]] and [[Nechells]]. 32 of the estate's 34 tower blocks were cleared between 1995 and 2004, with the remaining two being refurbished and re-opened as \"vertical warden-controlled schemes\". All of the estate's 27 maisonette blocks were also cleared, as were more than 100 bungalows. The remaining low-rise stock, however, was retained. The two remaining tower blocks were comprehensively refurbished. The sites of the demolished flats have been replaced by both private and social housing in low-rise redevelopments.<ref name=\"amc1\">{{cite book|last=Mornement |first=Adam |title=No Longer Notorious: The Revival of Castle Vale, 1993\u20132005 |publisher=Castle Vale Neighbourhood Partnership |date=March 2005 |pages=4\u201315 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Rise and Fall of Castle Vale, 1964\u20131993 |url=http://www.crp-ltd.co.uk/downloads/chapter01.pdf |format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe mood had changed and new [[council garden estate]]s were built. These consist of low rise dwellings, mainly houses with gardens. The high residential density, equivalent to a tower block, is achieved by pedestrianisation of the estate, which allowed the dwellings to be very close together, separated by pathways not {{Convert|11|m|ft|adj=on}} -wide roads. The resident's car park is next to the service road. Front doors open onto pedestrian areas, which thus provide safe play areas for children. An early late 1960s example of this design is [[Cressingham Gardens]]. This estate popular with its residents, and they have resisted all attempts to be resettled.<ref>{{cite news|title=A time for trust at Lambeth's Cressingham Gardens estate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/mar/08/a-time-for-trust-at-the-cressingham-gardens-estate|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Largest estates===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n[[Becontree]] in Dagenham is the largest area of council housing in the UK with a population of over 100,000. It forms the bulk of a town. It was built during the 1920s and early 1930s. Otherwise, the largest estates are [[Wythenshawe]] in the south of Manchester and [[Bransholme]] in the north-east of Hull. \n<!--Arron Way in [[Corby]] was a large estate, although the majority of the housing became derelict and the area is now undergoing regeneration. -->\n\nIn [[Scotland]], Glasgow has the highest proportion of social housing. The largest estates include [[Drumchapel]], [[Easterhouse]], [[Castlemilk]] and [[Pollok]]. In Edinburgh there are several smaller peripheral estates such as [[Craigmillar]], [[Wester Hailes]] and [[Sighthill, Edinburgh|Sighthill]]. The large council estates in \n[[Wales]] include [[Caia Park]] in [[Wrexham]], [[Bettws, Newport|Bettws]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] and [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] in [[Cardiff]]. <!-- stats not checked -->\n\n==Public housing debate==\nThe debate on public housing provision is politically polarised, as can be seen in the large number of parliamentary acts referred to above. The left saw council estates as a great achievement, while successive Conservative administrations attempted to curb their spread and restrict the essential funding for maintenance. In 1951, they changed the raison d'etre from being affordable homes for all to homes only for the most needy, thereby breaking up the social mix by grouping dysfunctional families together.{{sfn|Hanley|2012}}\n\nCouncil estates could then be stereotyped as \"problem places\", where social difficulties like crime and [[welfare dependency]] are expected. Estates with particularly marked economic and social deprivation are derogated as [[sink estate]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://policypress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1332/policypress/9781861348159.001.0001/upso-9781861348159-chapter-8|title='Problem' people, 'problemg places?

The combination of security of tenure and subsidized rent gives little incentive to tenants to downsize from family accommodation after their children have moved out. Meanwhile, those who are on the waiting list are often in much greater need of this welfare, yet they cannot have it; once a council house has been granted to a tenant, they cannot be evicted except for anti-social behaviour, serious offences committed at the premises.<ref>{{citation|last=Mack|first=Jon|year=2009|title=Possession following criminal conviction: Ground 14|journal=Landlord & Tenant Review|volume=13|issue=6|pages=209\u2013211}}</ref> Recent policy decision to reduce the supply of public housing have exacerbated this problem. The Cameron government has addressed this shortage by imposing a [[bedroom tax]] to encourage movement.{{sfn|Hanley|2012}}\n\nSocial policy economists, such as [[Anthony J. Culyer|Culyer]] and Barr, have been critical of the role that council housing plays in attempts to help the [[Poverty in the United Kingdom|poor]]. One large criticism is that it hurts labour mobility with its system of allocating housing to those in the local area. Working-class people thus face a disincentive for moving across district lines, where they would be further down the waiting list for council housing in the new districts.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe movement from a close urban society with multiple emotional and practical support mechanism to new out-of-town estates with few informal facilities has been recognised since the 1930s. Again, when residence is restricted to the poor and dysfunctional, the effect is greater. Council estates have been blamed for creating isolated community and mentality where residents have low aspirations.{{sfn|Hanley|2012}}\n\n{{quote|The truth is that council housing is a living tomb.

Then there's a duty to provide suitable temporary accommodation immediately.\"  Pritchard maintains she continually finds cases where Local Authorities have sent victims to another authority instead of rehousing them.

Houses and flats built for public or social housing use are built by or for [[Municipality|local authorities]] and known as [[council house]]s, though since the 1980s the role of non-profit [[Housing association|housing associations]] became more important and subsequently the term \"social housing\" became more widely used, as technically council housing only refers to housing owned by a local authority, though the terms are largely used interchangeably. Before 1865, housing for the poor was provided solely by the private sector. Council houses were built on council estates, where other amenities, like schools and shops, were often also provided. From the 1950s, blocks of [[Apartment|flat]]s and three- or four-storey blocks of [[Apartment#Maisonette|maisonette]]s were widely built, alongside large developments of terraced housing, while the 1960s and (to some degree) the 1970s saw construction of many [[High-rise building|high-rise tower blocks]]. Flats and houses were also built in mixed estates.\n\nCouncil homes were built to supply uncrowded, well-built homes on [[Secure tenancy|secure tenancies]] at reasonable rents to primarily [[working-class]] people. Council housing in the mid-20th century included many large suburban \"council estates\", featuring terraced and semi-detached houses, where other amenities like schools and shops were often also provided.{{sfn|Hollow|2011}} By the late 1970s almost a third of UK households lived in social housing: some of these developments did not live up to the hopes of their supporters, and now suffer from [[urban blight]], while others became desirable locations.\n\nSince 1979, the role of council housing has changed. Housing stock has been sold under [[Right to Buy]] legislation, and new social housing has mainly been developed and managed by [[housing association]]s. A substantial part of the UK population still lives in council housing: in 2010, about 17% of UK households.<!-- later figures welcome--> Approximately 55% of the country's social housing stock is owned by local authorities \u2013 of which 15% is managed on a day-to-day basis by [[arms-length management organisation]]s, rather than the authority, and 45% by [[housing association]]s.<ref>{{citation |last=Cowan |first=David |year=2009 |title=Trust, Distrust and Betrayal |journal=[[Modern Law Review]] |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=157\u2013181 |issn= |doi= }}</ref> In Scotland, council estates are known as 'schemes'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/heritage/marking-100-years-of-scotland-s-council-houses-1-5006388|title=Marking 100 years of Scotland's council houses|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe history of public housing is the history of the housing of the poor. Even that statement is controversial, as before 1890 the state was not involved in housing policy. Public housing became needed to provide \"[[homes fit for heroes]]\" in 1919,{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 3 para. 1}}{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=60}} then to enable [[slum clearance]]. Standards were set to ensure high-quality homes. [[Aneurin Bevan]], a Labour politician, passionately believed that council houses should be provided for all, while the Conservative politician [[Harold Macmillan]] saw council housing \"as a stepping stone to home ownership\".{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=92}} The Labour government of [[Harold Wilson]] built houses and flats to the point where there was a surplus in the late 1960s. The Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] introduced Right to Buy in 1979, with the millionth council house being sold within seven years. In time the transfer of public housing stock to the private sector reached the point where councils had to rent back their own houses in order to house the homeless.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=134,135}}\n\n===Before council housing===\nEven in the stable medieval model of landowner and peasant, where estate workers lived at the landowner's whim in a tied cottage, the aged and infirm needed provision from their former employer, the church or the state.{{sfn|de Pennington|2011}} <!-- could be more focussed -->\n\n====Almshouses====\n[[File:Dorset sherbone almshouses.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Almshouse]] at [[Sherborne]], [[Dorset]]]]\nThe documented history of social housing in Britain starts with [[almshouse]]s, which were established from the 10th century, to provide a place of residence for \"poor, old and distressed folk\". The first recorded almshouse was founded in [[York]] by King [[King \u00c6thelstan of England|\u00c6thelstan]]; the oldest still in existence is the [[Hospital of St Cross|Hospital of St. Cross]] in [[Winchester]], dating to {{circa}} 1133.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 7 para. 3}}\n\n====Workhouses====\nThe public [[workhouse]] was the final fallback solution for the destitute.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 7 para. 3}} Rural poverty had been greatly increased by the [[Inclosure Act]]s leaving many in need of assistance. This was divided into outside relief, or handouts to keep the family together, and inside relief, which meant submitting to the workhouse. The workhouse provided for two groups of people \u2013 the transient population roaming the country looking for seasonal work, and the long-term residents. The two were kept separate where possible. The long term residents included single elderly men incapable of further labour, and young women with their children\u2014often women who had been abandoned by their husbands, single mothers and servant-girls who had been dismissed from residential positions.{{sfn|de Pennington|2011}}\n\n====Migration to the city====\nThe pressure for decent housing was increased by overcrowding in the large cities during the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th century; many social commentators (such as [[Octavia Hill]]) reported on the squalor, sickness and immorality that arose. Some industrialists and independent organisations provided housing in [[Apartment building|tenement block]]s, while some [[philanthropist]] factory owners built entire villages for their workers, such as [[Saltaire]] (1853), [[Bournville]] (1879) and [[Port Sunlight]] (1888).{{sfn|UWE|2008|section=Before Council Housing}}\n\n===Council-built housing===\nThe [[City of London Corporation]] built [[tenement]]s in [[Farringdon Road]] in 1865,<ref>Tarn, J.

As a consequence, [[London County Council]] opened the [[Boundary Estate]] in 1900, a 'block dwelling estate' of tenements in [[Tower Hamlets]].{{sfn|Yelling|1995|p=167}} The Housing of the Working Classes Act 1900 extended these power to all local councils, which then began building tenements and houses. {{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 2.}}{{sfn|Burnett|1986|p=184}}\n\n===Homes fit for heroes \u2013 interwar policy===\nIn 1912, [[Raymond Unwin]] published a pamphlet ''Nothing gained by Overcrowding''.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=153}} He worked on the influential Tudor Walters Report of 1918, which recommended housing in short terraces, spaced {{Convert|70|ft|m}} apart at a density of {{Convert|12|/acre|/ha}}. The [[World War I|First World War]] indirectly provided a new impetus, when the poor physical health and condition of many urban recruits to the [[British Army|army]] was noted with alarm. This led to a campaign under the slogan \"Homes fit for heroes\". In 1919, the Government first required councils to provide housing, built to the Tudor Walters standards, under the [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919]] (Addison Act), helping them to do so through the provision of subsidies.{{sfn|UK Parliament- Acts|2015}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newcastleareas.wordpress.com/2019/08/11/100-years-exhibition-the-1919-act/|title=100 years exhibition \u2013 the 1919 Act|last=Geography|first=Kay's|date=2019-08-11|website=Newcastle residential areas|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref> London County Council embraced these freedoms and planned eight 'cottage estates' in the peripheries of London: [[Becontree]], [[St Helier, London|St Helier]], [[Downham]] for example; seven further followed including [[Bellingham, London|Bellingham]]. Houses were built on green field land on the peripheries of the urban area. The war had caused house building costs to rise enormously: [[Ernest Simon, 1st Baron Simon of Wythenshawe|Sir Ernest Simon]] reported to the Manchester Housing Committee in 1910 that \"houses that had cost \u00a3250 to build pre war were then costing \u00a31,250, so the economic rent was 30/- a week but had to be let at 12/6d\".\n\nThe provision of local authority housing varied throughout the UK; in the period 1919-39 67% of the houses built in Scotland were in the public sector, compared to 26% in England.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scran.ac.uk/scotland/pdf/SP2_4Housing.pdf|title=URBAN HOUSING IN SCOTLAND 1840-1940|last=Knox|first=W.W.|website=SCRAN|publisher=Historic Environment Scotland|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===LCC cottage estates===\n{{main|London County Council cottage estate}}\n{{LCC cottage estates}}\nThe Addison Act provided subsidies solely to local authorities and not to private builders. Many houses were built over the next few years in 'cottage estates'.{{sfn|Hollow|2011}} The [[Housing, &c. Act 1923]] ([[Nevil Chamberlain|Chamberlain Act]]) of 1923 stopped subsidies going to council houses but extended the subsidies to private builders. Following the line of the railways, predominantly private estates were built on cheap agricultural land; building houses that the professional classes with an income of \u00a3300- \u00a3500 a year were able to afford. <!-- Cheadle Hume, Sale, Timperley --> These pattern-book houses, put up speculatively by companies such as [[George Wimpey|Wimpey]], [[Costain Group|Costain]], [[John Laing Group|Laing]] and [[Taylor Woodrow]], were mocked by [[Osbert Lancaster]], as 'Mock Tudor' and 'By-pass variegated'.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=154}}\nLarge council estates following the line of the radial roads. <!--Kingsway, Princess Parkway, Withington, Chorlton cum Hardy--> This marked a further movement out of the city, first by the middle classes and then the blue-collar workers, leaving just the poorest layer of society living in the urban area.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=155}}\n\nThe first Labour government was returned in 1924. The [[Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1924|Wheatley Act of 1924]] restored subsidies to municipal housing but at a lower level, it failed to make any provision for lower paid, who were living in the worse conditions, and could not afford to pay the higher rents of the new houses, or travel to or from them to work. They continued in substandard housing circling the urban core; in Manchester, for example, this 'slum belt' was about half a mile wide.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=155}}\n\n<!-- this list need re-assessing\nExamples of these were built at the [[Downham Estate]] in [[London]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/case-studies/downham-estate/2|title=Why the estate was needed - Case Studies |publisher=Ideal Homes}}</ref> [[Kates Hill]] in [[Dudley]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/News/How-1920146s-Dudley-honoured-Nurse-Cavell-2.htm|title=How 1920s Dudley honoured Nurse Cavell|work=Black Country Bugle}}</ref> [[Low Hill]] in [[Wolverhampton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/article/A-History-of-Council-Housing-in-Wolverhampton/3|title=A History of Council Housing in Wolverhampton|publisher=geograph.org.uk}}</ref> [[Weoley Castle]] in [[Birmingham]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brumagem.co.uk/ae_Weoley-area_Birmingham.htm|title=Profile: Weoley in Birmingham|publisher=brumagem.co.uk}}</ref> and [[Norris Green]] in [[Liverpool]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catalystmedia.org.uk/issues/nerve3/norris_green.htm|title=Nerve Articles - Issue 3|publisher=catalystmedia.org.uk}}</ref>\nBlocks of flats were also built.<ref>[[Chris Roberts (author)|Chris Roberts]], Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 (ISBN 0-7862-8517-6)</ref> -->===Statutory slum clearance plans===\nWhile new council housing had been built, little had been done to resolve the problem of inner-city [[slum]]s, which could also be found in many smaller towns.

Still looking for that-- but that is a tertiary source--> The bomb damage from the war only worsened the condition of Britain's housing stock, which was in poor condition before its outbreak. Before the war many social housing projects, such as the [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill Flats]] (pictured, right) in [[Leeds]] were built. However the bomb damage meant that much greater progress had to be made with [[slum clearance]] projects. In heavily bombed cities like [[London]], [[Coventry]] and [[Kingston upon Hull]], the redevelopment schemes were often larger and more radical.\n\nIn the immediate post-war years, and well into the 1950s, council house provision was shaped by the [[New Towns Act 1946]] and the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]]{{sfn|UK Parliament-New Towns|2015}} of the 1945\u201351 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government. Simultaneously, this government introduced housing legislation that removed [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] references to housing for the [[working class]] and introduced the concept of \"general needs\" construction (i.e., that council housing should aim to fill the needs of a wide range of society). In particular, [[Aneurin Bevan]], the [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister for Health and Housing]], promoted a vision of new estates where \"the working man, the doctor and the clergyman will live in close proximity to each other\". {{sfn|Panagidis|Savva|2015}}\n\nWhile a number of large cities tentatively erected their first [[high-rise]] developments (e.g., Aston Cross in [[Birmingham]], [[Churchill Gardens]] in [[Westminster]]), in [[England]] and [[Wales]] homes were typically [[semi-detached]] or in small [[Terraced house|terrace]]s. A three-bedroom semi-detached council house was typically built on a square grid {{convert|21|ft|m}} on the side, with a maximum density of houses of no more than {{Convert|12|/acre|/ha}}, that is to say around {{Convert|337|m2|sqyd}} per house. As a result, most houses had generous space around them. The [[new town]]s and many existing towns had countless estates built to this basic model. In [[Scotland]], the tradition of [[tenement]] living meant that most homes of this period were built in low-rise (3\u20134) storey blocks of [[Apartment|flat]]s.\n\nFor many working-class people, this housing model provided their first experience of private indoor toilets, private bathrooms and hot running water, as well as gardens and electric lighting. For [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] in England and Wales it also usually provided the first experience of private garden space (usually front and rear). The quality of these houses, and in particular the existence of small gardens in England and Wales, compared very favourably with social housing being built on the European continent in this period.\n\n===Focusing on a new urban vision===\nThe 1951 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government began to re-direct the building programme back from \"general needs\" towards \"welfare accommodation for low income earners\" The principal focus was on [[inner-city]] [[slum clearance]], completing the job that was started in the 1930s. \n[[Harold Macmillan#Housing Minister (1951\u201354)|Harold Macmillan]]'s task, as Minister for Housing, was to deliver 300,000 houses a year. These were {{convert|700|sqft|m2}}, 20% smaller than a Tudor Walters Bevan house, usually built as a two-bedroom terrace called \"[[People's house (United Kingdom)|The Peoples House]]\".{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=88-93}} {{sfn|Gimson|2013}}\nFrom 1956, with the [[Housing Subsidy Act 1956]] the government subsidy was confined to new houses built to replace those removed by slum clearance. There was more money available for blocks of more than six storeys high.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=93}} Helped by this focused subsidy, neighbourhoods throughout the country were demolished and rebuilt as mixed estates with low and high-rise building.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 6.}}\nAt the same time the rising influence of [[modernism|modernist]] architecture, the development of new cheaper construction techniques, such as [[system building]] (a form of [[prefabrication]]), and a growing desire by many towns and cities to retain [[population]] (and thus rental income and local rates) within their own boundaries (rather than \"export\" people to New Towns and \"out of boundary\" [[peripheral]] estates) led to this model being adopted; abandoned inner-city areas were demolished, and estates of high-rise apartments blocks proliferated on vacant sites.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 6.}} Whole working class communities were scattered, and the tenants either relocated themselves to neighbouring overcrowded properties or became isolated away from friends in flats and houses, on estates without infrastructure or a bus-route.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=68, 69, 71}}\n\n[[Glasgow]] led the way and others followed. [[High-rise building|Tower block]]s became the preferred model. The councils visited Marseille and saw the results of [[Le Corbusier|Charles \u00c9douard Jenneret]]'s (Le Corbusier's) vision.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=103}} The argument was advanced that more generously sized dwellings could be provided this way, that communities could be re-housed close to existing [[employment]] opportunities and there would be far less disruption to local [[shopping]] and [[leisure]] patterns. During the 1950s and 1960s, the number of high-rise dwellings rose significantly. In 1953, just 23% of public-sector approvals were for flats, with only 3% high-rise (defined as blocks of six stories or more). By 1966, however, high-rise housing accounted for 26% of all homes started.<ref>''The Five Giants: A Biography of the Welfare State'' by Nicholas Timmins.</ref> A National Dwelling and Housing Survey carried out in 1977 also found higher levels of housing satisfaction amongst owner occupiers than council housing tenants. The survey found that 90% of owner occupiers were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with their accommodation and only 4% \"dissatisfied\" or \"very dissatisfied\", while for council tenants the equivalent figures were 74% and 14%, respectively.<ref>Labour and Inequality: A Fabian Study of Labour in Power, 1974-79 edited by Nick Bosanquet and Peter Townsend</ref>\n\nSubsequent research at the [[London School of Economics]] has tried to cast doubt on claims that only high rise developments could accommodate the [[population density]] required for these policies.<ref>R. Burdett, T. Travers, D. Czischke, P. Rode and B. Moser, ''Density and Urban Neighbourhoods in London: Summary Report'' (Enterprise [[LSE Cities]], 2004), pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nThe post-war governments considered the provision of as much new housing as possible to be a major part of post-war policy, and provided subsidies for local authorities to build such housing. The Conservatives competed with Labour for the popular vote over who could build more houses, abandoning Bevan's principle that numbers weren't enough - that the homes had to be spacious and well built, too.\n\nThe use of [[system building]] methods was later seen as possibly being a short-sighted, false economy, as many of the later houses are in a poor state of repair or have been demolished. On many estates, older council houses, with their largely superior build quality, have outlived them \u2013 more incredibly, they have even been outlasted by a large percentage of Edwardian and late Victorian private houses.{{sfn|Meek|2014|loc= page 3.}}\n\nA number of types of system building used in flats have serious flaws. They were initially very popular with tenants due to their generous space standards, and with [[councillor]]s and housing officials due to their speed of construction<ref>Glendenning, Miles, and Muthesius, Stefan (1994), ''Tower Block: Modern Public Housing in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland''.</ref> \u2013 but have suffered problems, especially poor protection from damp and weather ingress, as well as other design defects and poor management. Also, studies such as ''[[Family and Kinship in East London]]'' found that people moving to such estates lost their old social networks and failed to develop new ones.{{sfn|Meek|2014|loc= page 3}} As noted by one study:\n\n\"There was, however, one way in which slum clearance rather than enhancing housing standards actually threatened to reduce them: the building by experimented prefabricated methods, of large impersonal estates of high-rise buildings, lacking many of the amenities common in similar developments on the continent.\"<ref>The Welfare State in Britain since 1945 by Rodney Lowe</ref>\n\nThe last major push in council home provision was made under the Wilson government of 1964. The energetic Minister of Housing [[Richard Crossman]] accepted the truth that the provision rate was too slow and instructed authorities to exercise their compulsory purchase powers and construct large overspill estates.

A similar incident caused significant damage to one side of a block in [[Manchester]].\nAlthough these incidents were due to a series of failures (not least being the illegal connection of gas cookers by unqualified friends of tenants{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}), subsequently all system-built tower blocks were usually built with \"all electric\" heating, to prevent the occurrence of such an explosion.\n\nThe same year Manchester started the construction of the [[Hulme Crescents]]. Thirteen tower blocks connected by aerial walkways and the four long curving south facing blocks of flats and maisonettes connected by walkways and bridges. Five thousand homes were constructed in eight years. Three thousand of these were the deck access flats, almost immediately the constructional problems became apparent:they leaked, ducting failed and they were too expensive to heat. A child died falling from a deck and by 1975, and they were declared unsuitable for families with children, the elderly and the disabled. In 1975, 96.3% of the residents wanted to leave. 643 families petitioned to be rehoused. {{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|pp=194\u2013195}} They were demolished between 1991 and 1994.\n\nProportion of houses and flats built by local authorities and New Towns in England and Wales, 1960-80 (a)\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse sortable\"\n|-\n!

The North Hull HAT was set up to regenerate a large area of predominantly interwar council housing in the north of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Humberside]]. [[Liverpool]] HAT covered 67 of the worst tower blocks on [[Merseyside]]; 54 of these blocks were demolished and replaced by new public or private sector housing developments, while the remaining 13 blocks were refurbished. [[Stonebridge, London|Stonebridge]] HAT in [[Harlesden]], [[London]], was the final HAT to cease to exist when it was wound up in 2007, mostly covering an area of council housing built during the 1960s and 1970s. [[Waltham Forest]] HAT in [[South London]] covered several council estates, mostly built during the 1960s, and lasted until 2002, with the final phase of the regeneration being completed several years later by [[English Partnerships]]. [[Tower Hamlets]] HAT involved the regeneration of three council estates, mostly consisting of flats, in [[East London]]. Perhaps the most notable HAT was the one founded in 1993 to regenerate the [[Castle Vale]] estate in [[Birmingham]], which had been built in the 1960s.  The original master plan for the redevelopment of Castle Vale saw 17 out of 34 tower blocks on the estate earmarked for demolition, as well as 24 of the estate's 27 maisonette blocks, but by the time of the HAT's demise in 2005 all but two of the 34 tower blocks had been demolished, as well as all of the maisonette blocks and more than 100 bungalows. Community facilities on the estate were also improved, and the main shopping centre was completely redeveloped.\n\n[[File:BWFE panorama from northwest.JPG|thumb|centre|600px|[[Broadwater Farm]] in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], north London]] One of the most ambitious post-war council housing developments, the complex of [[housing estate|estate]]s at [[Broadwater Farm]] (shown above), became a national symbol of perceived failures in the council housing system following the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] in 1985.

When that was exhausted, [[peripheral estate]]s were built on the edge of the town. Residents needed to commute by public transport or bicycle, as almost none of the people living in these areas had cars until well after [[World War II]].<!--Denton and Moston?--> Councils bought vacant land in neighbouring boroughs to build [[overspill estate]]s. In [[Greater Manchester]], this included [[Wythenshawe]] in the 1920s and then [[Hattersley]] in the 1960s. Later, infill estates were created on small pieces of brown field land that had been vacated by contracting heavy industry. <!-- write first and find references at leisure.-->\n\nSome pit villages, such as [[Grimethorpe]] in [[Yorkshire]], are almost entirely composed of original council housing.

Act 1919]] (also known as the Addison Act after [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]], [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Dr Christopher Addison]], the-then Minister for Housing), and the resulting wave of mass council housing in the early 1920s was among the first generation of houses in the country to feature electricity, running water, bathrooms, indoor toilets and front/rear gardens. However, some council houses were still being built with outdoor toilets, attached to the house, until well into the 1930s. Some of the earliest council houses did not feature an actual bathroom; the bath could often be found in the kitchen with a design that allowed it to double as a work surface. These new houses had two, three, four or five bedrooms, and generously sized back gardens intended for vegetable growing. At the best they were built at a density of houses of {{Convert|12|/acre|/ha}}.

Most interwar council houses were built on completely new estates.\n\nThe [[Housing Act 1930]] encouraged further mass slum clearance. There was a cut in funding and the housing density on the [[peripheral estate]]s was increased; leading to a poorer build quality. The former tenants of the inner city properties, were displaced far from their workplaces unable to afford the higher rents (though reduced from the 1919 levels) or the cost of transport. Although the standard of housing improved, stable communities were broken up, and with it, support networks.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 4.}}\n\n===System build estates===\n[[File:Red Road flats at Balornock - geograph.org.uk - 119968.jpg|thumb|Glasgow's Red Road flats]]\nIt was not until the 1950s that mixed estates of multi-storey flats and houses became a common sight. Until then it was rare to see blocks of flats that were more than three or four storeys high. An early and famous development of council flats was at [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill]] in Leeds. Modelled on [[Karl-Marx-Hof]] flats in Vienna, the complex was built by Leeds City Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/image_galleries/image_gallery_quarry_hill_gallery.shtml?9|title=Leeds - In Pictures Quarry Hill's history |publisher=BBC}}</ref> At the time they were considered revolutionary: each flat had a motorized rubbish chute leading to a central incinerator. The complex had its own offices, shops and [[gasworks]]. The 1970s sitcom [[Queenie's Castle]] was filmed there. Long-term problems with the steel-frame structure led to demolition, beginning in 1978 and there is now no evidence of their existence. Though not in UK, the Oliver Bond flats in Dublin,Ireland were built in 1936 and have a similar design to many of the council estates in the UK today. The [[Red Road (flats)|Red Road flats]] in Glasgow were once the tallest residential buildings in Europe; but all eight towers were demolished in the 2010s.\n<!--Garages were provided on new housing developments, although these were usually in separate blocks to houses, as car ownership increased.-->\n\nBy the 1990s, many multi-storey flats and low-rise flats and maisonettes (mostly built in the 1950s and 1960s) were being demolished, due to their deteriorating condition, structural problems and a difficulty in finding new tenants when these properties became empty.\n\nOne notable regeneration programme featuring tower blocks was that of the [[Castle Vale]] estate in Birmingham, built between 1964 and 1969 to rehouse families from inner city 'slums' in areas including [[Aston]] and [[Nechells]]. 32 of the estate's 34 tower blocks were cleared between 1995 and 2004, with the remaining two being refurbished and re-opened as \"vertical warden-controlled schemes\". All of the estate's 27 maisonette blocks were also cleared, as were more than 100 bungalows. The remaining low-rise stock, however, was retained. The two remaining tower blocks were comprehensively refurbished. The sites of the demolished flats have been replaced by both private and social housing in low-rise redevelopments.<ref name=\"amc1\">{{cite book|last=Mornement |first=Adam |title=No Longer Notorious: The Revival of Castle Vale, 1993\u20132005 |publisher=Castle Vale Neighbourhood Partnership |date=March 2005 |pages=4\u201315 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Rise and Fall of Castle Vale, 1964\u20131993 |url=http://www.crp-ltd.co.uk/downloads/chapter01.pdf |format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe mood had changed and new [[council garden estate]]s were built. These consist of low rise dwellings, mainly houses with gardens. The high residential density, equivalent to a tower block, is achieved by pedestrianisation of the estate, which allowed the dwellings to be very close together, separated by pathways not {{Convert|11|m|ft|adj=on}} -wide roads. The resident's car park is next to the service road. Front doors open onto pedestrian areas, which thus provide safe play areas for children. An early late 1960s example of this design is [[Cressingham Gardens]]. This estate popular with its residents, and they have resisted all attempts to be resettled.<ref>{{cite news|title=A time for trust at Lambeth's Cressingham Gardens estate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/mar/08/a-time-for-trust-at-the-cressingham-gardens-estate|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Largest estates===\n{{unreferenced sections|date=April 2020}}\n[[Becontree]] in Dagenham is the largest area of council housing in the UK with a population of over 100,000. It forms the bulk of a town. It was built during the 1920s and early 1930s. Otherwise, the largest estates are [[Wythenshawe]] in the south of Manchester and [[Bransholme]] in the north-east of Hull. \n<!--Arron Way in [[Corby]] was a large estate, although the majority of the housing became derelict and the area is now undergoing regeneration. -->\n\nIn [[Scotland]], Glasgow has the highest proportion of social housing. The largest estates include [[Drumchapel]], [[Easterhouse]], [[Castlemilk]] and [[Pollok]]. In Edinburgh there are several smaller peripheral estates such as [[Craigmillar]], [[Wester Hailes]] and [[Sighthill, Edinburgh|Sighthill]]. The large council estates in \n[[Wales]] include [[Caia Park]] in [[Wrexham]], [[Bettws, Newport|Bettws]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] and [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] in [[Cardiff]]. <!-- stats not checked -->\n\n==Public housing debate==\nThe debate on public housing provision is politically polarised, as can be seen in the large number of parliamentary acts referred to above. The left saw council estates as a great achievement, while successive Conservative administrations attempted to curb their spread and restrict the essential funding for maintenance. In 1951, they changed the raison d'etre from being affordable homes for all to homes only for the most needy, thereby breaking up the social mix by grouping dysfunctional families together.{{sfn|Hanley|2012}}\n\nCouncil estates could then be stereotyped as \"problem places\", where social difficulties like crime and [[welfare dependency]] are expected. Estates with particularly marked economic and social deprivation are derogated as [[sink estate]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://policypress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1332/policypress/9781861348159.001.0001/upso-9781861348159-chapter-8|title='Problem' people, 'problemg places?

The combination of security of tenure and subsidized rent gives little incentive to tenants to downsize from family accommodation after their children have moved out. Meanwhile, those who are on the waiting list are often in much greater need of this welfare, yet they cannot have it; once a council house has been granted to a tenant, they cannot be evicted except for anti-social behaviour, serious offences committed at the premises.<ref>{{citation|last=Mack|first=Jon|year=2009|title=Possession following criminal conviction: Ground 14|journal=Landlord & Tenant Review|volume=13|issue=6|pages=209\u2013211}}</ref> Recent policy decision to reduce the supply of public housing have exacerbated this problem. The Cameron government has addressed this shortage by imposing a [[bedroom tax]] to encourage movement.{{sfn|Hanley|2012}}\n\nSocial policy economists, such as [[Anthony J. Culyer|Culyer]] and Barr, have been critical of the role that council housing plays in attempts to help the [[Poverty in the United Kingdom|poor]]. One large criticism is that it hurts labour mobility with its system of allocating housing to those in the local area. Working-class people thus face a disincentive for moving across district lines, where they would be further down the waiting list for council housing in the new districts.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe movement from a close urban society with multiple emotional and practical support mechanism to new out-of-town estates with few informal facilities has been recognised since the 1930s. Again, when residence is restricted to the poor and dysfunctional, the effect is greater. Council estates have been blamed for creating isolated community and mentality where residents have low aspirations.{{sfn|Hanley|2012}}\n\n{{quote|The truth is that council housing is a living tomb. You dare not give the house up because you might never get another, but staying is to be trapped in a ghetto of both place and mind. \u2026 The people in them need to have better training and more incentives to work.

Then there's a duty to provide suitable temporary accommodation immediately.\"  Pritchard maintains she continually finds cases where Local Authorities have sent victims to another authority instead of rehousing them.

His face and hands are obscured, hidden under a blanket, but [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] wounds on his feet reveal his identity.<ref name=Burnett/> The statue has been described as a \"visual translation\" of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] passage in which Jesus tells his disciples, \"as you did it to one of the least of my brothers, you did it to me\".<ref name=Burnett/> Schmalz intended for the bronze sculpture to be provocative, admitting, \"That's essentially what the sculpture is there to do. It's meant to challenge people.\"<ref name=Burnett/> He offered the first casts to [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Toronto)|St. Michael's Cathedral]] in [[Toronto]] and [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York, but both churches declined.<ref name=Burnett/> One spokesperson for St. Michael's said the church declined because appreciation \"was not unanimous\" and it was undergoing restoration.

His face and hands are obscured, hidden under a blanket, but [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] wounds on his feet reveal his identity.<ref name=Burnett/> The statue has been described as a \"visual translation\" of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] passage in which Jesus tells his disciples, \"as you did it to one of the least of my brothers, you did it to me\".<ref name=Burnett/> Schmalz intended for the bronze sculpture to be provocative, admitting, \"That's essentially what the sculpture is there to do. It's meant to challenge people.\"<ref name=Burnett/> He offered the first casts to [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Toronto)|St. Michael's Cathedral]] in [[Toronto]] and [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York, but both churches declined.<ref name=Burnett/> One spokesperson for St. Michael's said the church declined because appreciation \"was not unanimous\" and it was undergoing restoration. The cast intended for St. Michael's was installed at Regis College, the Jesuit School of Theology at the [[University of Toronto]]. Similarly, a spokesperson for St. Patrick's complimented the work but declined purchasing the cast due to ongoing renovations.<ref name=Burnett/>\n\n[[File:Homeless Jesus CCSD 07 2018 9746.jpg|left|thumb| Signature of Timothy P.

He was a government minister from 1976 to 1984.\n\nLanda was born in [[St Peters, New South Wales|St Peters]] in [[Sydney]] to Maurice and Fay Landa, who were of [[Ireland|Irish]]/[[Poland|Polish]] descent and had migrated from [[Belfast]].

In that year he also became the Government's Leader in the Upper House. He became Education Minister in 1980, Energy Minister in 1981 and [[Attorney General of New South Wales|Attorney General]] in 1983.

The protesters were stopping logging from taking place within the Terania Creek rainforest. While Landa was fully supportive of the preservation of the rainforest and the stopping of logging it was his cabinet colleague [[Frank Walker (Australian politician)|Frank Walker]] who had brought the matter to the Government's attention.<ref>http://theluckygeneral.biz/2019/07/12/barbarians-at-the-gate-dont-let-them-destroy-murray-valley-national-park/</ref> After visiting Terania Creek themselves the Cabinet Members agreed that the Environmental Impact Study that the protesters were wanting would be carried out. The logging was stopped and never recommenced.\n\nWhen he became Minister for Education in 1980 Paul Landa distributed native trees to schools to enable the planting of native tree groves, including rainforest groves, in school grounds as a means of providing hands on environmental education to school children. At a time when protecting the environment was seen as radical, controversial and largely unnecessary Paul Landa was a leader in environmental protection and education.

In public life, he was called \"Paul Landa\".  He was a [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor]] member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] from 1973 to 1984, and the member for [[Electoral district of Peats|Peats]] in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] in 1984. He was a government minister from 1976 to 1984.\n\nLanda was born in [[St Peters, New South Wales|St Peters]] in [[Sydney]] to Maurice and Fay Landa, who were of [[Ireland|Irish]]/[[Poland|Polish]] descent and had migrated from [[Belfast]]. He was educated at [[Kogarah, New South Wales|Kogarah]] High School and [[Sydney Boys' High School]] in 1956-58,<ref name=\"SHSOBU\">{{cite web |title=Members of parliament and legislatures |url=https://www.shsobu.org.au/wp-content/uploads/mps.pdf |publisher=Sydney High School Old Boys Union |accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref> before studying for a [[Bachelor of Laws]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. He became a solicitor in 1964 and was admitted to the bar in 1974. On 17 December 1968, he married Annika. He was [[Jewish]].<ref name=nsw>{{cite NSW Parliament | title = The Hon. David Paul Landa |id=1980 |former=Yes |accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref>  He was the nephew of [[Abe Landa]], who was also a NSW Government Minister.\n\nIn 1973, Landa was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] as a Labor member. He became Minister for Industrial Relations in 1976, although later that year he became the [[Minister for Planning (New South Wales)|Minister for Planning]] and [[Minister for the Environment (New South Wales)|Environment]] and became Vice-President of the Executive Council. In that year he also became the Government's Leader in the Upper House. He became Education Minister in 1980, Energy Minister in 1981 and [[Attorney General of New South Wales|Attorney General]] in 1983. In 1984, he transferred to the lower house, winning the seat of [[Electoral district of Peats|Peats]].<ref name=green>{{cite web| last = Green  | first = Antony  | authorlink = Antony Green  | title = Contests for Peats  | work = NSW Election Database  | publisher = Parliament of New South Wales  | year = 2010  | url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/DistrictIndexes/Peats.htm| accessdate = 4 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nPaul Landa was Minister for the Environment in 1979 when he and the majority of NSW Cabinet Members travelled to Terania Creek in northern NSW to investigate the reasons behind the presence of around 300 protesters, and 100 police, at Terania Creek. The protesters were stopping logging from taking place within the Terania Creek rainforest. While Landa was fully supportive of the preservation of the rainforest and the stopping of logging it was his cabinet colleague [[Frank Walker (Australian politician)|Frank Walker]] who had brought the matter to the Government's attention.<ref>http://theluckygeneral.biz/2019/07/12/barbarians-at-the-gate-dont-let-them-destroy-murray-valley-national-park/</ref> After visiting Terania Creek themselves the Cabinet Members agreed that the Environmental Impact Study that the protesters were wanting would be carried out. The logging was stopped and never recommenced.\n\nWhen he became Minister for Education in 1980 Paul Landa distributed native trees to schools to enable the planting of native tree groves, including rainforest groves, in school grounds as a means of providing hands on environmental education to school children. At a time when protecting the environment was seen as radical, controversial and largely unnecessary Paul Landa was a leader in environmental protection and education. Much of his legacy, following his death, was carried on by Bob Carr as Minister for the Environment from 1984 to 1988.\n\nHe was generally seen as an outstanding politician who was probably destined for the party leadership, but later that year he died at [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]], while playing [[tennis]]. It is believed he suffered a [[heart attack]]. He was 43.\n\n==Legacy==\nThere is a public foreshore park in Pearl Beach (Gosford City, NSW), called \"Paul Landa Reserve\", dedicated to Paul Landa's service.\n\nSince 2004, the David Paul Landa Memorial Scholarship for Pianists has been awarded to a piano finalist in the [[Symphony Australia]] Young Performers Awards.

Before opening the club, Sanford Kellman had an impromptu party there and found that all the neighbors complained about the noise. Therefore, Sanford Kellman was required by the City government of San Francisco to soundproof the entire building at great expense, delaying the opening of the club for several months.<ref>Diebold, David ''Tribal Rites:San Francisco's Dance Music Phenomenon'' Northridge, California:1986--Time Warp Publishing--Pages 144</ref> On the opening night of the club in October 1977, groups of bare-chested men in jeans and construction hats carried [[I-Beam]]s on their shoulders into the club.\n\n==Dancing, DJs, Music, Clubs, and Events at the I-Beam==\n\nThe I-Beam began as a seven night a week gay club in 1977, the second largest  gay dance club in San Francisco.  The City Night Club also known as the Cabaret was the first large gay club in North Beach district. As the crowd left the I-Beam for the newer clubs South of Market such as The Trocadero and later on Dreamland, the I-Beam opened only for five days a week.  Randy Schiller who built the new sound system for the club was operating a recording studio where he had a long list of bands recording in his studio decided that we should reopen on Monday nights which started \"Monday Night Live.\" with local bands.\n\nInside the I-Beam the main room was forty feet by sixty feet.  There were [[Mylar]] covered [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] I-Beams hanging from the ceiling above the center of the dance floor.  At the entrance there were framed pictures of various [[astronomical objects]] such as [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[planet]]s put there by former astronomer Sanford Kellman.  Randall Schiller installed an award-winning sound system including lighting and later, video. There was a large room in the front near the entrance with [[pinball machine]]s and [[pool table]]s. Friday and Saturday nights at the I-Beam hosted [[heterosexual]] dance parties later on.\n\nThe club hosted [[I-Beam Sunday Night Tea Dance]]s, which took place from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Sunday night. Free passes to this popular [[tea dance]] were routinely handed out in the gay neighborhoods of San Francisco. Michael Garrett was the first dj to play there when it opened in 1977, immediately after which  [[Tim Rivers]]  was hired and played Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday nights. Eventually, a Sunday Tea Dance was added and Tim played the opening hours, 4 - 8 pm, after which [[Steve Fabus]] took over the 'tables. Steve played at the Sunday Night Tea Dance from 1977 to 1980.  From 1980 to its end in 1992 Michael Garrett was the primary [[DJ]]\u2014he played [[modern rock]] [[dance music]] by artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[The Cure]], [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]], [[Nine Inch Nails (band)|Nine Inch Nails]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Depeche Mode]], etc. Guest DJs Micheal Dinella and Jim Caldwell frequently created original remixes on the impressive DJ equipment.\n\nThe temperature inside the I-Beam was deliberately kept as warm as possible in order to encourage people to take off their shirts while they were dancing; sexual encounters in the bathrooms were a common occurrence.\n\nIn January 1988 three [[go-go box]]es (cubes four feet square with a black and white checkerboard pattern of squares one foot by one foot on top; thus the surface of each go-go box had a checkerboard pattern of 16 black and white squares) were installed in the club, and on Wednesday night, the [[Boy Club]] was held, for which young male [[Go-Go dancer]]s were hired by the I-Beam for the first time.  The Boy Club continued until the end of 1988.  From 1988 to 1992 many fun events were held at the I-Beam such as strip contests and appearances by [[List of gay porn stars|gay porn stars]] such as [[Lou Cass]].  Beginning in 1988, there was a [[hip-hop]] dance club that appealed to the [[African American]]s in the neighborhood.  In 1989, the year [[rave]] dances first started in San Francisco, Wednesday night became ''[[Acid house]] Night'' at the I-Beam.\n\nStarting on 28 July 1980 with The Lloyds and Ultrasheen, ''New Music Night'' was instituted on Monday night, and later Tuesdays at which emerging new rock groups played. With the temporary closing of The Fillmore Auditorium following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the I-Beam was able to book many bands that would otherwise have played the larger venue. Because of this the club was featuring live music up to four nights a week, usually Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, with the occasional Sunday afternoon 'matin\u00e9e' performance (a legendary Butthole Surfers show, among others). On Monday, November 14, 1988, The Escape Club performed, marking the only time a band with the current number one record on the Billboard Hot 100 chart ('Wild, Wild West', week of Nov. 12, 1988) played at the club.\n\nMonday nights became known as ''Monday Night Live!'' started by Randall Schiller and was originally booked by Alan Robinson and then Randy persuaded his employee Cathy Cohn to take over the booking, a [[KUSF (defunct)|KUSF]] DJ. After Cathy and Randy left, the booking duties for the club were handled by Anita Rivas, and eventually Eddie Jennings. Randall Schiller installed the latest EAW Loudspeaker system in the I-Beam as he was the first to introduce EAW to the Bay Area asa a long time dealer for the product. The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], and indie bands played the I-Beam from 1981 to 1992. Many well known groups played at the I-Beam such as The Birthday Party , A Certain Ratio, [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Killing Joke]], [[Gun Club]], [[The Chameleons UK]], [[Clan of Xymox]], [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Tones on Tail]], [[The Pursuit of Happiness (band)|The Pursuit of Happiness]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[The Church (band)|The Church]], [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], [[Pylon (band)|Pylon]], [[Faith No More]], [[The Fuzztones]], [[Gene Loves Jezebel]], [[Flesh For Lulu]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[The Legendary Pink Dots]], [[The Lemonheads]], [[Meat Beat Manifesto]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]], [[Big Black]], the [[Butthole Surfers]], [[10,000 Maniacs]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Firehose (band)|Firehose]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Trouble Funk]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Counting Crows]], [[Screaming Jay Hawkins]], [[Soul Asylum]], [[Camper Van Beethoven]], [[Gwar]], [[Henry Rollins]] Band, [[Jane's Addiction]], [[X (U.S. band)|X]], [[Specimen (band)|Specimen]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[The Slits]], [[Sugarcubes]], A House, [[Bush Tetras]], [[The Bangles]], [[Fear (band)|Fear]], [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]], [[The Wipers]], [[Translator (band)|Translator]], [[Wilma (band)|Wilma]], [[Tackhead]], [[The Mermen]], [[Meat Puppets]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Psychic TV]], Manufacture, The Rosemary's, Alice Donut, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Primitive Painters, [[T.S.O.L.]], [[Curve (band)|Curve]], [[Social Distortion]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], The Lloyds, [[Buck Naked and the Bare Bottom Boys|Buck Naked and the Bare-Bottom Boys]], and [[Chris Isaak]].<ref name=\"SF Boook\">{{cite book|last=Selvin|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Selvin|title=San Francisco, the Musical History Tour|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=1996|pages=53\u201354|isbn=0-8118-1007-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hxCLmGXGuHIC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=i-beam+tea+dances#PPA53,M1|language=}}</ref>\n\n==End of the I-Beam==\nThe I-Beam closed in 1994 after a long battle with neighbors over sound issues. Live [[Rock and roll|rock music]] shows over the last few years were few and far between.  The Sunday Night Tea Dance continued until July 1992, but the last year had few patrons because by that time [[house music]] had become more popular than modern rock among gays who liked to go dancing.\n\nNew Wave City, [[San Francisco]]'s First & Foremost 80's Dance Party, presented its \"Just Can't Get Enough\" event at the I-Beam on the last night of the I-Beam's operation, July 23, 1994.\n\nAfter the I-Beam closed, the building (originally the Park Masonic Hall), remained vacant and boarded up for 10 years until 2004, when it was torn down and a modern apartment house with retail shops at street level was constructed on the site.\n\n==I-Beam on Haight Street today==\n\nThe enduring ''Traxx'' bar is the only remaining vestige of upper Haight Street's gay scene {{As of|2008|lc=on}}; however Traxx is much smaller than the former I-Beam, and as a neighborhood bar (as opposed to a nightclub), it has no dance floor.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Diebold, David ''Tribal Rites:San Francisco's Dance Music Phenomenon'' Northridge, California:1986\u2014Time Warp Publishing--\"I-Beam\"  Pages 144-146.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.is/20130121192939/http://www.discomusic.com/clubs-more/3187_0_6_0_C/ Photos of the I-Beam and people's reminiscences about the I-Beam]\u2014at Discomusic.com/clubs.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:I-Beam (Nightclub)}}\n[[Category:Defunct LGBT nightclubs in California]]\n[[Category:Drinking establishments in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco]]\n[[Category:LGBT culture in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:LGBT history in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Nightclubs in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:1977 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:1994 disestablishments in California]]\n", "text_old": "{{coord|37|46|10|N|122|27|4|W|region:US-CA|display=title}}\n{{Original research|date=September 2008}}\n\nThe '''I-Beam''' was a popular [[nightclub]] in [[San Francisco]] that was located in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood at 1748 Haight Street.

(band)|R.E.M.]], [[Nine Inch Nails (band)|Nine Inch Nails]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Depeche Mode]], etc. Guest DJ's Micheal Dinella and Jim Caldwell frequently created original remixes on the impressive DJ equipment.\n\nThe temperature inside the I-Beam was deliberately kept as warm as possible in order to encourage people to take off their shirts while they were dancing; sexual encounters in the bathrooms were a common occurrence.\n\nIn January 1988 three [[go-go box]]es (cubes four feet square with a black and white checkerboard pattern of squares one foot by one foot on top; thus the surface of each go-go box had a checkerboard pattern of 16 black and white squares) were installed in the club, and on Wednesday night, the [[Boy Club]] was held, for which young male [[Go-Go dancer]]s were hired by the I-Beam for the first time.  The Boy Club continued until the end of 1988.  From 1988 to 1992 many fun events were held at the I-Beam such as strip contests and appearances by [[List of gay porn stars|gay porn stars]] such as [[Lou Cass]].  Beginning in 1988, there was a [[hip-hop]] dance club that appealed to the [[African American]]s in the neighborhood.  In 1989, the year [[rave]] dances first started in San Francisco, Wednesday night became ''[[Acid house]] Night'' at the I-Beam.\n\nStarting on 28 July 1980 with The Lloyds and Ultrasheen, ''New Music Night'' was instituted on Monday night, and later Tuesdays at which emerging new rock groups played. With the temporary closing of The Fillmore Auditorium following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the I-Beam was able to book many bands that would otherwise have played the larger venue. Because of this the club was featuring live music up to four nights a week, usually Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, with the occasional Sunday afternoon 'matin\u00e9e' performance (a legendary Butthole Surfers show, among others). On Monday, November 14, 1988, The Escape Club performed, marking the only time a band with the current number one record on the Billboard Hot 100 chart ('Wild, Wild West', week of Nov. 12, 1988) played at the club.\n\nMonday nights became known as ''Monday Night Live!'' started by Randall Schiller and was originally booked by Alan Robinson and then Randy persuaded his employee Cathy Cohn to take over the booking, a [[KUSF (defunct)|KUSF]] DJ. After Cathy and Randy left, the booking duties for the club were handled by Anita Rivas, and eventually Eddie Jennings. Randall Schiller installed the latest EAW Loudspeaker system in the I-Beam as he was the first to introduce EAW to the Bay Area asa a long time dealer for the product. The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], and indie bands played the I-Beam from 1981 to 1992. Many well known groups played at the I-Beam such as The Birthday Party , A Certain Ratio, [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Killing Joke]], [[Gun Club]], [[The Chameleons UK]], [[Clan of Xymox]], [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Tones on Tail]], [[The Pursuit of Happiness (band)|The Pursuit of Happiness]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[The Church (band)|The Church]], [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], [[Pylon (band)|Pylon]], [[Faith No More]], [[The Fuzztones]], [[Gene Loves Jezebel]], [[Flesh For Lulu]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[The Legendary Pink Dots]], [[The Lemonheads]], [[Meat Beat Manifesto]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]], [[Big Black]], the [[Butthole Surfers]], [[10,000 Maniacs]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Firehose (band)|Firehose]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Trouble Funk]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Counting Crows]], [[Screaming Jay Hawkins]], [[Soul Asylum]], [[Camper Van Beethoven]], [[Gwar]], [[Henry Rollins]] Band, [[Jane's Addiction]], [[X (U.S. band)|X]], [[Specimen (band)|Specimen]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[The Slits]], [[Sugarcubes]], A House, [[Bush Tetras]], [[The Bangles]], [[Fear (band)|Fear]], [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]], [[The Wipers]], [[Translator (band)|Translator]], [[Wilma (band)|Wilma]], [[Tackhead]], [[The Mermen]], [[Meat Puppets]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Psychic TV]], Manufacture, The Rosemary's, Alice Donut, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Primitive Painters, [[T.S.O.L.]], [[Curve (band)|Curve]], [[Social Distortion]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], The Lloyds, [[Buck Naked and the Bare Bottom Boys|Buck Naked and the Bare-Bottom Boys]], and [[Chris Isaak]].<ref name=\"SF Boook\">{{cite book|last=Selvin|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Selvin|title=San Francisco, the Musical History Tour|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=1996|pages=53\u201354|isbn=0-8118-1007-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hxCLmGXGuHIC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=i-beam+tea+dances#PPA53,M1|language=}}</ref>\n\n==End of the I-Beam==\nThe I-Beam closed in 1994 after a long battle with neighbors over sound issues. Live [[Rock and roll|rock music]] shows over the last few years were few and far between.  The Sunday Night Tea Dance continued until July 1992, but the last year had few patrons because by that time [[house music]] had become more popular than modern rock among gays who liked to go dancing.\n\nNew Wave City, [[San Francisco]]'s First & Foremost 80's Dance Party, presented its \"Just Can't Get Enough\" event at the I-Beam on the last night of the I-Beam's operation, July 23, 1994.\n\nAfter the I-Beam closed, the building (originally the Park Masonic Hall), remained vacant and boarded up for 10 years until 2004, when it was torn down and a modern apartment house with retail shops at street level was constructed on the site.\n\n==I-Beam on Haight Street today==\n\nThe enduring ''Traxx'' bar is the only remaining vestige of upper Haight Street's gay scene {{As of|2008|lc=on}}; however Traxx is much smaller than the former I-Beam, and as a neighborhood bar (as opposed to a nightclub), it has no dance floor.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Diebold, David ''Tribal Rites:San Francisco's Dance Music Phenomenon'' Northridge, California:1986\u2014Time Warp Publishing--\"I-Beam\"  Pages 144-146.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.is/20130121192939/http://www.discomusic.com/clubs-more/3187_0_6_0_C/ Photos of the I-Beam and people's reminiscences about the I-Beam]\u2014at Discomusic.com/clubs.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:I-Beam (Nightclub)}}\n[[Category:Defunct LGBT nightclubs in California]]\n[[Category:Drinking establishments in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco]]\n[[Category:LGBT culture in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:LGBT history in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Nightclubs in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:1977 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:1994 disestablishments in California]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-Beam_(nightclub)"}

The company was headed by the station's new General Manager, Nick J. Pollacia, Jr. (The name \"Pene\" was chosen because it was the name of Nick Pollacia, Jr's sister) Pene Broadcasting is a family owned organization, and at the time of KLLA's purchase, plans were also being simultaneously made to build a completely new FM radio station for the Leesville, and Vernon Parish broadcasting area.  That station was to become KJAE.\n\nIn early 1980 the station was granted a FCC permit to begin construction of a Class 'A' FM station with a licensed power originally of 3,000 watts broadcasting at 92.7 on the FM dial. Later in the 1980s KJAE's frequency would be changed by the FCC to 93.5.\n\nPlanning for the new FM station had been handled out of the original broadcast facilities of KJAE's older sister station KLLA. However that original station's location was deemed too small to support the new studio and control facilities necessary for both KLLA and KJAE, so a new physical plant building was constructed.  This building was separate but also located at the same site as the older building. The original station building still stands today, and is used as a storage facility.\n\nThe new facility was much larger building and more than doubled the original space of the older station. It was one that could more comfortably contain both of the two stations broadcast & production studios, and transmitter & equipment control rooms, as well as offices for management, sales and engineering.(two stations operated separately in one building) Anticipatory construction on the facilities had begun in late 1979, and so, final construction on the FM portion was completed in late summer of 1980.\n\nActual first broadcast operations for KJAE began in the fall of 1980 with the grant of the first FCC license to broadcast. The original KLLA had operated for years with a basically split format that was basically country music in the morning at sign on, and then rock & popular music from noon to sign off, with Christian programming on Sunday mornings. However KJAE had always been meant to be programmed entirely as a country station from sign on to sign off. So when KJAE signed on the air in early 1980, KLLA became a rock music station all day from sign on to sign off. Thus the two stations served the two dominant mainstream forms of music for Leesville & Vernon Parish.  Very popular morning and afternoon shows were created, as well as frequent mobile onsite remote broadcasts that are popular to this day.  Pollacia inaugurated the very well received and popular seasonal broadcasts of the football games of the Leesville High School Wampus Cats, whether they were home games or away, they were also broadcast by remote.\n\nIn the mid 70's, just prior to the dawn of live syndicated broadcasting via satellite link, a new form of syndicated all-day programming had been introduced. With this automated format it was possible for two stations operating out of one building to more or less be handled by one staff member. This System operated by using an early form of computerized automation system to control four large 10.5\" 2-track open reel to reel tape decks, two commercial holding rotating carousels for carts, a voice tape/music tape synchronizer and an early computer system to control the entire system.  The hardware system itself was marketed by SMC, or the Sono-Mag Corporation. But it needed the separate all important programming itself, and this was the Top American Country programming created for these automation systems by Century 21 Productions of Dallas, Tx.\n\nEach week a large box arrived via priority mail at the station that contained new 10.5 inch large reel tapes. Two would have the new current & upcoming hits on them in different combinations of two together, and another two reels would have a \"Recurrent\" reel that was music that had just fallen off the charts recently, and an oldie tape and then the all-important voice track tapes.  It was all very organized to program an entire week, 24 hours a day. A 7-day printed set of pages showed exactly where each song on the different decks would be rotated onto the air. Voice tapes ran just like live DJs, and they used these same schedules to record their voice tracks. One 'DJ' would come on for four hours for each section of the day starting at 0600 each day. Century 21 used some of the biggest names in country music radio DJs from across the country to record these tapes.  The automated synchronizer and the SMC system carried out a good deal of the days programming, while KLLA itself remained live with separate DJs for its broadcast day.\n\nImmediately after going on the air at 0600, KJAE went live for three hours until 0900, and it was the first morning radio show in Vernon Parish that was done live.  It had been started on KLLA by owner/manager Nick Pollacia, and when KJAE came on line it transferred over to that new station. The incredibly popular program \"Swap Shop\" was also created by Mr. Pollacia on KLLA airing at 0900 in the morning, and after transferring to KJAE, has continued non-stop to this day.  It remains a regular favorite with listeners.\n\nThe automated programming on KJAE was only done until around 1983 or so. Then it was done live for some years until the readily available live satellite programming was used to fill the parts of the night & day when the station was not actually live.  Many segments of the day are currently done live.\n\nMr. Pollacia left the station in the mid 80's to pursue other opportunities. The day-to-day operation and the station's management was passed into the capable hands of his sister, Mrs. Pene Scoggins. She remains the station's longest active employee/owner, having had a strong influence in the day-to-day operations of both stations since their ownership began in 1975.\n  \nOn January 20, 2000, the station upgraded to its current facilities of 7,500 watts (however, the station jokes about upgrading to 500,000 watts on its website).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kjae935.com/Main/About.htm |title=KJAE History page |access-date=2008-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708222112/http://www.kjae935.com/Main/About.htm |archive-date=2008-07-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{FM station data|KJAE}}\n\n{{Fort Polk South Radio}}\n{{Country Radio Stations in Louisiana}}\n\n[[Category:Country radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Vernon Parish, Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1980]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox radio station \n| name            = KJAE \n| city            = [[Leesville, Louisiana|Leesville]], [[Louisiana]] \n| slogan          = \"93-5 K-J All American Country\"  \n| frequency       = 93.5 [[Megahertz|MHz]]  \n| format          = [[Country music|Country]] \n| erp             = 7,500 [[watt]]s \n| haat            = 100 meters \n| class           = C3 \n| facility_id     = 52140 \n| coordinates     = {{coord|31|8|28|N|93|17|41|W|region:US-LA_type:landmark|display=inline,title}} \n| owner           = Pene Broadcasting Company INC \n| website         = [http://www.kjae935.com/ KJAE Website]\n| sister_stations = [[KLLA]] \n|}}\n\n'''KJAE''' (93.5 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is a [[radio station]] broadcasting a [[country music]] format.

A test model was constructed in October 1982 to verify the functionality of the hardware, after which work began on programming tools. Because 65xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time, no cross-development software was available and it had to be produced from scratch. Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an [[PC-8000 series|NEC PC-8001]] computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time.<ref name=\"DevHistory\">{{Cite journal|last=\u9ad8\u91ce|first=\u96c5\u6674|date=1995-01-16|title=\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u958b\u767a\u7269\u8a9e|url=https://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/special/20081002/1019327/|journal=\u65e5\u7d4c\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9|language=ja|publisher=[[Nikkei Business Publications]]|oclc=5530170|access-date=2019-06-06|via=Nikkei Trendy Net}}</ref>\n\nThe code name for the project was \"GameCom\", but Masayuki Uemura's wife proposed the name \"Famicom\", arguing that \"In Japan, 'pasokon' is used to mean a personal computer, but it is neither a home or personal computer. Perhaps we could say it is a family computer.\" Meanwhile, Hiroshi Yamauchi decided that the console should use a red and white theme after seeing a billboard for DX Antenna (a Japanese antenna manufacturer) which used those colors.<ref name=\"DevHistory\" />\n\nThe creation of the Famicom was hugely influenced by the [[ColecoVision]], [[Coleco]]'s competition against the [[Atari 2600]] in the United States. Takao Sawano, chief manager of the project, brought a ColecoVision home to his family, who were impressed by the system's capability to produce smooth graphics at the time,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u9ad8\u91ce|first=\u96c5\u6674|date=1995-01-16|title=\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u958b\u767a\u7269\u8a9e|url=https://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/special/20081002/1019378/|journal=\u65e5\u7d4c\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9|language=ja|publisher=[[Nikkei Business Publications]]|oclc=5530170|access-date=2019-06-07|via=Nikkei Trendy Net}}</ref> which contrasts with the flicker and slowdown commonly seen on Atari 2600 games. Uemura, head of Famicom development, stated that the ColecoVision set the bar for the Famicom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/deciding-on-the-specs/|title=GlitterBerri's Game Translations \u00bb Deciding on the Specs|website=Glitterberri.com}}</ref>\n\nOriginal plans called for the Famicom's cartridges to be the size of a cassette tape, but ultimately they ended up being twice as big. Careful design attention was paid to the cartridge connectors because loose and faulty connections often plagued arcade machines. As it necessitated 60 connection lines for the memory and expansion, Nintendo decided to produce its own connectors.<ref name=\"DevHistory\" />\n\nThe controllers are hard-wired to the console with no connectors for cost reasons. The game pad controllers were more-or-less copied directly from the Game & Watch machines, although the Famicom design team originally wanted to use arcade-style joysticks, even dismantling some from American game consoles to see how they worked. There were concerns regarding the durability of the joystick design and that children might step on joysticks on the floor. Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game & Watch [[D-pad]] to the Famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and caused no discomfort. Ultimately though, they installed a 15-pin expansion port on the front of the console so that an optional arcade-style joystick could be used.<ref name=\"DevHistory\" />\n\n[[Gunpei Yokoi]] suggested an eject lever to the cartridge slot which is not really necessary, but he believed that children could be entertained by pressing it. Uemura adopted his idea. Uemura added a microphone to the second controller with the idea that it could be used to make players' voices sound through the TV speaker.<ref>[http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/synonymous-with-the-domestic-game-console/ GlitterBerri's Game Translations \u00bb Synonymous With the Domestic Game Console].

The deal was set to be finalized and signed at the Summer [[International CES|Consumer Electronics Show]] in June 1983. However, Atari discovered at that show that its competitor Coleco was illegally demonstrating its [[Coleco Adam]] computer with Nintendo's ''Donkey Kong'' game. This violation of Atari's exclusive license with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of Nintendo's game console marketing contract with Atari.

Although it ended up having a short product lifespan, R.O.B. was initially used to market the NES as novel and sophisticated compared to previous game consoles.]]\n\nThe system's launch represented not only a new product, but also a reframing of the severely damaged home video game market. The 1983 video game crash had occurred in large part due to a lack of consumer and retailer confidence in video games, which had been partially due to confusion and misrepresentation in video game marketing. Prior to the NES, the packaging of many video games presented bombastic artwork which exaggerated the graphics of the actual game. In terms of product identity, a single game such as ''[[Pac-Man]]'' would appear in many versions on many different game consoles and computers, with large variations in graphics, sound, and general quality between the versions. In stark contrast, Nintendo's marketing strategy aimed to regain consumer and retailer confidence by delivering a singular platform whose technology was not in need of exaggeration and whose qualities were clearly defined.\n\nTo differentiate Nintendo's new home platform from the perception of a troubled and shallow video game market still reeling from the 1983 crash, the company freshened its product nomenclature and established a strict product approval and licensing policy. The overall platform is referred to as \"Entertainment System\" instead of a \"video game system\", is centered upon a machine called a \"Control Deck\" instead of a \"console\", and features software cartridges called \"Game Paks\" instead of \"video games\". This allowed Nintendo to gain more traction in selling the system in toy stores.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=NES |url=http://g4tv.com/gamemakers/episodes/4844/NES.html |series=Icons |serieslink=Icons (TV series) |credits= |network=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] |airdate=December 1, 2005 |season=4 |number=5010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016233741/http://www.g4tv.com/gamemakers/episodes/4844/NES.html |archivedate=October 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/25smartest/index22.shtml |title=25 Smartest Moments in Gaming |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |page=22 |date=July 21\u201325, 2003 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902124439/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/25smartest/index22.shtml |archivedate=September 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> To deter production of games which had not been licensed by Nintendo, and to prevent copying, the [[10NES]] [[lockout chip]] system act as a lock-and-key coupling of each Game Pak and Control Deck.

It features a more subdued gray, black, and red color scheme. An expansion port was found on the bottom of the unit and the cartridge connector [[pinout]] was changed.\n\n<!-- PAL-A -->\nIn the UK, Italy and Australia which share the PAL-A region, two versions of the NES were released; the \"Mattel Version\" and \"NES Version\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2010/12/gycw-nes-ports-1-contra/ |title=Guru Larry's Retrospective on the regional variations and releases of the European Nintendo Entertainment System |publisher=Blisteredthumbs.net |accessdate=October 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927105841/http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2010/12/gycw-nes-ports-1-contra/ |archivedate=September 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> When the NES was first released in those countries, it was distributed by Mattel and Nintendo decided to use a lockout chip specific to those countries, different from the chip used in other European countries. When Nintendo took over European distribution in 1990, it produced consoles that were then labelled \"NES Version\"; therefore, the only differences between the two are the text on the front flap and texture on the top/bottom of the casing.\n\n<!-- NES-101 -->\n[[File:NES-101-Console-Set.jpg|right|thumb|The NES-101 control deck alongside its similarly redesigned NES-039 [[game controller]].]]\nIn October 1993, Nintendo redesigned the NES to follow many of the same design cues as the newly introduced [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the Japanese Super Famicom. Like the SNES, the [[Nintendo Entertainment System (Model NES-101)|NES-101]] model loads cartridges through a covered slot on top of the unit replacing the complicated mechanism of the earlier design.\n\n<!-- HVC-101 -->\n[[File:New Famicom.jpg|right|thumb|The HVC-101 control deck alongside its similarly redesigned HVC-102 game controller.]]\nIn December 1993, the Famicom received a similar redesign. It also loads cartridges through a covered slot on the top of the unit and uses non-hardwired controllers. Because HVC-101 uses composite video output instead of being RF only like the HVC-001, Nintendo marketed the newer model as the {{nihongo foot|'''AV Famicom'''.|AV\u4ed5\u69d8\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3|Eibui Shiy\u014d Famikon|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} Since the new controllers don't have microphones on them like the second controller on the original console, certain games such as the Disk System version of ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''[[Raid on Bungeling Bay]]'' have certain tricks that cannot be replicated when played on an HVC-101 Famicom without a modified controller. In October 1987, Nintendo released a 3D [[Stereoscopic video game|stereoscopic]] headset called the [[Famicom 3D System]] (HVC-031) in Japan only.\n\n===Design flaws===\n[[File:Nintendo-Entertainment-System-NES-Deconstruction-03.jpg|thumb|right|The VCR-like loading mechanism of the NES led to problems over time. The design wears connector pins out quickly and easily become dirty, resulting in difficulties with the NES reading Game Paks.]]\n\nNintendo's design styling for US release was made deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. One result of this philosophy is to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading [[zero insertion force]] (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]. The newly designed connector works quite well when both the connector and the cartridges are clean and the pins on the connector are new. Unfortunately, the ''ZIF connector'' is not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserts the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bends the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge's ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges cause the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years{{dubious|date=March 2020}} and the ZIF design prove more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector.<ref name=\"zif\">{{cite web | first=Benj | last=Edwards | title=No More Blinkies: Replacing the NES's 72-Pin Cartridge Connector | url=http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/13 | work=Vintage Computing and Gaming | date=November 7, 2005 | accessdate=June 3, 2007}}</ref> These design issues are exacerbated by Nintendo's choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors are also prone to [[tarnish]]ing.

Hobbyists in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip's mode of operation from \"lock\" to \"key\", removing all effects and greatly improving the console's ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions have different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region do not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are these: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip); most of Europe (3195); Asia (3196); and UK, Italy, and Australia (3197). Because two types of lockout chip were released in Europe, European NES game boxes often have an \"A\" or \"B\" letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Games in the rest of Europe typically have text on the box stating \"This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\". Similarly, UK/Italy/Australia games state \"This game is only compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\".\n\nProblems with the [[10NES]] lockout chip frequently result in the console's most infamous problem: the blinking red power light, in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly because the 10NES would reset the console once per second. The lockout chip required constant communication with the chip in the game to work.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|247}} Dirty, aging, and bent connectors often disrupt the communication, resulting in the blink effect.<ref name=\"zif\"/> Alternatively, the console would turn on but only show a solid white, gray, or green screen. Users may attempt to solve this problem by blowing air onto the cartridge connectors, inserting the cartridge just far enough to get the ZIF to lower, licking the edge connector, slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge, shifting the cartridge from side to side after insertion, pushing the ZIF up and down repeatedly, holding the ZIF down lower than it should have been, and cleaning the connectors with alcohol. Many of the most frequent attempts to fix this problem instead risk damaging the cartridge or system.<ref>{{cite web |title=Did Blowing into Nintendo Cartridges Really Help? |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/12589/did-blowing-nintendo-cartridges-really-help |website=MentalFloss |accessdate=July 12, 2018 |language=en |date=September 24, 2012}}</ref> In 1989, Nintendo released an official NES Cleaning Kit to help users clean malfunctioning cartridges and consoles.\n\nWith the release of the top-loading [[Nintendo Entertainment System (Model NES-101)|NES-101]] (NES 2) toward the end of the NES's lifespan, Nintendo resolved the problems by switching to a standard [[card edge connector]] and eliminating the lockout chip. All of the Famicom systems use standard card edge connectors, as do Nintendo's two subsequent game consoles, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the [[Nintendo 64]].\n\nIn response to these hardware flaws, \"Nintendo Authorized Repair Centers\" sprang up across the U.S. According to Nintendo, the authorization program was designed to ensure that the machines were properly repaired. Nintendo would ship the necessary replacement parts only to shops that had enrolled in the authorization program. In practice, the authorization process consisted of nothing more than paying a fee to Nintendo for the privilege.\n\n===Famicom 3D System===\nNintendo released a [[Stereoscopic video game|stereoscopic]] headset peripheral called [[Famicom 3D System]].

The sizes of NES games vary from 8 kB (''Galaxian'') to 1 MB (''Metal Slader Glory''), but 128 to 384&nbsp;kB is the most common.\n\nThe NES<ref>{{cite web|url=http://problemkaputt.de/everynes.htm|title=NES Specifications|website=Problemkaputt.de|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> uses a custom-made [[Picture Processing Unit]] (PPU) developed by [[Ricoh]]. All variations of the PPU feature 2&nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]] of video RAM, 256&nbsp;bytes of on-die \"object attribute memory\" (OAM) to store the positions, colors, and tile indices of up to 64 [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] on the screen, and 28&nbsp;bytes of on-die palette RAM to allow selection of background and sprite colors. The console's 2&nbsp;kB of onboard RAM may be used for tile maps and attributes on the NES board and 8&nbsp;kB of tile pattern ROM or RAM may be included on a cartridge. The system has an available [[Palette (computing)|color palette]] of 48 colors and 6 grays. Up to 25 simultaneous colors may be used without writing new values mid-frame: a background color, four sets of three tile colors, and four sets of three sprite colors. The NES palette is based on NTSC rather than RGB values. A total of 64 sprites may be displayed onscreen at a given time without reloading sprites mid-screen. The standard [[display resolution]] of the NES is 256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels.\n\nVideo output connections vary between console models. The original HVC-001 model of the Family Computer features only [[RF modulator|radio frequency (RF) modulator]] output. The North American and European consoles have support for composite video through [[RCA connector]]s in addition to the RF modulator. The HVC-101 model of the Famicom omits the RF modulator entirely and has composite video output via a proprietary 12-pin \"multi-out\" connector first introduced on the Super Famicom and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Conversely, the North American re-released NES-101 model most closely resembles the original HVC-001 model Famicom, in that it features RF modulator output only.<ref name=\"20years\" /> Finally, the PlayChoice-10 utilizes an inverted RGB video output.\n\nThe stock NES supports a total of five sound channels, two of which are pulse channels with 4 pulse width settings, one is a triangle wave generator, another is a noise generator (often used for percussion), and the fifth one plays low-quality digital samples.\n\nThe NES supports expansion chips contained in certain cartridges to add sound channels and help with data processing. Developers can add these chips to their games, such as the Konami VRC6, Konami VRC7, Sunsoft 5B, Namco 163, and two more by Nintendo itself: the Nintendo FDS wave generator (a modified Ricoh RP2C33 chip <!-- (including [[Programmable sound generator|PSG]] + [[DPCM]]) --> with single-cycle wave [[table-lookup synthesis|table-lookup sound]] support), and the Nintendo [[Memory Management Controller]] 5 (MMC5).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famitracker.com/wiki/index.php?title=Sound_hardware|title=Sound hardware|website=Famitracker.com|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> Due to wiring differences between the Famicom and NES, a stock NES console is incapable of passing through audio generated by expansion chips utilizing additional sound channels, but can be modified to regain this capability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrofixes.com/2014/05/open-hidden-sound-channels-in-nes.html|title=Open Hidden Sound Channels in the NES|website=Retrofixes.com|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://curriculumcrasher.com/2017/01/24/nes-expanded-audio-100k-pot-mod/|title=NES Expanded Audio: 100k Pot Mod|website=Curriculumcrasher.com|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{further | Memory management controller}}\n\n===Accessories===\n{{See also|List of Nintendo Entertainment System accessories}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Entertainment-System-NES-Controller-FL.jpg|thumb|right|In addition to featuring a revised color scheme that matched the more subdued tones of the console itself, NES controllers are detached and lack the microphone featured in Famicom controllers.]]\n\n===={{anchor|Game_controllers}}Controllers====\nThe [[game controller]] used for both the NES and the Famicom features an oblong brick-like design with a simple four button layout: two round buttons labeled \"A\" and \"B\", a \"START\" button, and a \"SELECT\" button.<ref name=\"NESBooklet\">{{cite book | title =Nintendo Entertainment System Instruction Booklet | publisher =Nintendo | year =1989 | page =5 }}</ref> Additionally, the controllers utilize the cross-shaped [[D-pad|joypad]], designed by Nintendo employee [[Gunpei Yokoi]] for Nintendo [[Game & Watch]] systems, to replace the bulkier [[joystick]]s on earlier gaming consoles' controllers.<ref name=\"Ultimate History\"/>{{rp|279}}\n\nThe original model Famicom features two game controllers, both of which are hardwired to the back of the console.

Both controllers have a Turbo feature, where one press of the button represents multiple automatic rapid presses. This feature allows players to shoot much faster in shooter games. The NES Advantage has two knobs that adjust the firing rate of the turbo button from quick to Turbo, as well as a \"Slow\" button that slows down compatible games by rapidly pausing the game. The NES Max has a non-adjustable Turbo feature and no \"Slow\" feature, and has a wing-like handheld shape and a sleek directional pad. Turbo functionality exists on the [[NES Satellite]], the [[NES Four Score]], and the [[U-Force]]. Other accessories include the Power Pad and the [[Power Glove]], which is featured in the movie ''[[The Wizard (1989 film)|The Wizard]]''.\n\nNear the end of the NES's lifespan, upon the release of the AV Famicom and the top-loading NES 2, the design of the game controllers was modified slightly. Though the original button layout was retained, the controller's shape resembles that of the SNES's controller. In addition, the AV Famicom dropped the hardwired controllers in favor of detachable controller ports. The controllers included with the Famicom AV have 90&nbsp;cm (3 feet) long cables, compared to the 180&nbsp;cm (6 feet) of NES controllers.<ref name=\"AVFamicom\">{{cite web |first =Benj |last=Edwards |url=http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/73 |title=Gotta Love That Fresh \"AV Famicom Smell\" |work=Vintage Computing and Gaming |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe original NES controller has become one of the most recognizable symbols of the console.

It contains RAM for the game to load into and an extra single-cycle wave [[table-lookup synthesis|table-lookup]] sound chip. The disks are used both for storing the game and saving progress, with a total capacity of 128k (64k per side). The disks were originally obtained from [[kiosk]]s in malls and other public places where buyers could select a game and have it written to the disk. This process cost less than cartridges and users could take the disk back to a vending booth and have it rewritten with a new game, or the high score faxed to Nintendo for national leaderboard contests.\n\n{{further|Family Computer Disk System#Disk Writer and Disk Fax kiosks}}\n\nA variety of games for the FDS were released by Nintendo (including some which had already been released on cartridge, such as ''Super Mario Bros.''), and third party companies such as Konami, Taito, or unlicensed publishers. Its limitations became quickly apparent as larger ROM chips were introduced, allowing cartridges with greater than 128k of space. More advanced memory management chips (MMC) soon appeared and the FDS quickly became obsolete. Nintendo also charged developers high prices to produce FDS games, and many refused to develop for it, instead continuing to make cartridge games.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} After only two years, the FDS was discontinued, although vending booths remained in place until 1993 and Nintendo continued to service drives, and to rewrite and offer replacement disks until 2003. Approximately four million drives were sold.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nNintendo did not release the Disk System outside Japan due to numerous problems encountered with the medium in Japan, and due to the increasing data storage capacity and reducing cost of the highly reliable cartridge medium.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Life |first1=Nintendo |title=Feature: Slipped Disk - The History of the Famicom Disk System |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2010/11/feature_slipped_disk_the_history_of_the_famicom_disk_system |website=Nintendo Life |accessdate=July 12, 2018 |date=November 20, 2010}}</ref> As a result, many Disk System games such as ''Castlevania'', ''The Legend of Zelda'', and ''Bubble Bobble'' were converted to cartridge format for their export releases, resulting in simplified sound and the disk save function replaced by either password or battery save systems.\n\n===Hardware clones===\n[[File:FC-Twin-Console-Set-H.jpg|thumb|right|Pirated clones of NES hardware remained in production for many years after the original had been discontinued.

Initially, such clones were popular in markets where Nintendo never issued a legitimate version of the console. In particular, the [[Dendy (console)|Dendy]] ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u0414\u0435\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0438}}), an unlicensed hardware clone produced in Taiwan and sold in the former [[Soviet Union]], emerged as the most popular video game console of its time in that setting and it enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to that experienced by the NES/Famicom in North America and Japan. A range of Famicom clones was marketed in Argentina during the late 1980s and early 1990s under the name of [[Family Game NES Clone|\"Family Game\"]], resembling the original hardware design. The [[Micro Genius]] ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]]: \u5c0f\u5929\u624d) was marketed in Southeast Asia as an alternative to the Famicom; Samurai was the popular [[PAL]] alternative to the NES; and in Central Europe, especially Poland, the [[Pegasus (console)|Pegasus]] was available.<ref>[http://www.pegasus-gry.com/pegasus-iq-502.php Pegasus IQ-502] Polish review of the most popular NES / Famicom clone \u2013 Pegasus IQ-502</ref> Since 1989, there were many Brazilian clones of NES,<ref name=\"nearchive\" /> and the very popular Phantom System (with hardware superior to the original console) caught the attention of Nintendo itself.<ref name=\"nintendopedia\" />\n\n[[File:RetroUSB-AVS-Console-wController-FL.jpg|thumb|right|The RetroUSB AVS, an [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA-based]] hardware clone of the NES that outputs 720p via [[HDMI]].]]\nThe unlicensed clone market has flourished following Nintendo's discontinuation of the NES.

Many of the clone vendors have included built-in copies of licensed Nintendo software, which constitutes copyright infringement in most countries.\n\nAlthough most hardware clones were not produced under license by Nintendo, certain companies were granted licenses to produce NES-compatible devices. The [[Sharp Corporation]] produced at least two such clones: the [[Twin Famicom]] and the [[C1 NES TV|SHARP 19SC111]] television.

All licensed NTSC and PAL cartridges are a standard shade of gray plastic, with the exception of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' and ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'', which were manufactured in gold-plastic carts. Unlicensed carts were produced in black, robin egg blue, and gold, and are all slightly different shapes than standard NES cartridges. Nintendo also produced yellow-plastic carts for internal use at Nintendo Service Centers, although these \"test carts\" were never made available for purchase. All licensed US cartridges were made by Nintendo, Konami, and Acclaim. For promotion of ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]'', Capcom sent 150 limited-edition gold NES cartridges with the original game, featuring the ''Remastered'' art as the sticker, to different gaming news agencies. The instruction label on the back includes the opening lyric from the [[DuckTales|show]]'s theme song, \"Life is like a hurricane\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/08/07/capcom-39-s-golden-ducktales-promotional-cartridge-is-actually-ducktales.aspx|title=Capcom's Golden DuckTales Promotional Cartridge Is Actually DuckTales|last=Hilliard|first=Kyle|work=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFamicom cartridges are shaped slightly differently. Unlike NES games, official Famicom cartridges were produced in many colors of plastic. Adapters, similar in design to the popular accessory [[Game Genie]], are available that allow Famicom games to be played on an NES. In Japan, several companies manufactured the cartridges for the Famicom.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|61}} This allowed these companies to develop their own customized chips designed for specific purposes, such as superior sound and graphics.\n\n===Third-party licensing===\n[[File:Famicom Family logo.svg|thumb|right|The Famicom Family mark appeared in games and peripherals from 1988 that were approved by Nintendo for compatibility with official Famicom consoles and derivatives.]]\nNintendo's near monopoly on the home video game market left it with a dominant influence over the industry. Unlike Atari, which never actively pursued third-party developers (and even went to court in an attempt to force [[Activision]] to cease production of [[Atari 2600]] games), Nintendo had anticipated and encouraged the involvement of third-party software developers, though strictly on Nintendo's terms.<ref name=\"archive1\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080320090353/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/index23.shtml GameSpy.com \u2013 Article].

However, they found resistance with United States based game developers including [[Atari]], [[Activision]], [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Epyx]] refusing Nintendo's one-sided terms. [[Acclaim Entertainment]], a fledgling game publisher founded by former Activision employees, would be the first major third-party licensee based out of the United States to sign on with Nintendo in late 1987.

Nintendo required that it be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges, and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the risk. As a result, some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games. Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers, which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system, order at least 10,000 cartridges, and only make five games per year.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|214\u2013215}} The global [[chip famine|1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips]] reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit an average of 25% of publishers' requests for cartridges, with some receiving much higher amounts and others almost none.<ref name=\"keizer198809\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-09-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_100_1988_Sep#page/n7/mode/2up | title=Games Hot, but Cartridges Cool | work=Compute! | date=September 1988 | accessdate=November 10, 2013 | author=Keizer, Gregg | page=8}}</ref> [[GameSpy]] noted that Nintendo's \"iron-clad terms\" made the company many enemies during the 1980s. Some developers tried to circumvent the five game limit by creating additional company brands like [[Konami]]'s [[Ultra Games]] label and others tried circumventing the 10NES chip.<ref name=\"archive1\" />\n\n{{further | #Unlicensed games}}\n\nNintendo was accused of [[Competition law|antitrust]] behavior because of the strict licensing requirements.<ref name=\"U.S. Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit 1992\">{{cite web |author1=U.S. Court of Appeals |author2=Federal Circuit |year=1992 |title=Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc. |work=Digital Law Online |url=http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1015.htm |accessdate=March 30, 2005}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Justice]] and several states began probing Nintendo's business practices, leading to the involvement of Congress and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC). The FTC conducted an extensive investigation which included interviewing hundreds of retailers. During the FTC probe, Nintendo changed the terms of its publisher licensing agreements to eliminate the two-year rule and other restrictive terms. Nintendo and the FTC settled the case in April 1991, with Nintendo required to send vouchers giving a $5 discount off to a new game, to every person that had purchased a NES game between June 1988 and December 1990. GameSpy remarked that Nintendo's punishment was particularly weak giving the case's findings, although it has been speculated that the FTC did not want to damage the video game industry in the United States.<ref name=\"archive1\" />\n\nWith the NES near its end of its life many third-party publishers such as [[Electronic Arts]] supported upstart competing consoles with less strict licensing terms such as the [[Sega Genesis]] and then the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which eroded and then took over Nintendo's dominance in the home console market, respectively. Consoles from Nintendo's rivals in the post-SNES era had always enjoyed much stronger third-party support than Nintendo, which relied more heavily on first-party games.\n\n====Unlicensed games====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Templeofdoomtengen.png|thumb|Most unlicensed game cartridges differed from the standard gray cartridges.]] -->\nCompanies that refused to pay the licensing fee or were rejected by Nintendo found ways to circumvent the console's authentication system. Most of these companies created circuits that use a voltage spike to temporarily disable the 10NES chip.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|286}} A few unlicensed games released in Europe and Australia are in the form of a [[Software protection dongle|dongle]] to connect to a licensed game, in order to use the licensed game's 10NES chip for authentication. To combat unlicensed games, Nintendo of America threatened retailers who sold them with losing their supply of licensed games, and multiple revisions were made to the NES PCBs to prevent unlicensed games from working.\n\n[[Atari Games]] took a different approach with its line of NES products, [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]]. The company attempted to [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] the lockout chip to develop its own \"Rabbit\" chip. Tengen also obtained a description of the lockout chip from the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] by falsely claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims. Nintendo successfully sued Tengen for [[copyright]] infringement. Tengen's [[Competition law|antitrust]] claims against Nintendo were never decided.<ref name=\"U.S. Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit 1992\" />\n\n[[Color Dreams]] made [[Christian video games]] under the subsidiary name [[Wisdom Tree]]. Historian Steven Kent wrote, \"Wisdom Tree presented Nintendo with a prickly situation. The general public did not seem to pay close attention to the court battle with Atari Games, and industry analysts were impressed with Nintendo's legal acumen; but going after a tiny company that published innocuous religious games was another story.\"<ref name=\"Ultimate History\"/>{{rp|400}}\n\n===Game rentals===\nAs the Nintendo Entertainment System grew in popularity and entered millions of American homes, some small [[video rental shop]]s began buying their own copies of NES games, and renting them out to customers for around the same price as a [[Videotape|video cassette]] rental for a few days. Nintendo received no profit from the practice beyond the initial cost of their game, and unlike movie rentals, a newly released game could hit store shelves and be available for rent on the same day. Nintendo took steps to stop game rentals, but didn't take any formal legal action until [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Video]] began to make game rentals a large-scale service. Nintendo claimed that allowing customers to rent games would significantly hurt sales and drive up the cost of games.<ref name=\"morningCall1\">[http://articles.mcall.com/1989-09-09/news/2700327_1_nintendo-video-game-rent The Morning Call \u2013 Article].

The NES was launched in a test market of New York City on October 18, 1985, followed by Los Angeles as a second test market in February 1986, followed by Chicago and San Francisco, then other top 12 American markets, followed by a full launch across North America and some countries in Europe in September 1986, followed by Australia and other countries in Europe in 1987.

A test model was constructed in October 1982 to verify the functionality of the hardware, after which work began on programming tools. Because 65xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time, no cross-development software was available and it had to be produced from scratch. Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an [[PC-8000 series|NEC PC-8001]] computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time.<ref name=\"DevHistory\">{{Cite journal|last=\u9ad8\u91ce|first=\u96c5\u6674|date=1995-01-16|title=\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u958b\u767a\u7269\u8a9e|url=https://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/special/20081002/1019327/|journal=\u65e5\u7d4c\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9|language=ja|publisher=[[Nikkei Business Publications]]|oclc=5530170|access-date=2019-06-06|via=Nikkei Trendy Net}}</ref>\n\nThe code name for the project was \"GameCom\", but Masayuki Uemura's wife proposed the name \"Famicom\", arguing that \"In Japan, 'pasokon' is used to mean a personal computer, but it is neither a home or personal computer. Perhaps we could say it is a family computer.\" Meanwhile, Hiroshi Yamauchi decided that the console should use a red and white theme after seeing a billboard for DX Antenna (a Japanese antenna manufacturer) which used those colors.<ref name=\"DevHistory\" />\n\nThe creation of the Famicom was hugely influenced by the [[ColecoVision]], [[Coleco]]'s competition against the [[Atari 2600]] in the United States. Takao Sawano, chief manager of the project, brought a ColecoVision home to his family, who were impressed by the system's capability to produce smooth graphics at the time,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u9ad8\u91ce|first=\u96c5\u6674|date=1995-01-16|title=\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u958b\u767a\u7269\u8a9e|url=https://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/special/20081002/1019378/|journal=\u65e5\u7d4c\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9|language=ja|publisher=[[Nikkei Business Publications]]|oclc=5530170|access-date=2019-06-07|via=Nikkei Trendy Net}}</ref> which contrasts with the flicker and slowdown commonly seen on Atari 2600 games. Uemura, head of Famicom development, stated that the ColecoVision set the bar for the Famicom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/deciding-on-the-specs/|title=GlitterBerri's Game Translations \u00bb Deciding on the Specs|website=Glitterberri.com}}</ref>\n\nOriginal plans called for the Famicom's cartridges to be the size of a cassette tape, but ultimately they ended up being twice as big. Careful design attention was paid to the cartridge connectors because loose and faulty connections often plagued arcade machines. As it necessitated 60 connection lines for the memory and expansion, Nintendo decided to produce its own connectors.<ref name=\"DevHistory\" />\n\nThe controllers are hard-wired to the console with no connectors for cost reasons. The game pad controllers were more-or-less copied directly from the Game & Watch machines, although the Famicom design team originally wanted to use arcade-style joysticks, even dismantling some from American game consoles to see how they worked. There were concerns regarding the durability of the joystick design and that children might step on joysticks on the floor. Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game & Watch [[D-pad]] to the Famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and caused no discomfort. Ultimately though, they installed a 15-pin expansion port on the front of the console so that an optional arcade-style joystick could be used.<ref name=\"DevHistory\" />\n\n[[Gunpei Yokoi]] suggested an eject lever to the cartridge slot which is not really necessary, but he believed that children could be entertained by pressing it. Uemura adopted his idea. Uemura added a microphone to the second controller with the idea that it could be used to make players' voices sound through the TV speaker.<ref>[http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/synonymous-with-the-domestic-game-console/ GlitterBerri's Game Translations \u00bb Synonymous With the Domestic Game Console].

The deal was set to be finalized and signed at the Summer [[International CES|Consumer Electronics Show]] in June 1983. However, Atari discovered at that show that its competitor Coleco was illegally demonstrating its [[Coleco Adam]] computer with Nintendo's ''Donkey Kong'' game. This violation of Atari's exclusive license with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of Nintendo's game console marketing contract with Atari.

Although it ended up having a short product lifespan, R.O.B. was initially used to market the NES as novel and sophisticated compared to previous game consoles.]]\n\nThe system's launch represented not only a new product, but also a reframing of the severely damaged home video game market. The 1983 video game crash had occurred in large part due to a lack of consumer and retailer confidence in video games, which had been partially due to confusion and misrepresentation in video game marketing. Prior to the NES, the packaging of many video games presented bombastic artwork which exaggerated the graphics of the actual game. In terms of product identity, a single game such as ''[[Pac-Man]]'' would appear in many versions on many different game consoles and computers, with large variations in graphics, sound, and general quality between the versions. In stark contrast, Nintendo's marketing strategy aimed to regain consumer and retailer confidence by delivering a singular platform whose technology was not in need of exaggeration and whose qualities were clearly defined.\n\nTo differentiate Nintendo's new home platform from the perception of a troubled and shallow video game market still reeling from the 1983 crash, the company freshened its product nomenclature and established a strict product approval and licensing policy. The overall platform is referred to as \"Entertainment System\" instead of a \"video game system\", is centered upon a machine called a \"Control Deck\" instead of a \"console\", and features software cartridges called \"Game Paks\" instead of \"video games\".

The most famous example is [[Lucasfilm]]'s attempts to port the comedy-horror game ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'' to the NES, which Nintendo insisted be considerably watered down. Nintendo of America continued its censorship policy until 1994 with the advent of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] system, coinciding with criticism stemming from the cuts made to the Super NES port of ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' compared to the Sega Genesis'.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe optional Robotic Operating Buddy, or [[R.O.B.]], was part of a marketing plan to portray the NES's technology as being novel and sophisticated when compared to previous game consoles, and to portray its position as being within reach of the better established toy market.

It featured a top-loading cartridge slot, grooves on both sides of the deck in which the hardwired game controllers could be placed when not in use, and a 15-[[pin]] expansion port located on the unit's front panel for accessories.<ref name=\"InsideFamicom\">{{cite magazine| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/148391-7/inside_nintendos_classic_game_console.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100702061320/http://www.pcworld.com/article/148391-7/inside_nintendos_classic_game_console.html| archivedate = July 2, 2010| title = Inside Nintendo's Classic Game Console| first = Benj| last = Edwards| date = August 7, 2008| magazine = [[PC World]]| accessdate = June 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\n<!-- NES -->\nThe original NES, meanwhile, featured a front-loading cartridge covered by a small, hinged door that can be opened to insert or remove a cartridge and closed at other times. It features a more subdued gray, black, and red color scheme. An expansion port was found on the bottom of the unit and the cartridge connector [[pinout]] was changed.\n\n<!-- PAL-A -->\nIn the UK, Italy and Australia which share the PAL-A region, two versions of the NES were released; the \"Mattel Version\" and \"NES Version\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2010/12/gycw-nes-ports-1-contra/ |title=Guru Larry's Retrospective on the regional variations and releases of the European Nintendo Entertainment System |publisher=Blisteredthumbs.net |accessdate=October 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927105841/http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2010/12/gycw-nes-ports-1-contra/ |archivedate=September 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> When the NES was first released in those countries, it was distributed by Mattel and Nintendo decided to use a lockout chip specific to those countries, different from the chip used in other European countries. When Nintendo took over European distribution in 1990, it produced consoles that were then labelled \"NES Version\"; therefore, the only differences between the two are the text on the front flap and texture on the top/bottom of the casing.\n\n<!-- NES-101 -->\n[[File:NES-101-Console-Set.jpg|right|thumb|The NES-101 control deck alongside its similarly redesigned NES-039 [[game controller]].]]\nIn October 1993, Nintendo redesigned the NES to follow many of the same design cues as the newly introduced [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the Japanese Super Famicom. Like the SNES, the [[Nintendo Entertainment System (Model NES-101)|NES-101]] model loads cartridges through a covered slot on top of the unit replacing the complicated mechanism of the earlier design.\n\n<!-- HVC-101 -->\n[[File:New Famicom.jpg|right|thumb|The HVC-101 control deck alongside its similarly redesigned HVC-102 game controller.]]\nIn December 1993, the Famicom received a similar redesign. It also loads cartridges through a covered slot on the top of the unit and uses non-hardwired controllers. Because HVC-101 uses composite video output instead of being RF only like the HVC-001, Nintendo marketed the newer model as the {{nihongo foot|'''AV Famicom'''.|AV\u4ed5\u69d8\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3|Eibui Shiy\u014d Famikon|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} Since the new controllers don't have microphones on them like the second controller on the original console, certain games such as the Disk System version of ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''[[Raid on Bungeling Bay]]'' have certain tricks that cannot be replicated when played on an HVC-101 Famicom without a modified controller. In October 1987, Nintendo released a 3D [[Stereoscopic video game|stereoscopic]] headset called the [[Famicom 3D System]] (HVC-031) in Japan only.\n\n===Design flaws===\n[[File:Nintendo-Entertainment-System-NES-Deconstruction-03.jpg|thumb|right|The VCR-like loading mechanism of the NES led to problems over time. The design wears connector pins out quickly and easily become dirty, resulting in difficulties with the NES reading Game Paks.]]\n\nNintendo's design styling for US release was made deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. One result of this philosophy is to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading [[zero insertion force]] (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]. The newly designed connector works quite well when both the connector and the cartridges are clean and the pins on the connector are new. Unfortunately, the ''ZIF connector'' is not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserts the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bends the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge's ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges cause the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years{{dubious|date=March 2020}} and the ZIF design prove more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector.<ref name=\"zif\">{{cite web | first=Benj | last=Edwards | title=No More Blinkies: Replacing the NES's 72-Pin Cartridge Connector | url=http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/13 | work=Vintage Computing and Gaming | date=November 7, 2005 | accessdate=June 3, 2007}}</ref> These design issues are exacerbated by Nintendo's choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors are also prone to [[tarnish]]ing. Nintendo sought to fix these issues by redesigning the next generation [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) as a top loader similar to the Famicom to ensure better results reading the game cartridges.<ref name=\"corrosion\">{{cite web | first=Rob | last=Nelson | title=Nintendo Redivivus: how to resuscitate an old friend | url=https://arstechnica.com/features/2003/02/nintendo/ | work=Ars Technica | date=February 12, 2003 | accessdate=June 3, 2007}}</ref> Many players try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually speeds up the tarnishing due to moisture. One way to slow down the tarnishing process and extend the life of the cartridges is to use [[isopropyl alcohol]] and swabs, as well as non-conductive metal polish such as [[Brasso]] or Sheila Shine.<ref name=\"mental\">{{cite web | url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/12589/did-blowing-nintendo-cartridges-really-help | title=Did Blowing into Nintendo Cartridges Really Help? | publisher=Mental Floss, Inc. | accessdate=August 6, 2014 | last1=Higgins |first1= Chris}}</ref><ref name=\"nerdist\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nerdist.com/2014/07/we-blow-into-video-game-cartridges-because-of-weird-psychology/ | title=We Blow Into Video Game Cartridges Because of Weird Psychology | date=July 1, 2014 | accessdate=August 6, 2014 | author=Hill, Kyle}}</ref>\n\n===Lockout===\n[[File:Nintendo-10NES-Lockout-Chip.jpg|thumb|right|The 10NES authentication chip (at top) contributed to the system's reliability problems.

Hobbyists in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip's mode of operation from \"lock\" to \"key\", removing all effects and greatly improving the console's ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions have different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region do not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are these: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip); most of Europe (3195); Asia (3196); and UK, Italy, and Australia (3197). Because two types of lockout chip were released in Europe, European NES game boxes often have an \"A\" or \"B\" letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Games in the rest of Europe typically have text on the box stating \"This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\". Similarly, UK/Italy/Australia games state \"This game is only compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\".\n\nProblems with the [[10NES]] lockout chip frequently result in the console's most infamous problem: the blinking red power light, in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly because the 10NES would reset the console once per second. The lockout chip required constant communication with the chip in the game to work.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|247}} Dirty, aging, and bent connectors often disrupt the communication, resulting in the blink effect.<ref name=\"zif\"/> Alternatively, the console would turn on but only show a solid white, gray, or green screen. Users may attempt to solve this problem by blowing air onto the cartridge connectors, inserting the cartridge just far enough to get the ZIF to lower, licking the edge connector, slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge, shifting the cartridge from side to side after insertion, pushing the ZIF up and down repeatedly, holding the ZIF down lower than it should have been, and cleaning the connectors with alcohol. Many of the most frequent attempts to fix this problem instead risk damaging the cartridge or system.<ref>{{cite web |title=Did Blowing into Nintendo Cartridges Really Help? |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/12589/did-blowing-nintendo-cartridges-really-help |website=MentalFloss |accessdate=July 12, 2018 |language=en |date=September 24, 2012}}</ref> In 1989, Nintendo released an official NES Cleaning Kit to help users clean malfunctioning cartridges and consoles.\n\nWith the release of the top-loading [[Nintendo Entertainment System (Model NES-101)|NES-101]] (NES 2) toward the end of the NES's lifespan, Nintendo resolved the problems by switching to a standard [[card edge connector]] and eliminating the lockout chip. All of the Famicom systems use standard card edge connectors, as do Nintendo's two subsequent game consoles, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the [[Nintendo 64]].\n\nIn response to these hardware flaws, \"Nintendo Authorized Repair Centers\" sprang up across the U.S. According to Nintendo, the authorization program was designed to ensure that the machines were properly repaired. Nintendo would ship the necessary replacement parts only to shops that had enrolled in the authorization program. In practice, the authorization process consisted of nothing more than paying a fee to Nintendo for the privilege.\n\n===Famicom 3D System===\nNintendo released a [[Stereoscopic video game|stereoscopic]] headset peripheral called [[Famicom 3D System]]. This was never released outside Japan, since it was a commercial failure, making some gamers experience headaches and nausea.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/scienceandtech/14235-Five-Famicom-Peripherals-That-Never-Escaped-Japan|title=Five Famicom Peripherals That Never Escaped Japan {{!}} Science and Tech {{!}} The Escapist|website=v1.escapistmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n\n===Famicom Modem===\nNintendo released a modem peripheral called [[Famicom Modem]].

All variations of the PPU feature 2&nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]] of video RAM, 256&nbsp;bytes of on-die \"object attribute memory\" (OAM) to store the positions, colors, and tile indices of up to 64 [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] on the screen, and 28&nbsp;bytes of on-die palette RAM to allow selection of background and sprite colors. The console's 2&nbsp;kB of onboard RAM may be used for tile maps and attributes on the NES board and 8&nbsp;kB of tile pattern ROM or RAM may be included on a cartridge. The system has an available [[Palette (computing)|color palette]] of 48 colors and 6 grays. Up to 25 simultaneous colors may be used without writing new values mid-frame: a background color, four sets of three tile colors, and four sets of three sprite colors. The NES palette is based on NTSC rather than RGB values. A total of 64 sprites may be displayed onscreen at a given time without reloading sprites mid-screen. The standard [[display resolution]] of the NES is 256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels.\n\nVideo output connections vary between console models. The original HVC-001 model of the Family Computer features only [[RF modulator|radio frequency (RF) modulator]] output. The North American and European consoles have support for composite video through [[RCA connector]]s in addition to the RF modulator. The HVC-101 model of the Famicom omits the RF modulator entirely and has composite video output via a proprietary 12-pin \"multi-out\" connector first introduced on the Super Famicom and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Conversely, the North American re-released NES-101 model most closely resembles the original HVC-001 model Famicom, in that it features RF modulator output only.<ref name=\"20years\" /> Finally, the PlayChoice-10 utilizes an inverted RGB video output.\n\nThe stock NES supports a total of five sound channels, two of which are pulse channels with 4 pulse width settings, one is a triangle wave generator, another is a noise generator (often used for percussion), and the fifth one plays low-quality digital samples.\n\nThe NES supports expansion chips contained in certain cartridges to add sound channels and help with data processing. Developers can add these chips to their games, such as the Konami VRC6, Konami VRC7, Sunsoft 5B, Namco 163, and two more by Nintendo itself: the Nintendo FDS wave generator (a modified Ricoh RP2C33 chip <!-- (including [[Programmable sound generator|PSG]] + [[DPCM]]) --> with single-cycle wave [[table-lookup synthesis|table-lookup sound]] support), and the Nintendo [[Memory Management Controller]] 5 (MMC5).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famitracker.com/wiki/index.php?title=Sound_hardware|title=Sound hardware|website=Famitracker.com|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> Due to wiring differences between the Famicom and NES, a stock NES console is incapable of passing through audio generated by expansion chips utilizing additional sound channels, but can be modified to regain this capability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrofixes.com/2014/05/open-hidden-sound-channels-in-nes.html|title=Open Hidden Sound Channels in the NES|website=Retrofixes.com|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://curriculumcrasher.com/2017/01/24/nes-expanded-audio-100k-pot-mod/|title=NES Expanded Audio: 100k Pot Mod|website=Curriculumcrasher.com|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{further | Memory management controller}}\n\n===Accessories===\n{{See also|List of Nintendo Entertainment System accessories}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Entertainment-System-NES-Controller-FL.jpg|thumb|right|In addition to featuring a revised color scheme that matched the more subdued tones of the console itself, NES controllers are detached and lack the microphone featured in Famicom controllers.]]\n\n===={{anchor|Game_controllers}}Controllers====\nThe [[game controller]] used for both the NES and the Famicom features an oblong brick-like design with a simple four button layout: two round buttons labeled \"A\" and \"B\", a \"START\" button, and a \"SELECT\" button.<ref name=\"NESBooklet\">{{cite book | title =Nintendo Entertainment System Instruction Booklet | publisher =Nintendo | year =1989 | page =5 }}</ref> Additionally, the controllers utilize the cross-shaped [[D-pad|joypad]], designed by Nintendo employee [[Gunpei Yokoi]] for Nintendo [[Game & Watch]] systems, to replace the bulkier [[joystick]]s on earlier gaming consoles' controllers.<ref name=\"Ultimate History\"/>{{rp|279}}\n\nThe original model Famicom features two game controllers, both of which are hardwired to the back of the console.

Both controllers have a Turbo feature, where one press of the button represents multiple automatic rapid presses. This feature allows players to shoot much faster in shooter games. The NES Advantage has two knobs that adjust the firing rate of the turbo button from quick to Turbo, as well as a \"Slow\" button that slows down compatible games by rapidly pausing the game. The NES Max has a non-adjustable Turbo feature and no \"Slow\" feature, and has a wing-like handheld shape and a sleek directional pad. Turbo functionality exists on the [[NES Satellite]], the [[NES Four Score]], and the [[U-Force]]. Other accessories include the Power Pad and the [[Power Glove]], which is featured in the movie ''[[The Wizard (1989 film)|The Wizard]]''.\n\nNear the end of the NES's lifespan, upon the release of the AV Famicom and the top-loading NES 2, the design of the game controllers was modified slightly. Though the original button layout was retained, the controller's shape resembles that of the SNES's controller. In addition, the AV Famicom dropped the hardwired controllers in favor of detachable controller ports.

It contains RAM for the game to load into and an extra single-cycle wave [[table-lookup synthesis|table-lookup]] sound chip. The disks are used both for storing the game and saving progress, with a total capacity of 128k (64k per side). The disks were originally obtained from [[kiosk]]s in malls and other public places where buyers could select a game and have it written to the disk. This process cost less than cartridges and users could take the disk back to a vending booth and have it rewritten with a new game, or the high score faxed to Nintendo for national leaderboard contests.\n\n{{further|Family Computer Disk System#Disk Writer and Disk Fax kiosks}}\n\nA variety of games for the FDS were released by Nintendo (including some which had already been released on cartridge, such as ''Super Mario Bros.''), and third party companies such as Konami, Taito, or unlicensed publishers. Its limitations became quickly apparent as larger ROM chips were introduced, allowing cartridges with greater than 128k of space. More advanced memory management chips (MMC) soon appeared and the FDS quickly became obsolete. Nintendo also charged developers high prices to produce FDS games, and many refused to develop for it, instead continuing to make cartridge games.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} After only two years, the FDS was discontinued, although vending booths remained in place until 1993 and Nintendo continued to service drives, and to rewrite and offer replacement disks until 2003. Approximately four million drives were sold.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nNintendo did not release the Disk System outside Japan due to numerous problems encountered with the medium in Japan, and due to the increasing data storage capacity and reducing cost of the highly reliable cartridge medium.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Life |first1=Nintendo |title=Feature: Slipped Disk - The History of the Famicom Disk System |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2010/11/feature_slipped_disk_the_history_of_the_famicom_disk_system |website=Nintendo Life |accessdate=July 12, 2018 |date=November 20, 2010}}</ref> As a result, many Disk System games such as ''Castlevania'', ''The Legend of Zelda'', and ''Bubble Bobble'' were converted to cartridge format for their export releases, resulting in simplified sound and the disk save function replaced by either password or battery save systems.\n\n===Hardware clones===\n[[File:FC-Twin-Console-Set-H.jpg|thumb|right|Pirated clones of NES hardware remained in production for many years after the original had been discontinued.

Initially, such clones were popular in markets where Nintendo never issued a legitimate version of the console. In particular, the [[Dendy (console)|Dendy]] ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u0414\u0435\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0438}}), an unlicensed hardware clone produced in Taiwan and sold in the former [[Soviet Union]], emerged as the most popular video game console of its time in that setting and it enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to that experienced by the NES/Famicom in North America and Japan. A range of Famicom clones was marketed in Argentina during the late 1980s and early 1990s under the name of [[Family Game NES Clone|\"Family Game\"]], resembling the original hardware design. The [[Micro Genius]] ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]]: \u5c0f\u5929\u624d) was marketed in Southeast Asia as an alternative to the Famicom; Samurai was the popular [[PAL]] alternative to the NES; and in Central Europe, especially Poland, the [[Pegasus (console)|Pegasus]] was available.<ref>[http://www.pegasus-gry.com/pegasus-iq-502.php Pegasus IQ-502] Polish review of the most popular NES / Famicom clone \u2013 Pegasus IQ-502</ref> Since 1989, there were many Brazilian clones of NES,<ref name=\"nearchive\" /> and the very popular Phantom System (with hardware superior to the original console) caught the attention of Nintendo itself.<ref name=\"nintendopedia\" />\n\n[[File:RetroUSB-AVS-Console-wController-FL.jpg|thumb|right|The RetroUSB AVS, an [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA-based]] hardware clone of the NES that outputs 720p via [[HDMI]].]]\nThe unlicensed clone market has flourished following Nintendo's discontinuation of the NES.

Many of the clone vendors have included built-in copies of licensed Nintendo software, which constitutes copyright infringement in most countries.\n\nAlthough most hardware clones were not produced under license by Nintendo, certain companies were granted licenses to produce NES-compatible devices. The [[Sharp Corporation]] produced at least two such clones: the [[Twin Famicom]] and the [[C1 NES TV|SHARP 19SC111]] television.

All licensed NTSC and PAL cartridges are a standard shade of gray plastic, with the exception of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' and ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'', which were manufactured in gold-plastic carts. Unlicensed carts were produced in black, robin egg blue, and gold, and are all slightly different shapes than standard NES cartridges. Nintendo also produced yellow-plastic carts for internal use at Nintendo Service Centers, although these \"test carts\" were never made available for purchase. All licensed US cartridges were made by Nintendo, Konami, and Acclaim. For promotion of ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]'', Capcom sent 150 limited-edition gold NES cartridges with the original game, featuring the ''Remastered'' art as the sticker, to different gaming news agencies. The instruction label on the back includes the opening lyric from the [[DuckTales|show]]'s theme song, \"Life is like a hurricane\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/08/07/capcom-39-s-golden-ducktales-promotional-cartridge-is-actually-ducktales.aspx|title=Capcom's Golden DuckTales Promotional Cartridge Is Actually DuckTales|last=Hilliard|first=Kyle|work=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFamicom cartridges are shaped slightly differently. Unlike NES games, official Famicom cartridges were produced in many colors of plastic. Adapters, similar in design to the popular accessory [[Game Genie]], are available that allow Famicom games to be played on an NES. In Japan, several companies manufactured the cartridges for the Famicom.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|61}} This allowed these companies to develop their own customized chips designed for specific purposes, such as superior sound and graphics.\n\n===Third-party licensing===\n[[File:Famicom Family logo.svg|thumb|right|The Famicom Family mark appeared in games and peripherals from 1988 that were approved by Nintendo for compatibility with official Famicom consoles and derivatives.]]\nNintendo's near monopoly on the home video game market left it with a dominant influence over the industry. Unlike Atari, which never actively pursued third-party developers (and even went to court in an attempt to force [[Activision]] to cease production of [[Atari 2600]] games), Nintendo had anticipated and encouraged the involvement of third-party software developers, though strictly on Nintendo's terms.<ref name=\"archive1\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080320090353/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/index23.shtml GameSpy.com \u2013 Article].

However, they found resistance with United States based game developers including [[Atari]], [[Activision]], [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Epyx]] refusing Nintendo's one-sided terms. [[Acclaim Entertainment]], a fledgling game publisher founded by former Activision employees, would be the first major third-party licensee based out of the United States to sign on with Nintendo in late 1987.

Nintendo required that it be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges, and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the risk. As a result, some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games. Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers, which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system, order at least 10,000 cartridges, and only make five games per year.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|214\u2013215}} The global [[chip famine|1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips]] reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit an average of 25% of publishers' requests for cartridges, with some receiving much higher amounts and others almost none.<ref name=\"keizer198809\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-09-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_100_1988_Sep#page/n7/mode/2up | title=Games Hot, but Cartridges Cool | work=Compute! | date=September 1988 | accessdate=November 10, 2013 | author=Keizer, Gregg | page=8}}</ref> [[GameSpy]] noted that Nintendo's \"iron-clad terms\" made the company many enemies during the 1980s.

The FTC conducted an extensive investigation which included interviewing hundreds of retailers. During the FTC probe, Nintendo changed the terms of its publisher licensing agreements to eliminate the two-year rule and other restrictive terms. Nintendo and the FTC settled the case in April 1991, with Nintendo required to send vouchers giving a $5 discount off to a new game, to every person that had purchased a NES game between June 1988 and December 1990. GameSpy remarked that Nintendo's punishment was particularly weak giving the case's findings, although it has been speculated that the FTC did not want to damage the video game industry in the United States.<ref name=\"archive1\" />\n\nWith the NES near its end of its life many third-party publishers such as [[Electronic Arts]] supported upstart competing consoles with less strict licensing terms such as the [[Sega Genesis]] and then the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which eroded and then took over Nintendo's dominance in the home console market, respectively. Consoles from Nintendo's rivals in the post-SNES era had always enjoyed much stronger third-party support than Nintendo, which relied more heavily on first-party games.\n\n====Unlicensed games====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Templeofdoomtengen.png|thumb|Most unlicensed game cartridges differed from the standard gray cartridges.]] -->\nCompanies that refused to pay the licensing fee or were rejected by Nintendo found ways to circumvent the console's authentication system.

Throughout the summer [[Arrayer|Commissioners of Array]] for the King and [[Deputy Lieutenant]]s for Parliament attempted to raise the [[Trainband|trained bands]] and to seize the [[wiktionary:magazine|magazine]] in every county. During the confusion caused by the troops waiting to be shipped from [[Chester]] to [[Ireland]] to suppress the rebellion there, Sir William Brereton, the Parliamentary representative in Cheshire, turned to what was virtually recruiting. He found himself opposed by Sir Thomas Aston and all the resident Cheshire nobility and he failed in his attempt to secure Chester for Parliament.\n\nAt this time Aston was probably the recognized representative of the King in the county and was able to present the latter with a list of men willing to serve in the King's army. The King decided to base this army at [[Shrewsbury]] and when he arrived there on 20 September 1642 he wrote to [[Robert Needham, 2nd Viscount Kilmorey|Lord Kilmorey]], [[Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster|Lord Cholmondeley]] and \"the other of the subscribers for Horse in Cheshire\" telling them to deliver their horses into the charge of Aston who was to bring the forces raised to Shrewsbury to join with the main body of the army. Charles made it unnecessary for Aston to leave for Shrewsbury as he instead came to Chester and it was from here that he issued, on 26 September, an order for the seizure of arms and horses from those people who had carried out Parliament's [[Militia Ordinance]] in Cheshire. These were to be delivered to Aston who was able to leave with the King at the head of three troops of horse.\n\nAston obviously conducted himself satisfactorily in the campaign culminating in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] because an order from [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] in January 1643 refers to him as a colonel of a regiment of cuirassiers, and two days later on 19 January the King announced that he was sending Aston as a major-general to Cheshire and Lancashire. Aston's orders were simply stated by Prince Rupert; he was to take his regiment to Shropshire, raise forces of horse and foot there, and then defend Cheshire against the Parliamentary force that was heading to the county from London under the leadership of Brereton. He was also to seize arms and ammunition for the King's use and \"put into execution the laws and customs martial upon all offenders.....for the better preventing of disorders, plunderings and outrages which are often committed by soldiers.\" He was told to achieve this and return to the main army by 15 March unless he received orders to the contrary.\n\nThe preparations for Aston's march and arrival in Cheshire reveal the King's interest in keeping Cheshire Royalist. The authorities of the areas that Aston was to pass through on his way from [[Oxford]] to Cheshire were ordered to provide food and lodgings for his men. The Cheshire Commissioners of Array were also given explicit orders as to what they should do to help Aston. The King explained to them that, as the Parliamentarians had rejected the [[Bunbury Agreement]] and were sending a force to Cheshire, he was sending Aston and his regiment of horse to protect the county. The commissioners were to assemble the trained bands and summon [[Quarter Sessions]] to decide on a method of raising money to pay the soldiers. They were also to help Aston raise a regiment of [[dragoons]] and seize arms from \"malignants\" to arm them. In addition the parishes were to supply them horses.\n\nParliament also realised how important Cheshire was and sent Brereton to raise support for its cause.  Geographically Cheshire lies between the [[Pennines]] and the Welsh hills and so whoever controlled Cheshire controlled the north \u2013 south corridor. For Parliament the control of Cheshire would mean separating the King's northern supporters from the King and his army at Oxford. It could also stop the King bringing in reinforcements from his Irish army through the port of Chester. '<ref name=\"ives\">[http://www.brereton.org/professor_eric_ives.htm Lecture given to the worldwide Brereton Family Reunion]</ref>\n\nWhen Aston arrived in Shropshire he found that there were only 60 dragoons instead of the 600 promised. The authorities promised him another 200 and so he decided to wait for two days before moving on to Cheshire. During this time he was ordered to [[Stafford]] to help the sheriff there (perhaps against the Moorlanders who had risen for Parliament). However Aston did not neglect his prime objective and ordered the Cheshire Commissioners of Array to defend [[Nantwich]] with 150 musketeers and to inform him of Brereton's progress. Neither order was carried out and Aston was not informed until it was too late to arrive at Nantwich before Brereton.\n\n===Skirmish at Nantwich===\n[[File:Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet.jpg|right|thumb|Sir William Brereton]]\n\nBrereton, meanwhile, had ridden into [[Congleton]] on the evening of 27 January with\nhis own troop of horse and three companies of dragoons. Although he was joined in Congleton by the former mayor, William Edwards, with another troop of horse, his whole force could not have amounted to more than about 500 men. His mission, however, was not to conquer Cheshire but to rouse and organize the Parliamentary sympathizers in it. He had with him the cadre of a foot regiment, a case of drakes (small cannon about 7\u00bd feet long) and 700 muskets in his baggage train as well as an experienced Scottish professional, Major James Lothian,<ref>[http://www.scotwars.com/james_lothian.htm Major James Lothian. A short history of a Scots professional soldier in Cheshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927101159/http://www.scotwars.com/james_lothian.htm |date=2011-09-27 }}</ref> to train recruits. He had wide powers to construct fortifications and raise more men and was to finance the whole enterprise by voluntary payment and [[wiktionary:distraint|distraint]] upon the rent and goods of local Royalists.\n\nHe approached Nantwich on 28 January. not just \"to releave the town, beinge in greate danger to be plundered and destroyed by the Kings Armye and Commissioners of Array\",<ref name=\"malbon\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027145351/http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/malbon.html Malbon\u2019s Memorials of the Civil War]</ref> but also because it offered the only alternative to Chester as a county headquarters. It had sufficient wealth and housing to accommodate a large garrison and staff and was the centre of a network of roads leading to the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[London]], to North [[Wales]], [[Lancashire]], [[Yorkshire]] and [[Scotland]].\n\nBrereton sent ahead 50 dragoons under Lothian to occupy the town and they got there before Aston who had finally been informed of Brereton's progress by [[Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever|Orlando Bridgeman]], the son of the Bishop of Chester. Aston had with him his own troop of horse and some companies of Shropshire dragoons under the command of Colonel Sir Vincent Corbett<ref>\n[http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm  The Corbett Study Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930032731/http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm |date=2007-09-30 }}</ref> totalling about 500 men. Despite his superiority of numbers Aston failed to take the town and at dusk he retreated eastwards down Hospital Street. In a narrow lane his force met the remainder of Brereton's force and confusion was the result. A company of Brereton's dragoons dismounted but failed to leave anyone to control the horses which bolted into the fields and were taken by the Royalists for charging cavalry. The confusion was added to when some Parliamentarians loaded and fired one of the drakes. This does not seem to have caused any injury but the flash and the roar amid the general confusion frightened the Royalists so much \"that they weire all scattered and quyte Rowted\".<ref name=\"malbon\"/>\n\nAston turned up eventually at [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] and, although he claimed the skirmish as a draw, his distance from Nantwich and his appeals for reinforcements indicates that the skirmish was a defeat for the Royalists, likely due to his men being exhausted after the long march from Oxford and that he did not receive the support from the Cheshire Commissioners of Array that he had expected. This lack of proper support continued over the next four or five weeks. An agreement was made to raise a contribution in the county to pay the soldiers but most was paid to the upkeep of the Chester garrison, not to Aston's regiment or to the trained bands. The Royalist leaders were never able to agree to a unified command which meant that they were never able to field an army that would outnumber Brereton's force. There was a force of 2,000 men at Warrington under the Earl of Derby, a Welsh force of 1,000 men at Chester and the Shropshire force at Whitchurch. These never combined and it was not until March that the Royalists decided to choose a place in the county \"to summon in the King's friends\"\n\n==Prelude==\nAston set out for Middlewich on Friday 10 March. His progress was delayed that night when his men, who had yet to be paid, mutinied. Apparently the money and provisions were issued on Saturday but it was so late that Aston had to leave two troops of horse in the forest to guard it - \"though they lay in danger that night.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\">Sir Thomas Aston's Account to the Commissioners of Array for the County of Chester. Document XVII in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 56 \u2013 61 (London, 1874)</ref> It is not known why Middlewich was chosen as opposed to the much safer [[Knutsford]] where it would have been possible to retreat to [[Warrington]] if necessary. In his account of the battle of Middlewich, Aston did not say why he came to Middlewich on 11 March but explained that he had no wish to linger there. He realized the dangers of staying in an open town with enemy forces at both [[Northwich]] and Nantwich. Brereton, who was recruiting in Northwich, commented on the boldness of the Royalists for camping at Middlewich. He believed it resulted from overconfidence in their ability to win over the county and rid it of the Parliamentarians.\n\n==Saturday 11 March==\nAston arrived at Middlewich with about 500 mounted troops and over 1000 of the trained bands of the [[Broxton (hundred)|Broxton]] and [[Hundred of Wirral|Wirral]] [[Hundred (division)|Hundred]]s plus three cannons. William Brereton sent a strong party of horse from Northwich \"who gave them an alarm.\" Aston had meanwhile received a letter from the Governor of Chester, Sir Nicolas Byron,<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=19198 A History of the County of Chester: Volume 5 (i)]</ref> telling him that if he provided an escort for the family and goods of [[William Brereton, 2nd Baron Brereton|Lord Brereton]] to Chester then the latter, who was a relative of Sir William Brereton, would provide men for Aston. Although reluctant to linger in Middlewich, Thomas, after consulting with the sheriff, Sir [[Edward Fytton]] and Colonel Ellis, decided it was worth waiting for another day. He therefore sent a letter to Lord Brereton urging him to act immediately even though it meant travelling on a Sunday.\n\n==Sunday 12 March==\nBrereton, wanting to \"annoy\" the enemy, set out with two or three companies of dragoons to give alarm at Middlewich. He had no intention of attacking but wanted to harass the Royalists. In the meantime Lord Brereton had not done as Aston requested but instead came to Middlewich to confer further. Thomas believed that Lord Brereton's presence in Middlewich led to the attack by the Parliamentarians because they wanted to prevent the Royalists from joining forces. Sir William Brereton however, in his account of the battle, made it clear that he attacked because he believed a Royalist presence in Middlewich posed too much of a threat to be ignored.\n\nIn order to confer with Lord Brereton and also the sheriff's desire to \"sumon the countrey with theire contribucon and assistance, necessitated a ioynt consent to stay there on Monday.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>  Realising the danger posed by this decision Aston asked that the governor use the Whitchurch forces to threaten the Parliamentarians at Nantwich. According to the Commissioners of Array the Whitchurch force was not ordered to threaten Nantwich. In any case the forces there had been disbanded. Aston's fears were well founded as Brereton arranged to meet the Nantwich forces at six o'clock the next morning and to make a joint attack on Middlewich.\n\n==Battle==\nOn the morning of Monday 13 March the Nantwich forces had not arrived at the appointed time so Brereton decided to attack with his cavalry and about 200 musketeers (\"our greatest force of foot being at Nantwich\"). He \"with the best forces hee had theire came early in the mornynge backe to Midlewiche, & vpon Sheathe Heathe att the west end of the said Towne, Sr Thomas Aston havinge taken the advantage of the said ground & wynde, & planted his ordnance, sett upon him\"<ref name=\"malbon\"/>  Thomas sent a party of dragoons and horse under Captain Spotswood to give an alarm at Northwich, presumably to draw off some of Brereton's force. The captain, however, disobeyed orders and engaged the enemy and as a result Brereton's forces were able to establish themselves in one street leading into the town. In another street Captain Prestwich and his men were caught unawares by the enemy but were able to rally and drive back the enemy horse and rescue some prisoners. He stopped at a bridge and managed to hold off the enemy until the foot soldiers arrived. Waring Bridge was also approached by the enemy so Aston sent Prestwich and his troop to aid Captain Massie's company of foot defend it. In this way Aston was able to hold off the enemy until about 9:00 or 10:00&nbsp;a.m. when the Nantwich force arrived \"so resolutely and with such undauntedness of spirit.\" About 800 foot and 300 horse came down Booth Lane and entered into Newton at the south end of the town, where Aston had placed \"a good Brasse peece of ordnance\" and two trained bands of 200 men who were \"well advantaged by ditches and bankes on both sides.\" Aston withdrew a troop of horse under the command of Captain Bridgeman from the Northwich approach to check the advance of the Nantwich force. The rest of his horse he held back behind the foot, \"there being noe other ground for horse\", apart from a force of about 60 to attack the enemy. His plan was to line the hedge with about 100 musketeers so that the enemy could not take advantage of the ditches on both sides of the lane to attack the charging horse.\n\nThe Parliamentary force, on finding the lane so well defended, took to the fields on either side of the lane. The Royalist horse could not charge because of the hedges and the musketeers deserted as soon as the first shots were fired at them. The horse was therefore outflanked and cut off by the enemy musketeers on both sides of the lane. On the west side of the town the troop of horse, under Mayor Thomas Holme, were managing to hold off the Parliamentarians despite the fact that Bridgeman's troop had been withdrawn to defend the southern entrance. However, when Sergeant Major Gilmore ordered his foot to retreat the horse were outflanked by enemy musketeers on either side of the lane behind the hedges where the horse could not charge. They were therefore forced back into the town. The street was defended by musketeers behind a breastwork but they ran away after blindly firing once. Similarly the foot soldiers guarding Waring Bridge were ordered to retreat and the Parliamentarians were able to enter the town from there. Meanwhile, the horse on the Nantwich approach were pulled back to allow the use of the cannon that Ellis had drawn up.\n\nThe Parliamentarians were advancing towards [[St. Michael and All Angels, Middlewich|St Michael and All Angels church]] from three directions so Aston ordered a party of Captain Spotswood's dragoons to secure and defend the churchyard. He also placed a guard at the breastworks on the west side of town and put a cannon in the churchyard to cover the street. A company of musketeers and two trained bands were brought up to hold off the advancing Nantwich force. These musketeers lay down in the ditches as soon as they came to Ellis's cannon and it was all Aston could do to get them up to the hedges with the other musketeers by riding among them \"and with my sword I beat them up.\" This served no purpose because the soldiers would not lift their heads to see where to fire but instead shot their muskets into the air.\n\nThe Parliamentarians meanwhile had become encouraged by the inaccurate fire of the cannon and they charged the Royalist foot who promptly ran away, leaving Aston's cavalry exposed and unable to charge because of a large ditch. They therefore drew off to a safer position. Seeing this, a body of pikemen behind a breastwork further back ran away and \"all the musqueteers placed for the defence of the street ende quit their trenches, having never seen the enemy or cause of feare, but their fellows flying.\" Aston, however, held his cavalry firm until Ellis could draw off his cannon and then ordered a retreat to the high street. Aston himself went to the churchyard expecting it to be defended as he had ordered. Instead he found all the foot soldiers in the church and he could not \"draw out ten musqueteers out of the church would it have saved the world.\"  Relying on his two cannon to cover two streets, Aston ordered his cavalry, being exposed to the advancing enemy on three sides, to regroup in a field at one end of the town. However, their way was blocked by a barricade erected by Spotswood and they became separated and were unable to regroup until they were well past Kinderton House.\n\nReturning to the cannon Aston found that one had been deserted and the other being drawn off by a solitary cannoneer. With all the other men, including Ellis, in the church and refusing to come out, Aston was now alone:\n<blockquote>\n\"The enimy falling directly in three streets upon me, and discharging upon me in the church-yard, the horse marched out of sight. I alone, all I could possibly hope to doe was to rally the horse again if possible, to wheel about, and to fall in the rear of them\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the maze of streets Aston lost contact with his cavalry, apart from a few stragglers, and had little hope of turning the disaster into success especially as the Parliamentarians had now taken the church. With it they captured Ellis, Gilmore, Moseley, ten captains and other officers, 400 common soldiers, weapons for 500 men, two barrels of matches, four barrels of powder and two cannons.  Brereton, therefore, believed that \"since the beginning of this unnatural war, God hath not given many more complete victories.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsBrereton\">Battle of Middlewich, March 13, 1643 - Sir William Brereton's Account. Document XVI in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 54 \u2013 55 (London, 1874)</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Sir Thomas Aston===\nAston sent a messenger to rally his cavalry at [[Northwich|Rudheath]] intending to go on to [[Brereton, Cheshire|Lord Brereton]] and collect his force. The cavalry were, however, beyond recall and so Aston went on his own to give an account of the battle and to see if Lord Brereton was still willing to support him. Finding that he was, Aston returned to Whitchurch to raise the Shropshire forces. However, the trained bands there had been disbanded leaving him no alternative but to return to Cheshire, rally his men and await his fate. He summed up his feelings about the battle thus:\n<blockquote>\n\"It is the plain truth, the enemy having no diversion, but att liberty with their full power to fall on us from all parts, were much too hard for us in a place not defensible. And without some more experienced foot officers, I must freely say no number will be found sufficient to withstand ready men.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>\n</blockquote>\nHe was withdrawn to Oxford and continued to command a cavalry regiment in the King's field army. In 1644 he fought as a brigadier of cavalry in [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Prince Maurice's]] army in the West of England and fought at the [[second Battle of Newbury]] but probably never returned to Cheshire (although at least two sources mention him being there in 1644).<ref>[http://www.pardoes.com/abo/history.htm Welcome to Acton Bridge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016154440/http://www.pardoes.com/abo/history.htm |date=16 October 2006 }} states that during the Civil War in 1644 Sir Thomas Aston's men exercised \"all manor of outrages and intollerable taxes. They plundered Weaverham and the country about, carried off old men out of their houses, bound them together, tyde them to a cart and rove them through mire and water to that dungeon, where they lie without fire or light and now through extremities are so diseased, they are ready to give up the ghost.\" but does not state the source of the quote. Also John Vicars (see Online Sources below) stated that Brereton during the siege of Nantwich in 1644 \"won a most famous Victory of the Lord Capell and the Lord Byron.....and Sir Thomas Aston also\"</ref>\n\nIn 1645 Aston served in the West Country under [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] until September or October when he decided to return home. He passed through [[Kidderminster]] and [[Stourbridge]] on his way to Cheshire. At the beginning of November he was captured by a Parliamentary force under the command of a certain Captain Stones \"att or neere Banke\" (possibly near [[Walsall]]) along with about 60 Royalists - presumably Cheshire men who had fought in Aston's regiment and who were also returning home. From there he was taken to prison and placed under arrest. On 24 March 1646 Aston died of a fever brought on by his various wounds, including a blow to the head received during an unsuccessful attempt to escape.\n\n===Sir William Brereton===\nBrereton declared God responsible for him winning the battle:\n<blockquote>\n\"I desire the whole praise and glory may be attributed to Almighty God, who infused courage into them that stood for His cause, and struck the enemy with terror and amazement.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsBrereton\"/>\n</blockquote>\nBy the end of the spring Parliamentary forces, with Brereton as commander-in-chief, controlled five of the seven Hundreds of Cheshire. From this time on through to February 1646, when the last remaining Royalist base at Chester surrendered to him, the county was dominated by Berenton and he proved to be a dynamic war-time leader not just militarily but also politically and administratively. According to professor Ives, because of the importance of Cheshire, Brereton  \"had more influence on the outcome of the First English Civil War than Oliver Cromwell had.\"<ref name=\"ives\"/>  He suffered his only major defeat in December 1643 at [[Second Battle of Middlewich|Middlewich]]. In 1646, when peace returned and his control over Cheshire came to an end, Brereton moved south to become an active London-based MP and politician. As a reward for his services he received the chief forestership of the Forest of Macclesfield and the [[wiktionary:seneschal|seneschalship]] of the Hundred of Macclesfield. In 1651 he received the tenancy of the former archbishop's palace at [[Croydon]] in [[Surrey]] and he spent the last nine years of his life commuting between there and his ancestral home at [[Handforth]], in Cheshire. He died on 7 April 1661 in [[Croydon]] and is presumed to have been buried in the family vault in the church at [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] in Cheshire.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*R.

Throughout the summer [[Arrayer|Commissioners of Array]] for the King and [[Deputy Lieutenant]]s for Parliament attempted to raise the [[Trainband|trained bands]] and to seize the [[wiktionary:magazine|magazine]] in every county. During the confusion caused by the troops waiting to be shipped from [[Chester]] to [[Ireland]] to suppress the rebellion there, Sir William Brereton, the Parliamentary representative in Cheshire, turned to what was virtually recruiting. He found himself opposed by Sir Thomas Aston and all the resident Cheshire nobility and he failed in his attempt to secure Chester for Parliament.\n\nAt this time Aston was probably the recognized representative of the King in the county and was able to present the latter with a list of men willing to serve in the King's army. The King decided to base this army at [[Shrewsbury]] and when he arrived there on 20 September 1642 he wrote to [[Robert Needham, 2nd Viscount Kilmorey|Lord Kilmorey]], [[Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster|Lord Cholmondeley]] and \"the other of the subscribers for Horse in Cheshire\" telling them to deliver their horses into the charge of Aston who was to bring the forces raised to Shrewsbury to join with the main body of the army. Charles made it unnecessary for Aston to leave for Shrewsbury as he instead came to Chester and it was from here that he issued, on 26 September, an order for the seizure of arms and horses from those people who had carried out Parliament's [[Militia Ordinance]] in Cheshire. These were to be delivered to Aston who was able to leave with the King at the head of three troops of horse.\n\nAston obviously conducted himself satisfactorily in the campaign culminating in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] because an order from [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] in January 1643 refers to him as a colonel of a regiment of cuirassiers, and two days later on 19 January the King announced that he was sending Aston as a major-general to Cheshire and Lancashire. Aston's orders were simply stated by Prince Rupert; he was to take his regiment to Shropshire, raise forces of horse and foot there, and then defend Cheshire against the Parliamentary force that was heading to the county from London under the leadership of Brereton. He was also to seize arms and ammunition for the King's use and \"put into execution the laws and customs martial upon all offenders.....for the better preventing of disorders, plunderings and outrages which are often committed by soldiers.\" He was told to achieve this and return to the main army by 15 March unless he received orders to the contrary.\n\nThe preparations for Aston's march and arrival in Cheshire reveal the King's interest in keeping Cheshire Royalist. The authorities of the areas that Aston was to pass through on his way from [[Oxford]] to Cheshire were ordered to provide food and lodgings for his men. The Cheshire Commissioners of Array were also given explicit orders as to what they should do to help Aston. The King explained to them that, as the Parliamentarians had rejected the [[Bunbury Agreement]] and were sending a force to Cheshire, he was sending Aston and his regiment of horse to protect the county. The commissioners were to assemble the trained bands and summon [[Quarter Sessions]] to decide on a method of raising money to pay the soldiers. They were also to help Aston raise a regiment of [[dragoons]] and seize arms from \"malignants\" to arm them. In addition the parishes were to supply them horses.\n\nParliament also realised how important Cheshire was and sent Brereton to raise support for its cause.  Geographically Cheshire lies between the [[Pennines]] and the Welsh hills and so whoever controlled Cheshire controlled the north \u2013 south corridor. For Parliament the control of Cheshire would mean separating the King's northern supporters from the King and his army at Oxford. It could also stop the King bringing in reinforcements from his Irish army through the port of Chester. '<ref name=\"ives\">[http://www.brereton.org/professor_eric_ives.htm Lecture given to the worldwide Brereton Family Reunion]</ref>\n\nWhen Aston arrived in Shropshire he found that there were only 60 dragoons instead of the 600 promised. The authorities promised him another 200 and so he decided to wait for two days before moving on to Cheshire. During this time he was ordered to [[Stafford]] to help the sheriff there (perhaps against the Moorlanders who had risen for Parliament). However Aston did not neglect his prime objective and ordered the Cheshire Commissioners of Array to defend [[Nantwich]] with 150 musketeers and to inform him of Brereton's progress. Neither order was carried out and Aston was not informed until it was too late to arrive at Nantwich before Brereton.\n\n===Skirmish at Nantwich===\n[[File:Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet.jpg|right|thumb|Major General Sir William Brereton]]\n\nBrereton, meanwhile, had ridden into [[Congleton]] on the evening of 27 January with\nhis own troop of horse and three companies of dragoons. Although he was joined in Congleton by the former mayor, William Edwards, with another troop of horse, his whole force could not have amounted to more than about 500 men. His mission, however, was not to conquer Cheshire but to rouse and organize the Parliamentary sympathizers in it. He had with him the cadre of a foot regiment, a case of drakes (small cannon about 7\u00bd feet long) and 700 muskets in his baggage train as well as an experienced Scottish professional, Major James Lothian,<ref>[http://www.scotwars.com/james_lothian.htm Major James Lothian. A short history of a Scots professional soldier in Cheshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927101159/http://www.scotwars.com/james_lothian.htm |date=2011-09-27 }}</ref> to train recruits. He had wide powers to construct fortifications and raise more men and was to finance the whole enterprise by voluntary payment and [[wiktionary:distraint|distraint]] upon the rent and goods of local Royalists.\n\nHe approached Nantwich on 28 January. not just \"to releave the town, beinge in greate danger to be plundered and destroyed by the Kings Armye and Commissioners of Array\",<ref name=\"malbon\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027145351/http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/malbon.html Malbon\u2019s Memorials of the Civil War]</ref> but also because it offered the only alternative to Chester as a county headquarters. It had sufficient wealth and housing to accommodate a large garrison and staff and was the centre of a network of roads leading to the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[London]], to North [[Wales]], [[Lancashire]], [[Yorkshire]] and [[Scotland]].\n\nBrereton sent ahead 50 dragoons under Lothian to occupy the town and they got there before Aston who had finally been informed of Brereton's progress by [[Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever|Orlando Bridgeman]], the son of the Bishop of Chester. Aston had with him his own troop of horse and some companies of Shropshire dragoons under the command of Colonel Sir Vincent Corbett<ref>\n[http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm  The Corbett Study Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930032731/http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm |date=2007-09-30 }}</ref> totalling about 500 men. Despite his superiority of numbers Aston failed to take the town and at dusk he retreated eastwards down Hospital Street. In a narrow lane his force met the remainder of Brereton's force and confusion was the result. A company of Brereton's dragoons dismounted but failed to leave anyone to control the horses which bolted into the fields and were taken by the Royalists for charging cavalry. The confusion was added to when some Parliamentarians loaded and fired one of the drakes. This does not seem to have caused any injury but the flash and the roar amid the general confusion frightened the Royalists so much \"that they weire all scattered and quyte Rowted\".<ref name=\"malbon\"/>\n\nAston turned up eventually at [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] and, although he claimed the skirmish as a draw, his distance from Nantwich and his appeals for reinforcements indicates that the skirmish was a defeat for the Royalists, likely due to his men being exhausted after the long march from Oxford and that he did not receive the support from the Cheshire Commissioners of Array that he had expected. This lack of proper support continued over the next four or five weeks. An agreement was made to raise a contribution in the county to pay the soldiers but most was paid to the upkeep of the Chester garrison, not to Aston's regiment or to the trained bands. The Royalist leaders were never able to agree to a unified command which meant that they were never able to field an army that would outnumber Brereton's force. There was a force of 2,000 men at Warrington under the Earl of Derby, a Welsh force of 1,000 men at Chester and the Shropshire force at Whitchurch. These never combined and it was not until March that the Royalists decided to choose a place in the county \"to summon in the King's friends\"\n\n==Prelude==\nAston set out for Middlewich on Friday 10 March. His progress was delayed that night when his men, who had yet to be paid, mutinied. Apparently the money and provisions were issued on Saturday but it was so late that Aston had to leave two troops of horse in the forest to guard it - \"though they lay in danger that night.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\">Sir Thomas Aston's Account to the Commissioners of Array for the County of Chester. Document XVII in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 56 \u2013 61 (London, 1874)</ref> It is not known why Middlewich was chosen as opposed to the much safer [[Knutsford]] where it would have been possible to retreat to [[Warrington]] if necessary. In his account of the battle of Middlewich, Aston did not say why he came to Middlewich on 11 March but explained that he had no wish to linger there. He realized the dangers of staying in an open town with enemy forces at both [[Northwich]] and Nantwich. Brereton, who was recruiting in Northwich, commented on the boldness of the Royalists for camping at Middlewich. He believed it resulted from overconfidence in their ability to win over the county and rid it of the Parliamentarians.\n\n==Saturday 11 March==\nAston arrived at Middlewich with about 500 mounted troops and over 1000 of the trained bands of the [[Broxton (hundred)|Broxton]] and [[Hundred of Wirral|Wirral]] [[Hundred (division)|Hundred]]s plus three cannons. William Brereton sent a strong party of horse from Northwich \"who gave them an alarm.\" Aston had meanwhile received a letter from the Governor of Chester, Sir Nicolas Byron,<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=19198 A History of the County of Chester: Volume 5 (i)]</ref> telling him that if he provided an escort for the family and goods of [[William Brereton, 2nd Baron Brereton|Lord Brereton]] to Chester then the latter, who was a relative of Sir William Brereton, would provide men for Aston. Although reluctant to linger in Middlewich, Thomas, after consulting with the sheriff, Sir [[Edward Fytton]] and Colonel Ellis, decided it was worth waiting for another day. He therefore sent a letter to Lord Brereton urging him to act immediately even though it meant travelling on a Sunday.\n\n==Sunday 12 March==\nBrereton, wanting to \"annoy\" the enemy, set out with two or three companies of dragoons to give alarm at Middlewich. He had no intention of attacking but wanted to harass the Royalists. In the meantime Lord Brereton had not done as Aston requested but instead came to Middlewich to confer further. Thomas believed that Lord Brereton's presence in Middlewich led to the attack by the Parliamentarians because they wanted to prevent the Royalists from joining forces. Sir William Brereton however, in his account of the battle, made it clear that he attacked because he believed a Royalist presence in Middlewich posed too much of a threat to be ignored.\n\nIn order to confer with Lord Brereton and also the sheriff's desire to \"sumon the countrey with theire contribucon and assistance, necessitated a ioynt consent to stay there on Monday.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>  Realising the danger posed by this decision Aston asked that the governor use the Whitchurch forces to threaten the Parliamentarians at Nantwich. According to the Commissioners of Array the Whitchurch force was not ordered to threaten Nantwich. In any case the forces there had been disbanded. Aston's fears were well founded as Brereton arranged to meet the Nantwich forces at six o'clock the next morning and to make a joint attack on Middlewich.\n\n==Battle==\nOn the morning of Monday 13 March the Nantwich forces had not arrived at the appointed time so Brereton decided to attack with his cavalry and about 200 musketeers (\"our greatest force of foot being at Nantwich\"). He \"with the best forces hee had theire came early in the mornynge backe to Midlewiche, & vpon Sheathe Heathe att the west end of the said Towne, Sr Thomas Aston havinge taken the advantage of the said ground & wynde, & planted his ordnance, sett upon him\"<ref name=\"malbon\"/>  Thomas sent a party of dragoons and horse under Captain Spotswood to give an alarm at Northwich, presumably to draw off some of Brereton's force. The captain, however, disobeyed orders and engaged the enemy and as a result Brereton's forces were able to establish themselves in one street leading into the town. In another street Captain Prestwich and his men were caught unawares by the enemy but were able to rally and drive back the enemy horse and rescue some prisoners. He stopped at a bridge and managed to hold off the enemy until the foot soldiers arrived. Waring Bridge was also approached by the enemy so Aston sent Prestwich and his troop to aid Captain Massie's company of foot defend it. In this way Aston was able to hold off the enemy until about 9:00 or 10:00&nbsp;a.m. when the Nantwich force arrived \"so resolutely and with such undauntedness of spirit.\" About 800 foot and 300 horse came down Booth Lane and entered into Newton at the south end of the town, where Aston had placed \"a good Brasse peece of ordnance\" and two trained bands of 200 men who were \"well advantaged by ditches and bankes on both sides.\" Aston withdrew a troop of horse under the command of Captain Bridgeman from the Northwich approach to check the advance of the Nantwich force. The rest of his horse he held back behind the foot, \"there being noe other ground for horse\", apart from a force of about 60 to attack the enemy. His plan was to line the hedge with about 100 musketeers so that the enemy could not take advantage of the ditches on both sides of the lane to attack the charging horse.\n\nThe Parliamentary force, on finding the lane so well defended, took to the fields on either side of the lane. The Royalist horse could not charge because of the hedges and the musketeers deserted as soon as the first shots were fired at them. The horse was therefore outflanked and cut off by the enemy musketeers on both sides of the lane. On the west side of the town the troop of horse, under Mayor Thomas Holme, were managing to hold off the Parliamentarians despite the fact that Bridgeman's troop had been withdrawn to defend the southern entrance. However, when Sergeant Major Gilmore ordered his foot to retreat the horse were outflanked by enemy musketeers on either side of the lane behind the hedges where the horse could not charge. They were therefore forced back into the town. The street was defended by musketeers behind a breastwork but they ran away after blindly firing once. Similarly the foot soldiers guarding Waring Bridge were ordered to retreat and the Parliamentarians were able to enter the town from there. Meanwhile, the horse on the Nantwich approach were pulled back to allow the use of the cannon that Ellis had drawn up.\n\nThe Parliamentarians were advancing towards [[St. Michael and All Angels, Middlewich|St Michael and All Angels church]] from three directions so Aston ordered a party of Captain Spotswood's dragoons to secure and defend the churchyard. He also placed a guard at the breastworks on the west side of town and put a cannon in the churchyard to cover the street. A company of musketeers and two trained bands were brought up to hold off the advancing Nantwich force. These musketeers lay down in the ditches as soon as they came to Ellis's cannon and it was all Aston could do to get them up to the hedges with the other musketeers by riding among them \"and with my sword I beat them up.\" This served no purpose because the soldiers would not lift their heads to see where to fire but instead shot their muskets into the air.\n\nThe Parliamentarians meanwhile had become encouraged by the inaccurate fire of the cannon and they charged the Royalist foot who promptly ran away, leaving Aston's cavalry exposed and unable to charge because of a large ditch. They therefore drew off to a safer position. Seeing this, a body of pikemen behind a breastwork further back ran away and \"all the musqueteers placed for the defence of the street ende quit their trenches, having never seen the enemy or cause of feare, but their fellows flying.\" Aston, however, held his cavalry firm until Ellis could draw off his cannon and then ordered a retreat to the high street. Aston himself went to the churchyard expecting it to be defended as he had ordered. Instead he found all the foot soldiers in the church and he could not \"draw out ten musqueteers out of the church would it have saved the world.\"  Relying on his two cannon to cover two streets, Aston ordered his cavalry, being exposed to the advancing enemy on three sides, to regroup in a field at one end of the town. However, their way was blocked by a barricade erected by Spotswood and they became separated and were unable to regroup until they were well past Kinderton House.\n\nReturning to the cannon Aston found that one had been deserted and the other being drawn off by a solitary cannoneer. With all the other men, including Ellis, in the church and refusing to come out, Aston was now alone:\n<blockquote>\n\"The enimy falling directly in three streets upon me, and discharging upon me in the church-yard, the horse marched out of sight. I alone, all I could possibly hope to doe was to rally the horse again if possible, to wheel about, and to fall in the rear of them\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the maze of streets Aston lost contact with his cavalry, apart from a few stragglers, and had little hope of turning the disaster into success especially as the Parliamentarians had now taken the church. With it they captured Ellis, Gilmore, Moseley, ten captains and other officers, 400 common soldiers, weapons for 500 men, two barrels of matches, four barrels of powder and two cannons.  Brereton, therefore, believed that \"since the beginning of this unnatural war, God hath not given many more complete victories.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsBrereton\">Battle of Middlewich, March 13, 1643 - Sir William Brereton's Account. Document XVI in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 54 \u2013 55 (London, 1874)</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Sir Thomas Aston===\nAston sent a messenger to rally his cavalry at [[Northwich|Rudheath]] intending to go on to [[Brereton, Cheshire|Lord Brereton]] and collect his force. The cavalry were, however, beyond recall and so Aston went on his own to give an account of the battle and to see if Lord Brereton was still willing to support him. Finding that he was, Aston returned to Whitchurch to raise the Shropshire forces. However, the trained bands there had been disbanded leaving him no alternative but to return to Cheshire, rally his men and await his fate. He summed up his feelings about the battle thus:\n<blockquote>\n\"It is the plain truth, the enemy having no diversion, but att liberty with their full power to fall on us from all parts, were much too hard for us in a place not defensible. And without some more experienced foot officers, I must freely say no number will be found sufficient to withstand ready men.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>\n</blockquote>\nHe was withdrawn to Oxford and continued to command a cavalry regiment in the King's field army. In 1644 he fought as a brigadier of cavalry in [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Prince Maurice's]] army in the West of England and fought at the [[second Battle of Newbury]] but probably never returned to Cheshire (although at least two sources mention him being there in 1644).<ref>[http://www.pardoes.com/abo/history.htm Welcome to Acton Bridge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016154440/http://www.pardoes.com/abo/history.htm |date=16 October 2006 }} states that during the Civil War in 1644 Sir Thomas Aston's men exercised \"all manor of outrages and intollerable taxes. They plundered Weaverham and the country about, carried off old men out of their houses, bound them together, tyde them to a cart and rove them through mire and water to that dungeon, where they lie without fire or light and now through extremities are so diseased, they are ready to give up the ghost.\" but does not state the source of the quote. Also John Vicars (see Online Sources below) stated that Brereton during the siege of Nantwich in 1644 \"won a most famous Victory of the Lord Capell and the Lord Byron.....and Sir Thomas Aston also\"</ref>\n\nIn 1645 Aston served in the West Country under [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] until September or October when he decided to return home. He passed through [[Kidderminster]] and [[Stourbridge]] on his way to Cheshire. At the beginning of November he was captured by a Parliamentary force under the command of a certain Captain Stones \"att or neere Banke\" (possibly near [[Walsall]]) along with about 60 Royalists - presumably Cheshire men who had fought in Aston's regiment and who were also returning home. From there he was taken to prison and placed under arrest. On 24 March 1646 Aston died of a fever brought on by his various wounds, including a blow to the head received during an unsuccessful attempt to escape.\n\n===Sir William Brereton===\nBrereton declared God responsible for him winning the battle:\n<blockquote>\n\"I desire the whole praise and glory may be attributed to Almighty God, who infused courage into them that stood for His cause, and struck the enemy with terror and amazement.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsBrereton\"/>\n</blockquote>\nBy the end of the spring Parliamentary forces, with Brereton as commander-in-chief, controlled five of the seven Hundreds of Cheshire. From this time on through to February 1646, when the last remaining Royalist base at Chester surrendered to him, the county was dominated by Berenton and he proved to be a dynamic war-time leader not just militarily but also politically and administratively. According to professor Ives, because of the importance of Cheshire, Brereton  \"had more influence on the outcome of the First English Civil War than Oliver Cromwell had.\"<ref name=\"ives\"/>  He suffered his only major defeat in December 1643 at [[Second Battle of Middlewich|Middlewich]]. In 1646, when peace returned and his control over Cheshire came to an end, Brereton moved south to become an active London-based MP and politician. As a reward for his services he received the chief forestership of the Forest of Macclesfield and the [[wiktionary:seneschal|seneschalship]] of the Hundred of Macclesfield. In 1651 he received the tenancy of the former archbishop's palace at [[Croydon]] in [[Surrey]] and he spent the last nine years of his life commuting between there and his ancestral home at [[Handforth]], in Cheshire. He died on 7 April 1661 in [[Croydon]] and is presumed to have been buried in the family vault in the church at [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] in Cheshire.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*R.

He defeated the sitting [[United Australia Party]] member, [[Claude Fleck]]. He was a supporter of Lang's [[Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist)]] during the party split of 1941 but did not support the later manifestations of [[Lang Labor]].<ref name=NSW/>\n\n==Speaker of the Legislative Assembly==\nLamb succeeded [[Daniel Clyne]] as the [[Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] after the [[1947 New South Wales state election|1947]] election and retained the position for twelve years. His time as speaker was characterised by his singular interpretation of standing orders and firm control, leading to frequent criticism from the opposition for inflexibility, unnecessary interjections from the chair and bias towards the government.<ref name=NSW/>\n\nUnusually for a serving speaker, Lamb often made contributions in committee stages of bills. Controversially he even opposed some of his government's legislation, including the ''[[Local Government (Areas) Act 1948|Local Government (Areas)]]'' bill in 1948, calling it a \"flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of the democratic system\" which was a reference to the decision to amalgamate [[Municipality of Granville|Granville Council]] into [[City of Parramatta|Parramatta]] instead of the other way round.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105736551 |title=LAMB LASHES OUT ON MUNICIPAL MERGER. |newspaper=[[The Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers' Advocate]] |location=Parramatta, NSW |date=25 August 1948 |accessdate=15 September 2015 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nDefeated in a caucus ballot for speaker in 1959, Lamb was granted retention of the \"Honourable\" title.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128813692 |title=Maher N.S.W.
