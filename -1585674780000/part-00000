Singapore lies about one degree of latitude ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], and is situated off the southern tip of the [[Malay peninsula]], and, by extension, the [[Extreme points of Asia|southernmost extremity]] of continental [[Eurasia]]. The island country is wedged between western [[Indonesia]] and [[peninsular Malaysia]], sharing its [[Indonesia\u2013Singapore border|southern maritime border]] with the [[Riau archipelago|Batam, Bintan, and Karimun archipelago]] of the former's [[Riau Islands]] province, and its [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore border|northern, western, and eastern maritime borders]] with the latter's [[Johor|Johor state]]; it is additionally in the vicinity of [[Sumatra]] to its west and [[Borneo]] to its east. The island country is enveloped by the littoral waters of the [[Straits of Johor|Johore Strait]] to its north and the [[Singapore Strait]] to its south, and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, being bounded by the [[Malacca Strait]] to its west and the [[South China Sea]] to its east. The country's territory, which is [[Malay Archipelago|archipelagic]], is composed of one [[Pulau Ujong|main island]], [[List of islands of Singapore|63 satellite islands and islets]], and [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|one outlying islet]], the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive [[land reclamation]] projects.\n\nThroughout its millennia-long history, Singapore was a maritime [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]] that fell under the suzerainty of several successive Malay polities: initially a series of ancient to medieval Hindu-Buddhist [[thalassocracy|thalassocratic]] empires, subsequently a medieval [[Kingdom of Singapura|localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom]], and ultimately two [[Early modern period|early modern]] Islamic sultanates.<ref>[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-mark-200th-anniversary-of-raffles-arrival]</ref>{{refn|Singapore fell under the ''[[Mandala (political model)|mandala]]'' (suzerainty) of at least two Hindu-Buddhist thalassocracies (maritime empires): The [[Melayu Kingdom]] (also known as Dharmasraya or Jambi), and [[Srivijaya]]. It is postulated that the [[Majapahit]] exercised control over Singapore at some point in its history. Following Srivijaya's decline, a localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom\u2014the [[Kingdom of Singapura]]\u2014was founded on the main island. The Kingdom of Singapura was the final Dharmic polity to have exercised control of Singapore. It was then succeeded by the Muslim [[Malacca Sultanate]], which was in turn succeeded by the [[Johor Sultanate]]\u2014the final indigenous Malay polity to have exercised control over Singapore prior to its colonisation by the British.|group=Note}} The 1819 arrival of [[Stamford Raffles]], a British colonial officer, and the subsequent establishment of an [[East India Company]] trading post on the island\u2014then part of the [[Johor Sultanate]]\u2014marked the [[Founding of modern Singapore|genesis of modern Singapore]]. Five years later, the British [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824#History|partitioned the Sultanate]] and coercively wrested Singapore from the [[Hussein Shah of Johor|Sultan's]] control, marking the cessation of indigenous rule over the island for the first time in its history. In 1826, Singapore was incorporated into the [[Straits Settlements]], a pan-[[British Malaya|Malayan]] presidency of the Company with [[Penang]] as capital,<ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/c818356a-e1b9-4f8f-95b3-eee9b3351096]</ref>{{refn|The Straits Settlements were originally composed of (in chronological order) the [[British Malaya]]n peninsular territories of [[Penang]], Singapore, [[Malacca]], and [[Manjung District|Dindings]]. In the 1880s, the Settlements were expanded to include the British Indian Ocean territories of [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]. The last territory to be incorporated into the Settlements was the [[British Borneo|British Bornean]] territory of [[Crown Colony of Labuan|Labuan]] in 1907.|group=Note}} and in 1830, the Settlements were annexed to British India as a residency, where they would be governed from the capital of Calcutta under two administrations\u2014until 1858 under [[Company rule in India|Company rule]], and\u2014following the Company's collapse in the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 Indian Rebellion]]\u2014until 1867 under the successive [[British Raj]]. In 1867, the administration of the Settlements was transferred to London, bringing them under the direct control of the [[United Kingdom]] as a Malayan [[crown colony]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/372a4e72-9f1b-4eb4-9ec6-58cad02000f0|title=Singapore attains crown colony status}}</ref><ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/bd541c73-58ef-4bb1-9de7-173f00913286]</ref><ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/372a4e72-9f1b-4eb4-9ec6-58cad02000f0]</ref>\n\nFrom 1867 to the 1940s, Singapore, having taken over Penang as capital of the Settlements, grew into a thriving [[entrep\u00f4t]] and settler-colony under the auspices of the [[British Empire]], attracting large numbers of non-indigenous settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond.<ref>[http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers3/Lloyd97.pdf]</ref> During the [[Second World War]], [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] [[Fall of Singapore|invaded and annexed Singapore]], resulting in an interregnum of British colonial rule corresponding with a brief but bloody [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]] from 1942 to 1945. Following [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in 1945, Singapore was returned to British control; in 1946, the Straits Settlements were dissolved, and Singapore became a standalone [[Colony of Singapore|crown colony]]. In 1959, following a protracted period of agitation against colonial rule, Singapore was granted limited autonomy; in 1963, it became fully emancipated from the British Empire upon its [[Malaysia Agreement|federation]] with the territories of the erstwhile [[British Malaya]] and [[British Borneo]] to form the new country of [[Malaysia]].{{refn|Singapore federated with three other entities to form the country of Malaysia. <br><br> The first entity was the [[Federation of Malaya]], which was the decolonised agglomeration of the peninsular territories of the erstwhile [[British Malaya]]\u2014composed of the [[Unfederated Malay States]], the [[Federated Malay States]], and the peninsular [[Straits Settlements]] of [[Penang]], [[Malacca]], and [[Manjung District|Dindings]]. <br><br> The second and third entities were the [[British Borneo|British Bornean]] crown colonies of [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] and [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], respectively; the latter came to be known as [[Sabah]] after the formation of Malaysia.|group=Note}} However, after [[Singapore in Malaysia|two tumultuous years]] as a constituent state of the Malaysian Federation, marred by violent ethnoreligious [[Ethnic conflict|strife]] and other intractable differences between [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|indigenous]] and non-indigenous groups, Singapore was [[August 1965#August 9, 1965 (Monday)|expelled]] in 1965, becoming the first country in modern history to gain independence against its will\u2014although this narrative remains contentious.{{refn|Singapore's secession from the Malaysian Federation in 1965 is a contentious issue without a set historical narrative. The popular narrative is that Singapore was expelled from Malaysia, becoming the first country in modern history to gain independence against its will. This is technically correct, as the Malaysian Parliament voted unanimously in favour of Singapore's expulsion from the Federation. <br><br> However, historians believe that Singapore's political leaders might have been acutely aware of the prospect of a breakaway from the very start because of the domestic instability brought about by the incompatibility of worldviews within the Federation\u2014the most major source of acrimony being the steadfast insistence of Singapore's leaders on the concept of a [[Malaysian Malaysia]], not a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]-dominated Malaysia ''([[Ketuanan Melayu]])''. It has even been suggested that some of Singapore's political leaders might have actively precipitated the breakaway by negotiating the terms of secession in backdoor meetings.<ref>[https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/52146/was-singapore%E2%80%99s-independence-accident]</ref>|group=Note}} After early years of [[History of the Republic of Singapore#1965 to 1979|turbulence]], the newly sovereign nation\u2014viewed as a nonviable state by international observers due to its [[microstate|diminutiveness]], geostrategic vulnerability, absence of natural resources, and lack of a [[hinterland]]\u2014defied odds by rapidly developing and industrialising under the leadership of the inaugural [[People's Action Party]] to become a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]] and developed country within a single generation.\n\nSingapore is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary republic|parliamentary]] [[Constitution|constitutional]] [[republic]] with a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature that has been characterised by [[Dominant-party system|dominant-party rule]] since independence.

The Annals state that Nila Utama, who discovered the island on a voyage and subsequently founded the Kingdom of Singapura, sought to give the island a regal name after witnessing a lion stalking its shores. However, it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island; the prince probably saw a [[Malayan tiger]], the largest [[big cat]] species endemic to the Malay peninsula. The second hypothesis, drawn from the ''[[Tom\u00e9 Pires#The Suma Oriental|Suma Oriental]]'', a Portuguese historical source, postulates that the name was given by another Srivijayan Raja, the 14th-century [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] of Palembang. According to the source, Parameswara was the actual founder of the Kingdom of Singapura, usurping the throne of the preceding Temasek kingdom from its ruler, installing himself as Raja, and rechristening the kingdom ''Singapura'' in order to legitimise his claim over the island with a regal name of his own making. Although the name Parameswara and the narrative of usurpation are not mentioned in the Malay Annals, it is believed that Iskandar Shah\u2014a ruler identified by the Annals to be the fifth and final Raja of Singapura, and the subsequent founder of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]\u2014corresponds with the Parameswara of the ''Suma Oriental'' based on the extreme similarity of their biographies.<ref name=\"turnbull\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9yvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=A History of Modern Singapore, 1819-2005 |author= C.M.

There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services.

Singapore lies about one degree of latitude ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], and is situated off the southern tip of the [[Malay peninsula]], and, by extension, the [[Extreme points of Asia|southernmost extremity]] of continental [[Eurasia]]. The island country is wedged between western [[Indonesia]] and [[peninsular Malaysia]], sharing its [[Indonesia\u2013Singapore border|southern maritime border]] with the [[Riau archipelago|Batam, Bintan, and Karimun archipelago]] of the former's [[Riau Islands]] province, and its [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore border|northern, western, and eastern maritime borders]] with the latter's [[Johor|Johor state]]; it is additionally in the vicinity of [[Sumatra]] to its west and [[Borneo]] to its east. The island country is enveloped by the littoral waters of the [[Straits of Johor|Johore Strait]] to its north and the [[Singapore Strait]] to its south, and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, being bounded by the [[Malacca Strait]] to its west and the [[South China Sea]] to its east. The country's territory, which is [[Malay Archipelago|archipelagic]], is composed of one [[Pulau Ujong|main island]], [[List of islands of Singapore|63 satellite islands and islets]], and [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|one outlying islet]], the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive [[land reclamation]] projects.\n\nThroughout its millennia-long history, Singapore was a maritime [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]] that fell under the suzerainty of several successive Malay polities: initially a series of ancient to medieval Hindu-Buddhist [[thalassocracy|thalassocratic]] empires, subsequently a medieval [[Kingdom of Singapura|localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom]], and ultimately two [[Early modern period|early modern]] Islamic sultanates.<ref>[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-mark-200th-anniversary-of-raffles-arrival]</ref>{{refn|Singapore fell under the ''[[Mandala (political model)|mandala]]'' (suzerainty) of at least two Hindu-Buddhist thalassocracies (maritime empires): The [[Melayu Kingdom]] (also known as Dharmasraya or Jambi), and [[Srivijaya]]. It is postulated that the [[Majapahit]] exercised control over Singapore at some point in its history. Following Srivijaya's decline, a localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom\u2014the [[Kingdom of Singapura]]\u2014was founded on the main island. The Kingdom of Singapura was the final Dharmic polity to have exercised control of Singapore. It was then succeeded by the Muslim [[Malacca Sultanate]], which was in turn succeeded by the [[Johor Sultanate]]\u2014the final indigenous Malay polity to have exercised control over Singapore prior to its colonisation by the British.|group=Note}} The 1819 arrival of [[Stamford Raffles]], a British colonial officer, and the subsequent establishment of an [[East India Company]] trading post on the island\u2014then part of the [[Johor Sultanate]]\u2014marked the [[Founding of modern Singapore|genesis of modern Singapore]]. Five years later, the British [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824#History|partitioned the Sultanate]] and coercively wrested Singapore from the [[Hussein Shah of Johor|Sultan's]] control, marking the cessation of indigenous rule over the island for the first time in its history. In 1826, Singapore was incorporated into the [[Straits Settlements]], a pan-[[British Malaya|Malayan]] presidency of the Company with [[Penang]] as capital,<ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/c818356a-e1b9-4f8f-95b3-eee9b3351096]</ref>{{refn|The Straits Settlements were originally composed of (in chronological order) the [[British Malaya]]n peninsular territories of [[Penang]], Singapore, [[Malacca]], and [[Manjung District|Dindings]]. In the 1880s, the Settlements were expanded to include the British Indian Ocean territories of [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]. The last territory to be incorporated into the Settlements was the [[British Borneo|British Bornean]] territory of [[Crown Colony of Labuan|Labuan]] in 1907.|group=Note}} and in 1830, the Settlements were annexed to British India as a residency, where they would be governed from the capital of Calcutta under two administrations\u2014until 1858 under [[Company rule in India|Company rule]], and\u2014following the Company's collapse in the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 Indian Rebellion]]\u2014until 1867 under the successive [[British Raj]]. In 1867, the administration of the Settlements was transferred to London, bringing them under the direct control of the [[United Kingdom]] as a Malayan [[crown colony]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/372a4e72-9f1b-4eb4-9ec6-58cad02000f0|title=Singapore attains crown colony status}}</ref><ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/bd541c73-58ef-4bb1-9de7-173f00913286]</ref><ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/372a4e72-9f1b-4eb4-9ec6-58cad02000f0]</ref>\n\nFrom 1867 to the 1940s, Singapore, having taken over Penang as capital of the Settlements, grew into a thriving [[entrep\u00f4t]] and settler-colony under the auspices of the [[British Empire]], attracting large numbers of non-indigenous settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond.<ref>[http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers3/Lloyd97.pdf]</ref> During the [[Second World War]], [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] [[Fall of Singapore|invaded and annexed Singapore]], resulting in an interregnum of British colonial rule corresponding with a brief but bloody [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]] from 1942 to 1945. Following [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in 1945, Singapore was returned to British control; in 1946, the Straits Settlements were dissolved, and Singapore became a standalone [[Colony of Singapore|crown colony]]. In 1959, following a protracted period of agitation against colonial rule, Singapore was granted limited autonomy; in 1963, it became fully emancipated from the British Empire upon its [[Malaysia Agreement|federation]] with the territories of the erstwhile [[British Malaya]] and [[British Borneo]] to form the new country of [[Malaysia]].{{refn|Singapore federated with three other entities to form the country of Malaysia. <br><br> The first entity was the [[Federation of Malaya]], which was the decolonised agglomeration of the peninsular territories of the erstwhile [[British Malaya]]\u2014composed of the [[Unfederated Malay States]], the [[Federated Malay States]], and the peninsular [[Straits Settlements]] of [[Penang]], [[Malacca]], and [[Manjung District|Dindings]]. <br><br> The second and third entities were the [[British Borneo|British Bornean]] crown colonies of [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] and [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], respectively; the latter came to be known as [[Sabah]] after the formation of Malaysia.|group=Note}} However, after [[Singapore in Malaysia|two tumultuous years]] as a constituent state of the Malaysian Federation, marred by violent ethnoreligious [[Ethnic conflict|strife]] and other intractable differences between [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|indigenous]] and non-indigenous groups, Singapore was [[August 1965#August 9, 1965 (Monday)|expelled]] in 1965, becoming the first country in modern history to gain independence against its will\u2014although this narrative remains contentious.{{refn|Singapore's secession from the Malaysian Federation in 1965 is a contentious issue without a set historical narrative. The popular narrative is that Singapore was expelled from Malaysia, becoming the first country in modern history to gain independence against its will. This is technically correct, as the Malaysian Parliament voted unanimously in favour of Singapore's expulsion from the Federation. <br><br> However, historians believe that Singapore's political leaders might have been acutely aware of the prospect of a breakaway from the very start because of the domestic instability brought about by the incompatibility of worldviews within the Federation\u2014the most major source of acrimony being the steadfast insistence of Singapore's leaders on the concept of a [[Malaysian Malaysia]], not a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]-dominated Malaysia ''([[Ketuanan Melayu]])''.

The Annals state that Nila Utama, who discovered the island on a voyage and subsequently founded the Kingdom of Singapura, sought to give the island a regal name after witnessing a lion stalking its shores. However, it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island; the prince probably saw a [[Malayan tiger]], the largest [[big cat]] species endemic to the Malay peninsula. The second hypothesis, drawn from the ''[[Tom\u00e9 Pires#The Suma Oriental|Suma Oriental]]'', a Portuguese historical source, postulates that the name was given by another Srivijayan Raja, the 14th-century [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] of Palembang. According to the source, Parameswara was the actual founder of the Kingdom of Singapura, usurping the throne of the preceding Temasek kingdom from its ruler, installing himself as Raja, and rechristening the kingdom ''Singapura'' in order to legitimise his claim over the island with a regal name of his own making. Although the name Parameswara and the narrative of usurpation are not mentioned in the Malay Annals, it is believed that Iskandar Shah\u2014a ruler identified by the Annals to be the fifth and final Raja of Singapura, and the subsequent founder of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]\u2014corresponds with the Parameswara of the ''Suma Oriental'' based on the extreme similarity of their biographies.<ref name=\"turnbull\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9yvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=A History of Modern Singapore, 1819-2005 |author= C.M.

There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services.

In Shanghai, Xiao Yi struggles to find a job. She finds many low-paying jobs before working at Teng Fei but is happy to be with Tian Fei. At the same time, Tian Fei's colleague Xiao Lu (Yedda Chen), a new college graduate, has fallen in love with Tian Fei and is determined be with him. Wealthy bachelor Ma Yao Zu/ Hou Zi (Dennis Oh) is the son of the director of Teng Fei, and is Xiao Yi's boss. Although they met on a bad note and they argue continually, he cares for her and look out for her.\n\nAs emotions become more tangled, Xiao Lu fakes a pregnancy to force Tian Fei to marry her. Tian Fei makes a promise to Xiao Yi that he will take two years to work out the situation and then return to her. Xiao Yi naively believes him and waits for the two years to pass, but then finds out that she is pregnant with Tian Fei's baby. After half a year, finding out that Tian Fei will marry Xiao Lu, Xiao Yi has had enough of waiting for Tian Fei. Hou Zi confesses his feelings for Xiao Yi but she rejects him, citing her current situation as preventing them from being together.\n\nTwo years later, Xiao Yi has given birth to a girl, Lan Miao Miao, played by Fatimah, and is trying to earn enough money to buy her own apartment in Shanghai. She attempts to take care of her daughter alone while working full-time. By accident, she meets Hou Zi (Dennis Oh) again, but he's engaged to another girl, Shen Xue. Although he does not love her, he had initially lost hope of ever finding Xiao Yi before suddenly seeing her again. Tian Fei and Xiao Lu have also married and Tian Fei now has a car, a house, and a reliable job. But Tian Fei's and Xiao Lu's relationship falls apart after Tian Fei learns that Xiao Lu lied about her pregnancy. Although they don't hit if off at first, Hou Zi cares for Xiao Yi and Miao Miao, taking care of Xiao Yi, Miao Miao and her parents. Although she initially has reservations about dating him because of her situation, they slowly begin to fall in love with each other as he proves to be a reliable and caring man who appears whenever she needs any help.\n\nOne day, a drunk Tian Fei calls Xiao Yi, asking to meet up, although she expresses no interest in giving him a second chance. Following a series of encounters, Tian Fei learns that Xiao Yi has a child. Suspecting that it is his, he confronts Xiao Yi, but she refuses, and Hou Zi continues to look out for her, acting as a father figure for Miao Miao. After checking the DNA results, Tian Fei confirms that Miao Miao is his daughter. Tian Fei wants to rekindle their relationship again, but Xiao Yi is unwilling. After Tian Fei and his mother express their desire to take Miao Miao, Hou Zi attempts to stop them, even secretly offering Tian Fei a large sum of money to get him to leave her and her family alone.\n\nAfter a car accident, Tian Fei is left in a comatose state. Xiao Yi and Miao Miao go to see Tian Fei daily, and they try to help him wake up and restore his memories. Although Hou Zi hates Tian Fei, he expresses that Xiao Yi should let him see his daughter, and for her to know her biological father, for Miao Miao's sake. Afterwards, Xiao Yi advises Xiao Lu and Tian Fei to try to accept and love each other. Finally able to move on, Xiao Yi and Hou Zi finally marry and live together happily with their daughter Miao Miao.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dennis Oh]] as Ma Yao Zu (\u9a6c\u8000\u7956) / Hou Zi (\u7334\u5b50)\n* [[Ma Sichun|Ma Si Chun]] as Lan Xiao Yi (\u84dd\u5c0f\u4f9d)\n* Bao Tian Yuan as Lan Miao Miao (\u84dd\u5999\u5999) (Xiao Yi and Tian Fei's daughter)\n* Yuan Cheng Jie (\u8881\u6210\u6770) as Tian Fei (\u7530\u98de)\n* [[Yedda Chen]] as Lu Lu (\u9646\u9732) (Tian Fei's wife)\n* Zheng Si Ren (\u90d1\u65af\u4ec1) as Ah Wen (\u963f\u6587)\n* Ai Li Ya (\u827e\u4e3d\u5a05) as Tian Fei's mother\n* Wang Zhi Hua as Lu Lu's father\n* Wang Xiao Hong (\u738b\u5c0f\u7ea2) as Lu Lu's mother\n* Li Guo Liang (\u674e\u56fd\u6881) as Xiao Yi's father\n* Zhang Zhi Hua as Xiao Yi's mother\n* Juan Zi as Manager Wang\n* Xi Man Ning as Hou Zi's mother\n* Wang Zhong Xin (\u738b\u4ef2\u6b23) as Shen Xue, Hou Zi's ex-fianc\u00e9e\n* Liu Tian Yue as Hou Zi's elder sister\n* Zhang Yang (\u7ae0\u626c) as Song Chun Chun (\u5b8b\u6625\u6625)\n\n== Production ==\n* '''Original writing:''' novel \"Cheng Quan Zi Ji De Bi Hai Lan Tian\" (\u6210\u5168\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u78a7\u6d77\u84dd\u5929) by Lan Xiaoxi (\u84dd\u5c0f\u6c50)\n* '''Producer:''' Xu Yun (\u5f90\u4e91)\n* '''Director:''' Chen Hui Ling\n* '''Screenwriter:''' Lan Xiao Xi (\u84dd\u5c0f\u6c50)\n\n== Music ==\n* '''Opening theme song:''' Fang Xin Jiao Gei Wo Ai Qing (\u653e\u5fc3\u4ea4\u7ed9\u6211\u7231\u60c5) by Yuan Cheng Jie (\u8881\u6210\u6770)\n* '''Ending theme song:''' Yi Yang Ai Zhe Ni \u4e00\u6837\u7231\u7740\u4f60 ''Still Loving You'' by BY2\n* '''Insert songs:'''\n** Qi Tian Zhui Dao Ni (\u4e03\u5929\u8ffd\u5230\u4f60) by Rynn Lim\n** Hai Shi Ai Zhe Ta (\u8fd8\u662f\u7231\u7740\u4ed6) ''Still Loving Him'' by Zhang Jing (\u5f20\u5a67)\n** Ai De Shuang Zhong Mo Li (\u7231\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u9b54\u529b) by BY2\n** You Na Me Nan Ma?

Charniaev in [[Saint Petersburg]], 1909]]\nKupala was born on July 7, 1882 in [[Maladzyechna Raion|Viazynka]], a [[folwark]] settlement near [[Maladzyechna]]. His family was noble, although both of Kupala's parents were employed as tenant farmers at the folwark. Kupala was thus essentially born into a landless peasant class. Kupala received a traditional Belarusian education, completing his studies in 1898. Following the death of his father in 1902, Kupala worked a variety of short-term jobs, including as a tutor, a shop assistant, and a record keeper.\n\nKupala's first serious literary attempt was ''Ziarno'', a Polish-language sentimental poem which he completed around 1903\u20131904 under the pseudonym \"K-a.\" His first Belarusian-language work (\"\u041c\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043b\u044f\") was dated July 15, 1904. Kupala's first published poem, \"\u041c\u0443\u0436\u044b\u043a\" (\"Peasant\"), was published approximately a year later, appearing in Belarusian in the Russophone Belarusian newspaper ''Severo-Zapadnyi Krai'' (''Northwestern [[Krai]]'') on May 11, 1905. A number of subsequent poems by Kupala appeared in the Belarusian-language newspaper ''[[Nasha Niva]]'' from 1906 to 1907.<ref>[http://archives.gov.by/eng/index.php?id=951386 Yanka Kupala: personality and work]</ref>\n\n===Personal life===\nThe names of two women are still remembered when it comes to Yanka Kupala\u2019s personal life: Vladislava Stankevich (Vladislava Lutsevich)<ref>https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041b\u0443\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447,_\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430_\u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430</ref> and Paulina Miadzelka<ref>https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041c\u044f\u0434\u0451\u043b\u043a\u0430,_\u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430_\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430</ref>. \nThe lead character of the play ''Paulinka'' was named after Paulina Miadzelka. At the age of 16, she went to Vilnya ([[Vilnius]]) in search of a better life. She met Yanka Kupala in 1909 at her friends\u2019 house. From her memoir ''\u0421\u0446\u0435\u0436\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0456 \u0436\u044b\u0446\u0446\u044f'' (''Paths of life''):\n\n\"Kupala was making jokes, asking if there are many beautiful girls in Vilnya. I frowned and kept silent, unhappy with the playful nature of the conversation.\"\n\nThe encounter with Paulina Miadzelka sank so deep into Kupala\u2019s mind that in four years he named his new play ''Paulinka'' and even invited Paulina Miadzelka to play a lead role in the similarly-named amateur play. The aspiring actress accepted the offer and kept communicating with the author, even though during one of the meetings she pushed him back with words \u201cAre you coming here to teach me how to kiss? I can manage without your lessons.\u201d<ref>https://sputnik.by/longrid/20170706/1029623359/yanka-kupala-tajny-zhizni-lyubvi-i-smerti.html</ref>\n\nYanka Kupala married Vladislava Stankevich in 1916 in St. Peter\u2019s and Paul\u2019s Cathedral in Moscow. There is a comment in Paulina Miadzelka\u2019s memoir that she learned about the marriage of Yanka Kupala and her friend only in a year after the ceremony. \nThe marriage of Yanka Kupala and Vladislava Lutsevich lasted for over 25 years. \nWhen the poet died in 1942, his always energetic wife took it very heavily. She decided to devote her life to preserving the memory of the great poet. It was Vladislava Lutsevich <ref>https://www.kp.by/daily/26624.5/3642327/</ref> who created and became the director of the Museum of Yanka Kupala<ref>https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439_\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439_\u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439_\u042f\u043d\u043a\u0438_\u041a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043b\u044b</ref> in [[Minsk]].\n\n===In Vilnius and St. Petersburg===\nKupala moved to [[Vilnius]] in 1908, where he continued with his career as a poet. The same year the first published collection of his poems, ''\u0416\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0430'' (''The Little Flute'') brought on the ire of the czarist government, which ordered the book confiscated as an anti-government publication. The order for Kupala's arrest was revoked in 1909, but a second printing was again confiscated, this time by the local authorities in Vilnius. Kupala ceased working for the ''[[Nasha Niva]]'' in order to avoid ruining the reputation of the newspaper.\n\nKupala left for [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1909. The subsequent year saw the publication of several works, including the poem ''\u0410\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043d\u044f'' (''Eternal Song''), which appeared as a book in St. Petersburg in July 1910. ''\u0421\u043e\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0435'' (''Dream on a Barrow'')\u2013 completed in August 1910 \u2013symbolised the poor state of Kupala's Belarusian homeland. Kupala left St. Petersburg and returned to Vilnius in 1913. Among those influencing Kupala in the 1910s was [[Maxim Gorky]].\n\n===During the Soviet period===\nKupala's writing changed to an optimistic tone following the [[October Revolution|Great October Revolution]] of 1917. Among Kupala's numerous translations into the Belarusian language were the internationalist-Marxist anthem ''[[The Internationale]]'' and an ancient epic poem [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]] (translated in 1921).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myslenedrevo.com.ua/en/Lit/S/SlovoPolkIgor.html|title=The tale of Igor's campaign}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2011/11/03/slovo.html|title=\u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c 90 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0443 \"\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\" \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a|author=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0442|publisher= \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430|trans-title=the first translation of The Tale of Igor's Campaign into Belarusian was made 90 years ago|language=Russian}}</ref> Nevertheless, Kupala maintained his connections with the [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] oriented nationalist emigres of the [[Belarusian People's Republic]], who exhorted that he join them in exile in [[Czechoslovakia]] during a trip abroad in 1927. At home, the newly established authorities considered him with some distrust\u2013at times, criticism of Kupala in the press mounted insofar as Kupala's activities were regarded as too oriented around nationalism. This period stopped once Kupala printed a public letter of apology in the 1930s.{{cn|date=February 2017}}\n\nKupala was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]] in 1941 for the poetry collection ''\u0410\u0434 \u0441\u044d\u0440\u0446\u0430'' (''From the Heart''). With the [[Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany]] in 1941, because of being very ill he moved to Moscow and then to [[Tatarstan]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} Even from there he wrote poems supporting the [[Soviet partisans#Belarus|Belarusian partisans]] fighting against [[Nazi Germany]]. He died in Moscow in 1942, aged 59, having fallen down the stairwell in [[Hotel Moskva (Moscow)|Hotel Moskva]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} \n \n==Legacy==\n[[File:Yanka Kupala monument in Ashdod - 2.jpg|thumb|A monument to Yanka Kupala in Ashdod, Israel]]\nKupala became recognised as a symbol of [[culture of Belarus]] during the Soviet era.

Kupala ceased working for the ''[[Nasha Niva]]'' in order to avoid ruining the reputation of the newspaper.\n\nKupala left for [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1909. The subsequent year saw the publication of several works, including the poem ''\u0410\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043d\u044f'' (''Eternal Song''), which appeared as a book in St. Petersburg in July 1910. ''\u0421\u043e\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0435'' (''Dream on a Barrow'')\u2013 completed in August 1910 \u2013symbolised the poor state of Kupala's Belarusian homeland. Kupala left St. Petersburg and returned to Vilnius in 1913. Among those influencing Kupala in the 1910s was [[Maxim Gorky]].\n\n===During the Soviet period===\nKupala's writing changed to an optimistic tone following the [[October Revolution|Great October Revolution]] of 1917. Among Kupala's numerous translations into the Belarusian language were the internationalist-Marxist anthem ''[[The Internationale]]'' and an ancient epic poem [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]] (translated in 1921).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myslenedrevo.com.ua/en/Lit/S/SlovoPolkIgor.html|title=The tale of Igor's campaign}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2011/11/03/slovo.html|title=\u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c 90 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0443 \"\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\" \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a|author=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0442|publisher= \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430|trans-title=the first translation of The Tale of Igor's Campaign into Belarusian was made 90 years ago|language=Russian}}</ref> Nevertheless, Kupala maintained his connections with the [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] oriented nationalist emigres of the [[Belarusian People's Republic]], who exhorted that he join them in exile in [[Czechoslovakia]] during a trip abroad in 1927. At home, the newly established authorities considered him with some distrust\u2013at times, criticism of Kupala in the press mounted insofar as Kupala's activities were regarded as too oriented around nationalism. This period stopped once Kupala printed a public letter of apology in the 1930s.{{cn|date=February 2017}}\n\nKupala was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]] in 1941 for the poetry collection ''\u0410\u0434 \u0441\u044d\u0440\u0446\u0430'' (''From the Heart''). With the [[Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany]] in 1941, because of being very ill he moved to Moscow and then to [[Tatarstan]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} Even from there he wrote poems supporting the [[Soviet partisans#Belarus|Belarusian partisans]] fighting against [[Nazi Germany]]. He died in Moscow in 1942, aged 59, having fallen down the stairwell in [[Hotel Moskva (Moscow)|Hotel Moskva]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} \n \n==Legacy==\n[[File:Yanka Kupala monument in Ashdod - 2.jpg|thumb|A monument to Yanka Kupala in Ashdod, Israel]]\nKupala became recognised as a symbol of [[culture of Belarus]] during the Soviet era. A museum, organised in [[Minsk]] through the efforts of his widow in 1945, is the leading literary museum in Belarus. [[Hrodna State University]] was named after Yanka Kupala. There is also a [[Yanka Kupala Park|park]] named after him with a monument to the poet, a [[Yanka Kupala National Academic Theatre|theatre]] and a [[Minsk Metro|metro]] station ([[Kupala\u016dskaja (Minsk Metro)|Kupala\u016dskaja]]) named after him in [[Minsk]].\n\nAt the Arrow Park in [[Monroe, New York]] there is a monument of Yanka Kupala that was created by Belarusian sculptor Anatoly Anikeichik and architect Sergey Botkovsky.

After earning a Master\u2019s degree at the London School of Economics, he would go on to obtain his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[developmental psychology]] at Harvard while working with psychologists [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] and [[Jerome Bruner]], and philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]].<ref name=\"CRLearnEnc\" />\n\nFor his postdoctoral fellowship, Gardner worked alongside [[Norman Geschwind]] at Boston Veterans Administration Hospital and continued his work there for another 20 years.<ref name=\"go.galegroup.com\"/> Gardner began teaching at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] in 1986. Since 1995, much of the focus of his work has been on The GoodWork Project, now part of a larger initiative known as The Good Project that encourages excellence, ethics, and engagement in work, digital life, and beyond.\n\nIn 2000, Gardner, [[Kurt W. Fischer|Kurt Fischer]], and their colleagues at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] established the master's degree program in Mind, Brain and Education. This program was thought to be the first of its kind around the world. Many universities in both the United States and abroad have since developed similar programs. Four years later in 2004, Gardner would continue writing about the mind and brain and would publish ''Changing Minds: The Art and Science of Changing Our Own and Other People's Minds'', a book about seven forms of mind-change.<ref name=\"CRLearnEnc\"/>\n\nGardner retired from teaching in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/19/05/tribute-howard-gardner}}</ref>\n\n===Theory and criticism===\nAccording to Gardner's [[theory of multiple intelligences]], humans have several different ways of processing information, and these ways are relatively independent of one another. The theory is a critique of the standard intelligence theory, which emphasizes the correlation among abilities, as well as traditional measures like IQ tests that typically only account for linguistic, logical, and spatial abilities. Since 1999, Gardner has identified eight intelligences: linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, spatial, bodily/kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Understanding Multiple Intelligences Theory|url=https://smiletutor.sg/how-to-harness-develop-your-natural-strengths-multiple-intelligences-theory/|accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref> Gardner and colleagues have also considered two additional intelligences, existential and pedagogical.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://howardgardner01.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/473-madrid-oct-22-2011.pdf|title=The Theory of Multiple Intelligences: As Psychology, As Education, As Social Science Howard Gardner|work=Howardgardner01.files.wordpress.com|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multipleintelligencesoasis.org|title=Home - Mi Oasis|work=Mi Oasis|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref> Many teachers, school administrators, and special educators have been inspired by Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences as it has allowed for the idea that there is more than one way to define a person's intellect.<ref>Gordon, Lynn Melby. \"Gardner, Howard (1943\u2013).\" Encyclopedia of Human Development.

Other prominent psychologists whose contributions variously developed or expanded the field of study include [[Charles Spearman]], [[Louis Thurstone]], [[Edward Thorndike]], and [[Robert Sternberg]].\n\nIn 1967, Professor [[Nelson Goodman]] started an educational program called Project Zero at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, which began with a focus in arts education and now spans throughout a wide variety of educational arenas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pz.harvard.edu/history.php|title=Project Zero: History|work=Pz.harvard.edu|accessdate=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014215717/http://www.pz.harvard.edu/history.php|archive-date=14 October 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Howard Gardner and David Perkins were founding Research Assistants and later Co-Directed Project Zero from 1972-2000.

After earning a Master\u2019s degree at the London School of Economics, he would go on to obtain his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[developmental psychology]] at Harvard while working with psychologists [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] and [[Jerome Bruner]], and philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]].<ref name=\"CRLearnEnc\" />\n\nFor his postdoctoral fellowship, Gardner worked alongside [[Norman Geschwind]] at Boston Veterans Administration Hospital and continued his work there for another 20 years.<ref name=\"go.galegroup.com\"/> Gardner began teaching at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] in 1986. Since 1995, much of the focus of his work has been on The GoodWork Project, now part of a larger initiative known as The Good Project that encourages excellence, ethics, and engagement in work, digital life, and beyond.\n\nIn 2000, Gardner, [[Kurt W. Fischer|Kurt Fischer]], and their colleagues at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] established the master's degree program in Mind, Brain and Education. This program was thought to be the first of its kind around the world. Many universities in both the United States and abroad have since developed similar programs. Four years later in 2004, Gardner would continue writing about the mind and brain and would publish ''Changing Minds: The Art and Science of Changing Our Own and Other People's Minds'', a book about seven forms of mind-change.<ref name=\"CRLearnEnc\"/>\n\nGardner retired from teaching in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/19/05/tribute-howard-gardner}}</ref>\n\n===Theory and criticism===\nAccording to Gardner's [[theory of multiple intelligences]], humans have several different ways of processing information, and these ways are relatively independent of one another. The theory is a critique of the standard intelligence theory, which emphasizes the correlation among abilities, as well as traditional measures like IQ tests that typically only account for linguistic, logical, and spatial abilities. Since 1999, Gardner has identified eight intelligences: linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, spatial, bodily/kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Understanding Multiple Intelligences Theory|url=https://smiletutor.sg/how-to-harness-develop-your-natural-strengths-multiple-intelligences-theory/|accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref> Gardner and colleagues have also considered two additional intelligences, existential and pedagogical.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://howardgardner01.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/473-madrid-oct-22-2011.pdf|title=The Theory of Multiple Intelligences: As Psychology, As Education, As Social Science Howard Gardner|work=Howardgardner01.files.wordpress.com|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multipleintelligencesoasis.org|title=Home - Mi Oasis|work=Mi Oasis|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref> Many teachers, school administrators, and special educators have been inspired by Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences as it has allowed for the idea that there is more than one way to define a person's intellect.<ref>Gordon, Lynn Melby. \"Gardner, Howard (1943\u2013).\" Encyclopedia of Human Development.

Web. 8 Dec. 2014.</ref>\n\nGardner's definition of intelligence has been met with some criticism in education circles<ref>http://educationnext.org/reframing-the-mind/</ref> as well as in the field of psychology.  Perhaps the strongest and most enduring critique of his theory of multiple intelligences centers on its lack of empirical evidence, much of which points to a single construct of intelligence called \"g\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Klein | first1 = Perry D | year = 1998 | title = A Response to Howard Gardner: Falsifiability, Empirical Evidence, and Pedagogical Usefulness in Educational Psychologies | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Education | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 103\u2013112 | doi = 10.2307/1585969 | jstor = 1585969 }}</ref> Gardner responds that his theory is based entirely on applied evidence as opposed to experimental evidence, as he does not believe experimental evidence is appropriate for a theoretical synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gardner | first1 = Howard | year = 2006| title = On failing to grasp the core of MI theory: A response to Visser et al. | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 34 | issue = 5| pages = 503\u2013505 | doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2006.04.002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gardner | first1 = Howard | last2 = Moran | first2 = Seana | year = 2006| title = The science of multiple intelligences theory: A response to Lynn Waterhouse | url = | journal = Educational Psychologist | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 227\u2013232 | doi = 10.1207/s15326985ep4104_2 }}</ref>\n\nGardner's theory of multiple intelligences can be seen as both a departure from and a continuation of the last century's work on the subject of human intelligence.

His initial fame came from his portraits of glamorous actresses of the silent film era, but since his death, his Asian-inspired works, figures drawn from Hispanic California and pastel landscapes have received greater attention.\n\nLukits began his professional career as an illustrator while still in his teens. He was a still life painter, muralist and founder of the Lukits Academy of Fine Arts in Los Angeles for more than sixty years.  He had the reputation of a craftsman who made his own paints from raw pigments, constructed brushes and palettes, and designed and carved frames.  Lukits was responsible for keeping the \"Beaux-Arts\" methods of the French academic system alive in the western United States, and several of his students went on to prominent careers.<ref>Morseburg, Theodore Lukits, CAC Newsletter articles</ref>  His works are displayed in many public collections. He was a member of a number of professional art organizations and won many awards in competitions.  Lukits has been the subject of a number of solo museum exhibitions since his death, and his work has been included in a number of other museum exhibitions devoted to [[Tonalism]] and California and American [[Impressionism]].\n\n==Early history==\n\nLukits was born Nicolae Teodorescu in [[Timi\u0219oara]], [[Transylvania]], which was then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. His father, Theodore Lukits, Sr., was a butcher, and his mother was a homemaker.  He came to the United States at age two when his family immigrated in 1899, and he grew up in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref>Ancestry.com, U.S. Department of Immigration and Naturalization, Department of State Records. U.S. census records reveals Lukits Sr. was a butcher and sausage maker.</ref>  Lukits began formal studies at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] School of Fine Arts before he was twelve.<ref>Enrollment receipt in archival section of theodorelukits.org website dates to 1911.</ref> His first teacher was [[Edmund H. Wuerpel]] (1866\u20131958). He also studied with [[Richard E. Miller]] (1875\u20131943) in St. Louis, who had returned home from the art colony of Givery and was staying with his parents.<ref>''Who's Who in American Art'', 1940\u20131941, Lukits entry, page 407.</ref><ref>Miller's presence back in the U.S. is not well known but established by the 1910 U.S. census, which shows him in St. Louis, ancestry.com records</ref>  Lukits left public school after the 8th grade in order to pursue a career in art, with the full cooperation of his parents.  He worked from an early age, first as an office boy and then as an airbrush artist, painting delicate girls' heads on leather.<ref>Theodorelukits.org website archive, tuition receipts, letters of recommendation</ref>\n\n==Education in Chicago==\n\nLukits moved to [[Chicago]] when he was fifteen to attend the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].  At the Chicago Academy he studied with the painter, illustrator and traveler [[Carl Werntz]] (1874\u20131944) who founded the school in 1902.  He also studied with [[William Victor Higgins]], who later became famous as one of the [[Taos Ten]] of the [[Taos art colony]].<ref>''Who's Who in American Art'', 1919\u20131957, issues have list of instructors.</ref>\n\nLukits began at the Art Institute of Chicago with evening, weekend and summer classes because he was unable to enroll as a full-time student until he turned eighteen.<ref>Art Institute of Chicago, Circular of Instruction, 1913\u20131914, 1914\u20131915, 1915\u20131916, and 1917\u20131918 list his name.</ref> Lukits studied with a number of instructors at the institute, but his main teachers and mentors were the [[American Impressionist]] [[Karl Albert Buehr]] (1866\u20131952), the society portrait painter [[Wellington J. Reynolds]] (1866\u20131949) and the figurative painter [[Harry Mills Walcott]] 1877\u20131930).  Lukits worked under [[Edwin Blashfield]] (1848\u20131936) at some point in his Chicago years, presumably as an assistant on a mural project in the Midwest, but it is not known when.<ref>Blashfield delivered the Scammon lectures in Chicago in 1912 and did a number of mural projects in the Midwest.</ref>  He also studied with the realist painters [[Robert Henri]] (1865\u20131929), [[Charles Webster Hawthorne]] (1872\u20131930), and [[George Bellows]] (1882\u20131925), who were guest instructors at the Art Institute during Lukits' tenure.<ref>''Who's Who in American Art'', 1919\u20131957 and other listed reference works</ref>\n\nAnother painter Lukits was influenced by was Housep Pushman (1877\u20131966). He first met the Armenian artist in 1916 in Chicago, where he had an exhibition at the Art Institute of his figurative works and Asian-themed still lifes.\n\nDuring his student days, Lukits shared a studio with the Swedish-born painter [[Christian von Schneidau]] (1893\u20131976).   The two became friends in Chicago and would later renew their friendship in California where they both would paint portraits of movie stars.<ref>Theodorelukits.org website has story and photos</ref>\n\nHe won every major award at the Art Institute, including the Bryan Lathrop Traveling Scholarship. He paid for his studies by painting illustrations for major publications such as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.  After his graduation in 1918, he returned for post-graduate work the following year under Karl Buehr.<ref>AIC Circular of Instruction, 1918\u20131919</ref>  His last period of artistic study was a special scholarship which enabled him to study and travel with the Czech master of [[Art Nouveau]], painter and Illustrator [[Alphonse Mucha]] (1860\u20131939) who was exhibiting his Slav Epic murals in the United States.\n\nLukits also attended Barnes Medical College to study human anatomy.<ref>''Who's Who''; other reference works below list Mucha and Barnes.</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n[[File:Lukits Study of an Old Man.jpg|thumb|''Study of an Old Man'', Theodore Lukits (1915)]]\n\nAfter he arrived in California he rapidly became known for his portraits of early Hollywood figures [[Theda Bara]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Mae Murray]] and [[Alla Nazimova]].<ref>Morseburg, CAC Newsletter, December, 1998, p. 2</ref> The portrait Lukits painted of the Mexican actor [[Dolores del R\u00edo]] was exhibited at the [[premiere]] of one of her films and reproduced in newspapers in Los Angeles and [[Mexico City]].\n\nLukits opened the Lukits Academy in early 1924 and continued teaching until his retirement at age ninety.  He was a well known plein-air painter, choosing the pastel medium for more than one thousand sketches he did on location in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], [[Death Valley]], the [[Mojave Desert]], along the California coast and at the [[Grand Canyon]].<ref>Morseburg, Jonathan Art Foundation Book, 2010</ref> In the early 1930s Lukits also did a series of paintings of [[cowboy|vaqueros]] and female dancers that are now known as the ''Fiesta Suite'', as studies for a mural project for [[Howard Hughes]] that was never completed.<ref>Morseburg, Lukits, CAC Newsletter, December, 1998</ref>  This series of pastel and oil studies depicted many of the horsemen and young Latino actresses who came to Los Angeles to work as riders, stuntmen and extras in Hollywood films.\n\nLukits has been the subject of retrospective exhibitions at the [[Pacific Asia Museum]] in Pasadena, California; the [[Carnegie Art Museum (Oxnard, California)|Carnegie Art Museum]] in Oxnard, California; the Muckenthaller Cultural Center in Fullerton, California; and [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]].\n\nIn addition to art students, Lukits taught Hollywood makeup artists.  The prominent makeup artist Louis Hippe (1909\u20131967) advocated the study of drawing and anatomy under Lukits in order to understand the planes and facial structure of the human head and how it would appear under artificial light, and a number of other makeup artists followed him to Lukit's atelier in the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>News clipping, Theodorelukits.org website</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\nFrom the mid-1920s through the early 1930s, Lukits had a number of solo exhibitions in southern California.  The fall of 1926 may have been his most successful season.  He had an exhibition at the Southby Salon on Larchmont Boulevard that opened on September 23.  The review in the ''Los Angeles Times'' stated, \"About 100 people attended.  The event of the evening was the first showing of the artist's striking portrait of Ethel Wade.\"<ref>''Los Angeles Times'', September 26, 1926</ref>\n\n[[File:Delrio.jpg|thumb|''Souvenir of Seville'', oil on canvas, 80\" \u00d7 40\" (1926), private collection]]\n\nIn November he had a showing in the salon of the Hollywood restaurant the Montmatre Cafe. His work included portraits, landscapes and marines. Along with Count Tolstoy and the actress Dolores Del Rio, he was the guest at a pair of receptions.<ref>Montmatre catalogs in Lukits archive, Theodorelukits.org</ref>\n\nLukits exhibited at a number of the premier Los Angeles galleries during the 1930s.  In February 1931, he had an exhibition at the Desert Gallery in Palm Springs.  In June he had a large exhibition of landscapes, still lifes and portraits at the Stendahl Galleries.<ref>Stendahl brochure listed below, records in Archives of American Art. Stendahl represented Guy Rose and William Wendt as well.</ref>  In 1935 he had a solo exhibition at the Barbara Hotel in Santa Barbara.  In 1937 he was invited to participate in a special exhibition at Harriet Day's Desert Inn Gallery in Palm Springs, ''Twenty Paintings by Twenty Artists'', which included the work of [[Maurice Braun]], Hanson Puthuff and Maynard Dixon.<ref>Day, Harriet, ''Twenty Paintings by Twenty Artists'' brochure listed below</ref> That same year Harry Muir Kurtzworth curated an exhibition at the Los Angeles Public Library titled ''Tonal Impressionism'', with the works of [[Frank Tenney Johnson]], [[Jack Wilkinson Smith]], Alson Clark and Lukits.<ref>Kurtzworth, Harry, Muir, ''Tonal Impressionism'' catalog listed below.</ref>\n\n==Marriages==\nLukits met the aspiring artist and actress Eleanor Merriam (1909\u20131948) in 1931 when she came to study with him.<ref>Morseburg, CAC, December, 1998, p. 4</ref>  She became one of his' favorite models. He painted a well-exhibited pastel portrait of her in 1932, a prize-winning artistic oil portrait titled ''Gesture'' in 1934, and another portrait in 1936. In 1937, the couple eloped to Santa Barbara and were married.<ref>\"Theodore Lukits Reveals Nuptials\", April, 1937, scanned clipping in Lukits archive, unpaginated. LAT does not have many old issues online as does NYT.</ref> In 1940, they purchased a comfortable Spanish-style home on Citrus Avenue, just south of Wilshire Boulevard, adjacent to the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\nWorking together, Eleanor Merriam Lukits' work showed her husband's influence. He often worked on her pastels and paintings, and his bolder, more confident, stroke can be discerned, according to his biographer.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Eleanor Lukits was outgoing, and drew her husband into the social whirl of Los Angeles, where she cultivated patrons and portrait sitters. The couple showed their work together extensively and she participated in many of the exhibitions for women artists of the Southland in the 1930s and 1940s.  In 1948, as she and her husband were transferring gasoline from one container to another in their basement, the vapors were ignited by a pilot light. Both Eleanor and Theodore were burned, but her internal injuries led to her death in the hospital.<ref>\"Eleanor Lukits Dies of Explosion Burns\", ''Los Angeles Times'', September 26, 1948</ref>\n\nSeveral years later, Lukits began dating Lucille Greathouse, a Disney animator and also one of his students. They were married in 1952 after a short courtship.<ref>Morseburg, CAC, December, 1998, p. 8</ref>  Lukits and his second wife lived a quieter social life, but they exhibited and were active with a number of Southern California's art organizations in the 1950s and early 1960s.  From 1952 to 1990, Lucile Lukits helped her husband run his school and business affairs, and her assistance helped put the school on firmer financial footing. After her husband's death, Lucile Lukits took over management of her husband's artwork and estate before passing the responsibility on to his students. In 1997, feeling the effects of Parkinson's disease, she moved to Utah to be closer to her family.  She died in Utah in 2003 at the age of ninety-four.  There were no children from either of Lukits' marriages.\n\n==Late career==\nThe last generation of students that Theodore Lukits taught in the 1970s and 1980s included a number of notable figures. The plein air pastelist [[Arny Karl]] (1940\u20132000) studied with Lukits from 1968 to 1978.<ref>Karl's Ask Art Biography</ref> The plein air and figurative artist [[Peter Seitz Adams]] (b. 1950) <ref>CAC Web Site</ref> apprenticed with Lukits for seven years from 1970 to 1977;<ref>See Adams' \"Recollections\" in ''The Pastels of Theodore Lukits'', Carnegie Art Museum, p. 4-5 (1991)</ref> and the western and plein air landscape artist [[Tim Solliday]] (b. 1952) apprenticed with Lukits for five years.<ref>See Solliday's \"Recollections'\" in ''The Pastels of Theodore Lukits'', Carnegie Museum, p. 3 (1991)</ref>  Karl, Adams, and Solliday went on to work extensively in the pastel medium.\n\nIn 1990, Lucile and Theodore Lukits, who was then in declining health, donated a large collection of his work to the Jonathan Art Foundation in Los Angeles.  This collection, which includes a large selection of his pastels as well as a number of portraits, has been loaned out to museums for exhibitions that have been mounted after his death.<ref>See Lucile Lukits (1909\u20132003), Lukits Academy tuition records, 1952\u20131990, Lukits archive for records of students, unnumbered. Also web references to many of these artists as students of Lukits.</ref>\n\n==Posthumous exhibitions==\n\nSince his death in 1992, Theodore Lukits' work has been the subject of solo exhibitions in California museums.  His work has also been part of many other museum exhibitions devoted to [[California Plein-Air Painting]] and figurative art.  In 1998, a traveling show was organized under the auspices of the [[California Art Club]], titled ''Theodore N. Lukits: An American Orientalist.'' The exhibition focused on Lukits' Asian-inspired work, and included stylized portraits, plein-air landscape pastels with Japanese art influences, and a few still lifes of Asian antiques.<ref>Morseburg, Jeffrey, ''Theodore Lukits, An American Orientalist'', Exhibition Catalog, p. 1-16</ref> This exhibition opened at the [[Pacific Asia Museum]] in Pasadena, California, then traveled to the [[Carnegie Art Museum]] in Oxnard and culminated at the [[Muckenthaler Cultural Center]] in Fullerton, where it was combined with some of Lukits' Hispanic-themed works for a new exhibition title, ''Theodore N. Lukits: From Mandarins to Mariachis''.<ref>Invitation on Lukits.org website</ref> These exhibitions included many of his high-key, brightly-colored works.\n\nLukits made many studies and portraits of Mexican and Mexican-American sitters, some of which were preparatory works for mural projects.  These works were the subject of two different exhibitions at Mission San Juan Capistrano, in 1998 and 1999.  The second exhibition, titled ''Theodore N. Lukits: The Spirit of Old California'', was centered on what has been called his ''Fiesta Suite'', a collection of paintings that was used for studies for a mural of an old California fiesta scene created for [[Howard Hughes]]. It included more than a dozen figurative works, a collection of pastels, and some works that were created ''en plein air'' on the grounds of the missions in the 1920s.<ref>San Juan Capistrano catalogs listed below, also TFAOL website</ref>\n\nOne of his students, Kalan Brunink, followed his lead and became principal artist of the famed Old Town Olvera Street, Los Angeles and has a notable collection of Spanish-Mexican-American paintings and Mission San Juan Capistrano works.\n\nThe Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art has a notable collection of plein-air pastels by Theodore Lukits.  These have been central to two exhibitions at SAMA, one in 1999,<ref>Tomor, ''Contemporary Romanticism: Landscapes in Pastel''</ref> devoted to landscape pastels, and the other in 2008, which featured watercolors and pastels.<ref>\"From Charles Burchfield\" PDF</ref>\n\nMission San Juan Capistrano was the site of another Lukits exhibition in 2001 titled ''Romance of the Mission'', which was held in the courtyard of the mission in conjunction with the annual benefit dinner.<ref>''Romance of the Mission'' program, Mission San Juan Capistrano, p. 1-3</ref>\n\n==Partial exhibition record==\n* 1926 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Theodore Lukits, The Southby Art Salon, Hollywood, California, opened September 23, 1926\n* 1926 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Exhibition of Portraits and Paintings by Theodore Lukits, Cafe Montmatre Salon, Hollywood, California November 4, 1926 (23 works including portraits and landscapes)\n* 1926 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Annual Winter Exhibition, Portraits and Paintings by Theodore Lukits, Cafe Montmatre Salon, Hollywood, California November 25, 1926 (39 works including portraits and landscapes)\n* 1928 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Edgewater Beach Club, Santa Monica, California, September, 1928 (22 works including portraits, landscapes and a maritime work)\n* 1930 \u2013 Group Exhibition, Ebell Salon, Los Angeles, California, March, 1930\n* 1930 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Ainslie Galleries, Los Angeles, California, November 1\u201330, 1930 16 (16 works including figurative works and landscapes)\n* 1931 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Desert Paintings by Theodore Lukits, Desert Art Gallery, Palm Springs, California, February 1\u201328, 1931\n* 1931 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Stendahl Galleries, Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, June 1\u201313, 1931, (27 works including decorative portraits and landscapes)\n* 1935 - Solo Exhibition, Barbara Hotel, Santa Barbara, California, Circa 1935 (exhibition featuring ''Sierra Moonlight'' and ''Laughing Mood'', hosted by John Yuke)\n* 1935 \u2013 Group Exhibition, Biltmore Salon, Hotel Biltmore, Los Angeles, California\n* 1937 \u2013 Group Exhibition, International Aeronautical Art Exhibition, Los Angeles Museum, Los Angeles, California, February 5\u201319, 1937 (won E.K.

His initial fame came from his portraits of glamorous actresses of the silent film era, but since his death, his Asian-inspired works, figures drawn from Hispanic California and pastel landscapes have received greater attention.\n\nLukits began his professional career as an illustrator while still in his teens. He was a still life painter, muralist and founder of the Lukits Academy of Fine Arts in Los Angeles for more than sixty years.  He had the reputation of a craftsman who made his own paints from raw pigments, constructed brushes and palettes, and designed and carved frames.  Lukits was responsible for keeping the \"Beaux-Arts\" methods of the French academic system alive in the western United States, and several of his students went on to prominent careers.<ref>Morseburg, Theodore Lukits, CAC Newsletter articles</ref>  His works are displayed in many public collections. He was a member of a number of professional art organizations and won many awards in competitions.  Lukits has been the subject of a number of solo museum exhibitions since his death, and his work has been included in a number of other museum exhibitions devoted to [[Tonalism]] and California and American [[Impressionism]].\n\n==Early history==\n\nLukits was born Nicolae Teodorescu in [[Timi\u015foara]], [[Transylvania]], which was then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. His father, Theodore Lukits, Sr., was a butcher, and his mother was a homemaker.  He came to the United States at age two when his family immigrated in 1899, and he grew up in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref>Ancestry.com, U.S. Department of Immigration and Naturalization, Department of State Records. U.S. census records reveals Lukits Sr. was a butcher and sausage maker.</ref>  Lukits began formal studies at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] School of Fine Arts before he was twelve.<ref>Enrollment receipt in archival section of theodorelukits.org website dates to 1911.</ref> His first teacher was [[Edmund H. Wuerpel]] (1866\u20131958). He also studied with [[Richard E. Miller]] (1875\u20131943) in St. Louis, who had returned home from the art colony of Givery and was staying with his parents.<ref>''Who's Who in American Art'', 1940\u20131941, Lukits entry, page 407.</ref><ref>Miller's presence back in the U.S. is not well known but established by the 1910 U.S. census, which shows him in St. Louis, ancestry.com records</ref>  Lukits left public school after the 8th grade in order to pursue a career in art, with the full cooperation of his parents.  He worked from an early age, first as an office boy and then as an airbrush artist, painting delicate girls' heads on leather.<ref>Theodorelukits.org website archive, tuition receipts, letters of recommendation</ref>\n\n==Education in Chicago==\n\nLukits moved to [[Chicago]] when he was fifteen to attend the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].  At the Chicago Academy he studied with the painter, illustrator and traveler [[Carl Werntz]] (1874\u20131944) who founded the school in 1902.  He also studied with [[William Victor Higgins]], who later became famous as one of the [[Taos Ten]] of the [[Taos art colony]].<ref>''Who's Who in American Art'', 1919\u20131957, issues have list of instructors.</ref>\n\nLukits began at the Art Institute of Chicago with evening, weekend and summer classes because he was unable to enroll as a full-time student until he turned eighteen.<ref>Art Institute of Chicago, Circular of Instruction, 1913\u20131914, 1914\u20131915, 1915\u20131916, and 1917\u20131918 list his name.</ref> Lukits studied with a number of instructors at the institute, but his main teachers and mentors were the [[American Impressionist]] [[Karl Albert Buehr]] (1866\u20131952), the society portrait painter [[Wellington J. Reynolds]] (1866\u20131949) and the figurative painter [[Harry Mills Walcott]] 1877\u20131930).  Lukits worked under [[Edwin Blashfield]] (1848\u20131936) at some point in his Chicago years, presumably as an assistant on a mural project in the Midwest, but it is not known when.<ref>Blashfield delivered the Scammon lectures in Chicago in 1912 and did a number of mural projects in the Midwest.</ref>  He also studied with the realist painters [[Robert Henri]] (1865\u20131929), [[Charles Webster Hawthorne]] (1872\u20131930), and [[George Bellows]] (1882\u20131925), who were guest instructors at the Art Institute during Lukits' tenure.<ref>''Who's Who in American Art'', 1919\u20131957 and other listed reference works</ref>\n\nAnother painter Lukits was influenced by was Housep Pushman (1877\u20131966). He first met the Armenian artist in 1916 in Chicago, where he had an exhibition at the Art Institute of his figurative works and Asian-themed still lifes.\n\nDuring his student days, Lukits shared a studio with the Swedish-born painter [[Christian von Schneidau]] (1893\u20131976).   The two became friends in Chicago and would later renew their friendship in California where they both would paint portraits of movie stars.<ref>Theodorelukits.org website has story and photos</ref>\n\nHe won every major award at the Art Institute, including the Bryan Lathrop Traveling Scholarship. He paid for his studies by painting illustrations for major publications such as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.  After his graduation in 1918, he returned for post-graduate work the following year under Karl Buehr.<ref>AIC Circular of Instruction, 1918\u20131919</ref>  His last period of artistic study was a special scholarship which enabled him to study and travel with the Czech master of [[Art Nouveau]], painter and Illustrator [[Alphonse Mucha]] (1860\u20131939) who was exhibiting his Slav Epic murals in the United States.\n\nLukits also attended Barnes Medical College to study human anatomy.<ref>''Who's Who''; other reference works below list Mucha and Barnes.</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n[[File:Lukits Study of an Old Man.jpg|thumb|''Study of an Old Man'', Theodore Lukits (1915)]]\n\nAfter he arrived in California he rapidly became known for his portraits of early Hollywood figures [[Theda Bara]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Mae Murray]] and [[Alla Nazimova]].<ref>Morseburg, CAC Newsletter, December, 1998, p. 2</ref> The portrait Lukits painted of the Mexican actor [[Dolores del R\u00edo]] was exhibited at the [[premiere]] of one of her films and reproduced in newspapers in Los Angeles and [[Mexico City]].\n\nLukits opened the Lukits Academy in early 1924 and continued teaching until his retirement at age ninety.  He was a well known plein-air painter, choosing the pastel medium for more than one thousand sketches he did on location in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], [[Death Valley]], the [[Mojave Desert]], along the California coast and at the [[Grand Canyon]].<ref>Morseburg, Jonathan Art Foundation Book, 2010</ref> In the early 1930s Lukits also did a series of paintings of [[cowboy|vaqueros]] and female dancers that are now known as the ''Fiesta Suite'', as studies for a mural project for [[Howard Hughes]] that was never completed.<ref>Morseburg, Lukits, CAC Newsletter, December, 1998</ref>  This series of pastel and oil studies depicted many of the horsemen and young Latino actresses who came to Los Angeles to work as riders, stuntmen and extras in Hollywood films.\n\nLukits has been the subject of retrospective exhibitions at the [[Pacific Asia Museum]] in Pasadena, California; the [[Carnegie Art Museum (Oxnard, California)|Carnegie Art Museum]] in Oxnard, California; the Muckenthaller Cultural Center in Fullerton, California; and [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]].\n\nIn addition to art students, Lukits taught Hollywood makeup artists.  The prominent makeup artist Louis Hippe (1909\u20131967) advocated the study of drawing and anatomy under Lukits in order to understand the planes and facial structure of the human head and how it would appear under artificial light, and a number of other makeup artists followed him to Lukit's atelier in the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>News clipping, Theodorelukits.org website</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\nFrom the mid-1920s through the early 1930s, Lukits had a number of solo exhibitions in southern California.  The fall of 1926 may have been his most successful season.  He had an exhibition at the Southby Salon on Larchmont Boulevard that opened on September 23.  The review in the ''Los Angeles Times'' stated, \"About 100 people attended.  The event of the evening was the first showing of the artist's striking portrait of Ethel Wade.\"<ref>''Los Angeles Times'', September 26, 1926</ref>\n\n[[File:Delrio.jpg|thumb|''Souvenir of Seville'', oil on canvas, 80\" \u00d7 40\" (1926), private collection]]\n\nIn November he had a showing in the salon of the Hollywood restaurant the Montmatre Cafe. His work included portraits, landscapes and marines. Along with Count Tolstoy and the actress Dolores Del Rio, he was the guest at a pair of receptions.<ref>Montmatre catalogs in Lukits archive, Theodorelukits.org</ref>\n\nLukits exhibited at a number of the premier Los Angeles galleries during the 1930s.  In February 1931, he had an exhibition at the Desert Gallery in Palm Springs.  In June he had a large exhibition of landscapes, still lifes and portraits at the Stendahl Galleries.<ref>Stendahl brochure listed below, records in Archives of American Art. Stendahl represented Guy Rose and William Wendt as well.</ref>  In 1935 he had a solo exhibition at the Barbara Hotel in Santa Barbara.  In 1937 he was invited to participate in a special exhibition at Harriet Day's Desert Inn Gallery in Palm Springs, ''Twenty Paintings by Twenty Artists'', which included the work of [[Maurice Braun]], Hanson Puthuff and Maynard Dixon.<ref>Day, Harriet, ''Twenty Paintings by Twenty Artists'' brochure listed below</ref> That same year Harry Muir Kurtzworth curated an exhibition at the Los Angeles Public Library titled ''Tonal Impressionism'', with the works of [[Frank Tenney Johnson]], [[Jack Wilkinson Smith]], Alson Clark and Lukits.<ref>Kurtzworth, Harry, Muir, ''Tonal Impressionism'' catalog listed below.</ref>\n\n==Marriages==\nLukits met the aspiring artist and actress Eleanor Merriam (1909\u20131948) in 1931 when she came to study with him.<ref>Morseburg, CAC, December, 1998, p. 4</ref>  She became one of his' favorite models. He painted a well-exhibited pastel portrait of her in 1932, a prize-winning artistic oil portrait titled ''Gesture'' in 1934, and another portrait in 1936. In 1937, the couple eloped to Santa Barbara and were married.<ref>\"Theodore Lukits Reveals Nuptials\", April, 1937, scanned clipping in Lukits archive, unpaginated. LAT does not have many old issues online as does NYT.</ref> In 1940, they purchased a comfortable Spanish-style home on Citrus Avenue, just south of Wilshire Boulevard, adjacent to the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\nWorking together, Eleanor Merriam Lukits' work showed her husband's influence. He often worked on her pastels and paintings, and his bolder, more confident, stroke can be discerned, according to his biographer.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Eleanor Lukits was outgoing, and drew her husband into the social whirl of Los Angeles, where she cultivated patrons and portrait sitters. The couple showed their work together extensively and she participated in many of the exhibitions for women artists of the Southland in the 1930s and 1940s.  In 1948, as she and her husband were transferring gasoline from one container to another in their basement, the vapors were ignited by a pilot light. Both Eleanor and Theodore were burned, but her internal injuries led to her death in the hospital.<ref>\"Eleanor Lukits Dies of Explosion Burns\", ''Los Angeles Times'', September 26, 1948</ref>\n\nSeveral years later, Lukits began dating Lucille Greathouse, a Disney animator and also one of his students. They were married in 1952 after a short courtship.<ref>Morseburg, CAC, December, 1998, p. 8</ref>  Lukits and his second wife lived a quieter social life, but they exhibited and were active with a number of Southern California's art organizations in the 1950s and early 1960s.  From 1952 to 1990, Lucile Lukits helped her husband run his school and business affairs, and her assistance helped put the school on firmer financial footing. After her husband's death, Lucile Lukits took over management of her husband's artwork and estate before passing the responsibility on to his students. In 1997, feeling the effects of Parkinson's disease, she moved to Utah to be closer to her family.  She died in Utah in 2003 at the age of ninety-four.  There were no children from either of Lukits' marriages.\n\n==Late career==\nThe last generation of students that Theodore Lukits taught in the 1970s and 1980s included a number of notable figures. The plein air pastelist [[Arny Karl]] (1940\u20132000) studied with Lukits from 1968 to 1978.<ref>Karl's Ask Art Biography</ref> The plein air and figurative artist [[Peter Seitz Adams]] (b. 1950) <ref>CAC Web Site</ref> apprenticed with Lukits for seven years from 1970 to 1977;<ref>See Adams' \"Recollections\" in ''The Pastels of Theodore Lukits'', Carnegie Art Museum, p. 4-5 (1991)</ref> and the western and plein air landscape artist [[Tim Solliday]] (b. 1952) apprenticed with Lukits for five years.<ref>See Solliday's \"Recollections'\" in ''The Pastels of Theodore Lukits'', Carnegie Museum, p. 3 (1991)</ref>  Karl, Adams, and Solliday went on to work extensively in the pastel medium.\n\nIn 1990, Lucile and Theodore Lukits, who was then in declining health, donated a large collection of his work to the Jonathan Art Foundation in Los Angeles.  This collection, which includes a large selection of his pastels as well as a number of portraits, has been loaned out to museums for exhibitions that have been mounted after his death.<ref>See Lucile Lukits (1909\u20132003), Lukits Academy tuition records, 1952\u20131990, Lukits archive for records of students, unnumbered.

His work has also been part of many other museum exhibitions devoted to [[California Plein-Air Painting]] and figurative art.  In 1998, a traveling show was organized under the auspices of the [[California Art Club]], titled ''Theodore N. Lukits: An American Orientalist.'' The exhibition focused on Lukits' Asian-inspired work, and included stylized portraits, plein-air landscape pastels with Japanese art influences, and a few still lifes of Asian antiques.<ref>Morseburg, Jeffrey, ''Theodore Lukits, An American Orientalist'', Exhibition Catalog, p. 1-16</ref> This exhibition opened at the [[Pacific Asia Museum]] in Pasadena, California, then traveled to the [[Carnegie Art Museum]] in Oxnard and culminated at the [[Muckenthaler Cultural Center]] in Fullerton, where it was combined with some of Lukits' Hispanic-themed works for a new exhibition title, ''Theodore N. Lukits: From Mandarins to Mariachis''.<ref>Invitation on Lukits.org website</ref> These exhibitions included many of his high-key, brightly-colored works.\n\nLukits made many studies and portraits of Mexican and Mexican-American sitters, some of which were preparatory works for mural projects.  These works were the subject of two different exhibitions at Mission San Juan Capistrano, in 1998 and 1999.  The second exhibition, titled ''Theodore N. Lukits: The Spirit of Old California'', was centered on what has been called his ''Fiesta Suite'', a collection of paintings that was used for studies for a mural of an old California fiesta scene created for [[Howard Hughes]]. It included more than a dozen figurative works, a collection of pastels, and some works that were created ''en plein air'' on the grounds of the missions in the 1920s.<ref>San Juan Capistrano catalogs listed below, also TFAOL website</ref>\n\nOne of his students, Kalan Brunink, followed his lead and became principal artist of the famed Old Town Olvera Street, Los Angeles and has a notable collection of Spanish-Mexican-American paintings and Mission San Juan Capistrano works.\n\nThe Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art has a notable collection of plein-air pastels by Theodore Lukits.  These have been central to two exhibitions at SAMA, one in 1999,<ref>Tomor, ''Contemporary Romanticism: Landscapes in Pastel''</ref> devoted to landscape pastels, and the other in 2008, which featured watercolors and pastels.<ref>\"From Charles Burchfield\" PDF</ref>\n\nMission San Juan Capistrano was the site of another Lukits exhibition in 2001 titled ''Romance of the Mission'', which was held in the courtyard of the mission in conjunction with the annual benefit dinner.<ref>''Romance of the Mission'' program, Mission San Juan Capistrano, p. 1-3</ref>\n\n==Partial exhibition record==\n* 1926 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Theodore Lukits, The Southby Art Salon, Hollywood, California, opened September 23, 1926\n* 1926 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Exhibition of Portraits and Paintings by Theodore Lukits, Cafe Montmatre Salon, Hollywood, California November 4, 1926 (23 works including portraits and landscapes)\n* 1926 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Annual Winter Exhibition, Portraits and Paintings by Theodore Lukits, Cafe Montmatre Salon, Hollywood, California November 25, 1926 (39 works including portraits and landscapes)\n* 1928 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Edgewater Beach Club, Santa Monica, California, September, 1928 (22 works including portraits, landscapes and a maritime work)\n* 1930 \u2013 Group Exhibition, Ebell Salon, Los Angeles, California, March, 1930\n* 1930 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Ainslie Galleries, Los Angeles, California, November 1\u201330, 1930 16 (16 works including figurative works and landscapes)\n* 1931 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Desert Paintings by Theodore Lukits, Desert Art Gallery, Palm Springs, California, February 1\u201328, 1931\n* 1931 \u2013 Solo Exhibition, Stendahl Galleries, Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, June 1\u201313, 1931, (27 works including decorative portraits and landscapes)\n* 1935 - Solo Exhibition, Barbara Hotel, Santa Barbara, California, Circa 1935 (exhibition featuring ''Sierra Moonlight'' and ''Laughing Mood'', hosted by John Yuke)\n* 1935 \u2013 Group Exhibition, Biltmore Salon, Hotel Biltmore, Los Angeles, California\n* 1937 \u2013 Group Exhibition, International Aeronautical Art Exhibition, Los Angeles Museum, Los Angeles, California, February 5\u201319, 1937 (won E.K.
