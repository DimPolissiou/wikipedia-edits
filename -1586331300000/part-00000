Sawyer Air Force Base begin in the mid-1930s when Kenneth Ingalls Sawyer (1884\u20131944), a [[civil engineer]] and Marquette County road commissioner, desired to build an airport which would aid the development of the Marquette area.<ref name=mqmtrem>{{cite journal |url=http://www.comehometosawyerairport.com/PDFs/SawyerBackThen.pdf |magazine=Marquette Monthly |title=Remembering Kenneth Ingalls Sawyer |last=Henry |first=Ragene |date=August 1995 |pages=6, 7 |journal= |access-date=23 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195707/http://www.comehometosawyerairport.com/PDFs/SawyerBackThen.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The one factor which most likely influenced the establishment and final location of the airport was the growing mining industry in the local area. As the demand for iron ore increased, the need for travel increased. By 1937, the demand reached a point of air service necessity. To support this demand, a [[Marquette County Airport|county airport]] was built southwest of Marquette, northeast of [[Negaunee, Michigan|Negaunee]].\n\nThe population of the area continued to grow, and, by 1940, Sawyer realized the new Negaunee airport could not handle its ever-increasing demands. Therefore, in 1941, the then-superintendent of the county highway department stepped out of his role and presented a plan for a new airport. The most significant landmarks on his proposed site were a hill of sand and a wealth of [[blueberry]] patches. The board agreed with the idea. Shortly thereafter, the United States was drawn into [[World War II]]. Local concern for the protection of the [[Great Lakes]] inter-lake navigation [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] named [[Soo Locks]] at the trans-border area of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] prompted area citizens to propose that the U.S. [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] take over the new airfield. At that time, the proposal was shelved.\n\n===K. I. Sawyer Airport===\nSawyer died in 1944, and the following year the airfield, consisting of a single airstrip, was completed and named '''K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer Airport''' in his honor. It was used by private fliers until 1948 when Nationwide Airlines became the first commercial airline to operate flights out of the airport. Nationwide flew shuttles to [[Detroit]] from Marquette, with stops in [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]], [[Iron Mountain, Michigan|Iron Mountain]], and [[Menominee, Michigan|Menominee]].\n\nIn February 1954, the U.S. Air Force announced plans to enlarge its forces, and new bases were needed. The government entered into negotiations with the county for Sawyer's lease, and offered to build a $12 million jet base which could be jointly used by the Air Force and Marquette-area citizens. The major stipulation made by the government was no more than 300 landings per month could be made by civilian aircraft. In January 1955, a public meeting was held in the county courthouse to discuss the proposed lease. Many at this meeting voted to adopt a resolution urging the Marquette City Commission to accept the government's offer.\n\n===K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base===\nOn 24 Jan 1955, the U.S. government signed a [[99-year lease]]. Almost immediately, construction of military support facilities began. About 850 people were employed during the construction of the base and another 262 were actively employed during the winter months. A letter from [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Harold E. Talbott]] to [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Homer S. Ferguson]] was printed in ''[[The Mining Journal]]'' and reported more than 900&nbsp;military personnel were to be stationed at K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer Air Force Base with an annual income in excess of $3 million. K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer Airport officially opened as a joint civil-military facility on 8 April 1956, and it was not long before the Air Force proposed a $447,000 appropriation for construction of a civil airport in [[Negaunee Township, Michigan|Negaunee Township]], which would allow the Air Force sole use of the base.\n\nAir Force facilities constructed included a {{convert|12366|ft|m|adj=mid|-long|-1}}<ref>FAA records http://www.airnav.com/airport/KSAW</ref> and {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide|-1}} runway. Additionally, the region's wide open airspace offers ease of operations for an extremely safe and delay free air traffic setting. The official opening of K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer AFB occurred on 8 May 1959, at which time the airfield became a strictly military operation.\n\n====Air Defense Command====\n[[File:Air Defense Command.png|left|100px]]\n[[File:62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron - Emblem.png|left|100px]]\n[[File:87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron - Patch.png|left|100px]]\n[[File:62d FIS F-101 KI Sawyer 1960s.jpg|thumb|[[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo|F-101]] of the 62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on Alert during the 1960s]]\n[[File:87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron-TAC-F-106-59-0094.jpg|thumb|[[Convair F-106 Delta Dart|F-106A]] (59-0094) of the 87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in flight in the early 1980s. Note the [[Tactical Air Command]] emblem on the tail, replacing the squadron emblem.]]\nUpon activation, K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer was placed under the Jurisdiction of [[Aerospace Defense Command|Air Defense Command]] (ADC) on 8 April 1956. The [[473d Fighter Group]] was activated as the host unit, under the ADC [[4706th Air Defense Wing]] at [[O'Hare International Airport]], Illinois.\n\nThe initial mission of the base was to act as a fighter-[[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] defense against an enemy [[Strategic bomber|bomber]] attack, the [[484th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] was activated on 8 June 1956, and authorized [[Northrop F-89 Scorpion|F-89D Scorpion]] interceptors, however the 484th FIS was never equipped or manned as much construction was necessary to bring the airport up to Air Force standards for a military airfield. In 1957, civilian commercial operations from the base moved to a new Marquette County Airport erected at the site of the old Negaunee Airport. The first aircraft assigned to K. I. Sawyer were [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102 Delta Dagger]]s from the [[438th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] at [[Kincheloe Air Force Base|Kincheloe AFB]], which were temporarily stationed at K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer during the summer of 1958.\n\nOn 8 November 1958 the [[Sault Sainte Marie Air Defense Sector]] (SsmADS) was established at K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer AFB. The ADC command and control organization's mission was to operate the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) Data Center (DC-14), which opened in 1959. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. SsmADS also supported the [[Antigo Air Force Station|Antigo AFS]] (P-19) and [[Calumet Air Force Station|Calumet AFS]] (P-16) ADC Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning stations\n\nFurther expansion of the base occurred in 1959 when the runway was extended to its present 12,366 feet. Prior to the expansion, ADC replaced the 473d Fighter Group with the [[56th Fighter Wing]], along with its [[62d Fighter Squadron|62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]], to Sawyer as the host unit. The 56th FW received its first aircraft, a [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], in 1959, after the expanded runway was completed. The F-101s provided the SAGE unit with the required intercept and destroy capabilities that gave the base teeth.\n\nIn 1961 the 56th Fighter Wing was discontinued and the host unit at Sawyer became the Sault Sainte Marie ADS. In a reorganization in 1964, SAC assumed jurisdiction of the base and ADC phased down its presence to a tenant organization. The 62d FIS came under the command and control of the [[Duluth Air Defense Sector]] and the SsmADS was inactivated. Responsibilities for the SAGE system were switched to the Duluth ADS, (DC-10) or the [[Detroit Air Defense Sector]] (DC-06).\n\nIn 1969, Air Defense Command was redesignated as Aerospace Defense Command. In 1971, the 62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and its [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo|F-101B Voodoo]] was replaced with a new squadron and aircraft. The new squadron was the [[87th Flying Training Squadron|87th Fighter Interceptor Squadron]] (87 FIS), the \"Red Bulls,\" which flew the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart|F-106A Delta Dart]]. The 87th maintained four T-33 aircraft to provide target support for the squadron interceptors, simulating Soviet bomber tactics. In addition, they flew NORAD radar evaluation and logistic support sorties.\n\nADC was disestablished in 1979 and all ADC aircraft assets were transferred to [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) under a sub-organization known as Air Defense \u2013 Tactical Air Command (ADTAC). The 87 FIS and their F-106 aircraft remained based and maintaining a 24/7/365 alert status at Sawyer AFB. The 87th was scheduled to convert to the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagle]] in 1984. However, due to budget cuts the conversion was cancelled and the squadron was scheduled for inactivation on 1 October 1985 as the continental air defense mission in the United States was increasingly transferred to the [[Air National Guard]]. When inactivated, the 87th FIS was the second-to-last F-106 squadron on active duty.\n\nOn 4 September 1985, the last three F-106 Delta Darts from the 87th FIS departed K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer for [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group|AMARC]] at [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base|Davis-Monthan AFB]] at [[Tucson, Arizona]]. Most of its aircraft were later converted to QF-106 target drones and expended as aerial targets over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as part of the \"Pacer Six Program\" during the late 1990s at [[Tyndall Air Force Base|Tyndall AFB]] in western [[Florida]] by the [[82d Aerial Targets Squadron]].\n\n====Strategic Air Command====\n[[File:Shield Strategic Air Command.png|left|100px]]\n[[File:410th Air Expeditionary Wing.PNG|left|100px]]\nThe [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) became a tenant organization at K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer AFB on 1 August 1958 with the organization of the [[410th Air Expeditionary Wing#Strategic Air Command|4042d Strategic Wing]]. The 4042d SW was a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H Stratofortress]] dispersal wing, a part of SAC's plan to disperse its big bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike.\n\nBefore receiving the [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135A]] [[Aerial refueling|tanker]] and heavy B-52H bomber aircraft of SAC, an all-weather, heavy-duty concrete runway was built, measuring {{convert|24|in|cm}} thick and {{convert|150|ft}} wide. It was extended in 1959 from {{convert|6000|to|12366|ft|-1}},<ref>World Wide Metric http://www.worldwidemetric.com/measurements.html</ref> overruns of {{convert|1000|ft|-1}}.  There are also {{convert|75|ft|adj=on}} shoulders on each side of the runway, providing a paved width of {{convert|300|ft|-1}}.\n\nThe two operational units to be assigned later to this wing were the 923d Air Refueling Squadron on 1 May 1960, and the [[526th Bombardment Squadron]] on 1 June 1961. The refueling squadron's first KC-135A aircraft arrived 4 August 1960, and the unit was declared fully combat ready in November of that year.\n[[File:Boeing B-52H-140-BW (SN 60-0017) 061026-F-1234S-023.jpg|thumb|A Boeing [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]] (SN 60-0017), the type assigned to the 410th Bomb Wing at K.

Sawyer AFB]]\n[[File:Boeing KC-135 J57 wet takeoff.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135A]] taking off with [[Water injection (engine)#Use in aircraft|water injection]] to its [[Pratt & Whitney J57|J-57 engines]]]]\nIn April 1961, the 923d was inactivated and the [[46th Air Refueling Squadron]] organized and activated as a replacement unit. The first B-52H aircraft assigned to the 526th arrived at Sawyer in August 1961. On 1 February 1963, the 4042d Strategic Wing was discontinued and the [[410th Air Expeditionary Wing|410th Bombardment Wing]] (Heavy) organized and activated with no change in mission, personnel or aircraft. Also on that date, the [[644th Bomb Squadron|644th Bombardment Squadron]] was activated replacing the 526th, and the 46th Air Refueling Squadron was reassigned to the 410th. The majority of the wing's present support squadrons were also activated on this date as well.\n\nOn 1 January 1964, SAC assumed jurisdiction of Sawyer AFB, with the 410th Bomb Wing becoming the host unit under the [[4th Air Division|4th Strategic Aerospace Division]]. K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer was one of three SAC bases in Michigan that operated the B-52: the others were [[Kincheloe Air Force Base|Kincheloe AFB]] to the east, near [[Kinross Charter Township, Michigan|Kinross]], south of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]], and [[Wurtsmith Air Force Base|Wurtsmith AFB]], in the northeast of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, near [[Oscoda, Michigan|Oscoda]].\n\nThe 410th and its subordinate units' mission was to operate at full readiness, and support activities included aircraft and vehicle maintenance, bombing crew and unit training, and air refueling support. The wing did not deploy bomber aircraft to Southeast Asia during the [[Vietnam War]], as the B-52H was dedicated to strategic deterrence. However, the tanker aircraft and aircrews participated in the \"Young Tiger\" [[Temporary duty assignment|TDY]] effort, and the bomber aircrews went through RTU (Replacement Training Unit) training to fly B-52Ds out of [[Andersen Air Force Base|Andersen AFB]], Guam and [[U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield|U-Tapao RTAFB]], Thailand and were active participants in many of the notable campaigns that took place in Southeast Asia, such as [[Operation Arc Light]].\n\nOne Sawyer KC-135A (61-0313) became famous throughout the SAC community as \"the glider\" when it ran out of fuel on a short final approach prior to landing at its home base after flying practice approaches at nearby Kincheloe AFB to complete requalification training. The flight crew, with the exception of the instructor pilot, bailed out when the engines went quiet. The instructor pilot, who remained on board, landed the aircraft just short of the runway overrun, bounced and rolled to a stop on the runway. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service quickly and even the crew entry door (which separated from the aircraft during bailout procedures) was returned to the Air Force by a local farmer.<ref>46th Air Refueling Squadron Association [https://web.archive.org/web/20170203172329/http://46thars.tripod.com/id26.html http://46thars.tripod.com/id26.html]  \"Night of the Gliding Pig\" entry by crew Navigator Joe \"Hump\" Heywood</ref>\n\nOther aircraft assigned to K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer over the years included [[Kaman HH-43 Huskie|HH-43B]] and [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|HH-1H]] rescue helicopters of the 48th and 39th Air Rescue and Recovery Wings at [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin AFB]], Florida at the K. I. Sawyer Helicopter (later re-designated Training) Annex, 14 March 1975 to 1 October 1977. SAC [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|FB-111]] bombers assigned to the [[509th Bomb Wing|509th Bombardment Wing (Medium)]] from [[Pease Air National Guard Base|Pease AFB]] in [[New Hampshire]], on satellite alert at Sawyer in 1974 and 1975.\n\nIn the early 1980s, K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer's B-52s were modified to carry the new Boeing [[AGM-86 ALCM|AGM-86 Air-Launched Cruise Missile]] (ALCM). The ALCM was powered by a 600&nbsp;lb.s.t. [[Williams F107|Williams F107-WR-100 turbofan]], which is fed by an inlet which folds out on the top of the missile. The B-52 could carry six AGM-86Bs on each of the two underwing pylons.  In 1980, two B-52H crews assigned to the 644th Bomb Squadron (S-21 and S-31) were awarded the [[Mackay Trophy]] for \"executing a nonstop, around-the-world mission with the immediate objective of locating and photographing elements of the [[Soviet Navy]] operating in the [[Persian Gulf]].\" The Wing Commander at this time was Col G. Alan [[Dugard]], a great leader and author of the 2011 book about the [[Operation Linebacker II]] missions of 1972, titled \"When the Wolf Rises.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://naa.aero/html/awards/index.cfm?cmsid%3D187 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222043251/http://www.naa.aero/html/awards/index.cfm?cmsid=187 |archivedate=22 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Closure===\nIn [[1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission|1993]], the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Commission of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] ([[1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission|BRAC 1993]])<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = BRAC 1993 defenselink.mil Sec. 1 Pg 72\n  | title = Brac 1993\n  | year = 1993\n  | url = http://www.defenselink.mil/brac/docs/1993com2.pdf\n  | accessdate = 30 March 2009 }}\n</ref> recommended the base for closure.\n\nThe KC-135 tankers departed in October 1993 and the B-52H's were split between the two remaining B-52 bases at [[Barksdale Air Force Base|Barksdale]] and [[Minot Air Force Base|Minot]]; Sawyer's final B-52 left for Minot in November 1994.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://members.fortunecity.com/kisawyer/ |title=Mike's K.I.

Sawyer was a favorite base among the SAC community. Although isolated and definitely northern, it was an attractive base for its pleasing [[Laurentian Mixed Forest Province|North Woods]] location and its proximity to outdoor activities off the base, including hunting, fishing, boating, and winter sports including [[Alpine skiing|skiing]] at [[Marquette Mountain]] (known as \"Cliffs Ridge\" before 1982), as well as the venues on site (base lake, ski hill, and others).\n\nWhile the base was sometimes referred to as \"K.&nbsp;I. [[Siberia]]\" or \"The Rock\" and there was an abundance of [[lake-effect snow]],<ref name=sremflkp>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YhJQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zlUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5429%2C5617317 |newspaper=Ludington (MI) Daily News |agency=Associated Press |last=St. John |first=Paige |title=Snow removal fleet keeps Sawyer open|date=17 March 1989 |page=2}}</ref> it was not the bitter sub-zero temperatures and wind chills and hot summers of the tree-sparse [[North Dakota]] bases, or the confinement of the bases in the more established communities of the northeastern states. Locals maintained that the K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer runway was built over some of the best [[blueberry]] fields in the state. Berry patches remained on many other parts of the base, and families of aircrew members often picked them near the alert barracks and the family center.\n\nA portion of the operational section of K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer AFB has been converted into [[Sawyer International Airport]], which opened its passenger terminal for service in September 1999. It replaced the smaller [[Marquette County Airport]], just southwest of Marquette, as the region's primary civilian airport.\n[[File:Retired Boeing B-52 Stratofortress commemorating the former K. I.

Sawyer Air Force Base''' is a decommissioned [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] installation in [[Marquette County, Michigan]], south of the city of [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]]. Near the center of Michigan's [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]], the base operated for nearly forty years and closed in 1995. The county airport, [[Sawyer International Airport|Sawyer International]], now occupies a portion of the base and has scheduled airline flights and some general aviation activity. The area of the former base is now an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] and a [[census-designated place]] for statistical purposes known as '''K. I. Sawyer AFB.'''\n\n==History==\nThe origins of K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer Air Force Base begin in the mid-1930s when Kenneth Ingalls Sawyer (1884\u20131944), a [[civil engineer]] and Marquette County road commissioner, desired to build an airport which would aid the development of the Marquette area.<ref name=mqmtrem>{{cite journal |url=http://www.comehometosawyerairport.com/PDFs/SawyerBackThen.pdf |magazine=Marquette Monthly |title=Remembering Kenneth Ingalls Sawyer |last=Henry |first=Ragene |date=August 1995 |pages=6, 7 |journal= |access-date=23 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195707/http://www.comehometosawyerairport.com/PDFs/SawyerBackThen.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The one factor which most likely influenced the establishment and final location of the airport was the growing mining industry in the local area. As the demand for iron ore increased, the need for travel increased. By 1937, the demand reached a point of air service necessity. To support this demand, a [[Marquette County Airport|county airport]] was built southwest of Marquette, northeast of [[Negaunee, Michigan|Negaunee]].\n\nThe population of the area continued to grow, and, by 1940, Sawyer realized the new Negaunee airport could not handle its ever-increasing demands. Therefore, in 1941, the then-superintendent of the county highway department stepped out of his role and presented a plan for a new airport. The most significant landmarks on his proposed site were a hill of sand and a wealth of [[blueberry]] patches. The board agreed with the idea. Shortly thereafter, the United States was drawn into [[World War II]]. Local concern for the protection of the [[Great Lakes]] inter-lake navigation [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] named [[Soo Locks]] at the trans-border area of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] prompted area citizens to propose that the U.S. [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] take over the new airfield. At that time, the proposal was shelved.\n\n===K. I. Sawyer Airport===\nSawyer died in 1944, and the following year the airfield, consisting of a single airstrip, was completed and named '''K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer Airport''' in his honor. It was used by private fliers until 1948 when Nationwide Airlines became the first commercial airline to operate flights out of the airport. Nationwide flew shuttles to [[Detroit]] from Marquette, with stops in [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]], [[Iron Mountain, Michigan|Iron Mountain]], and [[Menominee, Michigan|Menominee]].\n\nIn February 1954, the U.S. Air Force announced plans to enlarge its forces, and new bases were needed. The government entered into negotiations with the county for Sawyer's lease, and offered to build a $12 million jet base which could be jointly used by the Air Force and Marquette-area citizens. The major stipulation made by the government was no more than 300 landings per month could be made by civilian aircraft. In January 1955, a public meeting was held in the county courthouse to discuss the proposed lease. Many at this meeting voted to adopt a resolution urging the Marquette City Commission to accept the government's offer.\n\n===K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base===\nOn 24 Jan 1955, the U.S. government signed a [[99-year lease]]. Almost immediately, construction of military support facilities began. About 850 people were employed during the construction of the base and another 262 were actively employed during the winter months. A letter from [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Harold E. Talbott]] to [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Homer S. Ferguson]] was printed in ''[[The Mining Journal]]'' and reported more than 900&nbsp;military personnel were to be stationed at K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer Air Force Base with an annual income in excess of $3 million. K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer Airport officially opened as a joint civil-military facility on 8 April 1956, and it was not long before the Air Force proposed a $447,000 appropriation for construction of a civil airport in [[Negaunee Township, Michigan|Negaunee Township]], which would allow the Air Force sole use of the base.\n\nAir Force facilities constructed included a {{convert|12366|ft|m|adj=mid|-long|-1}}<ref>FAA records http://www.airnav.com/airport/KSAW</ref> and {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide|-1}} runway. Additionally, the region's wide open airspace offers ease of operations for an extremely safe and delay free air traffic setting. The official opening of K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer AFB occurred on 8 May 1959, at which time the airfield became a strictly military operation.\n\n====Air Defense Command====\n[[File:Air Defense Command.png|left|100px]]\n[[File:62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron - Emblem.png|left|100px]]\n[[File:87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron - Patch.png|left|100px]]\n[[File:62d FIS F-101 KI Sawyer 1960s.jpg|thumb|[[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo|F-101]] of the 62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on Alert during the 1960s]]\n[[File:87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron-TAC-F-106-59-0094.jpg|thumb|[[Convair F-106 Delta Dart|F-106A]] (59-0094) of the 87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in flight in the early 1980s. Note the [[Tactical Air Command]] emblem on the tail, replacing the squadron emblem.]]\nUpon activation, K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer was placed under the Jurisdiction of [[Aerospace Defense Command|Air Defense Command]] (ADC) on 8 April 1956. The [[473d Fighter Group]] was activated as the host unit, under the ADC [[4706th Air Defense Wing]] at [[O'Hare International Airport]], Illinois.\n\nThe initial mission of the base was to act as a fighter-[[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] defense against an enemy [[Strategic bomber|bomber]] attack, the [[484th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] was activated on 8 June 1956, and authorized [[Northrop F-89 Scorpion|F-89D Scorpion]] interceptors, however the 484th FIS was never equipped or manned as much construction was necessary to bring the airport up to Air Force standards for a military airfield. In 1957, civilian commercial operations from the base moved to a new Marquette County Airport erected at the site of the old Negaunee Airport. The first aircraft assigned to K. I. Sawyer were [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102 Delta Dagger]]s from the [[438th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] at [[Kincheloe Air Force Base|Kincheloe AFB]], which were temporarily stationed at K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer during the summer of 1958.\n\nOn 8 November 1958 the [[Sault Sainte Marie Air Defense Sector]] (SsmADS) was established at K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer AFB. The ADC command and control organization's mission was to operate the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) Data Center (DC-14), which opened in 1959. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. SsmADS also supported the [[Antigo Air Force Station|Antigo AFS]] (P-19) and [[Calumet Air Force Station|Calumet AFS]] (P-16) ADC Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning stations\n\nFurther expansion of the base occurred in 1959 when the runway was extended to its present 12,366 feet. Prior to the expansion, ADC replaced the 473d Fighter Group with the [[56th Fighter Wing]], along with its [[62d Fighter Squadron|62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]], to Sawyer as the host unit. The 56th FW received its first aircraft, a [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], in 1959, after the expanded runway was completed. The F-101s provided the SAGE unit with the required intercept and destroy capabilities that gave the base teeth.\n\nIn 1961 the 56th Fighter Wing was discontinued and the host unit at Sawyer became the Sault Sainte Marie ADS. In a reorganization in 1964, SAC assumed jurisdiction of the base and ADC phased down its presence to a tenant organization. The 62d FIS came under the command and control of the [[Duluth Air Defense Sector]] and the SsmADS was inactivated. Responsibilities for the SAGE system were switched to the Duluth ADS, (DC-10) or the [[Detroit Air Defense Sector]] (DC-06).\n\nIn 1969, Air Defense Command was redesignated as Aerospace Defense Command. In 1971, the 62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and its [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo|F-101B Voodoo]] was replaced with a new squadron and aircraft. The new squadron was the [[87th Flying Training Squadron|87th Fighter Interceptor Squadron]] (87 FIS), the \"Red Bulls,\" which flew the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart|F-106A Delta Dart]]. The 87th maintained four T-33 aircraft to provide target support for the squadron interceptors, simulating Soviet bomber tactics. In addition, they flew NORAD radar evaluation and logistic support sorties.\n\nADC was disestablished in 1979 and all ADC aircraft assets were transferred to [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) under a sub-organization known as Air Defense \u2013 Tactical Air Command (ADTAC). The 87 FIS and their F-106 aircraft remained based and maintaining a 24/7/365 alert status at Sawyer AFB. The 87th was scheduled to convert to the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagle]] in 1984. However, due to budget cuts the conversion was cancelled and the squadron was scheduled for inactivation on 1 October 1985 as the continental air defense mission in the United States was increasingly transferred to the [[Air National Guard]]. When inactivated, the 87th FIS was the second-to-last F-106 squadron on active duty.\n\nOn 4 September 1985, the last three F-106 Delta Darts from the 87th FIS departed K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer for [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group|AMARC]] at [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base|Davis-Monthan AFB]] at [[Tucson, Arizona]]. Most of its aircraft were later converted to QF-106 target drones and expended as aerial targets over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as part of the \"Pacer Six Program\" during the late 1990s at [[Tyndall Air Force Base|Tyndall AFB]] in western [[Florida]] by the [[82d Aerial Targets Squadron]].\n\n====Strategic Air Command====\n[[File:Shield Strategic Air Command.png|left|100px]]\n[[File:410th Air Expeditionary Wing.PNG|left|100px]]\nThe [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) became a tenant organization at K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer AFB on 1 August 1958 with the organization of the [[410th Air Expeditionary Wing#Strategic Air Command|4042d Strategic Wing]]. The 4042d SW was a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H Stratofortress]] dispersal wing, a part of SAC's plan to disperse its big bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike.\n\nBefore receiving the [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135A]] [[Aerial refueling|tanker]] and heavy B-52H bomber aircraft of SAC, an all-weather, heavy-duty concrete runway was built, measuring {{convert|24|in|cm}} thick and {{convert|150|ft}} wide. It was extended in 1959 from {{convert|6000|to|12366|ft|-1}},<ref>World Wide Metric http://www.worldwidemetric.com/measurements.html</ref> overruns of {{convert|1000|ft|-1}}.  There are also {{convert|75|ft|adj=on}} shoulders on each side of the runway, providing a paved width of {{convert|300|ft|-1}}.\n\nThe two operational units to be assigned later to this wing were the 923d Air Refueling Squadron on 1 May 1960, and the [[526th Bombardment Squadron]] on 1 June 1961. The refueling squadron's first KC-135A aircraft arrived 4 August 1960, and the unit was declared fully combat ready in November of that year.\n[[File:Boeing B-52H-140-BW (SN 60-0017) 061026-F-1234S-023.jpg|thumb|A Boeing [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]] (SN 60-0017), the type assigned to the 410th Bomb Wing at K. I. Sawyer AFB]]\n[[File:Boeing KC-135 J57 wet takeoff.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135A]] taking off with [[Water injection (engine)#Use in aircraft|water injection]] to its [[Pratt & Whitney J57|J-57 engines]]]]\nIn April 1961, the 923d was inactivated and the [[46th Air Refueling Squadron]] organized and activated as a replacement unit. The first B-52H aircraft assigned to the 526th arrived at Sawyer in August 1961. On 1 February 1963, the 4042d Strategic Wing was discontinued and the [[410th Air Expeditionary Wing|410th Bombardment Wing]] (Heavy) organized and activated with no change in mission, personnel or aircraft. Also on that date, the [[644th Bomb Squadron|644th Bombardment Squadron]] was activated replacing the 526th, and the 46th Air Refueling Squadron was reassigned to the 410th. The majority of the wing's present support squadrons were also activated on this date as well.\n\nOn 1 January 1964, SAC assumed jurisdiction of Sawyer AFB, with the 410th Bomb Wing becoming the host unit under the [[4th Air Division|4th Strategic Aerospace Division]]. K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer was one of three SAC bases in Michigan that operated the B-52: the others were [[Kincheloe Air Force Base|Kincheloe AFB]] to the east, near [[Kinross Charter Township, Michigan|Kinross]], south of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]], and [[Wurtsmith Air Force Base|Wurtsmith AFB]], in the northeast of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, near [[Oscoda, Michigan|Oscoda]].\n\nThe 410th and its subordinate units' mission was to operate at full readiness, and support activities included aircraft and vehicle maintenance, bombing crew and unit training, and air refueling support. The wing did not deploy bomber aircraft to Southeast Asia during the [[Vietnam War]], as the B-52H was dedicated to strategic deterrence. However, the tanker aircraft and aircrews participated in the \"Young Tiger\" [[Temporary duty assignment|TDY]] effort, and the bomber aircrews went through RTU (Replacement Training Unit) training to fly B-52Ds out of [[Andersen Air Force Base|Andersen AFB]], Guam and [[U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield|U-Tapao RTAFB]], Thailand and were active participants in many of the notable campaigns that took place in Southeast Asia, such as [[Operation Arc Light]].\n\nOne Sawyer KC-135A (61-0313) became famous throughout the SAC community as \"the glider\" when it ran out of fuel on a short final approach prior to landing at its home base after flying practice approaches at nearby Kincheloe AFB to complete requalification training. The flight crew, with the exception of the instructor pilot, bailed out when the engines went quiet. The instructor pilot, who remained on board, landed the aircraft just short of the runway overrun, bounced and rolled to a stop on the runway. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service quickly and even the crew entry door (which separated from the aircraft during bailout procedures) was returned to the Air Force by a local farmer.<ref>46th Air Refueling Squadron Association [https://web.archive.org/web/20170203172329/http://46thars.tripod.com/id26.html http://46thars.tripod.com/id26.html]  \"Night of the Gliding Pig\" entry by crew Navigator Joe \"Hump\" Heywood</ref>\n\nOther aircraft assigned to K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer over the years included [[Kaman HH-43 Huskie|HH-43B]] and [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|HH-1H]] rescue helicopters of the 48th and 39th Air Rescue and Recovery Wings at [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin AFB]], Florida at the K. I. Sawyer Helicopter (later re-designated Training) Annex, 14 March 1975 to 1 October 1977. SAC [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|FB-111]] bombers assigned to the [[509th Bomb Wing|509th Bombardment Wing (Medium)]] from [[Pease Air National Guard Base|Pease AFB]] in [[New Hampshire]], on satellite alert at Sawyer in 1974 and 1975.\n\nIn the early 1980s, K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer's B-52s were modified to carry the new Boeing [[AGM-86 ALCM|AGM-86 Air-Launched Cruise Missile]] (ALCM). The ALCM was powered by a 600&nbsp;lb.s.t.

Sawyer was a favorite base among the SAC community. Although isolated and definitely northern, it was an attractive base for its pleasing [[Laurentian Mixed Forest Province|North Woods]] location and its proximity to outdoor activities off the base, including hunting, fishing, boating, and winter sports including [[Alpine skiing|skiing]] at [[Marquette Mountain]] (known as \"Cliffs Ridge\" before 1982), as well as the venues on site (base lake, ski hill, and others).\n\nWhile the base was sometimes referred to as \"K.&nbsp;I. [[Siberia]]\" or \"The Rock\" and there was an abundance of [[lake-effect snow]],<ref name=sremflkp>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YhJQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zlUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5429%2C5617317 |newspaper=Ludington (MI) Daily News |agency=Associated Press |last=St. John |first=Paige |title=Snow removal fleet keeps Sawyer open|date=17 March 1989 |page=2}}</ref> it was not the bitter sub-zero temperatures and wind chills and hot summers of the tree-sparse [[North Dakota]] bases, or the confinement of the bases in the more established communities of the northeastern states. Locals maintained that the K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer runway was built over some of the best [[blueberry]] fields in the state. Berry patches remained on many other parts of the base, and families of aircrew members often picked them near the alert barracks and the family center.\n\nA portion of the operational section of K.&nbsp;I. Sawyer AFB has been converted into [[Sawyer International Airport]], which opened its passenger terminal for service in September 1999. It replaced the smaller [[Marquette County Airport]], just southwest of Marquette, as the region's primary civilian airport.\n[[File:Retired Boeing B-52 Stratofortress commemorating the former K. I.

Spinning lights on the Outdoor Observatory (floor 91) provided a display of sound and lights, but no fireworks were launched.\n* 2004\u20132005: Grand opening of Taipei 101 celebrated with the first fireworks display. The show lasted 35 seconds. Rockets were launched from section balconies. Festivities included all-day performances by famous entertainers and ceremonial visits by national dignitaries.\n* 2005\u20132006: Show extended to 128 seconds. [[Sony]] sponsored the show, which concluded with a display of the brand name in lights.\n* 2006\u20132007: Show extended to 188 seconds; 9,000 rockets were launched. This was Sony's second time sponsoring the event.\n* 2007\u20132008: Show same length but featuring 12,000 rockets. Event Sponsor Taiwan Tourism Bureau ended the show with a display, in lights, of a heart over the word 'Taiwan'.\n* 2008\u20132009: A conspicuously more modest show than those which preceded it. The theme was \"Love Taiwan With Your Heart in 2009\". The show ended with the four sides of the building displaying lights in four colors (red, blue, green, and yellow) to represent happiness, vision, sustainability and passion.\n* 2009\u20132010: The display regained some of the dazzle of 2005\u20132008 shows but remained more brief in duration. The theme was \"Taiwan Up\".\n*2010\u20132011: Show extended to 288 seconds (100 sec. for flash effects and 188 sec. for fireworks), and designed by [[Cai Guo-Qiang]], the artist also responsible for Beijing Olympics and World Expo Shanghai's fireworks. The theme was \"100 ROC\" (100th anniversary of the [[Republic of China]]) which extended on the \"Love Taiwan\" theme. 2010 was also the year the Floral Expo was held in Taipei, and at Dajia Riverside Park there was another New Year's Eve event. It was a VIP event, but was broadcast simultaneously with the City Hall event. The display on the building was accompanied by fireworks going off other buildings in the Xinyi financial district. One concept was for fireworks to spiral up and down the building like [[dragon]] crawling, but technical difficulties caused some disappointment with what was anticipated (reported by the media to be more like \"a worm\"). It also took 30 seconds for the host to realize the fireworks were over.\n*2011\u20132012: The show was shortened to 202 seconds and was considered to be more conservative than that of the previous year, but featuring the largest number of rockets launched to date, totaling 30,000. The theme coincided with the 101st anniversary of the ROC. It also gained attention on YouTube, where viewers noticed an apparent \"[[UFO]]\" in the seconds before the fireworks started, later determined to be a radio-controlled glider with flashing lights.\n*2012\u20132013: The show was designed by the French pyrotechnics company Groupe F and was 198 seconds in length, featuring 22,000 rockets launched to an adaptation of Igor Stravinsky's ''[[The Firebird]]''. The theme was \"Swing for the Future\". The words \"Time for Taiwan\" (both in English and Mandarin Chinese) were displayed in lights at the building to promote Taiwan Tourism Bureau's current advertising campaign.\n*2013\u20132014: The show lasted 218 seconds and a thematic music was created for the first time by local musicians to commemorate Taipei 101's 10th anniversary. \n*2014\u20132015: Marked 10th anniversary since the official opening on 31 December 2004. The show performed for 218 seconds. iSee Taiwan Foundation sponsored the fireworks to promote the beauty of Taiwanese culture and creativity. The firework music was arranged by Taiwanese Golden Melody award winner \u2013 Mr. Lee, Che-Yi, blended with the famous classical song The four seasons by Vivaldi and many Taiwanese folk music. Performed and recorded by Taipei Symphony Orchestra. \n*2015\u20132016: It's the fourth time Group F designed the firework show for Taipei 101, with a green theme \"Nature is Future\" this year. The 238-second display was considered the longest performance ever. In addition to the most various and natural patterns of flowers, birds, seahorses, fishes, etc. were projected, 30,000 effects were one of the most to show. It's also the first time to have professional climbers to settle the firework racks onto the building fa\u00e7ades. Mr. Lee, Chi-Yi once again arranged the music mixed with international and Taiwanese rhythms reflecting the nature-related theme and Evergreen Symphony Orchestra played the role of performance. A young Taiwanese IT design company BungBungame became the exclusive sponsor supporting a symbolic event showing Taiwan to the world.\n*2020: Taipei 101 displayed a show with the theme of \"Light of Hope, Taiwan\", launching 16,000 fireworks at midnight. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3847975|title=Taipei 101 New Year's Eve fireworks displ...|last=News|first=Taiwan|website=Taiwan News|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Developments===\nThe Taipei Financial Center Corporation (TFCC) announced plans on 2 November 2009 to make Taipei 101 \"the world's tallest green building\" by summer of 2011 as measured by LEED standards. The structure is already designed to be energy-efficient, with double-pane windows blocking external heat by 50 percent and recycled water meeting 20\u201330 percent of the building's needs. LEED certification would entail inspections and upgrades in wiring, water and lighting equipment at a cost of NT$60&nbsp;million (US$1.8&nbsp;million).

Spinning lights on the Outdoor Observatory (floor 91) provided a display of sound and lights, but no fireworks were launched.\n* 2004\u20132005: Grand opening of Taipei 101 celebrated with the first fireworks display. The show lasted 35 seconds. Rockets were launched from section balconies. Festivities included all-day performances by famous entertainers and ceremonial visits by national dignitaries.\n* 2005\u20132006: Show extended to 128 seconds. [[Sony]] sponsored the show, which concluded with a display of the brand name in lights.\n* 2006\u20132007: Show extended to 188 seconds; 9,000 rockets were launched. This was Sony's second time sponsoring the event.\n* 2007\u20132008: Show same length but featuring 12,000 rockets. Event Sponsor Taiwan Tourism Bureau ended the show with a display, in lights, of a heart over the word 'Taiwan'.\n* 2008\u20132009: A conspicuously more modest show than those which preceded it. The theme was \"Love Taiwan With Your Heart in 2009\". The show ended with the four sides of the building displaying lights in four colors (red, blue, green, and yellow) to represent happiness, vision, sustainability and passion.\n* 2009\u20132010: The display regained some of the dazzle of 2005\u20132008 shows but remained more brief in duration. The theme was \"Taiwan Up\".\n*2010\u20132011: Show extended to 288 seconds (100 sec. for flash effects and 188 sec. for fireworks), and designed by [[Cai Guo-Qiang]], the artist also responsible for Beijing Olympics and World Expo Shanghai's fireworks. The theme was \"100 ROC\" (100th anniversary of the [[Republic of China]]) which extended on the \"Love Taiwan\" theme. 2010 was also the year the Floral Expo was held in Taipei, and at Dajia Riverside Park there was another New Year's Eve event. It was a VIP event, but was broadcast simultaneously with the City Hall event. The display on the building was accompanied by fireworks going off other buildings in the Xinyi financial district. One concept was for fireworks to spiral up and down the building like [[dragon]] crawling, but technical difficulties caused some disappointment with what was anticipated (reported by the media to be more like \"a worm\"). It also took 30 seconds for the host to realize the fireworks were over.\n*2011\u20132012: The show was shortened to 202 seconds and was considered to be more conservative than that of the previous year, but featuring the largest number of rockets launched to date, totaling 30,000. The theme coincided with the 101st anniversary of the ROC. It also gained attention on YouTube, where viewers noticed an apparent \"[[UFO]]\" in the seconds before the fireworks started, later determined to be a radio-controlled glider with flashing lights.\n*2012\u20132013: The show was designed by the French pyrotechnics company Groupe F and was 198 seconds in length, featuring 22,000 rockets launched to an adaptation of Igor Stravinsky's ''[[The Firebird]]''. The theme was \"Swing for the Future\". The words \"Time for Taiwan\" (both in English and Mandarin Chinese) were displayed in lights at the building to promote Taiwan Tourism Bureau's current advertising campaign.\n*2013\u20132014: The show lasted 218 seconds and a thematic music was created for the first time by local musicians to commemorate Taipei 101's 10th anniversary. \n*2014\u20132015: Marked 10th anniversary since the official opening on 31 December 2004. The show performed for 218 seconds. iSee Taiwan Foundation sponsored the fireworks to promote the beauty of Taiwanese culture and creativity. The firework music was arranged by Taiwanese Golden Melody award winner \u2013 Mr. Lee, Che-Yi, blended with the famous classical song The four seasons by Vivaldi and many Taiwanese folk music. Performed and recorded by Taipei Symphony Orchestra. \n*2015\u20132016: It's the fourth time Group F designed the firework show for Taipei 101, with a green theme \"Nature is Future\" this year. The 238-second display was considered the longest performance ever. In addition to the most various and natural patterns of flowers, birds, seahorses, fishes, etc. were projected, 30,000 effects were one of the most to show. It's also the first time to have professional climbers to settle the firework racks onto the building fa\u00e7ades. Mr. Lee, Chi-Yi once again arranged the music mixed with international and Taiwanese rhythms reflecting the nature-related theme and Evergreen Symphony Orchestra played the role of performance. A young Taiwanese IT design company BungBungame became the exclusive sponsor supporting a symbolic event showing Taiwan to the world.\n*2020: Taipei 101 displayed a show with the theme of \"Light of Hope, Taiwan\", launching 16,000 fireworks at midnight. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3847975|title=Taipei 101 New Year's Eve fireworks displ...|last=News|first=Taiwan|website=Taiwan News|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Developments===\nThe Taipei Financial Center Corporation (TFCC) announced plans on 2 November 2009 to make Taipei 101 \"the world's tallest green building\" by summer of 2011 as measured by LEED standards. The structure is already designed to be energy-efficient, with double-pane windows blocking external heat by 50 percent and recycled water meeting 20\u201330 percent of the building's needs. LEED certification would entail inspections and upgrades in wiring, water and lighting equipment at a cost of NT$60&nbsp;million (US$1.8&nbsp;million).

The airport is named after [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan Bir Bikram Shah]], the king of Nepal from 11 December 1911 to 13 March 1955. The airport is a sole international airport in Nepal, operating with a single runway, one domestic and an international terminal. TIA connects Nepal to more than 40 destinations in 17 countries. \n\nThe airport is a hub for two international airlines, [[Himalaya Airlines]] and the flag carrier, [[Nepal Airlines]]. Seasonally, [[Buddha Air]] also offers scheduled international flights to nearby Indian cities. About seventeen [[List of aircraft registration prefixes|9N-]] registered [[List of airlines of Nepal|domestic air operators]] maintain Kathmandu as their principal base of operation.<ref name=\"Report 2017\" /> The airport is considered as a starting point to [[Mount Everest]], with the several daily flights to [[Tenzing\u2013Hillary Airport|Lukla]]. A few airlines also offer Everest sightseeing flights out of Kathmandu. \n\nDue to severe traffic congestion and the airport running out of its maximum capacity, the government of Nepal has decided to perform a short-term expansion and construct more international airports, notably, [[Nijgadh International Airport]]. \n \nAs a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], [[ Nepal Government]] has suspended all international flights until 30 April 2020 and domestic flights until 15 April 2020. \n==History==\nThe airport was originally named '''Gauchaur Airport''', after the area of Kathmandu where it was situated. The formal beginning of aviation in Nepal occurred in 1949, with the landing of a [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] carrying the Indian ambassador. The first charter flight took place between Gauchaur and [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], in a [[Himalayan Aviation]] [[Douglas DC-3|Dakota]] on 20 February 1950.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caanepal.org.np/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=60&Itemid=38|title=Chronology|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the airport was inaugurated by King Mahendra and renamed '''Tribhuvan Airport''' in memory of [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|the king's father]]. The airport was again renamed '''Tribhuvan International Airport''' in 1964. The original grass runway was re-laid in concrete in 1957 and extended from {{convert|3750|ft|m}}, to {{convert|6600|ft|m}} in 1967. The runway was again extended from {{convert|6600|ft|m}} to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} in 1975.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\" />\n\nThe first jet aircraft to land at Tribhuvan was a [[Lufthansa]] [[Boeing 707]] in 1967.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\" /> [[Nepal Airlines|Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation]] commenced jet operations at the airport in 1972 with [[Boeing 727]] aircraft.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\" />\n\nIn May 2007, [[Austrian Airlines]] discontinued its flight to [[Vienna Airport|Vienna]], Nepal's last direct air link to Europe.<ref>\n \"Austrian bids farewell to the 737\", Airliner World, June 2013: p6</ref> In September 2013, [[Turkish Airlines]] launched direct flights from [[Istanbul]] to Kathmandu, re-establishing Nepal's connection with continental Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/flights-tickets/flights-destinations?departure=istanbul&continent=all&class=economy|title=International Flight Destinations & Special Offers \u2013 Turkish Airlines|author=Medyasoft (c) 2012|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n=== Runway === \nThe airport has a single {{convert|10,007|ft|m}} runway with a slope of 1.2% oriented at 02/20. The [[Asphalt|bitumen]] runway with the strength of [[Pavement classification number|PCN]] 54F/A/W/T has the markings of the centerline, edge, touchdown zone and the threshold. The runway is equipped with the high intensity centerline lights, bidirectional raised edge lights, the threshold lights and the runway end lights. [[Precision approach path indicator]] (PAPI) lights at 3\u00b0 are installed as landing aids for the both runways 02/20. The runway has five intersections with the the taxiways. The taxiway G runs parallel to the runway but it doesn't connect the thresholds.\n\n=== Aids to Navigation ===\nThere are two [[non-precision approach]] available at the Kathmandu Airport; VHF omnidirectional range along a distance measuring equipment ([[VOR/DME]]) and [[Area navigation|Random Area Navigation]] (RNAV/RNP). A high intensity {{Convert|870|m|ft|abbr=}} extended centerline lights are installed at the southern end of the airport to assist with the approach.\n\n=== Terminals ===\nThe airport has two public terminals, one for international and one for domestic traffic. It also has a terminal for VIP guests operated by the [[Government of Nepal]], where international state guests are welcomed. There are plans to construct a separate terminal for [[helicopter|helicopter transportation]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Separate helicopter terminal to be built at TIA |url=https://www.aviationnepal.com/separate-helicopter-terminal-to-be-built-at-tia/ |publisher=Aviation Nepal |accessdate=31 January 2019 |date=20 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel Kathmandu]] operates an executive lounge for first and business class passengers for some airlines<ref>{{cite web|title=Airport Restaurant and Executive Lounge|url=https://www.radisson.com/rad/images/hotels/NEPKATHM/airport%20restaurant.pdf|publisher=Radisson|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> and [[Thai Airways]] operates a lounge for its business-class passengers, as well as [[Star Alliance]] Gold card holders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Orchid Lounge|url=https://www.thaiairways.com/en/exp_thai/Airport_Services/royal_orchid_lounges.page|publisher=Thai Airways|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Aircraft maintenance ===\nNepal Airlines operates a large hangar between the international and domestic terminals.

The airport is named after [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan Bir Bikram Shah]], the king of Nepal from 11 December 1911 to 13 March 1955. The airport is a sole international airport in Nepal, operating with a single runway, one domestic and an international terminal. TIA connects Nepal to more than 40 destinations in 17 countries. \n\nThe airport is a hub for two international airlines, [[Himalaya Airlines]] and the flag carrier, [[Nepal Airlines]]. Seasonally, [[Buddha Air]] also offers scheduled international flights to nearby Indian cities. About seventeen [[List of aircraft registration prefixes|9N-]] registered [[List of airlines of Nepal|domestic air operators]] maintain Kathmandu as their principal base of operation.<ref name=\"Report 2017\" /> The airport is considered as a starting point to [[Mount Everest]], with the several daily flights to [[Tenzing\u2013Hillary Airport|Lukla]]. A few airlines also offer Everest sightseeing flights out of Kathmandu. \n\nDue to severe traffic congestion and the airport running out of its maximum capacity, the government of Nepal has decided to perform a short-term expansion and construct more international airports, notably, [[Nijgadh International Airport]]. \n \nAs a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], [[ Nepal Government]] has suspended all international flights until 30 April 2020 and domestic flights until 15 April 2020. \n==History==\nThe airport was originally named '''Gauchaur Airport''', after the area of Kathmandu where it was situated. The formal beginning of aviation in Nepal occurred in 1949, with the landing of a [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] carrying the Indian ambassador. The first charter flight took place between Gauchaur and [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], in a [[Himalayan Aviation]] [[Douglas DC-3|Dakota]] on 20 February 1950.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caanepal.org.np/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=60&Itemid=38|title=Chronology|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the airport was inaugurated by King Mahendra and renamed '''Tribhuvan Airport''' in memory of [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|the king's father]]. The airport was again renamed '''Tribhuvan International Airport''' in 1964. The original grass runway was re-laid in concrete in 1957 and extended from {{convert|3750|ft|m}}, to {{convert|6600|ft|m}} in 1967. The runway was again extended from {{convert|6600|ft|m}} to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} in 1975.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\" />\n\nThe first jet aircraft to land at Tribhuvan was a [[Lufthansa]] [[Boeing 707]] in 1967.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\" /> [[Nepal Airlines|Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation]] commenced jet operations at the airport in 1972 with [[Boeing 727]] aircraft.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\" />\n\nIn May 2007, [[Austrian Airlines]] discontinued its flight to [[Vienna Airport|Vienna]], Nepal's last direct air link to Europe.<ref>\n \"Austrian bids farewell to the 737\", Airliner World, June 2013: p6</ref> In September 2013, [[Turkish Airlines]] launched direct flights from [[Istanbul]] to Kathmandu, re-establishing Nepal's connection with continental Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/flights-tickets/flights-destinations?departure=istanbul&continent=all&class=economy|title=International Flight Destinations & Special Offers \u2013 Turkish Airlines|author=Medyasoft (c) 2012|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n=== Runway === \nThe airport has a single {{convert|10,007|ft|m}} runway with a slope of 1.2% oriented at 02/20. The [[Asphalt|bitumen]] runway with the strength of [[Pavement classification number|PCN]] 54F/A/W/T has the markings of the centerline, edge, touchdown zone and the threshold. The runway is equipped with the high intensity centerline lights, bidirectional raised edge lights, the threshold lights and the runway end lights. [[Precision approach path indicator]] (PAPI) lights at 3\u00b0 are installed as landing aids for the both runways 02/20. The runway has five intersections with the the taxiways. The taxiway G runs parallel to the runway but it doesn't connect the thresholds.\n\n=== Aids to Navigation ===\nThere are two [[non-precision approach]] available at the Kathmandu Airport; VHF omnidirectional range along a distance measuring equipment ([[VOR/DME]]) and [[Area navigation|Random Area Navigation]] (RNAV/RNP). A high intensity {{Convert|870|m|ft|abbr=}} extended centerline lights are installed at the southern end of the airport to assist with the approach.\n\n=== Terminals ===\nThe airport has two public terminals, one for international and one for domestic traffic. It also has a terminal for VIP guests operated by the [[Government of Nepal]], where international state guests are welcomed. There are plans to construct a separate terminal for [[helicopter|helicopter transportation]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Separate helicopter terminal to be built at TIA |url=https://www.aviationnepal.com/separate-helicopter-terminal-to-be-built-at-tia/ |publisher=Aviation Nepal |accessdate=31 January 2019 |date=20 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel Kathmandu]] operates an executive lounge for first and business class passengers for some airlines<ref>{{cite web|title=Airport Restaurant and Executive Lounge|url=https://www.radisson.com/rad/images/hotels/NEPKATHM/airport%20restaurant.pdf|publisher=Radisson|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> and [[Thai Airways]] operates a lounge for its business-class passengers, as well as [[Star Alliance]] Gold card holders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Orchid Lounge|url=https://www.thaiairways.com/en/exp_thai/Airport_Services/royal_orchid_lounges.page|publisher=Thai Airways|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Aircraft maintenance ===\nNepal Airlines operates a large hangar between the international and domestic terminals.
