The show was a creation of [[Mark Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman]] Productions.\n\nThe show began on radio as ''Time's A-Wastin''' in 1948, hosted by [[Bud Collyer]], and changed its name to ''Beat the Time'' on January 5, 1949. The show moved to television on the [[CBS]] nighttime schedule starting on March 23, 1950. On September 16, 1957, CBS premiered an afternoon version of the show as well, which ran for a year. The nighttime show was cancelled on February 16, 1958, and the afternoon program followed on September 12, 1958.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/54/mode/2up|accessdate=22 March 2020|pages=54-55}}</ref>\n\nSoon, the show moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] daytime schedule, and ran from October 13, 1958 to January 27, 1961. A brief revival aired on CBS from September 9, 1979 to February 1, 1980.<ref name=Daytime/>\n\nThe most recent revival premiered on [[Universal Kids]] on February 6, 2018.\n\n==1950\u20131961==\nThe first edition of ''Beat the Clock'' was a production of [[CBS]] and aired there until 1958. The show then moved to [[American Broadcasting Company]] where it stayed until 1961. [[Bud Collyer]] emceed the original series.\n\nContestants were required to perform tasks (called \"problems\" by Collyer) within a certain time limit which was counted down on a large 60-second [[clock]]. If they succeeded, they were said to have \"beaten the clock\"\u2014otherwise, \"the clock beat them\". The show had several sponsors over its run, with the most longstanding being the electronics company [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]].\n\n===On-air personalities===\nSubstitute hosts on the original version included Bill Hart (1951), [[John Reed King]] (1952), stunt creator [[Frank Wayne]] (1953), Bob Kennedy (1954), [[Win Elliot]] (1955), and [[Sonny Fox]], who became Collyer's permanent substitute from 1957 to 1960. Collyer was referred to in the introductions as \"America's number one clockwatcher\", and the fill-in hosts were each named \"America's number two clockwatcher\".\n[[File:Beat the Clock 1958.JPG|thumb|180px|Bud Collyer as the show's host, 1958.]]\nThe show had several female on-air assistants. The original hostess was [[Roxanne (model)|Roxanne]] (n\u00e9e Delores Evelyn Rosedale). Roxanne was replaced by [[Beverly Bentley]] in August 1955. Bentley's departure in 1956 coincided with Hazel Bishop's sponsorship and a period of having no main assistant (see production changes below). She reappeared as one of the models on the original version of ''[[The Price Is Right (1956 U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' for its entire run.\n\nThe announcer for the show's run on CBS was Bernard (\"Bern\") Bennett until 1958. In October 1957, ''Beat the Clock'' ran a contest inviting viewers to submit drawings of what Bennett, who was never shown on camera, might look like. Over 20,000 viewers participated, and winner Edward Darnell, of [[Columbus, Indiana]], was flown in to appear with Bennett on the December 2, 1957, show. When ''Beat the Clock'' moved to ABC, Dirk Fredericks became the announcer. Substitute announcers included Lee Vines, [[Bob Sheppard]], [[Hal Simms]], and Dick Noel.\n\n===Contestants===\nContestants were chosen from the studio audience and usually were married couples. Other pairs were engaged, dating, or were a familial relationship. Collyer would ask them general questions (usually including where they were from and how long they'd been married) and usually asked if they had children, their ages and genders. Sometimes the couple would bring children on the show. Collyer usually would talk to the children, asking them what they wanted to be when they grew up, or, if the kids were not at the show, to have their parents wave to them on TV. The husbands on the show usually wore a [[business suit]]. Collyer would often ask the husband to take off his coat for stunts to make it less cumbersome (there were hooks on the contestants' podium) or Collyer would hold the coat.\n\nOccasionally, if there was going to be a messy stunt, the husband would come out dressed in a plastic jumpsuit. Similarly, wives would sometimes play in their \"street clothes\", but sometimes the women would appear in a jumpsuit because their own clothing might be too cumbersome or perhaps fragile. The women's jumpsuits, unlike the men's, which were rather plain, were patterned to look like a pair of [[overalls]] with a collared [[blouse]] underneath. The women would also often be issued running shoes instead of their own [[high heels]].\n\n===Game format===\n\n====Main Game====\nOne couple competed against the clock to win a prize in stunts that required one or both members of the couple. The stunt was described and the time limit was set on a giant onstage clock. The time limit was always a multiple of 5 seconds, usually at least 30 seconds. At one point Collyer said that a 55-second time limit was the maximum, but later on, stunts occasionally had 60-second limits. On the primetime edition, the first stunt was called the $100 clock. If the couple beat the $100 clock, they moved on to the $200 clock and the same rules applied. If they failed to beat the $100 clock, they received a consolation prize worth less than $100. If they failed to beat the $200 clock, they got a prize worth more than $100. On the daytime versions, couples continued playing as long as they kept beating the clock.\n\n====Jackpot Clock====\nOn the primetime version, if the couple beat the $200 clock, the wife would play the jackpot clock in which the words of a famous saying or quote were scrambled up on a magnetic board and that phrase had to be unscrambled in 20 seconds or less. If successful, then the couple won the Jackpot Prize. If not, they got a prize worth more than $200. Occasionally, when the wife of the couple did not speak English very well, the husband was allowed to perform the jackpot clock.\n\nThe jackpot clock and the Bonus Stunt would provide the templates for the traditional quiz show bonus round, which would become a TV staple, starting in 1950 with the bonus question round on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]''.\n\nIn the show's earliest set design in available episodes, there was a round display near the contestants mirroring the clock. This display had three rings of light like a target. The outer ring would light during the $100 clock, the middle ring for the $200 clock, and the center circle would light during the jackpot clock. This feature was removed in later set designs.\n\n====Bonus Stunt====\nSome time during every episode (between normal stunts), a bell would sound. The couple playing at the time would attempt the Bonus Stunt for the Bonus Prize that started at $100 in cash. If the stunt was not beaten, it would be attempted the next week with $100 added to the prize. When it was beaten, it was retired from the show and a new Bonus Stunt began the next week at $100. The bonus (as the name suggests) did not affect the regular game, and win or lose the couple continued the regular clocks wherever they left off. Beginning in August 1954, the starting amount for each Bonus Stunt was raised to $500, still increasing $100 each week.\n\nBonus Stunts were harder than the usual $100 and $200 clocks and sometimes reached $2,000 and even $3,000 on rare occasions. The first time the Bonus reached $1,000 was on February 28, 1953, when it was won for that amount. In 1956, the Bonus Stunt was replaced by the Super Bonus.\n\nThere was usually a special technique for performing the stunt that had to be figured out, but even then, the stunt was usually difficult enough to require some skill or luck once the technique was realized. Viewers would usually try to figure it out and after a few weeks on the air viewers would often get it (sometimes Collyer would remark that viewers had been writing in and he would give certain dimensions of the props used so viewers could try to figure it out at home).\n\nUsually either contestants themselves would start appearing on the show with the technique in mind, or audience members would shout it out to try to help them. A stunt would usually take a few weeks before the audience realized the technique, and then a few more weeks before someone was able to properly employ it.\n\n====Super Bonus Stunt====\nIn response to the big money prizes on other networks' game shows, CBS talked Mark Goodson into increasing the stakes on ''Beat The Clock''. Ultimately the plan was unsuccessful as the ratings never did improve much, perhaps leading to the end of the Super Bonus. Starting on February 25, 1956, after the last regular Bonus Stunt had been won, it was replaced by the super bonus which started at $10,000 and went up by $1,000 every time a couple failed to beat the clock. Unlike with the regular bonus stunt and the \"Big Cash Bonus Stunt\" that followed it, the Super Bonus was attempted by every couple who qualified by beating the $200 clock. Originally the stunt was played at the end of the show by each couple that qualified, and \"because of the high prize value\" a special timing machine made by the [[Longines]] company was used, which was touted as the most accurate portable timer available. Probably realizing that seeing the same stunt a few times in a row was a bit boring, they moved the Super Bonus right after the $200 clock and before the jackpot clock on March 17, dropping the Longines timer.\n\nPartway through the run of the second Super Bonus, a rolling desk/table with dollar value of the bonus printed on it was used to roll out the props for the stunt. This carried over to the Big Cash Bonus Stunt. It is notable that in the earliest surviving episodes from 1952 that air, the original bonus had a similar desk with the value of the bonus on it. The desk was done away with for several years until the idea was reused in 1956.\n\n====Big Cash Bonus Stunt====\nStarting on September 22, 1956, the bonus reverted to the original Bonus Stunt format (attempted once per episode by whatever couple heard the \"bonus bell\" ringing). The Jackpot started at $5,000 and increased $1,000 every week it was not won. If successful, the couple left the show with the top prize. Otherwise, they continued on with the regular game.\n\n====Bonus Cash and Prize Stunt====\nFeatured on the daytime version. A lucky couple had a chance to win a bundle of cash and their choice of a new car or boat. To win, they had to successfully complete their Bonus Stunt. Like the original Bonus Stunt, the cash value started at $100, going up each time the stunt was not successfully completed. The largest cash bonus won on the daytime edition was $20,100 during its years on ABC.\n\n===Stunts===\nThe stunts performed on the show were mostly created by staff stunt writers Frank Wayne and Bob Howard. In the early days of the show, playwright [[Neil Simon]] was also a stunt writer. The stunts were usually aimed towards fun with difficulty being secondary. The stunts would usually be constructed out of common household props such as cardboard boxes, string, balloons, record players, dishes, cups, plates, cutlery, and balls of almost every type. As was the case with many other game shows during television's infancy, the budget was low.\n\nThe stunts performed varied widely, but there were some common themes. Most stunts in some way involved physical speed or dexterity. Contestants often had to balance something with some part of their body, or race back and forth on the stage (for example, releasing a balloon, running across the stage to do some task, and running back in time to catch the balloon before it floated too high). Often the challenge was some form of [[target practice]], in terms of throwing, rolling, bowling, etc.\n\nThe setup for the stunt was often designed to look easy but then have a complication or [[gimmick]] revealed. For example, Collyer would say \"All you have to do is stack four plates\", check the clock to see how much time they had to do it, and then add \"Oh, and one more thing...you can't use your hands\". Common twists included blindfolding one or both contestants, or telling them they could not use their hands (or feet or any body part that would be obvious to use for whatever the task was).\n\nThe other common element in the stunts was to get one of the contestants messy in some way often involving whipped cream, pancake batter, and such (usually limited to the husband of the couple). While it was not a part of every stunt, and sometimes it didn't even happen in an episode, it was common enough that when a couple brought a child on, Collyer would often ask what they thought the parents might have to do and the child would often respond \"get whipped cream in their face\". Many times the wife would be shown a task, be blindfolded, and then her husband would be quietly brought out and unknown to her she would be covering him with some sort of mess. When the mess was not hidden from the wife, Collyer would often jokingly tell the husband (who usually had a short haircut) that they would put a bathing cap on his head \"to keep your long hair out of your eyes\" before revealing what form of mess he would be involved with. Occasionally Collyer himself would get caught in the mess accidentally.\n\nTechnicality in the rules was not a major issue on the show. The goal was usually to make sure the contestants had fun. Collyer would often stop the clock in the middle of a stunt if the contestant(s) was struggling so he advised them on a better way to do the stunt. Often if a condition of the stunt was \"don't use your hands,\" Collyer would ignore the first use of hands and just warn the contestant. If the time limit was nearly up on a task, he would often give them a few moments extra, or tell them if they started before the clock ran out and succeeded in that attempt, he would count it. Sometimes if a contestant had come close enough (for example, if they had to stack cups and saucers without the pile falling over, and the contestant knocked the pile over while putting the last cup on top), he would give them the stunt if they did not have time to do it again. If there was a problem with a prop breaking or running out of a supply, such as balloons, Collyer would simply give the stunt to the couple, citing it as the show's fault. Similarly, on the messy stunts, since the goal was just to mess up the husband, the time limit was often unimportant and the clock would be stopped when Bud felt the husband was messy enough.\n\n===Prizes===\nPrizes varied depending on the era of the show and the sponsor at the time. During Sylvania's tenure as sponsor (which began in March 1951), consolation prizes for losing the $100 clock were usually a Sylvania radio.\n* $100 clock prizes included Michael C. Fina silverware sets, a collection of four Knapp-Monarch small kitchen appliances, or a [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] [[vacuum cleaner|upright]], among others.\n* $200 clock prizes included International-Harvester refrigerators, air conditioning units (usually in the summer), a [[Tappan (brand)|Tappan]] range/oven, a James dishwasher, [[Speed Queen]] washers and dryers (for some reason, they were only offered separately) and small Sylvania TVs. All of these prizes, except the Sylvania radio, were shown on \"art cards\" and not actually brought out on the show.\n* The Jackpot Prize during Sylvania's tenure was always a Sylvania [[television set]]. Sometimes a [[hi-fi]] stereo/phonograph (with \"famous surround sound\") was included with the television, and it was noted that the Jackpot Prize was \"worth more than $500\". A notable (and often pointed out) feature of Sylvania's TVs at the time was the \"halo light\", which was an illuminated \"frame\" around the image which was supposed to have made watching the image easier on the eyes, similar to [[Philips]]' \"AmbiLight\" feature on television sets today.\n\nThe sets, as was the style at the time, were freestanding pieces of furniture that sat on legs on the floor with a speaker mounted below the screen. Various models were given away over the years\u2014sometimes the same model several times in one episode, sometimes a different model each time the Jackpot was won in an episode. Roxanne (later Beverly) would pose with the TV which was revealed from behind a curtain in a small faux living room.\n\nThere were also various gifts given to the contestants just for appearing on the show. There was a Sylvania ''Beat the Clock'' home game produced which was given to contestants starting in the mid-50s. When it was novel, Collyer would open the box and explain that it would be fun for not just children but adults at parties, and he would point out the working clock and the instructions for stunts and all the props. Later in the run it would be brought out, shown and whisked away just as quickly. The boxes were reworked a few times, and there was a new edition released later in the run. Both versions were manufactured by Lowell Toy Mfg. Co. of New York, who produced a number of television-based home games at the time.\n\nWhen children were brought on the show, there were special gifts. Starting on September 6, 1952, girls brought on the show were given a Roxanne doll that was produced at the time. On October 11, 1952, the [[Buck Rogers]] Space Ranger Kit was debuted for boys. In the mid-50s, each child was given a camera kit.\n\nIf contestants were involved in a messy stunt, Roxanne (later Beverly) would come out and take a picture. Initially it wasn't made clear how the couple would get the photo (perhaps mailed to them), but later in the run, the camera would be given to the couple in addition to any their children might already have been given. Collyer would explain that when they developed the film, the first photo would be that of the husband/couple.\n\nFrom 1956 and for the rest of the show's run on CBS, the Jackpot Prizes usually consisted of a [[Magnavox]] Color TV, [[Fedders]] air conditioners (usually awarded as a pair), [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] washer & dryer pairs, and refrigerators, [[Hardwick (appliances)|Hardwick]] ranges, [[Whirpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] freezers, and Easy \"Combomatic\" combination washer-dryers.\n\n==1969\u20131974==\nOn September 15, 1969, ''Beat the Clock'' returned to television in five-day-a-week syndication. This series continued to air until September 20, 1974. For the first season (1969\u20131970), the show was taped at [[Helen Hayes Theatre|The Little Theatre]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City, sharing the stage with [[The Merv Griffin Show]] and [[The David Frost Show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eyesofageneration.com/the-little-theater-240-west-44th-street-in-midtown-manhattannow-known-as-th/?post_id=31118&comments=2&get=30&order=DESC|title=The Little Theater: 240 West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan \u2013 Eyes Of A Generation\u2026Television's Living History}}</ref> After that, taping moved to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] as a cost-saving measure. This was the only time Goodson-Todman taped a series in Canada that was not for a Canadian-specific audience. The show was broadcast by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Canada.\n\n[[Jack Narz]] hosted the first three seasons of the series before leaving and his announcer, [[Gene Wood]], replaced him for the remainder of the run.\n\nThe music for this version of ''Beat the Clock'' was played live on the organ by keyboardist and arranger [[Dick Hyman]].\n\n===Jack Narz (1969\u20131972)===\nIn early episodes, couples, now aided by a weekly celebrity guest, played for points simply by completing stunts. The first couple to reach 100 points won a prize package. This was subsequently changed to the couples receiving a prize every time they won, which was later replaced by the winning couple facing a \"cash board\" with \"BEAT THE CLOCK\" spelled out on three levels, each letter concealing a money amount: either $25 (4), $50 (5), $100 (2), or $200. The couple would agree on a letter, select it, and the winnings would be revealed.\n\nIn addition, if a couple completed a stunt in less than half the time, the remaining time would be used for awarding a cash bonus. Anywhere from $10 to $50 would be awarded for each time the stunt was completed in the time remaining.\n\nAt some point during the show, the celebrity would perform a \"Solo Stunt\" (which seemed to have supplanted the Bonus Stunt on the original show). The couples won $50 if they guessed correctly whether the star could beat the clock or vice versa. Towards the end of Narz' tenure as host, stunts would be replaced in the second half of the show with the celebrity playing a game of intuition with the couples, who would play for a cash prize that was divided among them.\n\nDuring this time, the show was syndicated through [[20th Century Fox Television]].  One curious aspect of this version of the show was that Narz' suit jackets sported an embroidered patch of the show's ''Beat The Clock'' logo sewn onto the left breast.  This practice was similar to hosts [[Jim Lange]] and [[Bob Eubanks]]' wearing logo patches from ''[[The Dating Game]]'' and ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' respectively, and also the scrambled \"mystery logo\" seen on Hugh Downs' (and later Bob Clayton's) blazer when they hosted [[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]].\n\n===Gene Wood (1972\u20131974)===\nJack Narz left the show in 1972. At the time, he made no announcement and gave no reason for his departure. In a 2007 [[Internet radio]] interview, Narz finally explained that the show's budget did not include his personal travel expenses. Narz had to pay for his travel, and the cost of airline fare between his Los Angeles home and Montreal became prohibitive. His travel costs were essentially equal to his earnings, and even a successful appeal to Mark Goodson for more money was not enough.\n\nAnnouncer Gene Wood hosted the show for the next two seasons. Wood had also been hosting a similar stunt game titled ''[[Anything You Can Do (game show)|Anything You Can Do]]'', a battle of the sexes competition which was also recorded in Canada. [[CFCF-TV]] Montreal staff announcer Nick Holenreich became the show's announcer (he had previously announced for a week during Narz's final season in which Wood was the celebrity guest). At this time, the show also changed syndicators to Firestone Syndication Services, which syndicated another Goodson-Todman show, ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', which had originally been hosted by Bud Collyer.\n\nThe show was now called ''The New Beat the Clock'' (although the logo still read simply \"Beat the Clock\"), and the set was refreshed with a new color scheme and a redesigned clock. Like his predecessor, Wood also wore suit jackets with the show's logo sewn on the pockets.\n\nThe only changes in the format were that couples were introduced separately and played two stunts, win or lose (a win still getting a trip to the Cash Board), and both couples competed simultaneously in a final stunt, with the winning couple receiving a prize. Celebrity guests were retained in the new format, once again aiding the contestants, and performing the Solo Stunt as well as \"co-judge\" with Wood in the final stunt of the day. Another throwback to the Collyer era (when the show was seen in the daytime) was the revival of \"Ladies' Day\", where women only (not counting the celebrity for that week) would play the game.\n\nDespite continued popularity on local stations in both daytime and [[Prime Time Access Rule|prime time access]] timeslots, Goodson-Todman decided to discontinue production of ''Beat the Clock'' in 1974 when CTV asked the company for half of the proceeds from advertisers awarding their wares as contestant consolation prizes. Wood returned to voice-over work, and went on to a 20-year career announcing [[Los Angeles]]-based shows for Goodson-Todman and occasionally other packagers.\n\n===Episode status===\nSome episodes of this series are intact and have aired on [[Game Show Network|GSN]]. Two episodes from the Narz era were aired in late 2005 to pay tribute to [[Bob Denver]] and [[Louis Nye]], both of whom had recently died. An episode featuring [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]] (Narz's brother) aired on June 11, 2007.\n\nIn January 2007, a Gene Wood episode aired which featured [[William Shatner]]. Another episode aired on October 22, 2007, featuring [[Dick Clark]]. At least three episodes were also aired featuring [[Richard Dawson]].\n\n==1979\u20131980==\nIn 1979, CBS elected to bring the series back as ''All-New Beat the Clock'' for its daytime schedule. Production moved to [[CBS Television City]], taping in Studio 31 and marking the only time a ''Beat the Clock'' series originated from Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shows\u2013CBS Television City|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows#|accessdate=July 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713152856/http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows|archivedate=July 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series premiered on September 17, 1979, at 10:00{{nbsp}}a.m., replacing reruns of ''[[All in the Family]]'' in the time period, preceding ''[[Whew!]]''. [[Monty Hall]], who had not hosted a game show [[Stefan Hatos-Monty Hall Productions|his company]] did not produce since he was host of Heatter-Quigley's ''[[Video Village]]'', was the emcee for the series while former host of the 1970s syndicated series, Jack Narz, served as his announcer and a series producer. The show faced competition from NBC's ''[[Card Sharks]]'' (ABC did not start programming until 11:00{{nbsp}}a.m.)\n\nThere were two theme songs used (both composed by [[Score Productions]]). The second one was performed live in the studio by a small band led by [[Arthur B. Rubinstein]].\n\nTwo couples, one usually a returning champion, competed against each other and the clock. The champion couple (or champion-designate if the previous episode had ended with a retiring champion couple) wore red sweaters while the opposing couple wore green.\n\n===Rounds 1 and 2===\nThe first two rounds began with the couples competing against each other in a stunt worth $500 for the winner. One stunt usually featured the women of the couples, while the other featured the men, though the other partner sometimes had to help as well. The stunts were conducted for 60 seconds and were either races against the clock to perform an objective or competitions to outscore the opponent in the stunt before the clock ran out. In the former case, the clock was run as a fail safe, and if neither couple managed to complete the stunt, the team furthest along won.\n\nHall would then bring the winning couple across the stage to compete in a stunt by themselves for an additional $500. After Hall described the stunt and what both partners had to do, the clock was set and the couple had to complete the stunt in the allotted time. Doing so won the $500, but failure to do so did not.\n\n===Bonus Shuffle===\nAfter the first two rounds, both teams squared off in a modified [[table shuffleboard]] game called the \"Bonus Shuffle\".\n\nThe teams took turns throwing pucks down the shuffleboard table. The team leading had the advantage of throwing three pucks and going first. If there was a tie, a coin was tossed with the winners going first and there were only two pucks per side. The table had eight stripes on it, and each stripe had a higher dollar amount on it. The first stripe was worth $300 and each subsequent stripe was worth $100 more, with the stripe at the very end of the table worth $1,000. There was just enough space in between the stripes where a puck could land and not score any money. Pucks had to remain on the table to count, and if a puck failed to reach the first stripe it was taken off the board and discarded. The teams were allowed to try to knock each other's pucks off the board if they so desired but did so at their own risk, as they could just as easily knock their own puck off the board or push a puck up the board and onto a higher value.\n\nThe team whose puck was furthest along on the board after all pucks had been thrown won the money attached to the space their puck was touching and became the day's champions. They then moved on to play the Bonus Stunt for ten times the amount of their Bonus Shuffle total. In the event of a tie, each team threw one puck. The first puck's landing spot was marked and the other team had to beat the mark to win.\n\n===Bonus Stunt===\nThe Bonus Stunt round was conducted the same way as the solo stunts were. Hall would give the objective of the Bonus Stunt to the champion couple, then the clock would be set and the couple had to complete the stunt before time ran out. If they did so, as previously mentioned, they won ten times their Bonus Shuffle score for a maximum of $10,000 and a new Bonus Stunt would be played on the next show. If a Bonus Stunt was played five consecutive times without a couple managing to complete it, the stunt would be replaced with a new one.\n\nCouples continued to appear until they were either defeated or surpassed $25,000 in total winnings. A team could win up to $13,000 in one day if they managed to win all four stunts in the main game, score $1,000 in the Bonus Shuffle, and win the Bonus Stunt.\n\n===''The All-New All-Star Beat The Clock''===\nOn November 5, 1979, the show switched to an all-celebrity format. The changes that were made included:\n* Celebrity pairs played for designated rooting sections of the audience which split the winnings. (Also, someone in \"the winning rooting section\" won a set of prizes, which were the \"consolation prizes\" in the non-celebrity part of the run.)\n* Both rooting sections could be seen on-camera.\n* Stunts in the first two rounds were only worth $250 for the rooting sections.\n* If the winning team completed the bonus stunt, $1,000 went to their rooting section while the remaining money went to their favorite charity (thus, the most money a celebrity team could win for their rooting section in a single day was $3,000 and a possible $9,000 to their charity).\n* Both star teams remained on the show for a week. The pairings stayed the same on four of the five days, with the teams changing colors (the red team on Monday and Thursday was the green team on Tuesday and Friday). On Wednesdays, the teams switched, although still one man and one woman per team.\n* In case of a tie going into the Bonus Shuffle, a coin toss determined who went first.\n* In the last two weeks of the run, after each head-to-head stunt, both teams got to perform the next stunt, with the losing team from the previous stunt going first. If both teams performed this stunt within the time limit, whoever did it faster got the $250.\n* The theme song was now an upbeat version of the first one used in its run (it was previously used going into and out of the commercials of the earlier episodes), and was performed live in the studio.\n\n===Episode status===\nThis series exists in its entirety. The Christmas episode with [[Ronnie Schell]], [[Joyce Bulifant]], [[Johnny Brown (actor)|Johnny Brown]], and [[Patti Deutsch]] has aired on GSN in the past during Christmas-themed marathons. The series aired on GSN between September 10, 2007, and September 2008 in a late Saturday and Sunday night slot but was pulled from the schedule after beginning the final week. On November 12, 2008, it returned to the GSN lineup weeknights at 2:00{{nbsp}}a.m., replacing ''[[Trivia Trap]]''. It last aired January 3, 2009.\n\n[[Buzzr]] has also carried the Hall version of ''Beat the Clock'' on a sporadic basis.\n\n==2002\u20132003==\nThis version, the show's previous appearance other than the ''[[Gameshow Marathon (U.S. TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'' special, aired daily from September 2, 2002, to September 4, 2003, on [[PAX TV]] (the first week of shows was called a \"preview week\"). Taped in [[Universal Studios Florida]], three couples competed in this version with no returning champions. The couples were distinguished by color\u2014red, blue, and gold.\n\n===Round 1===\nTo start the game, all three couples faced off in a stunt. The first couple to complete the stunt got 10 points and the advantage of having to play a 30-second solo stunt first, as well as the ability to assign the stunts to the other teams- prior to gameplay the couple was shown 3 items on a tray that represented the stunts themselves, picked one for themselves to play, and divided the other two among the remaining players.\n\nBefore the playing of each stunt, a two-part trivia question was asked. Answering it correctly gave the team 10 extra seconds to complete the stunt and both parts had to be answered correctly, one by each player, in order to get those 10 seconds. 10 points were given for completing the stunt with one additional point for each second remaining on the clock (for example, if a couple completed a stunt with three seconds remaining, they scored 13 points for the round).\n\n===Round 2===\nThe second round consisted of two parts. The first part was another face-off stunt, i.e. trying to throw a ring around a pole the other player is wearing on their head. In a stunt like this, the first place couple's ring tosser would be closest to their partner, the second place couple would be slightly further back, and the third place couple would be the furthest back (the first place couple was always given an advantage, with the second having less of one and the third the least). Play continued until two of the couples completed the stunt, with those two teams continuing on.\n\nThe two remaining couples were then shown the stunt they would have to attempt. After the stunt was described, another trivia question was asked. In this case, the female half of the couple was given the option to answer it, have her partner answer it, or pass it to the other team to make them answer. If the couple answered correctly they would be given control, but if they did not the opponents did. The two couples then bid down from a base time of two minutes to see who could complete the stunt in the fastest amount of time, and bidding continued until one team challenged the other to beat the clock. The stunt was then played, and if the challenged couple completed it they won the game and advanced to the bonus game. If they were not successful, the challenging couple won the game.\n\n===Bonus Round (\"The Swirling Whirlwind of Cash and Prizes\")===\nThe winning couple played the \"Swirling Whirlwind of Cash and Prizes\", which took place inside a machine similar to a [[vertical wind tunnel]]. $25,000 in cash was inside the machine, as well as several \"prize vouchers\" (coloured slips of paper with the names of prizes written on them). Several more vouchers would be tossed into the machine prior to the start of the round.\n\nOnce inside the machine, both players tried to grab as much money and prize vouchers as they could within a 1-minute time limit. There were three standing rules- both players could grab items but they had to be placed in a bag worn around the male partner's waist, they couldn't bend over and pick up anything off the floor (although they could kick items off the floor into the air), and once the buzzer sounded, they had to put their hands up and stop. Later in the run, several [[gold certificate]]s were added to the machine and if the couple picked one up, the cash they had grabbed would be doubled. (If the couple somehow picked up more than one, only one was counted.)\n\nThe \"swirling whirlwind\" was previously used in the bonus round of ''[[The Diamond Head Game]]'', a show hosted by [[Bob Eubanks]] in 1975.\n\n== 2018 ==\nOn October 12, 2017, [[Universal Kids]] announced that it had ordered a revival of ''Beat the Clock'' from FremantleMedia North America, which premiered on February 6, 2018. The new version, (taped in Los Angeles, making it the second version taped there) features children and adults competing as teams and was hosted by Paul Costabile.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/fremantlemedia-na-sells-two-game-shows-universal-kids/169285|title=FremantleMedia N.A.

There are three rounds of stunts. \n\nThe first round is worth $100/stunt and the second round is worth $150/stunt. The third and final round is a head-to-head challenge for $300 for a possible grand total of $550. Both teams get to keep the cash, but the team with the most money at the end of round three wins the game and goes on to try and Beat The Big Clock for over $2,000 if the losing team not win any money than they got consolation prize .  In the event of a tie, whoever completes the task first, or does the most tasks within the time limit in the head to head wins.  If neither teams complete the challenge and are still tied, whoever has the most money wins.\n\n===The Big Clock===\nThe winning team has 60 seconds to complete one final four-part stunt. Each part completed is worth $250, and completing all four parts wins the team $2,000, along with a $1,000 donation to a children's charity of the team's choice because paul always says that because they spread the love \nhere if not than the money they won earlier plus $250 they won from the stunts they did complete the donation Is not given to anyone who loses\n\n==International versions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|-\n!

The show was a creation of [[Mark Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman]] Productions.\n\nThe show began on radio as ''Time's A-Wastin''' in 1948, hosted by [[Bud Collyer]], and changed its name to ''Beat the Time'' on January 5, 1949. The show moved to television on the [[CBS]] nighttime schedule starting on March 23, 1950. On September 16, 1957, CBS premiered an afternoon version of the show as well, which ran for a year. The nighttime show was cancelled on February 16, 1958, and the afternoon program followed on September 12, 1958.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/54/mode/2up|accessdate=22 March 2020|pages=54-55}}</ref>\n\nSoon, the show moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] daytime schedule, and ran from October 13, 1958 to January 27, 1961. A brief revival aired on CBS from September 9, 1979 to February 1, 1980.<ref name=Daytime/>\n\nThe most recent revival premiered on [[Universal Kids]] on February 6, 2018.\n\n==1950\u20131961==\nThe first edition of ''Beat the Clock'' was a production of [[CBS]] and aired there until 1958. The show then moved to [[American Broadcasting Company]] where it stayed until 1961. [[Bud Collyer]] emceed the original series.\n\nContestants were required to perform tasks (called \"problems\" by Collyer) within a certain time limit which was counted down on a large 60-second [[clock]]. If they succeeded, they were said to have \"beaten the clock\"\u2014otherwise, \"the clock beat them\". The show had several sponsors over its run, with the most longstanding being the electronics company [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]].\n\n===On-air personalities===\nSubstitute hosts on the original version included Bill Hart (1951), [[John Reed King]] (1952), stunt creator [[Frank Wayne]] (1953), Bob Kennedy (1954), [[Win Elliot]] (1955), and [[Sonny Fox]], who became Collyer's permanent substitute from 1957 to 1960. Collyer was referred to in the introductions as \"America's number one clockwatcher\", and the fill-in hosts were each named \"America's number two clockwatcher\".\n[[File:Beat the Clock 1958.JPG|thumb|180px|Bud Collyer as the show's host, 1958.]]\nThe show had several female on-air assistants. The original hostess was [[Roxanne (model)|Roxanne]] (n\u00e9e Delores Evelyn Rosedale). Roxanne was replaced by [[Beverly Bentley]] in August 1955. Bentley's departure in 1956 coincided with Hazel Bishop's sponsorship and a period of having no main assistant (see production changes below). She reappeared as one of the models on the original version of ''[[The Price Is Right (1956 U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' for its entire run.\n\nThe announcer for the show's run on CBS was Bernard (\"Bern\") Bennett until 1958. In October 1957, ''Beat the Clock'' ran a contest inviting viewers to submit drawings of what Bennett, who was never shown on camera, might look like. Over 20,000 viewers participated, and winner Edward Darnell, of [[Columbus, Indiana]], was flown in to appear with Bennett on the December 2, 1957, show. When ''Beat the Clock'' moved to ABC, Dirk Fredericks became the announcer. Substitute announcers included Lee Vines, [[Bob Sheppard]], [[Hal Simms]], and Dick Noel.\n\n===Contestants===\nContestants were chosen from the studio audience and usually were married couples. Other pairs were engaged, dating, or were a familial relationship. Collyer would ask them general questions (usually including where they were from and how long they'd been married) and usually asked if they had children, their ages and genders. Sometimes the couple would bring children on the show. Collyer usually would talk to the children, asking them what they wanted to be when they grew up, or, if the kids were not at the show, to have their parents wave to them on TV. The husbands on the show usually wore a [[business suit]]. Collyer would often ask the husband to take off his coat for stunts to make it less cumbersome (there were hooks on the contestants' podium) or Collyer would hold the coat.\n\nOccasionally, if there was going to be a messy stunt, the husband would come out dressed in a plastic jumpsuit. Similarly, wives would sometimes play in their \"street clothes\", but sometimes the women would appear in a jumpsuit because their own clothing might be too cumbersome or perhaps fragile. The women's jumpsuits, unlike the men's, which were rather plain, were patterned to look like a pair of [[overalls]] with a collared [[blouse]] underneath. The women would also often be issued running shoes instead of their own [[high heels]].\n\n===Game format===\n\n====Main Game====\nOne couple competed against the clock to win a prize in stunts that required one or both members of the couple. The stunt was described and the time limit was set on a giant onstage clock. The time limit was always a multiple of 5 seconds, usually at least 30 seconds. At one point Collyer said that a 55-second time limit was the maximum, but later on, stunts occasionally had 60-second limits. On the primetime edition, the first stunt was called the $100 clock. If the couple beat the $100 clock, they moved on to the $200 clock and the same rules applied. If they failed to beat the $100 clock, they received a consolation prize worth less than $100. If they failed to beat the $200 clock, they got a prize worth more than $100. On the daytime versions, couples continued playing as long as they kept beating the clock.\n\n====Jackpot Clock====\nOn the primetime version, if the couple beat the $200 clock, the wife would play the jackpot clock in which the words of a famous saying or quote were scrambled up on a magnetic board and that phrase had to be unscrambled in 20 seconds or less. If successful, then the couple won the Jackpot Prize. If not, they got a prize worth more than $200. Occasionally, when the wife of the couple did not speak English very well, the husband was allowed to perform the jackpot clock.\n\nThe jackpot clock and the Bonus Stunt would provide the templates for the traditional quiz show bonus round, which would become a TV staple, starting in 1950 with the bonus question round on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]''.\n\nIn the show's earliest set design in available episodes, there was a round display near the contestants mirroring the clock. This display had three rings of light like a target. The outer ring would light during the $100 clock, the middle ring for the $200 clock, and the center circle would light during the jackpot clock. This feature was removed in later set designs.\n\n====Bonus Stunt====\nSome time during every episode (between normal stunts), a bell would sound. The couple playing at the time would attempt the Bonus Stunt for the Bonus Prize that started at $100 in cash. If the stunt was not beaten, it would be attempted the next week with $100 added to the prize. When it was beaten, it was retired from the show and a new Bonus Stunt began the next week at $100. The bonus (as the name suggests) did not affect the regular game, and win or lose the couple continued the regular clocks wherever they left off. Beginning in August 1954, the starting amount for each Bonus Stunt was raised to $500, still increasing $100 each week.\n\nBonus Stunts were harder than the usual $100 and $200 clocks and sometimes reached $2,000 and even $3,000 on rare occasions. The first time the Bonus reached $1,000 was on February 28, 1953, when it was won for that amount. In 1956, the Bonus Stunt was replaced by the Super Bonus.\n\nThere was usually a special technique for performing the stunt that had to be figured out, but even then, the stunt was usually difficult enough to require some skill or luck once the technique was realized. Viewers would usually try to figure it out and after a few weeks on the air viewers would often get it (sometimes Collyer would remark that viewers had been writing in and he would give certain dimensions of the props used so viewers could try to figure it out at home).\n\nUsually either contestants themselves would start appearing on the show with the technique in mind, or audience members would shout it out to try to help them. A stunt would usually take a few weeks before the audience realized the technique, and then a few more weeks before someone was able to properly employ it.\n\n====Super Bonus Stunt====\nIn response to the big money prizes on other networks' game shows, CBS talked Mark Goodson into increasing the stakes on ''Beat The Clock''. Ultimately the plan was unsuccessful as the ratings never did improve much, perhaps leading to the end of the Super Bonus. Starting on February 25, 1956, after the last regular Bonus Stunt had been won, it was replaced by the super bonus which started at $10,000 and went up by $1,000 every time a couple failed to beat the clock. Unlike with the regular bonus stunt and the \"Big Cash Bonus Stunt\" that followed it, the Super Bonus was attempted by every couple who qualified by beating the $200 clock. Originally the stunt was played at the end of the show by each couple that qualified, and \"because of the high prize value\" a special timing machine made by the [[Longines]] company was used, which was touted as the most accurate portable timer available. Probably realizing that seeing the same stunt a few times in a row was a bit boring, they moved the Super Bonus right after the $200 clock and before the jackpot clock on March 17, dropping the Longines timer.\n\nPartway through the run of the second Super Bonus, a rolling desk/table with dollar value of the bonus printed on it was used to roll out the props for the stunt. This carried over to the Big Cash Bonus Stunt. It is notable that in the earliest surviving episodes from 1952 that air, the original bonus had a similar desk with the value of the bonus on it. The desk was done away with for several years until the idea was reused in 1956.\n\n====Big Cash Bonus Stunt====\nStarting on September 22, 1956, the bonus reverted to the original Bonus Stunt format (attempted once per episode by whatever couple heard the \"bonus bell\" ringing). The Jackpot started at $5,000 and increased $1,000 every week it was not won. If successful, the couple left the show with the top prize. Otherwise, they continued on with the regular game.\n\n====Bonus Cash and Prize Stunt====\nFeatured on the daytime version. A lucky couple had a chance to win a bundle of cash and their choice of a new car or boat. To win, they had to successfully complete their Bonus Stunt. Like the original Bonus Stunt, the cash value started at $100, going up each time the stunt was not successfully completed. The largest cash bonus won on the daytime edition was $20,100 during its years on ABC.\n\n===Stunts===\nThe stunts performed on the show were mostly created by staff stunt writers Frank Wayne and Bob Howard. In the early days of the show, playwright [[Neil Simon]] was also a stunt writer. The stunts were usually aimed towards fun with difficulty being secondary. The stunts would usually be constructed out of common household props such as cardboard boxes, string, balloons, record players, dishes, cups, plates, cutlery, and balls of almost every type. As was the case with many other game shows during television's infancy, the budget was low.\n\nThe stunts performed varied widely, but there were some common themes. Most stunts in some way involved physical speed or dexterity. Contestants often had to balance something with some part of their body, or race back and forth on the stage (for example, releasing a balloon, running across the stage to do some task, and running back in time to catch the balloon before it floated too high). Often the challenge was some form of [[target practice]], in terms of throwing, rolling, bowling, etc.\n\nThe setup for the stunt was often designed to look easy but then have a complication or [[gimmick]] revealed. For example, Collyer would say \"All you have to do is stack four plates\", check the clock to see how much time they had to do it, and then add \"Oh, and one more thing...you can't use your hands\". Common twists included blindfolding one or both contestants, or telling them they could not use their hands (or feet or any body part that would be obvious to use for whatever the task was).\n\nThe other common element in the stunts was to get one of the contestants messy in some way often involving whipped cream, pancake batter, and such (usually limited to the husband of the couple). While it was not a part of every stunt, and sometimes it didn't even happen in an episode, it was common enough that when a couple brought a child on, Collyer would often ask what they thought the parents might have to do and the child would often respond \"get whipped cream in their face\". Many times the wife would be shown a task, be blindfolded, and then her husband would be quietly brought out and unknown to her she would be covering him with some sort of mess. When the mess was not hidden from the wife, Collyer would often jokingly tell the husband (who usually had a short haircut) that they would put a bathing cap on his head \"to keep your long hair out of your eyes\" before revealing what form of mess he would be involved with. Occasionally Collyer himself would get caught in the mess accidentally.\n\nTechnicality in the rules was not a major issue on the show. The goal was usually to make sure the contestants had fun. Collyer would often stop the clock in the middle of a stunt if the contestant(s) was struggling so he advised them on a better way to do the stunt. Often if a condition of the stunt was \"don't use your hands,\" Collyer would ignore the first use of hands and just warn the contestant. If the time limit was nearly up on a task, he would often give them a few moments extra, or tell them if they started before the clock ran out and succeeded in that attempt, he would count it. Sometimes if a contestant had come close enough (for example, if they had to stack cups and saucers without the pile falling over, and the contestant knocked the pile over while putting the last cup on top), he would give them the stunt if they did not have time to do it again. If there was a problem with a prop breaking or running out of a supply, such as balloons, Collyer would simply give the stunt to the couple, citing it as the show's fault. Similarly, on the messy stunts, since the goal was just to mess up the husband, the time limit was often unimportant and the clock would be stopped when Bud felt the husband was messy enough.\n\n===Prizes===\nPrizes varied depending on the era of the show and the sponsor at the time. During Sylvania's tenure as sponsor (which began in March 1951), consolation prizes for losing the $100 clock were usually a Sylvania radio.\n* $100 clock prizes included Michael C. Fina silverware sets, a collection of four Knapp-Monarch small kitchen appliances, or a [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] [[vacuum cleaner|upright]], among others.\n* $200 clock prizes included International-Harvester refrigerators, air conditioning units (usually in the summer), a [[Tappan (brand)|Tappan]] range/oven, a James dishwasher, [[Speed Queen]] washers and dryers (for some reason, they were only offered separately) and small Sylvania TVs. All of these prizes, except the Sylvania radio, were shown on \"art cards\" and not actually brought out on the show.\n* The Jackpot Prize during Sylvania's tenure was always a Sylvania [[television set]]. Sometimes a [[hi-fi]] stereo/phonograph (with \"famous surround sound\") was included with the television, and it was noted that the Jackpot Prize was \"worth more than $500\". A notable (and often pointed out) feature of Sylvania's TVs at the time was the \"halo light\", which was an illuminated \"frame\" around the image which was supposed to have made watching the image easier on the eyes, similar to [[Philips]]' \"AmbiLight\" feature on television sets today.\n\nThe sets, as was the style at the time, were freestanding pieces of furniture that sat on legs on the floor with a speaker mounted below the screen. Various models were given away over the years\u2014sometimes the same model several times in one episode, sometimes a different model each time the Jackpot was won in an episode. Roxanne (later Beverly) would pose with the TV which was revealed from behind a curtain in a small faux living room.\n\nThere were also various gifts given to the contestants just for appearing on the show. There was a Sylvania ''Beat the Clock'' home game produced which was given to contestants starting in the mid-50s. When it was novel, Collyer would open the box and explain that it would be fun for not just children but adults at parties, and he would point out the working clock and the instructions for stunts and all the props. Later in the run it would be brought out, shown and whisked away just as quickly. The boxes were reworked a few times, and there was a new edition released later in the run. Both versions were manufactured by Lowell Toy Mfg. Co. of New York, who produced a number of television-based home games at the time.\n\nWhen children were brought on the show, there were special gifts. Starting on September 6, 1952, girls brought on the show were given a Roxanne doll that was produced at the time. On October 11, 1952, the [[Buck Rogers]] Space Ranger Kit was debuted for boys. In the mid-50s, each child was given a camera kit.\n\nIf contestants were involved in a messy stunt, Roxanne (later Beverly) would come out and take a picture. Initially it wasn't made clear how the couple would get the photo (perhaps mailed to them), but later in the run, the camera would be given to the couple in addition to any their children might already have been given. Collyer would explain that when they developed the film, the first photo would be that of the husband/couple.\n\nFrom 1956 and for the rest of the show's run on CBS, the Jackpot Prizes usually consisted of a [[Magnavox]] Color TV, [[Fedders]] air conditioners (usually awarded as a pair), [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] washer & dryer pairs, and refrigerators, [[Hardwick (appliances)|Hardwick]] ranges, [[Whirpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] freezers, and Easy \"Combomatic\" combination washer-dryers.\n\n==1969\u20131974==\nOn September 15, 1969, ''Beat the Clock'' returned to television in five-day-a-week syndication. This series continued to air until September 20, 1974. For the first season (1969\u20131970), the show was taped at [[Helen Hayes Theatre|The Little Theatre]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City, sharing the stage with [[The Merv Griffin Show]] and [[The David Frost Show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eyesofageneration.com/the-little-theater-240-west-44th-street-in-midtown-manhattannow-known-as-th/?post_id=31118&comments=2&get=30&order=DESC|title=The Little Theater: 240 West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan \u2013 Eyes Of A Generation\u2026Television's Living History}}</ref> After that, taping moved to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] as a cost-saving measure. This was the only time Goodson-Todman taped a series in Canada that was not for a Canadian-specific audience. The show was broadcast by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Canada.\n\n[[Jack Narz]] hosted the first three seasons of the series before leaving and his announcer, [[Gene Wood]], replaced him for the remainder of the run.\n\nThe music for this version of ''Beat the Clock'' was played live on the organ by keyboardist and arranger [[Dick Hyman]].\n\n===Jack Narz (1969\u20131972)===\nIn early episodes, couples, now aided by a weekly celebrity guest, played for points simply by completing stunts. The first couple to reach 100 points won a prize package. This was subsequently changed to the couples receiving a prize every time they won, which was later replaced by the winning couple facing a \"cash board\" with \"BEAT THE CLOCK\" spelled out on three levels, each letter concealing a money amount: either $25 (4), $50 (5), $100 (2), or $200. The couple would agree on a letter, select it, and the winnings would be revealed.\n\nIn addition, if a couple completed a stunt in less than half the time, the remaining time would be used for awarding a cash bonus. Anywhere from $10 to $50 would be awarded for each time the stunt was completed in the time remaining.\n\nAt some point during the show, the celebrity would perform a \"Solo Stunt\" (which seemed to have supplanted the Bonus Stunt on the original show). The couples won $50 if they guessed correctly whether the star could beat the clock or vice versa. Towards the end of Narz' tenure as host, stunts would be replaced in the second half of the show with the celebrity playing a game of intuition with the couples, who would play for a cash prize that was divided among them.\n\nDuring this time, the show was syndicated through [[20th Century Fox Television]].  One curious aspect of this version of the show was that Narz' suit jackets sported an embroidered patch of the show's ''Beat The Clock'' logo sewn onto the left breast.  This practice was similar to hosts [[Jim Lange]] and [[Bob Eubanks]]' wearing logo patches from ''[[The Dating Game]]'' and ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' respectively, and also the scrambled \"mystery logo\" seen on Hugh Downs' (and later Bob Clayton's) blazer when they hosted [[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]].\n\n===Gene Wood (1972\u20131974)===\nJack Narz left the show in 1972. At the time, he made no announcement and gave no reason for his departure. In a 2007 [[Internet radio]] interview, Narz finally explained that the show's budget did not include his personal travel expenses. Narz had to pay for his travel, and the cost of airline fare between his Los Angeles home and Montreal became prohibitive. His travel costs were essentially equal to his earnings, and even a successful appeal to Mark Goodson for more money was not enough.\n\nAnnouncer Gene Wood hosted the show for the next two seasons. Wood had also been hosting a similar stunt game titled ''[[Anything You Can Do (game show)|Anything You Can Do]]'', a battle of the sexes competition which was also recorded in Canada. [[CFCF-TV]] Montreal staff announcer Nick Holenreich became the show's announcer (he had previously announced for a week during Narz's final season in which Wood was the celebrity guest). At this time, the show also changed syndicators to Firestone Syndication Services, which syndicated another Goodson-Todman show, ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', which had originally been hosted by Bud Collyer.\n\nThe show was now called ''The New Beat the Clock'' (although the logo still read simply \"Beat the Clock\"), and the set was refreshed with a new color scheme and a redesigned clock. Like his predecessor, Wood also wore suit jackets with the show's logo sewn on the pockets.\n\nThe only changes in the format were that couples were introduced separately and played two stunts, win or lose (a win still getting a trip to the Cash Board), and both couples competed simultaneously in a final stunt, with the winning couple receiving a prize. Celebrity guests were retained in the new format, once again aiding the contestants, and performing the Solo Stunt as well as \"co-judge\" with Wood in the final stunt of the day. Another throwback to the Collyer era (when the show was seen in the daytime) was the revival of \"Ladies' Day\", where women only (not counting the celebrity for that week) would play the game.\n\nDespite continued popularity on local stations in both daytime and [[Prime Time Access Rule|prime time access]] timeslots, Goodson-Todman decided to discontinue production of ''Beat the Clock'' in 1974 when CTV asked the company for half of the proceeds from advertisers awarding their wares as contestant consolation prizes. Wood returned to voice-over work, and went on to a 20-year career announcing [[Los Angeles]]-based shows for Goodson-Todman and occasionally other packagers.\n\n===Episode status===\nSome episodes of this series are intact and have aired on [[Game Show Network|GSN]]. Two episodes from the Narz era were aired in late 2005 to pay tribute to [[Bob Denver]] and [[Louis Nye]], both of whom had recently died. An episode featuring [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]] (Narz's brother) aired on June 11, 2007.\n\nIn January 2007, a Gene Wood episode aired which featured [[William Shatner]]. Another episode aired on October 22, 2007, featuring [[Dick Clark]]. At least three episodes were also aired featuring [[Richard Dawson]].\n\n==1979\u20131980==\nIn 1979, CBS elected to bring the series back as ''All-New Beat the Clock'' for its daytime schedule. Production moved to [[CBS Television City]], taping in Studio 31 and marking the only time a ''Beat the Clock'' series originated from Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shows\u2013CBS Television City|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows#|accessdate=July 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713152856/http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows|archivedate=July 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series premiered on September 17, 1979, at 10:00{{nbsp}}a.m., replacing reruns of ''[[All in the Family]]'' in the time period, preceding ''[[Whew!]]''. [[Monty Hall]], who had not hosted a game show [[Stefan Hatos-Monty Hall Productions|his company]] did not produce since he was host of Heatter-Quigley's ''[[Video Village]]'', was the emcee for the series while former host of the 1970s syndicated series, Jack Narz, served as his announcer and a series producer. The show faced competition from NBC's ''[[Card Sharks]]'' (ABC did not start programming until 11:00{{nbsp}}a.m.)\n\nThere were two theme songs used (both composed by [[Score Productions]]). The second one was performed live in the studio by a small band led by [[Arthur B. Rubinstein]].\n\nTwo couples, one usually a returning champion, competed against each other and the clock. The champion couple (or champion-designate if the previous episode had ended with a retiring champion couple) wore red sweaters while the opposing couple wore green.\n\n===Rounds 1 and 2===\nThe first two rounds began with the couples competing against each other in a stunt worth $500 for the winner. One stunt usually featured the women of the couples, while the other featured the men, though the other partner sometimes had to help as well. The stunts were conducted for 60 seconds and were either races against the clock to perform an objective or competitions to outscore the opponent in the stunt before the clock ran out. In the former case, the clock was run as a fail safe, and if neither couple managed to complete the stunt, the team furthest along won.\n\nHall would then bring the winning couple across the stage to compete in a stunt by themselves for an additional $500. After Hall described the stunt and what both partners had to do, the clock was set and the couple had to complete the stunt in the allotted time. Doing so won the $500, but failure to do so did not.\n\n===Bonus Shuffle===\nAfter the first two rounds, both teams squared off in a modified [[table shuffleboard]] game called the \"Bonus Shuffle\".\n\nThe teams took turns throwing pucks down the shuffleboard table. The team leading had the advantage of throwing three pucks and going first. If there was a tie, a coin was tossed with the winners going first and there were only two pucks per side. The table had eight stripes on it, and each stripe had a higher dollar amount on it. The first stripe was worth $300 and each subsequent stripe was worth $100 more, with the stripe at the very end of the table worth $1,000. There was just enough space in between the stripes where a puck could land and not score any money. Pucks had to remain on the table to count, and if a puck failed to reach the first stripe it was taken off the board and discarded. The teams were allowed to try to knock each other's pucks off the board if they so desired but did so at their own risk, as they could just as easily knock their own puck off the board or push a puck up the board and onto a higher value.\n\nThe team whose puck was furthest along on the board after all pucks had been thrown won the money attached to the space their puck was touching and became the day's champions. They then moved on to play the Bonus Stunt for ten times the amount of their Bonus Shuffle total. In the event of a tie, each team threw one puck. The first puck's landing spot was marked and the other team had to beat the mark to win.\n\n===Bonus Stunt===\nThe Bonus Stunt round was conducted the same way as the solo stunts were. Hall would give the objective of the Bonus Stunt to the champion couple, then the clock would be set and the couple had to complete the stunt before time ran out. If they did so, as previously mentioned, they won ten times their Bonus Shuffle score for a maximum of $10,000 and a new Bonus Stunt would be played on the next show. If a Bonus Stunt was played five consecutive times without a couple managing to complete it, the stunt would be replaced with a new one.\n\nCouples continued to appear until they were either defeated or surpassed $25,000 in total winnings. A team could win up to $13,000 in one day if they managed to win all four stunts in the main game, score $1,000 in the Bonus Shuffle, and win the Bonus Stunt.\n\n===''The All-New All-Star Beat The Clock''===\nOn November 5, 1979, the show switched to an all-celebrity format. The changes that were made included:\n* Celebrity pairs played for designated rooting sections of the audience which split the winnings. (Also, someone in \"the winning rooting section\" won a set of prizes, which were the \"consolation prizes\" in the non-celebrity part of the run.)\n* Both rooting sections could be seen on-camera.\n* Stunts in the first two rounds were only worth $250 for the rooting sections.\n* If the winning team completed the bonus stunt, $1,000 went to their rooting section while the remaining money went to their favorite charity (thus, the most money a celebrity team could win for their rooting section in a single day was $3,000 and a possible $9,000 to their charity).\n* Both star teams remained on the show for a week. The pairings stayed the same on four of the five days, with the teams changing colors (the red team on Monday and Thursday was the green team on Tuesday and Friday). On Wednesdays, the teams switched, although still one man and one woman per team.\n* In case of a tie going into the Bonus Shuffle, a coin toss determined who went first.\n* In the last two weeks of the run, after each head-to-head stunt, both teams got to perform the next stunt, with the losing team from the previous stunt going first. If both teams performed this stunt within the time limit, whoever did it faster got the $250.\n* The theme song was now an upbeat version of the first one used in its run (it was previously used going into and out of the commercials of the earlier episodes), and was performed live in the studio.\n\n===Episode status===\nThis series exists in its entirety. The Christmas episode with [[Ronnie Schell]], [[Joyce Bulifant]], [[Johnny Brown (actor)|Johnny Brown]], and [[Patti Deutsch]] has aired on GSN in the past during Christmas-themed marathons. The series aired on GSN between September 10, 2007, and September 2008 in a late Saturday and Sunday night slot but was pulled from the schedule after beginning the final week. On November 12, 2008, it returned to the GSN lineup weeknights at 2:00{{nbsp}}a.m., replacing ''[[Trivia Trap]]''. It last aired January 3, 2009.\n\n[[Buzzr]] has also carried the Hall version of ''Beat the Clock'' on a sporadic basis.\n\n==2002\u20132003==\nThis version, the show's previous appearance other than the ''[[Gameshow Marathon (U.S. TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'' special, aired daily from September 2, 2002, to September 4, 2003, on [[PAX TV]] (the first week of shows was called a \"preview week\"). Taped in [[Universal Studios Florida]], three couples competed in this version with no returning champions. The couples were distinguished by color\u2014red, blue, and gold.\n\n===Round 1===\nTo start the game, all three couples faced off in a stunt. The first couple to complete the stunt got 10 points and the advantage of having to play a 30-second solo stunt first, as well as the ability to assign the stunts to the other teams- prior to gameplay the couple was shown 3 items on a tray that represented the stunts themselves, picked one for themselves to play, and divided the other two among the remaining players.\n\nBefore the playing of each stunt, a two-part trivia question was asked. Answering it correctly gave the team 10 extra seconds to complete the stunt and both parts had to be answered correctly, one by each player, in order to get those 10 seconds. 10 points were given for completing the stunt with one additional point for each second remaining on the clock (for example, if a couple completed a stunt with three seconds remaining, they scored 13 points for the round).\n\n===Round 2===\nThe second round consisted of two parts. The first part was another face-off stunt, i.e. trying to throw a ring around a pole the other player is wearing on their head. In a stunt like this, the first place couple's ring tosser would be closest to their partner, the second place couple would be slightly further back, and the third place couple would be the furthest back (the first place couple was always given an advantage, with the second having less of one and the third the least). Play continued until two of the couples completed the stunt, with those two teams continuing on.\n\nThe two remaining couples were then shown the stunt they would have to attempt. After the stunt was described, another trivia question was asked. In this case, the female half of the couple was given the option to answer it, have her partner answer it, or pass it to the other team to make them answer. If the couple answered correctly they would be given control, but if they did not the opponents did. The two couples then bid down from a base time of two minutes to see who could complete the stunt in the fastest amount of time, and bidding continued until one team challenged the other to beat the clock. The stunt was then played, and if the challenged couple completed it they won the game and advanced to the bonus game. If they were not successful, the challenging couple won the game.\n\n===Bonus Round (\"The Swirling Whirlwind of Cash and Prizes\")===\nThe winning couple played the \"Swirling Whirlwind of Cash and Prizes\", which took place inside a machine similar to a [[vertical wind tunnel]]. $25,000 in cash was inside the machine, as well as several \"prize vouchers\" (coloured slips of paper with the names of prizes written on them). Several more vouchers would be tossed into the machine prior to the start of the round.\n\nOnce inside the machine, both players tried to grab as much money and prize vouchers as they could within a 1-minute time limit. There were three standing rules- both players could grab items but they had to be placed in a bag worn around the male partner's waist, they couldn't bend over and pick up anything off the floor (although they could kick items off the floor into the air), and once the buzzer sounded, they had to put their hands up and stop. Later in the run, several [[gold certificate]]s were added to the machine and if the couple picked one up, the cash they had grabbed would be doubled.

The third and final round is a head-to-head challenge for $300 for a possible grand total of $550. Both teams get to keep the cash, but the team with the most money at the end of round three wins the game and goes on to try and Beat The Big Clock for over $2,000 if the losing team not win any money than they got consolation prize .

It was a major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the [[First Balkan War]], and revolved around the [[Giannitsa|Yenidje]] fortified position, which formed the last line of defense before the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]].\n\nThe rough and swampy terrain surrounding Yenidje significantly complicated the advance of the Greek army, most notably its artillery. In the early morning of 20 October, an infantry charge by the Greek 9th Evzone Battalion caused the Greek army to gain momentum, leading to the collapse of the entire western wing of the Ottomans. Ottoman morale plunged and the bulk of the defenders began fleeing two hours later. The Greek victory at Yenidje opened the way for the capture of Thessaloniki and the surrender of its garrison, helping shape the modern map of Greece.\n\n==Background==\nThe disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. [[Georgios Theotokis]] was the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[Table of organization|table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by re-arming and re-training the military, including extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchase of new weapons, and the recall of [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} \n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912, fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans declared mobilization on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October, with the latter declaring [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nThe [[Army of Thessaly]] crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked [[Elassona]], resulting in an Ottoman withdrawal towards Sarandaporo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} At 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its [[Battle of Sarantaporo|assault]] on Sarandaporo. The [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st]], [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd]] and [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Divisions]] attacked the Ottoman main line frontally. In the meantime, the cavalry brigade, [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th]] and [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Divisions]] conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The Konstantinopoulos [[Evzone]] detachment struck from the east of the pass. {{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Division's seizure of Porta Pass, panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers began fleeing and abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division marched into [[Servia, Greece|Servia]]{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}, while the Greek cavalry entered [[Kozani]] unopposed the following day.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; a day later King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} \nThe Ottomans fought a number of small scale delaying actions at Kolokouri, Tripotamos and Perdika, the Greek army nevertheless continued its advance taking Veroia and [[Katerini]] on 16 October. Between 17 and 18 October, the Greek general command forwarded its troops to the Veroia-[[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] plain.\n{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=293\u2013294}} \n\nAfter their defeat at Sarandaporo, the Ottomans augmented the remnants of [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]]'s force with fresh reinforcements. Two divisions from east Macedonia, one reserve division from Asia Minor and one reserve division from Thessaloniki; bringing the total Ottoman forces in the area to 25,000 men and 36 artillery pieces.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} The Ottomans chose to organize their main defensive line at [[Giannitsa|Yenidje]] either because of the town's religious importance for Macedonia's Muslim population or because they did not wish to fight too close to Thessaloniki.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|p=266}} The Ottomans dug their trenches at a {{convert|130|meter|foot|sigfig=1}} high hill which overlooked the plain west of the town. The hill was surrounded by two rough streams, its southern approaches were covered by the swampy [[Giannitsa Lake]] while the slopes of [[Mount Paiko]] complicated any potential enveloping maneuver from the north.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} On the eastern approaches to Yenidje, the Ottomans reinforced the garrisons guarding the bridges across [[Loudias River]], the rail line at [[Platy, Imathia|Platy]] and Gida.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=81}}\n\nOn 18 October, Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] ordered the Greek army to advance towards Yenidje despite receiving conflicting intelligence reports regarding the disposition of the enemy troops.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} The 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions marched along the same route towards  Tsaousli and Tsekre respectively, both located north-east of Yenidje. The 1st Greek Division acted as the army's [[rearguard]]. The 4th Division headed towards Yenidje from the north-west, while the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Division]] circumvented the city further to west, intending to capture Nedir. The [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Division]] and the cavalry brigade covered the right flank of the army by advancing towards Gida; while the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment was ordered to seize [[Trikala, Imathia|Trikala]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=81\u201382}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:TiradoresGriegosEnElLagoYeniye--balkancockpitpol00pric 0091.png|thumb|Greek soldiers at the lake during the battle]]\n[[File:Greek infantry Giannitsa 1912.jpg|thumb|Greek infantry charge]]\n\nThe first shots were fired in the early morning of 19 October, the advance guards of the 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions pushed back the Turks at Burgas. Upon reaching the bridge across Balitzas river, the two divisions became the target of heavy shelling from the hills surrounding Yenidje. The 4th and 6th Divisions likewise halted their advance, after being repulsed by massed rifle fire.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} The Greek army command arrived at the battlefield at noon, in order to assess the situation and issue new orders. The 2nd and 3rd Divisions were to force their way across the bridge, conducting a frontal attack on the main body of the Ottoman forces behind it. The 4th and 6th Divisions conducted a flanking maneuver from the west, in the meantime the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment and the cavalry brigade rushed towards Loudias; thus creating two fronts on either side of the Giannitsa Lake.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=82\u201383}}\n\nThe Greek artillery's shelling was inaccurate as only a single battery managed to establish itself at a distance of {{convert|4.5|km|miles|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches, since the ground was swampy and unstable. This caused the 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions to significantly slow down their advance, however by nightfall, they managed to establish a large bridgehead across Gramos river which flows into Giannitsa Lake from the north.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} Contrary to the orders they had received the 7th Division and the cavalry brigade encamped at Gida upon reaching it, while the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment likewise failed to cross Loudias after failing to locate a bridge. The 4th and 6th Greek Divisions progressed steadily on the western edge of the battlefield, crushing two counter-attacks and forcing the Ottomans to move their headquarters further back.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=83\u201384}}\n\nAt 8 a.m., 20 October, an infantry charge by the 9th Evzone Battalion of the 4th Greek Division captured an Ottoman battery. The 4th Greek Division used the momentum it had gained to push back the entire western wing of the Ottomans. The 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions made headway against their opponents, reaching the edge of the city{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=84}} and launching a bayonet attack on the Ottomans just as the 4th Greek Division arrived from the west. At 10 a.m., the Ottomans broke into a disorganized retreat, most fleeing towards Thessaloniki and [[Star Dojran|Doiran]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|p=270}}  The latter were detained by a Serbian cavalry unit that was advancing towards the [[Axios]] valley. Crown Prince Constantine ordered a single regiment of the 2nd Greek Division to chase the retreating Ottomans along the road to Thessaloniki, but it proved to be too narrow for an effective pursuit.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=85}}\n\nAt the same time a force of 3,000 Ottomans struck the 7th Greek Division at Gida, as it lingered in the area.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} The Greeks held their ground and immediately went on the offensive, disobeying orders once again, they limited themselves to establishing a bridgehead at Kirtzalar instead of crossing Axios. The Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment managed to cross Loudias by midday. However since the engineers of the 7th Division and the cavalry brigade failed to arrive on time, it was unable to reach Axios and block its bridges; enabling many Ottomans to flee.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nGreek casualties in the battle of Yenidje numbered 188 killed and 785 wounded. While the Ottomans lost over 250 killed, over 1,000 wounded, 200 men captured {{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=222}}, 2 flags lost, 11 to 14 field artillery pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=222}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} Following the capture of Yenidje, Crown Prince Constantine allowed the bulk of the Army of Thessaly to rest for three days after fifteen days of continuous fighting. All while, Greek engineering units began repairing the bridges across Axios that the Ottomans had previously destroyed.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=295\u2013296}} In the meantime, the 5th Greek Division continued its march towards [[Bitola|Monastiri]] until it was [[Battle of Sorovich|ambushed and defeated]] outside Sorovich on 21 October. The battle of Sorovich perplexed Constantine and made him hesitate just as the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] seemed to be within his grasp. Citing Greek intelligence agents within the Bulgarian capital that the latter had taken [[Serres]] and were rapidly approaching Thessaloniki, a vexed Eleftherios Venizelos repeatedly urged Constantine and King George I to act.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=90\u201392, 66}} On 25 October, the Army of Thessaly finally crossed Axios, reaching the Tekeli-Bathylakkos-Gourdino line.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=94}}\n\nOn the same day, Constantine received a delegation consisting of the ambassadors of the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Great Powers]] to Thessaloniki and Ottoman general Sefik Pasha. Hasan Tahsin Pasha offered to surrender the city without a fight and in return requested that Thessaloniki's garrison could retain its weapons and retreat to [[Megalo Embolo|Karaburnu]] where it was to remain until the end of the war. Constantine rejected the Ottoman appeal, demanding a complete disarmament of the Ottomans and offering to transport them to a [[Asia Minor]] port of their choosing. At 5 a.m. on 26 October, a second Ottoman delegation appealed for 5,000 weapons to be retained during the transportation, Constantine responded by giving the Ottomans a two hour ultimatum to submit to his conditions. At 11 a.m., the 7th Greek Division crossed [[Gallikos (river)|Gallikos]] river, the last aquatic barrier before the city. Around the same time, Tahsin Pasha decided to given in to the Greek demands, dispatching messengers to alert Constantine about his intentions; the latter received the news at 2 p.m.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=296\u2013297}}\n\nThe 7th Greek Division and two Evzone battalions were immediately ordered to seize the city; while Constantine sent a message to the commander of the Bulgarian division closest to Thessaloniki advising him to divert towards a direction where his troops would be more useful. At 11 p.m., Tahsin Pasha signed a document of surrender in the presence of officers [[Viktor Dousmanis]] and [[Ioannis Metaxas]]. Under the terms of the treaty Greece captured 26,000 men and seized 70 artillery pieces, 30 machine guns, 70,000 rifles and large amounts of ammunition and other military equipment.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=298}} Feigning ignorance of the fact that the Ottomans had already surrendered, the Bulgarian army continued to advance towards the city. Bulgarian general [[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]] requested that the control of city be split between Bulgaria and Greece. Constantine refused, allowing only two Bulgarian battalions to rest within the city. The battle marked the liberation of the city and its inclusion in the Greek state, helping shape the modern map of Greece. Nevertheless the Greek capture of Thessaloniki remained a significant point of tension with Bulgaria, ultimately contributing to the outbreak of the [[Second Balkan War]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=99\u2013101}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which solidified the League's territorial ambitions, granting its members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as [[Crete]].

It was a major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the [[First Balkan War]], and revolved around the [[Giannitsa|Yenidje]] fortified position, which formed the last line of defense before the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]].\n\nThe rough and swampy terrain surrounding Yenidje significantly complicated the advance of the Greek army, most notably its artillery. In the early morning of 20 October, an infantry charge by the Greek 9th Evzone Battalion caused the Greek army to gain momentum, leading to the collapse of the entire western wing of the Ottomans. Ottoman morale plunged and the bulk of the defenders began fleeing two hours later. The Greek victory at Yenidje opened the way for the capture of Thessaloniki and the surrender of its garrison, helping shape the modern map of Greece.\n\n==Background==\nThe disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. [[Georgios Theotokis]] was the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[Table of organization|table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by re-arming and re-training the military, including extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchase of new weapons, and the recall of [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} \n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912, fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans declared mobilization on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October, with the latter declaring [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nThe [[Army of Thessaly]] crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked [[Elassona]], resulting in an Ottoman withdrawal towards Sarandaporo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} At 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its [[Battle of Sarantaporo|assault]] on Sarandaporo. The [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st]], [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd]] and [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Divisions]] attacked the Ottoman main line frontally. In the meantime, the cavalry brigade, [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th]] and [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Divisions]] conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The Konstantinopoulos [[Evzone]] detachment struck from the east of the pass. {{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Division's seizure of Porta Pass, panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers began fleeing and abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division marched into [[Servia, Greece|Servia]]{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}, while the Greek cavalry entered [[Kozani]] unopposed the following day.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; a day later King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} \nThe Ottomans fought a number of small scale delaying actions at Kolokouri, Tripotamos and Perdika, the Greek army nevertheless continued its advance taking Veroia and [[Katerini]] on 16 October. Between 17 and 18 October, the Greek general command forwarded its troops to the Veroia-[[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] plain.\n{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=293\u2013294}} \n\nAfter their defeat at Sarandaporo, the Ottomans augmented the remnants of [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]]'s force with fresh reinforcements. Two divisions from east Macedonia, one reserve division from Asia Minor and one reserve division from Thessaloniki; bringing the total Ottoman forces in the area to 25,000 men and 36 artillery pieces.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} The Ottomans chose to organize their main defensive line at [[Giannitsa|Yenidje]] either because of the town's religious importance for Macedonia's Muslim population or because they did not wish to fight too close to Thessaloniki.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|p=266}} The Ottomans dug their trenches at a {{convert|130|meter|foot|sigfig=1}} high hill which overlooked the plain west of the town. The hill was surrounded by two rough streams, its southern approaches were covered by the swampy [[Giannitsa Lake]] while the slopes of [[Mount Paiko]] complicated any potential enveloping maneuver from the north.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} On the eastern approaches to Yenidje, the Ottomans reinforced the garrisons guarding the bridges across [[Loudias River]], the rail line at [[Platy, Imathia|Platy]] and Gida.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=81}}\n\nOn 18 October, Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] ordered the Greek army to advance towards Yenidje despite receiving conflicting intelligence reports regarding the disposition of the enemy troops.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} The 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions marched along the same route towards  Tsaousli and Tsekre respectively, both located north-east of Yenidje. The 1st Greek Division acted as the army's [[rearguard]]. The 4th Division headed towards Yenidje from the north-west, while the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Division]] circumvented the city further to west, intending to capture Nedir. The [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Division]] and the cavalry brigade covered the right flank of the army by advancing towards Gida; while the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment was ordered to seize [[Trikala, Imathia|Trikala]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=81\u201382}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:TiradoresGriegosEnElLagoYeniye--balkancockpitpol00pric 0091.png|thumb|Greek soldiers at the lake during the battle]]\n[[File:Greek infantry Giannitsa 1912.jpg|thumb|Greek infantry charge]]\n\nThe first shots were fired in the early morning of 19 October, the advance guards of the 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions pushed back the Turks at Burgas. Upon reaching the bridge across Balitzas river, the two divisions became the target of heavy shelling from the hills surrounding Yenidje. The 4th and 6th Divisions likewise halted their advance, after being repulsed by massed rifle fire.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} The Greek army command arrived at the battlefield at noon, in order to assess the situation and issue new orders. The 2nd and 3rd Divisions were to force their way across the bridge, conducting a frontal attack on the main body of the Ottoman forces behind it. The 4th and 6th Divisions conducted a flanking maneuver from the west, in the meantime the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment and the cavalry brigade rushed towards Loudias; thus creating two fronts on either side of the Giannitsa Lake.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=82\u201383}}\n\nThe Greek artillery's shelling was inaccurate as only a single battery managed to establish itself at a distance of {{convert|4.5|km|miles|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches, since the ground was swampy and unstable. This caused the 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions to significantly slow down their advance, however by nightfall, they managed to establish a large bridgehead across Gramos river which flows into Giannitsa Lake from the north.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} Contrary to the orders they had received the 7th Division and the cavalry brigade encamped at Gida upon reaching it, while the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment likewise failed to cross Loudias after failing to locate a bridge. The 4th and 6th Greek Divisions progressed steadily on the western edge of the battlefield, crushing two counter-attacks and forcing the Ottomans to move their headquarters further back.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=83\u201384}}\n\nAt 8 a.m., 20 October, an infantry charge by the 9th Evzone Battalion of the 4th Greek Division captured an Ottoman battery. The 4th Greek Division used the momentum it had gained to push back the entire western wing of the Ottomans. The 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions made headway against their opponents, reaching the edge of the city{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=84}} and launching a bayonet attack on the Ottomans just as the 4th Greek Division arrived from the west. At 10 a.m., the Ottomans broke into a disorganized retreat, most fleeing towards Thessaloniki and [[Star Dojran|Doiran]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|p=270}}  The latter were detained by a Serbian cavalry unit that was advancing towards the [[Axios]] valley. Crown Prince Constantine ordered a single regiment of the 2nd Greek Division to chase the retreating Ottomans along the road to Thessaloniki, but it proved to be too narrow for an effective pursuit.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=85}}\n\nAt the same time a force of 3,000 Ottomans struck the 7th Greek Division at Gida, as it lingered in the area.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} The Greeks held their ground and immediately went on the offensive, disobeying orders once again, they limited themselves to establishing a bridgehead at Kirtzalar instead of crossing Axios. The Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment managed to cross Loudias by midday. However since the engineers of the 7th Division and the cavalry brigade failed to arrive on time, it was unable to reach Axios and block its bridges; enabling many Ottomans to flee.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nGreek casualties in the battle of Yenidje numbered 188 killed and 785 wounded. While the Ottomans lost over 250 killed, over 1,000 wounded, 200 men captured {{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=222}}, 2 flags lost, 11 to 14 field artillery pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=222}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=295}} Following the capture of Yenidje, Crown Prince Constantine allowed the bulk of the Army of Thessaly to rest for three days after fifteen days of continuous fighting. All while, Greek engineering units began repairing the bridges across Axios that the Ottomans had previously destroyed.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=295\u2013296}} In the meantime, the 5th Greek Division continued its march towards [[Bitola|Monastiri]] until it was [[Battle of Sorovich|ambushed and defeated]] outside Sorovich on 21 October. The battle of Sorovich perplexed Constantine and made him hesitate just as the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] seemed to be within his grasp. Citing Greek intelligence agents within the Bulgarian capital that the latter had taken [[Serres]] and were rapidly approaching Thessaloniki, a vexed Eleftherios Venizelos repeatedly urged Constantine and King George I to act.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=90\u201392, 66}} On 25 October, the Army of Thessaly finally crossed Axios, reaching the Tekeli-Bathylakkos-Gourdino line.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=94}}\n\nOn the same day, Constantine received a delegation consisting of the ambassadors of the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Great Powers]] to Thessaloniki and Ottoman general Sefik Pasha. Hasan Tahsin Pasha offered to surrender the city without a fight and in return requested that Thessaloniki's garrison could retain its weapons and retreat to [[Megalo Embolo|Karaburnu]] where it was to remain until the end of the war. Constantine rejected the Ottoman appeal, demanding a complete disarmament of the Ottomans and offering to transport them to a [[Asia Minor]] port of their choosing. At 5 a.m. on 26 October, a second Ottoman delegation appealed for 5,000 weapons to be retained during the transportation, Constantine responded by giving the Ottomans a two hour ultimatum to submit to his conditions. At 11 a.m., the 7th Greek Division crossed [[Gallikos (river)|Gallikos]] river, the last aquatic barrier before the city. Around the same time, Tahsin Pasha decided to given in to the Greek demands, dispatching messengers to alert Constantine about his intentions; the latter received the news at 2 p.m.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=296\u2013297}}\n\nThe 7th Greek Division and two Evzone battalions were immediately ordered to seize the city; while Constantine sent a message to the commander of the Bulgarian division closest to Thessaloniki advicing him to divert towards a direction where his troops would be more useful. At 11 p.m., Tahsin Pasha signed a document of surrender in the presence of officers [[Viktor Dousmanis]] and [[Ioannis Metaxas]]. Under the terms of the treaty Greece captured 26,000 men and seized 70 artillery pieces, 30 machine guns, 70,000 rifles and large amounts of ammunition and other military equipment.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=298}} Feigning ignorance of the fact that the Ottomans had already surrendered, the Bulgarian army continued to advance towards the city. Bulgarian general [[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]] requested that the control of city be split between Bulgaria and Greece. Constantine refused, allowing only two Bulgarian battalions to rest within the city. The battle marked the liberation of the city and its inclusion in the Greek state, helping shape the modern map of Greece. Nevertheless the Greek capture of Thessaloniki remained a significant point of tension with Bulgaria, ultimately contributing to the outbreak of the [[Second Balkan War]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=99\u2013101}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which solidified the League's territorial ambitions, granting its members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as [[Crete]].

One of the smallest countries on the African mainland, its capital city is [[Kigali]]. Located a few degrees south of the [[Equator]], Rwanda is bordered by [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Burundi]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It is highly elevated with its geography dominated by mountains in the west and [[savanna]] to the east, with numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year. Rwanda has a population of over 12.6 million <ref>United Nations - [[List of countries by population (United Nations)]]</ref> living on 26,338 km<sup>2</sup> of land, and  is the most densely populated mainland African country.\n\nThe population is [[Youth in Rwanda|young]] and predominantly rural, with a density among the highest in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the [[Banyarwanda]], although within this group there are three subgroups: the [[Hutu]], [[Tutsi]] and [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]]. The Twa are a forest-dwelling [[pygmy people]] and are often considered descendants of Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social [[caste]]s within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is [[Kinyarwanda]], spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as additional official languages. The [[sovereign state]] of Rwanda has a [[presidential system]] of government. The president is [[Paul Kagame]] of the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), who has served continuously since 2000. Today, Rwanda has low levels of corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by a strict administrative hierarchy since precolonial times; there are five [[Provinces of Rwanda|provinces]] delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only three countries in the world with a female majority in the national parliament, the two other countries being [[Bolivia]] and [[Cuba]].\n\n[[Hunter-gatherer]]s settled the territory in the [[Stone Age|stone]] and [[Iron Age]]s followed later by [[Bantu peoples]]. The population coalesced first into [[Clans of Rwanda|clans]] and then into kingdoms. The [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. [[German colonial empire|Germany]] colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of [[German East Africa]], followed by [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]], which invaded in 1916 during [[World War I]]. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population [[Rwandan Revolution|revolted]] in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated republic in 1962. A [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|1973 military coup]] saw a change of leadership, but the pro-Hutu policy remained. The Tutsi-led [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] launched a [[Rwandan Civil War|civil war]] in 1990. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, were killed when their aircraft was shot down on 6 April 1994. Social tensions erupted in the [[Rwandan genocide|1994 genocide]] that followed, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000-1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.\n\n[[Economy of Rwanda|Rwanda's developing economy]] suffered heavily in wake of the 1994 genocide, but has since strengthened. The economy is based mostly on [[subsistence agriculture]]. Coffee and tea are the major [[cash crops]] for export. [[Tourism in Rwanda|Tourism]] is a fast-growing sector and is now the country's leading foreign exchange earner. Rwanda is one of only two countries in which [[mountain gorilla]]s can be visited safely, and visitors pay high prices for gorilla tracking permits. Music and dance are an integral part of Rwandan culture, particularly drums and the highly choreographed ''intore'' dance. Traditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country, including ''[[imigongo]]'', a unique cow dung art.\n\nRwanda has been governed as a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system]] with a [[Parliament of Rwanda|bicameral parliament]] ruled by [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] since 1994. The country is member of the [[African Union]], the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa|COMESA]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|OIF]] and the [[East African Community]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Rwanda|German East Africa|Ruanda-Urundi}}\nModern human settlement of what is now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the [[last glacial period]], either in the [[Neolithic]] period around 8000 BC, or in the [[Neolithic Subpluvial|long humid period]] which followed, up to around 3000 BC.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=44}} Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the late [[Stone Age]], followed by a larger population of early [[Iron Age]] settlers, who produced dimpled [[pottery]] and iron tools.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=36}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=45}} These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], aboriginal [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=58}} The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes.{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were [[Hutu]], while the [[Tutsi]] migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=16}} An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=58}} Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=69}}{{sfn|Shyaka|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n[[File:Rwanda Nyanza Mwami Palace.jpg|thumb|left|A reconstruction of the ancient King's Palace at [[Nyanza, Rwanda|Nyanza]].]]\n\nThe earliest form of social organisation in the area was the [[Clans of Rwanda|clan]] (''ubwoko'').{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=88}} The clans were not limited to genealogical lineages or geographical area, and most included Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=88\u201389}} From the 15th century, the clans began to coalesce into kingdoms;{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=141}} by 1700 around eight kingdoms existed in present-day Rwanda.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=482}} One of these, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]], ruled by the Tutsi [[Nyiginya]] clan, became increasingly dominant from the mid-eighteenth century.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} The kingdom reached its greatest extent during the nineteenth century under the reign of King [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli Rwabugiri]]. Rwabugiri conquered several smaller states, expanded the kingdom west and north,{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} and initiated administrative reforms; these included ''[[ubuhake]]'', in which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle, and therefore privileged status, to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service,{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=13\u201314}} and ''[[uburetwa]]'', a [[corv\u00e9e]] system in which Hutu were forced to work for Tutsi chiefs.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} Rwabugiri's changes caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} The Twa were better off than in pre-Kingdom days, with some becoming dancers in the royal court,{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} but their numbers continued to decline.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=6}}\n\nThe [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference of 1884]] assigned the territory to [[German Empire|Germany]] as part of [[German East Africa]], marking the beginning of the colonial era. The explorer [[Gustav Adolf von G\u00f6tzen]] was the first European to significantly explore the country in 1894; he crossed from the south-east to Lake Kivu and met the king.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=217}}{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=9}} The Germans did not significantly alter the social structure of the country, but exerted influence by supporting the king and the existing hierarchy and delegating power to local chiefs.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=25}}<ref>See also Helmut Strizek, \"Geschenkte Kolonien: Ruanda und Burundi unter deutscher Herrschaft\", Berlin: Ch.

The major European languages during the colonial era were [[German language|German]], though it was never taught or widely used, and then [[French language|French]], which was introduced by Belgium from 1916 and remained an official and widely spoken language after independence in 1962.{{sfn|Universit\u00e9 Laval|2010}} [[Dutch language|Dutch]] was spoken too. The return of English-speaking Rwandan refugees in the 1990s{{sfn|Universit\u00e9 Laval|2010}} added a new dimension to the country's linguistic diversity.{{sfn|Samuelson|Freedman|2010}} Kinyarwanda, English, French, and Swahili are all official languages. Kinyarwanda is the national language while English is the primary medium of instruction in secondary and tertiary education. [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the [[lingua franca]] of the [[East African Community]],{{sfn|Tabaro|2015}} is also spoken by some as a second language, particularly returned refugees from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and those who live along the border with the DRC.{{sfn|Stanford University Swahili Department}} In 2015, Swahili was introduced as a mandatory subject in secondary schools.{{sfn|Tabaro|2015}} Inhabitants of Rwanda's [[Nkombo Island]] speak [[Mashi language|Mashi]], a language closely related to Kinyarwanda.{{sfn|Nakayima|2010}}\n\n===Sexuality===\n{{See also|LGBT rights in Rwanda}}\n\nHomosexuality is generally considered a [[taboo]] topic, and there is no significant public discussion of this issue in any region of the country.{{sfn|Gm\u00fcnder|2007|page=1216}}\n\nSame-sex sexual activity is legal in Rwanda, and some cabinet-level government officials have expressed support for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender people.{{sfn|U.S. Department of State|2016}} However, Rwanda does not recognise same-sex marriages, civil unions or similar unions.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 26}}\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of Rwanda}}\n[[File:Rwanda IntoreDancers.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional Rwandan ''[[intore]]'' dancers|alt=Photograph depicting two male dancers with straw wigs, neck garments, spears and sticks]]\n[[Music of Rwanda|Music]] and dance are an integral part of Rwandan ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings and storytelling.

It was established by President Habyarimana in 1974, and performs nationally and internationally.{{sfn|Briggs|2004}} Traditionally, music is transmitted orally, with styles varying between the social groups. Drums are of great importance; the royal drummers enjoyed high status within the court of the King (''Mwami'').{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|pp=135\u2013136}} Drummers play together in groups of varying sizes, usually between seven and nine in number.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=139}} The country has a growing popular music industry, influenced by African Great Lakes, Congolese, and American music. The most popular genre is [[hip hop]], with a blend of [[dancehall]], [[rap]], [[ragga]], [[R&B]] and [[dance-pop]].{{sfn|Mbabazi|2008}}\n\n[[File:Igiseke.jpg|thumb|upright|Rwandan woven basket|alt=Photograph depicting a bowl shaped off-white woven basket with tall conical lid and black zigzag pattern]]\nTraditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country, although most originated as functional items rather than purely for decoration. Woven baskets and bowls are especially common.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|pp=68\u201370}} ''[[Imigongo]]'', a unique cow dung art, is produced in the southeast of Rwanda, with a history dating back to when the region was part of the independent [[Gisaka]] kingdom. The dung is mixed with natural soils of various colours and painted into patterned ridges to form geometric shapes.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=243\u2013244}} Other crafts include pottery and wood carving.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=31}} Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials; circular or rectangular mud homes with grass-thatched roofs (known as ''nyakatsi'') are the most common. The government has initiated a programme to replace these with more modern materials such as corrugated iron.{{sfn|Ntambara|2009}}{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=75}}\n\nRwanda does not have a long history of written literature, but there is a strong oral tradition ranging from poetry to [[folk stories]]. Many of the country's moral values and details of history have been passed down through the generations.{{sfn|King|2007|p=105}} The most famous Rwandan literary figure was [[Alexis Kagame]] (1912\u20131981), who carried out and published research into oral traditions as well as writing his own poetry.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=29}} The Rwandan Genocide resulted in the emergence of a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as [[Benjamin Sehene]]. A number of films have been produced about the Rwandan Genocide, including the [[Golden Globe]]-nominated ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]'', ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (2007 film)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]'', ''[[Sometimes in April]]'', and ''[[Shooting Dogs]]'', the last two having been filmed in Rwanda and having featured survivors as cast members.{{sfn|Milmo|2006}}\n\nFourteen regular [[public holidays in Rwanda|national holidays]] are observed throughout the year,{{sfn|Government of Rwanda (I)}} with others occasionally inserted by the government. The week following Genocide Memorial Day on 7 April is designated an official week of mourning.{{sfn|Watson|Renzi|Viggiani|2010|p=25}} The victory for the RPF over the Hutu extremists is celebrated as [[Liberation Day]] on 4 July. The last Saturday of each month is ''[[umuganda]]'', a national morning of mandatory [[community service]] lasting from 8{{nbsp}}am to 11{{nbsp}}am, during which all able bodied people between 18 and 65 are expected to carry out community tasks such as cleaning streets or building homes for vulnerable people.{{sfn|Rwanda Governance Board}} Most normal services close down during ''umuganda'', and public transportation is limited.{{sfn|Rwanda Governance Board}}\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Cuisine of Rwanda}}\nThe cuisine of Rwanda is based on local [[staple food]]s produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ''[[ibitoke]]''), [[pulse (legume)|pulse]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, beans, and [[cassava]] (manioc).{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=81}} Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=81}} For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, [[tilapia]] is popular.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=81}} The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian [[Second European colonization wave (19th century\u201320th century)|colonialists]], is very popular.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=13}} [[Ugali]], locally known as ''[[Ubugari]]'' (or ''umutsima'') is common, a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a [[porridge]]-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes.{{sfn|Auzias|2007|p=74}} ''[[Isombe]]'' is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=13}} Lunch is usually a buffet known as ''m\u00e9lange'', consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=66}} [[Brochette]]s are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes [[tripe]], beef, or fish.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=66}} In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and [[barbecue|barbecuing]] the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas.{{sfn|Anyango|2010}} Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ''[[ikivuguto]]'', is a common drink throughout the country.{{sfn|Nzabuheraheza|2005}} Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and ''[[urwagwa]]'', made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=13}} The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is [[Bralirwa]], which was established in the 1950s, a Heineken partner, and is now listed on the [[Rwandan Stock Exchange]].{{sfn|Bralirwa (I)}} Bralirwa manufactures [[soft drink]] products from [[The Coca-Cola Company]], under license, including [[Coca-Cola]], [[Fanta]], and [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]],{{sfn|Bralirwa (II)}} and a range of beers including [[Primus

to the cost of their children's education by providing them with materials, supporting teacher development and making a contribution to school construction. According to the government, these costs should not be a basis for the exclusion of children from education, however.{{sfn|Williams|Abbott|Mupenzi|2015|p=935}} There are many private schools across the country, some church-run, which follow the same syllabus but charge fees.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=27}} From 1994 until 2009, secondary education was offered in either French or English; because of the country's increasing ties with the [[East African Community]] and the [[Commonwealth]], only the English syllabi are now offered.{{sfn|McGreal|2009}} The country has a number of institutions of tertiary education.

One of the smallest countries on the African mainland, its capital city is [[Kigali]]. Located a few degrees south of the [[Equator]], Rwanda is bordered by [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Burundi]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It is highly elevated with its geography dominated by mountains in the west and [[savanna]] to the east, with numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year. Rwanda has a population of over 12.6 million <ref>United Nations - [[List of countries by population (United Nations)]]</ref> living on 26,338 km<sup>2</sup> of land, and  is the most densely populated mainland African country.\n\nThe population is [[Youth in Rwanda|young]] and predominantly rural, with a density among the highest in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the [[Banyarwanda]], although within this group there are three subgroups: the [[Hutu]], [[Tutsi]] and [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]]. The Twa are a forest-dwelling [[pygmy people]] and are often considered descendants of Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social [[caste]]s within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is [[Kinyarwanda]], spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as additional official languages. The [[sovereign state]] of Rwanda has a [[presidential system]] of government. The president is [[Paul Kagame]] of the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), who has served continuously since 2000. Today, Rwanda has low levels of corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by a strict administrative hierarchy since precolonial times; there are five [[Provinces of Rwanda|provinces]] delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only three countries in the world with a female majority in the national parliament, the two other countries being [[Bolivia]] and [[Cuba]].\n\n[[Hunter-gatherer]]s settled the territory in the [[stone age|stone]] and [[iron age]]s followed later by [[Bantu peoples]]. The population coalesced first into [[Clans of Rwanda|clans]] and then into kingdoms. The [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. [[German colonial empire|Germany]] colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of [[German East Africa]], followed by [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]], which invaded in 1916 during [[World War I]]. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population [[Rwandan Revolution|revolted]] in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated republic in 1962. A [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|1973 military coup]] saw a change of leadership, but the pro-Hutu policy remained. The Tutsi-led [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] launched a [[Rwandan Civil War|civil war]] in 1990. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, were killed when their aircraft was shot down on 6 April 1994. Social tensions erupted in the [[Rwandan genocide|1994 genocide]] that followed, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000-1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.\n\n[[Economy of Rwanda|Rwanda's developing economy]] suffered heavily in wake of the 1994 genocide, but has since strengthened. The economy is based mostly on [[subsistence agriculture]]. Coffee and tea are the major [[cash crops]] for export. [[Tourism in Rwanda|Tourism]] is a fast-growing sector and is now the country's leading foreign exchange earner. Rwanda is one of only two countries in which [[mountain gorilla]]s can be visited safely, and visitors pay high prices for gorilla tracking permits. Music and dance are an integral part of Rwandan culture, particularly drums and the highly choreographed ''intore'' dance.

Its southern portion parallels [[Route 3 (MA)|Route 3]] from [[Cedarville, Massachusetts|Cedarville]] in southern [[Plymouth (MA)|Plymouth]] to [[Neponset, Massachusetts|Neponset]] in the [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]] area of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].  Towns and cities that Route 3A traverse along its path include [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], [[Kingston, Massachusetts|Kingston]], [[Duxbury, Massachusetts|Duxbury]], [[Marshfield, Massachusetts|Marshfield]], [[Scituate, Massachusetts|Scituate]], [[Cohasset, Massachusetts|Cohasset]], [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]] and [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]].\n\nNorth of Neponset, Route 3A runs, unsigned, concurrently with [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] and [[U.S. Route 3]] to [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]], before separating again (MassHighway counts the mileage along MA 3 between the two sections as part of MA 3A mileage).\n\nThe northern portion of which parallels [[U.S. Route 3 (MA)|U.S. Route 3]] in northwestern [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]]. It stretches from [[Interstate 95 (MA)|Interstate 95]] ([[Route 128 (MA)|Route 128]]) in [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]] to the [[New Hampshire]] state line, where it continues as [[Route 3A (southern New Hampshire)|Route 3A]].\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Plymouth to Boston===\nThis segment parallels [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]] from [[Cedarville, Massachusetts|Cedarville]] in southern [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] to [[Neponset, Massachusetts|Neponset]] in the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] area of [[Boston]].  Towns and cities that Route 3A traverse along its path include [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], [[Kingston, Massachusetts|Kingston]], [[Duxbury, Massachusetts|Duxbury]], [[Marshfield, Massachusetts|Marshfield]], [[Scituate, Massachusetts|Scituate]], [[Cohasset, Massachusetts|Cohasset]], [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]] and [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]].\n\nThe [[Claire Saltonstall Bikeway]] between Boston and Cape Cod intersects at Route 3A. Once in the Cedarville portion of Plymouth where Route 3A begins, and intersects again about 14 miles later in historic downtown Plymouth between South and Market Streets along Sandwich Street.\n\n===Boston to Burlington===\nThis segment is concurrent with [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]] (to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]) and then [[U.S. Route 3]] (from Cambridge to [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]]).  As an 'A' route concurrent with its parents, this segment is not posted.\n\n===Burlington to Tyngsborough===\n[[Image:Northbound MA Route 3A entering Tyngsborough MA.jpg|222px|thumb|right|Northbound 3A entering [[Tyngsborough, Massachusetts|Tyngsborough]]]]\nThis segment parallels [[U.S. Route 3 in Massachusetts|US 3]] from [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] ([[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]) in [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]] to the [[New Hampshire]] state line, where it continues as [[New Hampshire Route 3A]]. The part south of [[Massachusetts Route 113|Route 113]] in Tyngsborough is former US 3.\n\nThe section from Burlington to Billerica is currently being widened from 2 to 4 lanes.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:New England 6A.svg|50px|left]]\nFrom 1922 to 1926, Route 3A between Kingston and Quincy was [[New England Interstate]] Route 6A. In 1926, when [[New England Interstate Route 6]] became Route 3, Route 6A became Route 3A.\n\nIn the 1930s Route 3A's route was shifted onto new alignments built to reduce traffic problems in several communities through which the highway traversed. This included a bypass of Hingham Square along Broad Cove Road and Otis Street along Hingham Harbor replacing the original route that took it down Lincoln Street to downtown Hingham then along North Street to Summer Street. Chief Justice [[William Cushing|Cushing]] Highway was built around the same time and Route 3A was put on this highway from south of the Hingham Harbor rotary through Cohasset to Scituate. This replaced a routing along long-existing roadways such as Country Way in Scituate, South and North Main Streets in Cohasset and East Street to Summer Street in Hingham. Along East Street from Hull Street to Summer, Route 3A shared the highway with [[Route 128]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s Route 3A was extended to take over the original path of Route 3 south of Kingston to Plymouth and north of downtown Quincy to Neponset when Route 3 assumed its current [[freeway]] route. In between those locations, old Route 3 was designated [[MA Route 53|Route 53]].

The part south of [[Massachusetts Route 113|Route 113]] in Tyngsborough is former US 3.\n\nThe section from Burlington to Billerica is currently being widened from 2 to 4 lanes.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:New England 6A.svg|50px|left]]\nFrom 1922 to 1926, Route 3A between Kingston and Quincy was [[New England Interstate]] Route 6A. In 1926, when [[New England Interstate Route 6]] became Route 3, Route 6A became Route 3A.\n\nIn the 1930s Route 3A's route was shifted onto new alignments built to reduce traffic problems in several communities through which the highway traversed. This included a bypass of Hingham Square along Broad Cove Road and Otis Street along Hingham Harbor replacing the original route that took it down Lincoln Street to downtown Hingham then along North Street to Summer Street. Chief Justice [[William Cushing|Cushing]] Highway was built around the same time and Route 3A was put on this highway from south of the Hingham Harbor rotary through Cohasset to Scituate. This replaced a routing along long-existing roadways such as Country Way in Scituate, South and North Main Streets in Cohasset and East Street to Summer Street in Hingham. Along East Street from Hull Street to Summer, Route 3A shared the highway with [[Route 128]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s Route 3A was extended to take over the original path of Route 3 south of Kingston to Plymouth and north of downtown Quincy to Neponset when Route 3 assumed its current [[freeway]] route. In between those locations, old Route 3 was designated [[MA Route 53|Route 53]]. The section of old Route 3 from [[Cedarville, Massachusetts|Cedarville]] south to the [[Sagamore Bridge|Sagamore Rotary]] near the [[Cape Cod Canal]] in [[Bourne (MA)|Bourne]] is unnumbered.\n\nMuch of Route 3A is sometimes referred to as the \"Cape Way\" due to its history as the only major road to Cape Cod from Boston prior to the opening of Route 3.
