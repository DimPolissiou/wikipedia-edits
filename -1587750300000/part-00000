With manufacturing based in [[Brixworth]], [[Northamptonshire]], and maintenance offices in [[Plymouth, Michigan]], the company supplies engines and consultancy to the [[IndyCar Series]] and [[MotoGP]].\n\nAfter originally developing [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] engines, the company built a partnership with [[Mercedes-Benz]] to power F1 cars for both the [[Sauber]] and [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]] teams. After the death of Paul Morgan in a vintage aeroplane crash in 2001, Mercedes increased its stake until it owned the entire company, and renamed it '''[[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains|Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines Ltd.]]'''\n\nIn 2005, Mario Illien concluded a deal to purchase the Special Projects part of the company in partnership with [[Roger Penske]], which was under contract with [[Honda Performance Development]] to jointly develop, arrange, prepare and tune-up IndyCar engines from 2003\u20132011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilmor.com/en/racing/indy.aspx|title=Ilmor Racing: IndyCar, NASCAR, ARCA and Kart \u2014 Ilmor Engineering|work=ilmor.com|accessdate=8 October 2016}}</ref> This new company, which is totally independent of Mercedes, is once again known as '''Ilmor Engineering Ltd'''. They once again developed the [[Ilmor X3]] for the 2007 [[MotoGP]] World Motorcycle Championship, which they entered in one race before withdrawing and effectively shutting down the race team, due to funding problems.\n\nRacing remains the core part of the business today and Ilmor acts as a consultant for motorsport clients from all forms of racing. However, the business is now using its racing expertise to diversify into other areas such as OEM automotive, defence, marine and energy efficient engine applications.\n\n==2.65 litre Indy car V-8==\n[[File:Ilmorchevyindyv8.JPG|thumb|The Chevy Indy V-8]]Both engineers were working at Cosworth on the [[Cosworth DFX]] turbocharged methanol engine for the [[Champ Car|CART Indy Car World Series]]; differences of opinion over the direction in which DFX development should go (Cosworth were inherently conservative as they had a near monopoly) led them to break away from their parent company to pursue their own ideas. There was some acrimony in their split from Cosworth, their former employer claiming that the Ilmor engine was little different from their planned modifications to the DFX.<ref>Graham Robson, \"Cosworth: The Search For Power\"</ref>\n\nFounded as an independent British engine manufacturer in 1983, it started building engines for Indy cars with the money of team owner and chassis manufacturer Roger Penske. The Ilmor 265-A, badged initially as the Ilmor-[[Chevrolet]] Indy V-8, debuted at the [[1986 Indianapolis 500]] with [[Penske Racing|Team Penske]] driver [[Al Unser]]. In 1987, the engine program expanded to all three Penske team drivers ([[Rick Mears]], [[Danny Sullivan]], and Al Unser), [[Patrick Racing]], and [[Newman/Haas Racing]]. [[Mario Andretti]], driving for Newman/Haas, won at [[Long Beach Grand Prix|Long Beach]], the engine's first Indy car victory. He also won the pole position for the [[1987 Indianapolis 500]]. A year later, [[Rick Mears]] won the [[1988 Indianapolis 500]], the engine's first win at Indianapolis. The engine went on to have a stellar record in [[Champ Car|CART]]. From 1987 to 1991, the \"Chevy-A\" engine won 64 of 78 races.\n\nIn [[1992 PPG Indy Car World Series|1992]], the 265-A engine was followed up by the 265-B engine. The \"Chevy-B\" was fielded singly by Penske Racing ([[Rick Mears]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]) in 1992 and won four CART series races. All other Ilmor teams remained with the venerable \"Chevy-A\" for 1992. [[Bobby Rahal]], driving a \"Chevy-A\" won the 1992 CART championship, the fifth consecutive (and final) for the 265-A. [[Al Unser Jr.]] won the [[1992 Indianapolis 500]] driving a \"Chevy-A\", also the fifth consecutive (and final) Indy 500 win for the 265-A. [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] drove a \"Chevy-B\" to 4th place in points, but both he and Mears dropped out of that year's Indy 500 due to crashes. It was at this time that Ilmor was receiving new competition from [[Cosworth]], which had just introduced their new powerplant, the Ford-Cosworth XB.\n\nFor the [[1993 PPG Indy Car World Series|1993 season]], the 265-C engine was introduced, intended to replace both the 265-A and the 265-B. The \"Chevy-C\" was used widespread, and produced continued success for Ilmor. Some backmarker teams continued to utilize the \"A\" and \"B\" engines during the 1993 season, but neither the \"A\" nor the \"B\" would win another Indy car race. Chevrolet dropped its badging support after the 1993 season.\n\nFor the [[1994 PPG Indy Car World Series|1994 season]], two new engines were introduced. The 265-D engine replaced the 265-C, although some of the smaller teams still ran the \"C\" throughout 1994. Without badging support, the engines were referred to simply as the \"Ilmor-C\" and the \"Ilmor-D\". The other engine introduced in 1994 was the top-secret 265-E (see below), which was actually a 3.43 liter pushrod engine, used by Penske Racing at the [[1994 Indianapolis 500]].\n\nFor 1995, [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes-Benz]] became the badging manufacturer for the Ilmor Indy car engines. The engine continued to be a strong contender on the CART circuit. In [[1996 Indy Racing League season|1996]], the open wheel \"split\" began between CART and the IRL. Ilmor primarily was a provider for CART-based teams, and did not provide engines for any full-time IRL teams. At the [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996 Indy 500]], the \"Ilmor Mercedes-Benz D\" was used by [[Galles Racing]], and finished second, the powerplant's one and only start in an [[Indy Racing League|IRL]]-sanctioned race. When the IRL switched to normally-aspirated engines for 1997, the 265s were no longer permitted in the IRL and the Indy 500, and from that point on raced in the CART series exclusively.\n\n==F1 debut==\n\nIn 1991 Ilmor entered Formula 1 with a V10 engine as exclusive supplier to the ambitious [[Leyton House Racing|Leyton House]] team (formerly [[March Engineering|March]]). After some troubles Leyton House returned to racing as March again in 1992, still using Ilmor engines. Ilmor also supplied engines to the Tyrrell team, starting from 1992. Powered by the Ilmor V10, Tyrrell scored 8 points through [[Andrea de Cesaris]] and March another 3 through [[Karl Wendlinger]].\n\n==Sauber==\n\nIlmor were gaining a reasonable reputation in F1{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, and so the Sauber sportscar team and Mercedes-Benz, who were planning their Formula One entry together, signed a deal with Ilmor after scrapping plans for a Mercedes engine. In order to protect their image, Mercedes took on an observational role in the project and the cars had \"Concept by Mercedes-Benz\" written in the engine cover.\n\nAfter scoring 12 points in 1993, Mercedes entered officially in 1994 using an updated version of the 1993 engine, and now \"Powered by Mercedes-Benz\" was seen on the Sauber engine-cover. The same year Mercedes-Benz acquired [[Chevrolet]]'s 25% share of Ilmor.\n\nIn 1994 Ilmor also supplied the new [[Pacific Racing|Pacific GP]] team of [[Keith Wiggins]] with the old 1993 spec engines. In 32 attempts, the Pacific cars qualified seven times.\n\n==Racing in the United States==\n\nThe 265C V8s ran the entire [[1994 Indy Car season]] badged as \"Ilmor Indy V8\", with [[Team Penske]] headlining the program.\n\nBut there was another extraordinary engine from Ilmor in 1994 \u2013 the Mercedes-Benz 500I (although work on this started long before the Mercedes takeover as a private project between Ilmor and Penske). The 500I exploited a loophole in the engine rules at the [[Indianapolis 500]] (which was run under slightly different rules to other CART races). Originally stock-block engines based on production units, fitted with two [[pushrod]] and rocker arm actuated valves per cylinder, were permitted to run at increased cubic capacity (3.43 litres vs 2.65 litres) and significantly greater turbo boost than the pure racing engines. For several years [[Buick]] V6 units had been extremely fast but fragile; the restrictions were relaxed with the intent of permitting Buick-like engines to use stronger but still production-like blocks \u2013 the [[Team Menard|Menard]] engine based on the Buick took this approach, as did the unsuccessful Greenfield V8.\n\nIlmor realized that this provided scope for a completely new pure-bred racing engine \u2013 it would need to retain pushrods, but could be designed specifically for the requirements of the Indianapolis 500, and in strict secrecy schemed a completely new V8 engine which was approximately {{convert|200|bhp|abbr=on}} more powerful than the Cosworth XB and Ilmor 265C opposition. Team Penske's cars were by far the fastest at the [[1994 Indianapolis 500]], and [[Al Unser, Jr.]] won the race, with [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] also figuring strongly until an accident on lap 184. The loophole was closed for 1995, and Penske, a year behind on development for Indy, failed to qualify their 265C-powered cars for that year's 500.\n\nFor 1995 the 265C V8s were rebadged Mercedes and continued to be highly competitive, with [[Al Unser Jr.]] finishing runner-up with four wins. [[Rahal-Hogan Racing]] joined Penske as major teams, as [[Bobby Rahal]] collected five podiums to finish third in the overall standings. In 1996, Penske's Unser Jr. finished fourth, Rahal seventh and his teammate [[Bryan Herta]] eighth, with neither collecting wins. In 1997, Unser Jr. had a poor season, whereas Penske teammate [[Paul Tracy]] claimed three wins but retired in the last five races to finish fifth in the standings. PacWest drivers [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]] and [[Mark Blundell]] claimed four wins combined and finished fourth and sixth in the standings.  Forsythe driver [[Greg Moore (racing driver)|Greg Moore]] got two wins and three second places, but retired in eight races and finished seventh. After the CART-[[Indy Racing League|IRL]] split, Mercedes gradually lost interest in American racing and left CART after the 2000 season.\n\nIlmor continued working in the United States on the [[Oldsmobile]] Aurora V8 for the IRL ([[Penske Racing|Penske]] entries [http://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/irl-indy500-ilmor-prepared-olds-wins/]), and later developed the normally aspirated [[Chevrolet]] IRL engine which was used from 2002\u20132005.\n\nIn 2003 Honda partnered with Ilmor on the design, development and production of the [[Honda Indy V8]] engine, which was used in various forms from 2003\u20132011.[http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/indycar/news/story?id=5793266][http://news.honda.com/newsandviews/article.aspx?id=3928-en] In 2007 Honda took a more prominent role in engine design and development while continuing the existing partnership with Ilmor for shared production, tune-up, arrangement, maintenance and trackside support. At the conclusion of the 2011 season, Honda discontinued their partnership with Ilmor subsequently moving all design, development and production in house without any third-party tune-up partnership to HPD, for the 2012 Honda Indy V6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1067406_hpd-and-ilmor-trade-parting-gifts|title=HPD And Ilmor Trade Parting Gifts|website=motorauthority.com|accessdate=23 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Chevrolet returned to the [[IndyCar Series]], partnering with Ilmor on the [[Chevrolet Indy V6]] engine program.\n\nIlmor is the option specification engine supplier of engines for the [[NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series]].

Sauber had the opportunity to become a customer team, but team principal [[Peter Sauber]] opted to sign a deal with [[Ford]] instead. From then on Ilmor built the Mercedes-Benz engines exclusively for [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]].\n\nThe Ilmor engines went on to be hugely successful with McLaren, scoring several podiums in both [[1995 Formula One season|1995]] and [[1996 Formula One season|1996]], leading to three wins in [[1997 Formula One season|1997]] and back to back drivers championship in [[1998 Formula One season|1998]] and [[1999 Formula One season|1999]], as well as the constructor's championship in 98. Although they did not win another championship until 2008 the Ilmor-Mercedes engines won several races.\n\nIn 2001 Paul Morgan was killed while landing one of his vintage airplanes, a [[Hawker Sea Fury]] at [[Sywell Aerodrome]], [[Northamptonshire]]. In 2002 [[DaimlerChrysler]] increased its share to 55% and renamed the company '''Mercedes-Ilmor'''. In 2005 Daimler-Chrysler became the sole owner of Ilmor and renamed the company [[Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines|Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines Ltd]].\n\n==Ilmor Engineering, Inc. \u2013 expansion to the U.S.==\n\nIlmor Engineering, Inc., a sister company to Ilmor U.K., was incorporated in 1990 (President \u2013 Paul Ray) with the primary goal of providing engineering support to customers using the Ilmor Ltd.-manufactured Chevrolet 265A Indy Car engine. In 1998, the headquarters moved from its original facility in Redford, Michigan, into a custom-built, {{convert|28000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility in Plymouth, Michigan. The new facility housed all of the necessary disciplines to support the Indy Car program including design, engineering, engine building, engine test, performance development and trackside support functions.\n\nFrom its start as an Indy Car engineering and trackside support group Ilmor, Inc.\u2019s capabilities have grown to encompass design and analysis tools, engine and sub-systems test capabilities \u2013 including emissions compliance benches, precision manufacturing, electronics and wiring design and manufacture, and facilities for service and support.\n\nToday, the expanded facility (over 44,000 square feet) houses more than 100 people, and produces high performance products in multiple powertrain related arenas including auto racing, boat racing, high-performance road cars, high performance offshore powerboats and custom V-twin motorcycles.\n\n==Diversification \u2013 Ilmor High Performance Marine, LLC.==\n\nAs part of a broader desire to diversify the U.S. company's business base, Ilmor, Inc., entered the high-performance marine world in 2002, building race engines for the SuperCat Offshore Racing Series of the [[American Power Boat Association]] (APBA). Recognizing the business potential, Ilmor worked with then co-owner [[DaimlerChrysler]] to marinize and modify the [[Dodge Viper]]'s V10.\n\nLate that year, the first two prototype 550 HP engines were installed in a new {{convert|58|ft|m|adj=on}} sport rubber dinghy. In close collaboration with Pete Hledin of Douglas Marine (the parent company of Skater) and Bob Morgan of Big Thunder Marine, the Ilmor V10's underwent extensive durability testing and the results were encouraging.\n\nArmed with enough knowledge and experience from the initial marine exposure and having completed a comprehensive study of the marine business at large, Ilmor made long term plans to enter the powerboat business in a serious manner. Since 2004, Ilmor's high-performance marine division has enjoyed substantial growth, becoming a well-established supplier in the U.S. and European boat market. In addition to the MV10-550 engine, Ilmor created two additional performance variants: the MV10-625 in 2005, and the MV 7-10 in 2006. The 700-horsepower, naturally aspirated marine engine was developed with significantly improved fuel efficiency and a light-weight package. The MV10-550 was later upgraded to the 570 Hp in 2006.\n\nIn 2009, Ilmor had to utilize its engineering expertise to create an entirely new generation of MV-10 marine products. Emissions requirements established by the [[California Air Resources Board]] (the most stringent in the U.S.), the federal [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[European Union]] meant that all high-performance marine engines had to meet tough new exhaust emissions standards. The MV10-650 and the MV10-725, along with state-of-the-art Ilmor designed electronics were created to not only meet but exceed every requirement of the new regulations.  Ilmor's MV10-725 is the highest output emissions certified gasoline engine commercially available in Europe.\n\nAs part of its overall marine business development plan, Ilmor also unveiled the all-new INDY high-performance stern-drive in 2009. The INDY drive, two and a half years in the making, was designed to complement not only all of the current Ilmor high-performance marine engines but to handle the power and torque of several other engines aimed for introduction at a later time. The addition of the INDY drive placed Ilmor High Performance Marine firmly into the ranks of marine powertrain suppliers.\n\n==Powerboat Racing World Champions==\n\nAs a natural step for Ilmor, a decision was made in 2007 to enter the MV10 engine into powerboat competition. The twist for Ilmor, which is accustomed to manufacturing bespoke racing engines, was to race only engines identical to those already sold to the more typical high-performance powerboat customer. In the first year of competition for the engines, a pair of Ilmor Marine MV10-625 engines powered the #99 Fountain Worldwide \u201cKing of Shaves\u201d powerboat to the coveted 2007 Powerboat P1 Evolution Class World Championship. The successful first year of competition was backed up with two additional European based Powerboat P1 World Championships in 2008 and 2009 and World Championship success in the US in 2008. The success validated Ilmor's belief that its production based high-performance marine engine could race and win against any competition throughout the world.\n\nThere has also been great success for the \u201cCinzano Bianco\u201d race team in the UK marathon powerboat racing world championships. This boat was first raced in 2008 in the Cowes-Torquay-Cowes powerboat race with the MV10-625 engine. With the crew of Tim Grimshaw, Eric Smillie and Nik Keyser.  It came fifth overall and second in marathon class B. It was then raced again in 2009 in the marathon class B series and came first in class and first overall for the class and the whole of the marathon powerboat series. With the crew of Marcus Hendricks, Eric Smillie and Tim Grimshaw. Then in 2010 it was re-rigged with the new range of MV10-725 engines. Shortly after the re-rig the boat was raced in the Around Ireland 2010 powerboat race, which it won overall and won its class. It was then raced in the Cowes-Torquay-Cowes powerboat race of 2010. With the crew of Marcus Hendricks, Eric Smille and Simon Woodpower.\n\n==MotoGP==\n{{Main|Ilmor X3}}\n[[File:IlmorX3-001.jpg|thumb|Ilmor X3]]\nIn 2006, Ilmor announced that they would enter a two-bike team in the [[MotoGP]] motorcycle racing series  and would enter a single rider team as a wildcard entry in the final two races of the 2006 season.

Illien]] and [[Paul Morgan (engineer)|Paul Morgan]] in November 1983, is a [[UK|British]] independent high-performance autosport engineering company. With manufacturing based in [[Brixworth]], [[Northamptonshire]], and maintenance offices in [[Plymouth, Michigan]], the company supplies engines and consultancy to the [[IndyCar Series]] and [[MotoGP]].\n\nAfter originally developing [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] engines, the company built a partnership with [[Mercedes-Benz]] to power F1 cars for both the [[Sauber]] and [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]] teams. After the death of Paul Morgan in a vintage aeroplane crash in 2001, Mercedes increased its stake until it owned the entire company, and renamed it '''[[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains|Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines Ltd.]]'''\n\nIn 2005, Mario Illien concluded a deal to purchase the Special Projects part of the company in partnership with [[Roger Penske]], which was under contract with [[Honda Performance Development]] to jointly develop, arrange, prepare and tune-up IndyCar engines from 2003\u20132011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilmor.com/en/racing/indy.aspx|title=Ilmor Racing: IndyCar, NASCAR, ARCA and Kart \u2014 Ilmor Engineering|work=ilmor.com|accessdate=8 October 2016}}</ref> This new company, which is totally independent of Mercedes, is once again known as '''Ilmor Engineering Ltd'''. They once again developed the [[Ilmor X3]] for the 2007 [[MotoGP]] World Motorcycle Championship, which they entered in one race before withdrawing and effectively shutting down the race team, due to funding problems.\n\nRacing remains the core part of the business today and Ilmor acts as a consultant for motorsport clients from all forms of racing. However, the business is now using its racing expertise to diversify into other areas such as OEM automotive, defence, marine and energy efficient engine applications.\n\n==2.65 litre Indy car V-8==\n[[File:Ilmorchevyindyv8.JPG|thumb|The Chevy Indy V-8]]Both engineers were working at Cosworth on the [[Cosworth DFX]] turbocharged methanol engine for the [[Champ Car|CART Indy Car World Series]]; differences of opinion over the direction in which DFX development should go (Cosworth were inherently conservative as they had a near monopoly) led them to break away from their parent company to pursue their own ideas. There was some acrimony in their split from Cosworth, their former employer claiming that the Ilmor engine was little different from their planned modifications to the DFX.<ref>Graham Robson, \"Cosworth: The Search For Power\"</ref>\n\nFounded as an independent British engine manufacturer in 1983, it started building engines for Indy cars with the money of team owner and chassis manufacturer Roger Penske. The Ilmor 265-A, badged initially as the Ilmor-[[Chevrolet]] Indy V-8, debuted at the [[1986 Indianapolis 500]] with [[Penske Racing|Team Penske]] driver [[Al Unser]]. In 1987, the engine program expanded to all three Penske team drivers ([[Rick Mears]], [[Danny Sullivan]], and Al Unser), [[Patrick Racing]], and [[Newman/Haas Racing]]. [[Mario Andretti]], driving for Newman/Haas, won at [[Long Beach Grand Prix|Long Beach]], the engine's first Indy car victory. He also won the pole position for the [[1987 Indianapolis 500]]. A year later, [[Rick Mears]] won the [[1988 Indianapolis 500]], the engine's first win at Indianapolis. The engine went on to have a stellar record in [[Champ Car|CART]]. From 1987 to 1991, the \"Chevy-A\" engine won 64 of 78 races.\n\nIn [[1992 PPG Indy Car World Series|1992]], the 265-A engine was followed up by the 265-B engine. The \"Chevy-B\" was fielded singly by Penske Racing ([[Rick Mears]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]) in 1992 and won four CART series races. All other Ilmor teams remained with the venerable \"Chevy-A\" for 1992. [[Bobby Rahal]], driving a \"Chevy-A\" won the 1992 CART championship, the fifth consecutive (and final) for the 265-A. [[Al Unser Jr.]] won the [[1992 Indianapolis 500]] driving a \"Chevy-A\", also the fifth consecutive (and final) Indy 500 win for the 265-A. [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] drove a \"Chevy-B\" to 4th place in points, but both he and Mears dropped out of that year's Indy 500 due to crashes. It was at this time that Ilmor was receiving new competition from [[Cosworth]], which had just introduced their new powerplant, the Ford-Cosworth XB.\n\nFor the [[1993 PPG Indy Car World Series|1993 season]], the 265-C engine was introduced, intended to replace both the 265-A and the 265-B. The \"Chevy-C\" was used widespread, and produced continued success for Ilmor. Some backmarker teams continued to utilize the \"A\" and \"B\" engines during the 1993 season, but neither the \"A\" nor the \"B\" would win another Indy car race. Chevrolet dropped its badging support after the 1993 season.\n\nFor the [[1994 PPG Indy Car World Series|1994 season]], two new engines were introduced. The 265-D engine replaced the 265-C, although some of the smaller teams still ran the \"C\" throughout 1994. Without badging support, the engines were referred to simply as the \"Ilmor-C\" and the \"Ilmor-D\". The other engine introduced in 1994 was the top-secret 265-E (see below), which was actually a 3.43 liter pushrod engine, used by Penske Racing at the [[1994 Indianapolis 500]].\n\nFor 1995, [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes-Benz]] became the badging manufacturer for the Ilmor Indy car engines. The engine continued to be a strong contender on the CART circuit. In [[1996 Indy Racing League season|1996]], the open wheel \"split\" began between CART and the IRL. Ilmor primarily was a provider for CART-based teams, and did not provide engines for any full-time IRL teams. At the [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996 Indy 500]], the \"Ilmor Mercedes-Benz D\" was used by [[Galles Racing]], and finished second, the powerplant's one and only start in an [[Indy Racing League|IRL]]-sanctioned race. When the IRL switched to normally-aspirated engines for 1997, the 265s were no longer permitted in the IRL and the Indy 500, and from that point on raced in the CART series exclusively.\n\n==F1 debut==\n\nIn 1991 Ilmor entered Formula 1 with a V10 engine as exclusive supplier to the ambitious [[Leyton House Racing|Leyton House]] team (formerly [[March Engineering|March]]). After some troubles Leyton House returned to racing as March again in 1992, still using Ilmor engines. Ilmor also supplied engines to the Tyrrell team, starting from 1992. Powered by the Ilmor V10, Tyrrell scored 8 points through [[Andrea de Cesaris]] and March another 3 through [[Karl Wendlinger]].\n\n==Sauber==\n\nIlmor were gaining a reasonable reputation in F1{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, and so the Sauber sportscar team and Mercedes-Benz, who were planning their Formula One entry together, signed a deal with Ilmor after scrapping plans for a Mercedes engine. In order to protect their image, Mercedes took on an observational role in the project and the cars had \"Concept by Mercedes-Benz\" written in the engine cover.\n\nAfter scoring 12 points in 1993, Mercedes entered officially in 1994 using an updated version of the 1993 engine, and now \"Powered by Mercedes-Benz\" was seen on the Sauber engine-cover. The same year Mercedes-Benz acquired [[Chevrolet]]'s 25% share of Ilmor.\n\nIn 1994 Ilmor also supplied the new [[Pacific Racing|Pacific GP]] team of [[Keith Wiggins]] with the old 1993 spec engines. In 32 attempts, the Pacific cars qualified seven times.\n\n==Racing in the United States==\n\nThe 265C V8s ran the entire [[1994 Indy Car season]] badged as \"Ilmor Indy V8\", with [[Team Penske]] headlining the program.\n\nBut there was another extraordinary engine from Ilmor in 1994 \u2013 the Mercedes-Benz 500I (although work on this started long before the Mercedes takeover as a private project between Ilmor and Penske). The 500I exploited a loophole in the engine rules at the [[Indianapolis 500]] (which was run under slightly different rules to other CART races). Originally stock-block engines based on production units, fitted with two [[pushrod]] and rocker arm actuated valves per cylinder, were permitted to run at increased cubic capacity (3.43 litres vs 2.65 litres) and significantly greater turbo boost than the pure racing engines. For several years [[Buick]] V6 units had been extremely fast but fragile; the restrictions were relaxed with the intent of permitting Buick-like engines to use stronger but still production-like blocks \u2013 the [[Team Menard|Menard]] engine based on the Buick took this approach, as did the unsuccessful Greenfield V8.\n\nIlmor realized that this provided scope for a completely new pure-bred racing engine \u2013 it would need to retain pushrods, but could be designed specifically for the requirements of the Indianapolis 500, and in strict secrecy schemed a completely new V8 engine which was approximately {{convert|200|bhp|abbr=on}} more powerful than the Cosworth XB and Ilmor 265C opposition. Team Penske's cars were by far the fastest at the [[1994 Indianapolis 500]], and [[Al Unser, Jr.]] won the race, with [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] also figuring strongly until an accident on lap 184. The loophole was closed for 1995, and Penske, a year behind on development for Indy, failed to qualify their 265C-powered cars for that year's 500.\n\nFor 1995 the 265C V8s were rebadged Mercedes and continued to be highly competitive, with [[Al Unser Jr.]] finishing runner-up with four wins. [[Rahal-Hogan Racing]] joined Penske as major teams, as [[Bobby Rahal]] collected five podiums to finish third in the overall standings. In 1996, Penske's Unser Jr. finished fourth, Rahal seventh and his teammate [[Bryan Herta]] eighth, with neither collecting wins. In 1997, Unser Jr. had a poor season, whereas Penske teammate [[Paul Tracy]] claimed three wins but retired in the last five races to finish fifth in the standings. PacWest drivers [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]] and [[Mark Blundell]] claimed four wins combined and finished fourth and sixth in the standings.  Forsythe driver [[Greg Moore (racing driver)|Greg Moore]] got two wins and three second places, but retired in eight races and finished seventh. After the CART-[[Indy Racing League|IRL]] split, Mercedes gradually lost interest in American racing and left CART after the 2000 season.\n\nIlmor continued working in the United States on the [[Oldsmobile]] Aurora V8 for the IRL ([[Penske Racing|Penske]] entries [http://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/irl-indy500-ilmor-prepared-olds-wins/]), and later developed the normally aspirated [[Chevrolet]] IRL engine which was used from 2002\u20132005.\n\nIn 2003 Honda partnered with Ilmor on the design, development and production of the [[Honda Indy V8]] engine, which was used in various forms from 2003\u20132011.[http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/indycar/news/story?id=5793266][http://news.honda.com/newsandviews/article.aspx?id=3928-en] In 2007 Honda took a more prominent role in engine design and development while continuing the existing partnership with Ilmor for shared production, tune-up, arrangement, maintenance and trackside support. At the conclusion of the 2011 season, Honda discontinued their partnership with Ilmor subsequently moving all design, development and production in house without any third-party tune-up partnership to HPD, for the 2012 Honda Indy V6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1067406_hpd-and-ilmor-trade-parting-gifts|title=HPD And Ilmor Trade Parting Gifts|website=motorauthority.com|accessdate=23 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Chevrolet returned to the [[IndyCar Series]], partnering with Ilmor on the [[Chevrolet Indy V6]] engine program.\n\nIlmor is the option specification engine supplier of engines for the [[NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series]].

Sauber had the opportunity to become a customer team, but team principal [[Peter Sauber]] opted to sign a deal with [[Ford]] instead. From then on Ilmor built the Mercedes-Benz engines exclusively for [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]].\n\nThe Ilmor engines went on to be hugely successful with McLaren, scoring several podiums in both [[1995 Formula One season|1995]] and [[1996 Formula One season|1996]], leading to three wins in [[1997 Formula One season|1997]] and back to back drivers championship in [[1998 Formula One season|1998]] and [[1999 Formula One season|1999]], as well as the constructor's championship in 98. Although they did not win another championship until 2008 the Ilmor-Mercedes engines won several races.\n\nIn 2001 Paul Morgan was killed while landing one of his vintage airplanes, a [[Hawker Sea Fury]] at [[Sywell Aerodrome]], [[Northamptonshire]]. In 2002 [[DaimlerChrysler]] increased its share to 55% and renamed the company '''Mercedes-Ilmor'''. In 2005 Daimler-Chrysler became the sole owner of Ilmor and renamed the company [[Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines|Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines Ltd]].\n\n==Ilmor Engineering, Inc. \u2013 expansion to the U.S.==\n\nIlmor Engineering, Inc., a sister company to Ilmor U.K., was incorporated in 1990 (President \u2013 Paul Ray) with the primary goal of providing engineering support to customers using the Ilmor Ltd.-manufactured Chevrolet 265A Indy Car engine. In 1998, the headquarters moved from its original facility in Redford, Michigan, into a custom-built, {{convert|28000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility in Plymouth, Michigan. The new facility housed all of the necessary disciplines to support the Indy Car program including design, engineering, engine building, engine test, performance development and trackside support functions.\n\nFrom its start as an Indy Car engineering and trackside support group Ilmor, Inc.\u2019s capabilities have grown to encompass design and analysis tools, engine and sub-systems test capabilities \u2013 including emissions compliance benches, precision manufacturing, electronics and wiring design and manufacture, and facilities for service and support.\n\nToday, the expanded facility (over 44,000 square feet) houses more than 100 people, and produces high performance products in multiple powertrain related arenas including auto racing, boat racing, high-performance road cars, high performance offshore powerboats and custom V-twin motorcycles.\n\n==Diversification \u2013 Ilmor High Performance Marine, LLC.==\n\nAs part of a broader desire to diversify the U.S. company's business base, Ilmor, Inc., entered the high-performance marine world in 2002, building race engines for the SuperCat Offshore Racing Series of the [[American Power Boat Association]] (APBA). Recognizing the business potential, Ilmor worked with then co-owner [[DaimlerChrysler]] to marinize and modify the [[Dodge Viper]]'s V10.\n\nLate that year, the first two prototype 550 HP engines were installed in a new {{convert|58|ft|m|adj=on}} sport rubber dinghy. In close collaboration with Pete Hledin of Douglas Marine (the parent company of Skater) and Bob Morgan of Big Thunder Marine, the Ilmor V10's underwent extensive durability testing and the results were encouraging.\n\nArmed with enough knowledge and experience from the initial marine exposure and having completed a comprehensive study of the marine business at large, Ilmor made long term plans to enter the powerboat business in a serious manner. Since 2004, Ilmor's high-performance marine division has enjoyed substantial growth, becoming a well-established supplier in the U.S. and European boat market. In addition to the MV10-550 engine, Ilmor created two additional performance variants: the MV10-625 in 2005, and the MV 7-10 in 2006. The 700-horsepower, naturally aspirated marine engine was developed with significantly improved fuel efficiency and a light-weight package. The MV10-550 was later upgraded to the 570 Hp in 2006.\n\nIn 2009, Ilmor had to utilize its engineering expertise to create an entirely new generation of MV-10 marine products. Emissions requirements established by the [[California Air Resources Board]] (the most stringent in the U.S.), the federal [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[European Union]] meant that all high-performance marine engines had to meet tough new exhaust emissions standards. The MV10-650 and the MV10-725, along with state-of-the-art Ilmor designed electronics were created to not only meet but exceed every requirement of the new regulations.  Ilmor's MV10-725 is the highest output emissions certified gasoline engine commercially available in Europe.\n\nAs part of its overall marine business development plan, Ilmor also unveiled the all-new INDY high-performance stern-drive in 2009. The INDY drive, two and a half years in the making, was designed to complement not only all of the current Ilmor high-performance marine engines but to handle the power and torque of several other engines aimed for introduction at a later time. The addition of the INDY drive placed Ilmor High Performance Marine firmly into the ranks of marine powertrain suppliers.\n\n==Powerboat Racing World Champions==\n\nAs a natural step for Ilmor, a decision was made in 2007 to enter the MV10 engine into powerboat competition. The twist for Ilmor, which is accustomed to manufacturing bespoke racing engines, was to race only engines identical to those already sold to the more typical high-performance powerboat customer. In the first year of competition for the engines, a pair of Ilmor Marine MV10-625 engines powered the #99 Fountain Worldwide \u201cKing of Shaves\u201d powerboat to the coveted 2007 Powerboat P1 Evolution Class World Championship. The successful first year of competition was backed up with two additional European based Powerboat P1 World Championships in 2008 and 2009 and World Championship success in the US in 2008. The success validated Ilmor's belief that its production based high-performance marine engine could race and win against any competition throughout the world.\n\nThere has also been great success for the \u201cCinzano Bianco\u201d race team in the UK marathon powerboat racing world championships. This boat was first raced in 2008 in the Cowes-Torquay-Cowes powerboat race with the MV10-625 engine. With the crew of Tim Grimshaw, Eric Smillie and Nik Keyser.  It came fifth overall and second in marathon class B. It was then raced again in 2009 in the marathon class B series and came first in class and first overall for the class and the whole of the marathon powerboat series. With the crew of Marcus Hendricks, Eric Smillie and Tim Grimshaw. Then in 2010 it was re-rigged with the new range of MV10-725 engines. Shortly after the re-rig the boat was raced in the Around Ireland 2010 powerboat race, which it won overall and won its class. It was then raced in the Cowes-Torquay-Cowes powerboat race of 2010. With the crew of Marcus Hendricks, Eric Smille and Simon Woodpower.\n\n==MotoGP==\n{{Main|Ilmor X3}}\n[[File:IlmorX3-001.jpg|thumb|Ilmor X3]]\nIn 2006, Ilmor announced that they would enter a two-bike team in the [[MotoGP]] motorcycle racing series  and would enter a single rider team as a wildcard entry in the final two races of the 2006 season.

Prior to that, he had a one-man program, ''One Out of Seven,'' on KGO in which he dramatized a news story from the previous week.<ref name=mnf/>\n\nBy 1949, he had abandoned comedy for drama, and starred in ''[[Pat Novak, for Hire]],'' a radio show originating from KFRC about a man who worked as an unlicensed private detective. The program co-starred [[Raymond Burr]]. ''Pat Novak'' was notable for writing that imitated the [[hard-boiled]] style of such writers as [[Raymond Chandler]], with lines such as: \"She drifted into the room like 98 pounds of warm smoke. Her voice was hot and sticky\u2014like a furnace full of marshmallows.\"\n\nWebb's radio shows included ''[[Johnny Madero, Pier 23]],'' ''Jeff Regan, Investigator,'' ''[[The Amazing Mr. Malone|Murder and Mr. Malone]],'' ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (radio series)|Pete Kelly's Blues]],'' and ''One Out of Seven.'' Webb provided all of the voices on ''One Out of Seven,'' often vigorously attacking racial prejudice.\n\nWebb's most famous motion-picture role was as the combat-hardened [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[drill instructor]] at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]] in the 1957 film ''[[The D.I.]]'', with [[Don Dubbins]] as a callow Marine [[private (rank)|private]]. Webb's hard-nosed approach to this role, that of Drill Instructor [[Technical Sergeant]] James Moore, would be reflected in much of his later acting. But ''The D.I.'' was a box-office failure.\n\nWebb was approached to play the role of Vernon Wormer, Dean of Faber College, in ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]],'' but he turned it down, saying \"the movie didn't make any damn sense\"; [[John Vernon]] ultimately played the role.<ref>{{cite news| work=[[The New York Times]]| title=Food Fight!

''He Walked By Night's'' thinly veiled fictionalized recounting of the 1946 Walker crime spree gave Webb the idea for ''Dragnet:'' a recurring series based on real cases from LAPD police files, featuring authentic depictions of the modern police detective, including methods, mannerisms, and technical language.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Webb| first1=Jack| last2=Ellroy| first2=James| title=The Badge: True and Terrifying Crime Stories that Could Not be Presented on TV, from the Creator and Star of Dragnet| location=New York| publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press| isbn=978-1560256885| year=2005| page=103}}</ref>\n\nWith much assistance from Sgt.

He believed viewers wanted \"[[realism (arts)|realism]]\" and tried to give it to them. Webb had tremendous respect for those in law enforcement. He often said, in interviews, that he was angry about the \"ridiculous amount\" of abuse to which police were subjected by the press and the public. Webb was also impressed by the long hours, the low pay, and the high injury rate among police investigators of the day, particularly in the LAPD, which had by then acquired a notorious reputation for jettisoning officers who had become ill or injured in the line of duty; in Webb's book, ''The Badge: True and Terrifying Crime Stories that Could Not Be Presented on TV, from the Creator and Star of \"Dragnet\"'', one of Erwin Walker's victims, LAPD detective Lt. Colin Forbes, was among those whose experiences were so noted.<ref>Webb and Ellroy, p. 103: \"One of many examples of selfless service was that of LAPD detective Lt. Colin Forbes, who went to work each day carrying a .45-caliber slug next to his spine after being shot by none other than [[Erwin Walker]]. After his health was ruined from years of stakeouts and violent altercations with criminals, Lt. Forbes would be pensioned off at a mere $300 a month by the LAPD at the age of 46.\"</ref>\n\nIn announcing his vision of ''Dragnet,'' Webb said he intended to perform a service for the police by showing them as low-key working-class heroes. ''Dragnet'' moved away from earlier portrayals of the police in shows such as ''Jeff Regan'' and ''Pat Novak,'' which had often shown them as brutal and even corrupt. ''Dragnet'' became a successful television show in 1952. [[Barton Yarborough]] died of a heart attack in 1951, after filming only two episodes, and Barney Phillips (Sgt. Ed Jacobs) and Herbert Ellis (Officer Frank Smith) temporarily stepped in as partners. Veteran radio and film actor Ben Alexander took over the role of jovial, burly Officer Frank Smith. Alexander was popular and remained a cast member until the show's cancellation in 1959. In 1954, a full-length feature-film adaptation of the series was released, starring Webb, Alexander, and [[Richard Boone]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046931/| title=Dragnet| date=September 4, 1954| accessdate=March 26, 2018| website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\nThe television version of ''Dragnet'' began with this narration by [[George Fenneman]]: \"Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to see is true. The names have been changed to protect the innocent.\" Webb would intone, \"This is the city: Los Angeles, California.\" He would then make a historical or topical point, describe his duties, his partner, and superior on the episode. The radio series had a similar opening, though Webb, as Friday, did not give a unique LA-themed opening. Webb then set the plot by describing a typical day and then led into the story. \"It was Wednesday, March 19th. It was cool in Los Angeles. I was at headquarters, working narcotics....\" At the end of each show, Fenneman repeated his opening narration, revised to read: \"The story you have just seen is true. The names were changed to protect the innocent.\"\n\nA second announcer, [[Hal Gibney]], usually gave dates when and specific courtrooms where trials were held for the suspects, announcing the trial verdicts after commercial breaks. Many suspects shown to have been found guilty at the end were also shown as having been confined to the [[San Quentin State Prison|California State Prison]] at San Quentin. Webb frequently recreated entire floors of buildings on sound stages, such as the police headquarters at Los Angeles City Hall and a floor of the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]].''\n\nIn ''Dragnet'''s early days, Webb continued to appear in movies, notably as the best friend of [[William Holden]]'s character in the 1950 [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]].'' In 1950, Webb appeared alongside future 1960s ''Dragnet'' partner [[Harry Morgan]] in the [[film noir]] ''[[Dark City (1950 film)|Dark City]].'' In contrast to the pair's straight-arrow image in ''Dragnet,'' here Webb played a vicious [[card sharp]] in ''Dark City'' and Morgan a punch-drunk ex-fighter. Also in 1950, Webb appeared in ''[[The Men (film)|The Men]],'' the film in which Marlon Brando made his film debut.  Both actors played paraplegics undergoing rehabilitation at a veterans' hospital. In a subplot, Webb's character, a cynical intellectual, is fleeced of his life savings by a woman who feigns romantic interest.\n\nIn 1951, Webb introduced a short-lived radio series, ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (radio series)|Pete Kelly's Blues]],'' in an attempt to bring the music he loved to a broader audience. That show became the basis for a 1955 [[Pete Kelly's Blues (film)|film of the same name]]. In 1959, a television version was made. Neither was very successful. Pete Kelly was a cornet player who supplemented his income from playing in a nightclub band by working as a private investigator.\n\n==1960s==\nIn 1963, Webb took over from [[William T. Orr]] as executive producer of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Bros.]] detective series ''[[77 Sunset Strip]].'' He brought about wholesale changes in the program and retained only [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]], in the role of private detective Stuart Bailey. Gone were co-stars [[Roger Smith (actor)|Roger Smith]] and [[Edd Byrnes]] and the lively series set. The altered program began with Bailey quietly entering an elevator to an upper floor of a bleak office building. The story lines were far different from those of the first five years of the series. The result was a disaster, and critics accused Webb of being out of touch with the younger generation, a perception that the revival of ''Dragnet'' subsequently did nothing to correct. Ratings fell, and ''77 Sunset Strip'' was cancelled before the end of the sixth season. [[John Gavin]]'s ''[[Destry (TV series)|Destry]],'' a light-hearted [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, filled the remaining three months of the Friday-night time slot vacated on ABC by ''77 Sunset Strip.''\n\nMeanwhile, Webb teamed with actor [[Jeffrey Hunter]] to form Apollo Productions. They produced a failed television series, ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|Temple Houston]],'' with Hunter in the title role. In the summer of 1963, Webb pushed ''Temple Houston'' to production. The series was loosely based on the life of the frontier lawyer [[Temple Lea Houston]], the youngest son of the legendary [[Texas|Texan]] [[Sam Houston]]. The series was added to the NBC schedule after the planned drama, ''The Robert Taylor Show,'' based on case files of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare]], was suddenly disbanded after making four episodes. Under orders from Webb, ''Temple Houston'' episodes were put together in just two or three days each, something previously thought impossible in television production. Work began on August 7, 1963, with the initial airing set for September 19. [[Jimmy Lydon]], a former [[child actor]], adult actor, and a [[Television production|television producer]] with Warner Bros. at the time, recalled that Webb told the staff, \"Fellas, I just sold ''Temple Houston.'' We gotta be on the air in four weeks; we can't use the pilot, we have no scripts, no nothing--do it!\"<ref name=wtha/> Lydon recalled the team having worked around the clock to get ''Temple Houston'' on the air. Co-producer [[William Conrad]] directed six episodes, two scripts simultaneously on two different soundstages at WB. \"We bicycled Jeff (series star Jeffrey Hunter) and Elam (supporting star [[Jack Elam]]) between the two companies, and Bill shot 'em both in four-and-a-half days. Two complete one-hour shows!\" recalled Lydon.<ref name=wtha>Hawthorn, Billy. \"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967,\" ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]],'' Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 106\u2013109.</ref>\n\n''Temple Houston'' ended after its 26-week run. In a 1965 interview with ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]'', Hunter described the situation:{{quote|In the first place, we had no time to prepare for [the series]. I was notified on July 17 to be ready to start August 7 for an October air date. When we reached the screen we did not have a single segment ready. It was done so fast the writers never got a chance to know what it was all about. We all wanted to follow the line indicated by the [[Television pilot|pilot]] film, which we thought would make a charming series. NBC, however, favored making it serious.<ref>Spiro, J. D. \"Happy in Hollywood,\" ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]'', July 4, 1965.</ref>|}}\n\n===1967: ''Dragnet'' returns===\nShortly after leaving his position at Warner Bros., Webb teamed with [[Universal Television]] to begin work on a new ''Dragnet'' series. A pilot telefilm, based on the [[Harvey Glatman]] serial killings, was produced in 1966 for NBC, with Webb's Sgt. Joe Friday joined by Harry Morgan as Officer Bill Gannon. (Webb had tried to get Ben Alexander to reprise his role as Frank Smith, but he was unable to get Alexander to leave the ABC series ''[[Felony Squad]].'')\n\nThe new ''Dragnet'' premiered as a midseason replacement series on January 12, 1967, and aired until April 16, 1970. To distinguish it from the original series, the year of production was added to the title (''Dragnet 1967,'' ''Dragnet 1968,'' etc.). The revival emphasized crime prevention and outreach to the public. Its attempts to address the contemporary youth-drug culture (such as the revival's first episode, \"[[The LSD Story]]\", guest-starring [[Michael Burns (actor and historian)|Michael Burns]] as Benjamin John \"Blue Boy\" Carver, voted 85th-best TV episode of all time by ''[[TV Guide]]'' and [[TV Land]]) have led certain episodes on the topic to achieve cult status due to their strained attempts to be \"with-it\", such as Joe Friday grilling \"Blue Boy\" by asking him, \"You're pretty high and far out, aren't you? What kind of kick are you on, son?\" Don Dubbins, who had acted alongside Webb in ''The D.I.'' in 1957, was another featured actor in Mark VII Limited programs beginning in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1968, Webb and his production partner [[R.A. Cinader]] launched ''[[Adam-12]]'' on NBC. A spinoff of ''Dragnet,'' ''Adam-12'' starred [[Martin Milner]] and [[Kent McCord]] as a pair of LAPD beat cops, and followed their escapades while on patrol. Running till 1975, for a total of seven seasons, ''Adam-12'' was Webb's second-longest running television series, with the eight seasons recorded by the original ''Dragnet'' being the longest.\n\nAlso in 1968, Webb and [[Johnny Carson]] performed a sketch on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' that has since become known as the \"Copper Clapper Caper\" sketch. Webb, in character as Joe Friday, was working on the case of a robbery at a school-bell factory. Carson played the owner of the factory and victim of the theft, which consisted of each bell being relieved of its clapper (the device that makes the bell ring). The sketch's dialogue consisted of Webb and Carson discussing the situation in deadpan style and using alliteration and tongue twisters to describe the incident, each word having either a \"c\" or \"cl\" sound at the beginning. Both Webb and Carson tried desperately not to lose composure, but both did, near the  end of the sketch.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgYbogp1Ha0| title=Dragnet Clapper Caper with Jack Webb| series=The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson| date=October 1, 1962| website=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==1970s and 1980s==\n[[File:Jack Webb and Julie London with Stacey and Lisa, 1953.jpg|thumb|Jack Webb with first wife [[Julie London]] and daughters Stacey and Lisa, 1953]]\nIn 1970, Webb decided to bring an end to ''Dragnet'' and cease acting to focus on expanding Mark VII Limited's production profile.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 1971, Webb entered the world of district attorneys and federal government work with two series. The first, ''[[The D.A. (1971 TV series)|The D.A.]]'', starred [[Robert Conrad]] and Harry Morgan as a pair of Los Angeles County ADAs, with Conrad playing a junior ADA and Morgan his superior. The second, ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury|O'Hara, United States Treasury]],'' was a co-production of Webb and [[David Janssen]], the former star of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' and future star of ''[[Harry O]],'' for [[CBS]] (a rare non-NBC Mark VII effort) and featured Janssen as a Nebraska county sheriff-turned-[[United States Treasury Department]] agent. Neither series lasted very long, as ''The D.A.,'' Webb's last 30-minute series, was cancelled after 15 episodes and ''O'Hara'' ended after 22.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nLater in the 1971\u201372 season, Webb and Cinader launched ''[[Emergency!]]'', a spin-off of ''[[Adam-12]]'', which focused on the fictional Station 51 Rescue Squad of [[Los Angeles County Fire Department|L.A. County Fire Department]], which also featured one of the first [[paramedic]] units, and its work in conjunction with the emergency department staff of the fictional Rampart General Hospital.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Webb cast his ex-wife, [[Julie London]], as well as her second husband and ''Dragnet'' ensemble player [[Bobby Troup]], as head nurse Dixie McCall and Dr. Joe Early, respectively, with [[Randolph Mantooth]] and [[Kevin Tighe]] playing paramedics John Gage and Roy DeSoto and [[Robert Fuller (actor)|Robert Fuller]] playing Dr. Kelly Brackett, Rampart's Chief of Emergency Medicine.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n''Emergency!'' ran as part of NBC's Saturday-night lineup for six entire seasons, and it was a popular series, sometimes winning its time slot against CBS's popular Saturday-night comedy block, which included ''[[All in the Family]].''{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The series came to an end in 1977, but it spawned a series of telefilms that ran until 1979.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Webb's company and Universal also contracted with animator Fred Calvert to produce a spin-off Saturday-morning cartoon show for NBC titled ''[[Emergency +4]],'' which ran for three seasons (the last in reruns) and featured the paramedics Gage and DeSoto assisted by four youngsters and their three pets.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n''Emergency!'' was Webb's last sustained success. Of the remaining series his company produced, the only two that lasted longer than one season were ''[[Hec Ramsey]],'' a two-season component of the ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]'' wheel series that featured former ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' star [[Richard Boone]] as a pioneering [[forensic scientist]] in the Old West,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and ''[[Project UFO]]'', an anthology based on the investigations into UFOs as compiled by [[Project Bluebook]] that also ran for two seasons beginning in 1978.\n\nIn 1987, [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Tom Hanks]] starred in a movie parody (and homage) to Webb, titled ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', along with Harry Morgan, who reprised his role from the television series as Bill Gannon, who had by now become a captain of detectives. The comedy film was written and directed by [[Tom Mankiewicz]], in his directorial debut. Aykroyd played the role of Joe Friday, described as the nephew of the original series lead, while Hanks co-starred as Detective Officer Pep Streebeck, Friday's new smart-alecky and streetwise partner.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Personal life==\nWebb's personal life was better defined by his love of [[jazz]] than his interest in police work. He had a collection of more than 6,000 jazz recordings.<ref name=mnf/> His lifelong interest in the [[cornet]] allowed him to move easily in the jazz culture, where he met singer and actress [[Julie London]]. They married in 1947 and had daughters Stacy (1950\u20131996) and Lisa, born 1952. They divorced in 1954.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} He was married three more times after that, to Dorothy Towne for two years beginning in 1955, to former [[Miss USA]] [[Jackie Loughery]] for six years beginning in 1958, and to his longtime associate, Opal Wright, for the last two years of his life.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nStacy Webb authorized and collaborated on a book, ''Just the Facts, Ma'am: The Authorized Biography of Jack Webb, Creator of Dragnet, Adam-12, and Emergency!,'' of which Daniel Moyer and Eugene Alvarez were the primary authors. It was published in 1999.

After his health was ruined from years of stakeouts and violent altercations with criminals, Lt. Forbes would be pensioned off at a mere $300 a month by the LAPD at the age of 46.\"</ref>\n\nIn announcing his vision of ''Dragnet,'' Webb said he intended to perform a service for the police by showing them as low-key working-class heroes. ''Dragnet'' moved away from earlier portrayals of the police in shows such as ''Jeff Regan'' and ''Pat Novak,'' which had often shown them as brutal and even corrupt. ''Dragnet'' became a successful television show in 1952. [[Barton Yarborough]] died of a heart attack in 1951, after filming only two episodes, and Barney Phillips (Sgt. Ed Jacobs) and Herbert Ellis (Officer Frank Smith) temporarily stepped in as partners. Veteran radio and film actor Ben Alexander took over the role of jovial, burly Officer Frank Smith. Alexander was popular and remained a cast member until the show's cancellation in 1959. In 1954, a full-length feature-film adaptation of the series was released, starring Webb, Alexander, and [[Richard Boone]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046931/| title=Dragnet| date=September 4, 1954| accessdate=March 26, 2018| website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\nThe television version of ''Dragnet'' began with this narration by [[George Fenneman]]: \"Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to see is true. The names have been changed to protect the innocent.\" Webb would intone, \"This is the city: Los Angeles, California.\" He would then make a historical or topical point, describe his duties, his partner, and superior on the episode. The radio series had a similar opening, though Webb, as Friday, did not give a unique LA-themed opening. Webb then set the plot by describing a typical day and then led into the story. \"It was Wednesday, March 19th. It was cool in Los Angeles. I was at headquarters, working narcotics....\" At the end of each show, Fenneman repeated his opening narration, revised to read: \"The story you have just seen is true. The names were changed to protect the innocent.\"\n\nA second announcer, [[Hal Gibney]], usually gave dates when and specific courtrooms where trials were held for the suspects, announcing the trial verdicts after commercial breaks. Many suspects shown to have been found guilty at the end were also shown as having been confined to the [[San Quentin State Prison|California State Prison]] at San Quentin. Webb frequently recreated entire floors of buildings on sound stages, such as the police headquarters at Los Angeles City Hall and a floor of the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]].''\n\nIn ''Dragnet'''s early days, Webb continued to appear in movies, notably as the best friend of [[William Holden]]'s character in the 1950 [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]].'' In 1950, Webb appeared alongside future 1960s ''Dragnet'' partner [[Harry Morgan]] in the [[film noir]] ''[[Dark City (1950 film)|Dark City]].'' In contrast to the pair's straight-arrow image in ''Dragnet,'' here Webb played a vicious [[card sharp]] in ''Dark City'' and Morgan a punch-drunk ex-fighter. Also in 1950, Webb appeared in ''[[The Men (film)|The Men]],'' the film in which Marlon Brando made his film debut.  Both actors played paraplegics undergoing rehabilitation at a veterans' hospital. In a subplot, Webb's character, a cynical intellectual, is fleeced of his life savings by a woman who feigns romantic interest.\n\nIn 1951, Webb introduced a short-lived radio series, ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (radio series)|Pete Kelly's Blues]],'' in an attempt to bring the music he loved to a broader audience. That show became the basis for a 1955 [[Pete Kelly's Blues (film)|film of the same name]]. In 1959, a television version was made. Neither was very successful. Pete Kelly was a cornet player who supplemented his income from playing in a nightclub band by working as a private investigator.\n\n==1960s==\nIn 1963, Webb took over from [[William T. Orr]] as executive producer of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Bros.]] detective series ''[[77 Sunset Strip]].'' He brought about wholesale changes in the program and retained only [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]], in the role of private detective Stuart Bailey. Gone were co-stars [[Roger Smith (actor)|Roger Smith]] and [[Edd Byrnes]] and the lively series set. The altered program began with Bailey quietly entering an elevator to an upper floor of a bleak office building. The story lines were far different from those of the first five years of the series. The result was a disaster, and critics accused Webb of being out of touch with the younger generation, a perception that the revival of ''Dragnet'' subsequently did nothing to correct. Ratings fell, and ''77 Sunset Strip'' was cancelled before the end of the sixth season. [[John Gavin]]'s ''[[Destry (TV series)|Destry]],'' a light-hearted [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, filled the remaining three months of the Friday-night time slot vacated on ABC by ''77 Sunset Strip.''\n\nMeanwhile, Webb teamed with actor [[Jeffrey Hunter]] to form Apollo Productions. They produced a failed television series, ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|Temple Houston]],'' with Hunter in the title role. In the summer of 1963, Webb pushed ''Temple Houston'' to production. The series was loosely based on the life of the frontier lawyer [[Temple Lea Houston]], the youngest son of the legendary [[Texas|Texan]] [[Sam Houston]]. The series was added to the NBC schedule after the planned drama, ''The Robert Taylor Show,'' based on case files of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare]], was suddenly disbanded after making four episodes. Under orders from Webb, ''Temple Houston'' episodes were put together in just two or three days each, something previously thought impossible in television production. Work began on August 7, 1963, with the initial airing set for September 19. [[Jimmy Lydon]], a former [[child actor]], adult actor, and a [[Television production|television producer]] with Warner Bros. at the time, recalled that Webb told the staff, \"Fellas, I just sold ''Temple Houston.'' We gotta be on the air in four weeks; we can't use the pilot, we have no scripts, no nothing--do it!\"<ref name=wtha/> Lydon recalled the team having worked around the clock to get ''Temple Houston'' on the air. Co-producer [[William Conrad]] directed six episodes, two scripts simultaneously on two different soundstages at WB. \"We bicycled Jeff (series star Jeffrey Hunter) and Elam (supporting star [[Jack Elam]]) between the two companies, and Bill shot 'em both in four-and-a-half days. Two complete one-hour shows!\" recalled Lydon.<ref name=wtha>Hawthorn, Billy. \"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967,\" ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]],'' Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 106\u2013109.</ref>\n\n''Temple Houston'' ended after its 26-week run. In a 1965 interview with ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]'', Hunter described the situation:{{quote|In the first place, we had no time to prepare for [the series]. I was notified on July 17 to be ready to start August 7 for an October air date. When we reached the screen we did not have a single segment ready. It was done so fast the writers never got a chance to know what it was all about. We all wanted to follow the line indicated by the [[Television pilot|pilot]] film, which we thought would make a charming series. NBC, however, favored making it serious.<ref>Spiro, J. D. \"Happy in Hollywood,\" ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]'', July 4, 1965.</ref>|}}\n\n===1967: ''Dragnet'' returns===\nShortly after leaving his position at Warner Bros., Webb teamed with [[Universal Television]] to begin work on a new ''Dragnet'' series. A pilot telefilm, based on the [[Harvey Glatman]] serial killings, was produced in 1966 for NBC, with Webb's Sgt. Joe Friday joined by Harry Morgan as Officer Bill Gannon. (Webb had tried to get Ben Alexander to reprise his role as Frank Smith, but he was unable to get Alexander to leave the ABC series ''[[Felony Squad]].'')\n\nThe new ''Dragnet'' premiered as a midseason replacement series on January 12, 1967, and aired until April 16, 1970. To distinguish it from the original series, the year of production was added to the title (''Dragnet 1967,'' ''Dragnet 1968,'' etc.). The revival emphasized crime prevention and outreach to the public. Its attempts to address the contemporary youth-drug culture (such as the revival's first episode, \"[[The LSD Story]]\", guest-starring [[Michael Burns (actor and historian)|Michael Burns]] as Benjamin John \"Blue Boy\" Carver, voted 85th-best TV episode of all time by ''[[TV Guide]]'' and [[TV Land]]) have led certain episodes on the topic to achieve cult status due to their strained attempts to be \"with-it\", such as Joe Friday grilling \"Blue Boy\" by asking him, \"You're pretty high and far out, aren't you? What kind of kick are you on, son?\" Don Dubbins, who had acted alongside Webb in ''The D.I.'' in 1957, was another featured actor in Mark VII Limited programs beginning in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1968, Webb and his production partner [[R.A. Cinader]] launched ''[[Adam-12]]'' on NBC. A spinoff of ''Dragnet,'' ''Adam-12'' starred [[Martin Milner]] and [[Kent McCord]] as a pair of LAPD beat cops, and followed their escapades while on patrol. Running till 1975, for a total of seven seasons, ''Adam-12'' was Webb's second-longest running television series, with the eight seasons recorded by the original ''Dragnet'' being the longest.\n\nAlso in 1968, Webb and [[Johnny Carson]] performed a sketch on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' that has since become known as the \"Copper Clapper Caper\" sketch. Webb, in character as Joe Friday, was working on the case of a robbery at a school-bell factory. Carson played the owner of the factory and victim of the theft, which consisted of each bell being relieved of its clapper (the device that makes the bell ring). The sketch's dialogue consisted of Webb and Carson discussing the situation in deadpan style and using alliteration and tongue twisters to describe the incident, each word having either a \"c\" or \"cl\" sound at the beginning. Both Webb and Carson tried desperately not to lose composure, but both did, near the  end of the sketch.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgYbogp1Ha0| title=Dragnet Clapper Caper with Jack Webb| series=The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson| date=October 1, 1962| website=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==1970s and 1980s==\n[[File:Jack Webb and Julie London with Stacey and Lisa, 1953.jpg|thumb|Jack Webb with first wife [[Julie London]] and daughters Stacey and Lisa, 1953]]\nIn 1970, Webb decided to bring an end to ''Dragnet'' and cease acting to focus on expanding Mark VII Limited's production profile.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 1971, Webb entered the world of district attorneys and federal government work with two series. The first, ''[[The D.A. (1971 TV series)|The D.A.]]'', starred [[Robert Conrad]] and Harry Morgan as a pair of Los Angeles County ADAs, with Conrad playing a junior ADA and Morgan his superior. The second, ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury|O'Hara, United States Treasury]],'' was a co-production of Webb and [[David Janssen]], the former star of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' and future star of ''[[Harry O]],'' for [[CBS]] (a rare non-NBC Mark VII effort) and featured Janssen as a Nebraska county sheriff-turned-[[United States Treasury Department]] agent. Neither series lasted very long, as ''The D.A.,'' Webb's last 30-minute series, was cancelled after 15 episodes and ''O'Hara'' ended after 22.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nLater in the 1971\u201372 season, Webb and Cinader launched ''[[Emergency!]]'', a spin-off of ''[[Adam-12]]'', which focused on the fictional Station 51 Rescue Squad of [[Los Angeles County Fire Department|L.A. County Fire Department]], which also featured one of the first [[paramedic]] units, and its work in conjunction with the emergency department staff of the fictional Rampart General Hospital.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Webb cast his ex-wife, [[Julie London]], as well as her second husband and ''Dragnet'' ensemble player [[Bobby Troup]], as head nurse Dixie McCall and Dr. Joe Early, respectively, with [[Randolph Mantooth]] and [[Kevin Tighe]] playing paramedics John Gage and Roy DeSoto and [[Robert Fuller (actor)|Robert Fuller]] playing Dr. Kelly Brackett, Rampart's Chief of Emergency Medicine.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n''Emergency!'' ran as part of NBC's Saturday-night lineup for six entire seasons, and it was a popular series, sometimes winning its time slot against CBS's popular Saturday-night comedy block, which included ''[[All in the Family]].''{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The series came to an end in 1977, but it spawned a series of telefilms that ran until 1979.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Webb's company and Universal also contracted with animator Fred Calvert to produce a spin-off Saturday-morning cartoon show for NBC titled ''[[Emergency +4]],'' which ran for three seasons (the last in reruns) and featured the paramedics Gage and DeSoto assisted by four youngsters and their three pets.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n''Emergency!'' was Webb's last sustained success. Of the remaining series his company produced, the only two that lasted longer than one season were ''[[Hec Ramsey]],'' a two-season component of the ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]'' wheel series that featured former ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' star [[Richard Boone]] as a pioneering [[forensic scientist]] in the Old West,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and ''[[Project UFO]]'', an anthology based on the investigations into UFOs as compiled by [[Project Bluebook]] that also ran for two seasons beginning in 1978.\n\nIn 1987, [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Tom Hanks]] starred in a movie parody (and homage) to Webb, titled ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', along with Harry Morgan, who reprised his role from the television series as Bill Gannon, who had by now become a captain of detectives. The comedy film was written and directed by [[Tom Mankiewicz]], in his directorial debut. Aykroyd played the role of Joe Friday, described as the nephew of the original series lead, while Hanks co-starred as Detective Officer Pep Streebeck, Friday's new smart-alecky and streetwise partner.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Personal life==\nWebb's personal life was better defined by his love of [[jazz]] than his interest in police work. He had a collection of more than 6,000 jazz recordings.<ref name=mnf/> His lifelong interest in the [[cornet]] allowed him to move easily in the jazz culture, where he met singer and actress [[Julie London]]. They married in 1947 and had daughters Stacy (1950\u20131996) and Lisa, born 1952. They divorced in 1954.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} He was married three more times after that, to Dorothy Towne for two years beginning in 1955, to former [[Miss USA]] [[Jackie Loughery]] for six years beginning in 1958, and to his longtime associate, Opal Wright, for the last two years of his life.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nStacy Webb authorized and collaborated on a book, ''Just the Facts, Ma'am: The Authorized Biography of Jack Webb, Creator of Dragnet, Adam-12, and Emergency!,'' of which Daniel Moyer and Eugene Alvarez were the primary authors. It was published in 1999. Stacy did not live to see the publication of the book, having been killed in a collision with a California Highway Patrol car three years earlier.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/STACY+WEBB%2C+DAUGHTER+OF+ACTRESS%2C+LATE+ACTOR.-a083969282 |title=Stacy Webb, Daughter of Actress, Late Actor |via=The Free Library |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]| date=October 1, 1996 |access-date=January 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230115231/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/STACY+WEBB%2C+DAUGHTER+OF+ACTRESS%2C+LATE+ACTOR.-a083969282 |archive-date=December 30, 2017 |url-status=dead| agency=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Jack Webb Grave.JPG|thumb|120px|The grave of Jack Webb at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]], in the Hollywood Hills]]\nDespite his string of short-lived series in the late 1970s, Webb still kept trying to recapture his previous success and decided to bring ''Dragnet'' back to television for a third series in 1983. Five scripts had been produced and [[Kent McCord]], one of the stars of ''Adam-12,'' was cast as Joe Friday's new partner.\n\nWebb died of an apparent heart attack on December 23, 1982, at age 62.<ref name=NYT/> He is interred at Sheltering Hills Plot 1999, [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in Los Angeles, and was given a funeral with full Los Angeles police honors.

Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] ordered all flags lowered to half staff in Webb's honor for a day, and Webb was buried with a replica LAPD badge bearing the rank of sergeant and the number 714.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nWebb has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], one for radio (at 7040 Hollywood Boulevard) and the other for television (at 6728 Hollywood Boulevard).

Since July 2015, however, the PRC has amended the legislation to remove entry restrictions placed on ROC nationals, this includes the removal of the requirement to obtain entry endorsements as well as the 90-day stay limit per trip (the Travel Permit mentioned above is the only required document for travelling to Mainland China). '''ROC nationals are therefore generally free to enter the PRC and remain indefinitely.''' Currently ROC nationals can take up residence in the Mainland (PRC) without additional documentation and '''enjoy ''comparatively'' higher level of flexibility for employment than foreign nationals''', much like permanent residents of Hong Kong and Macau residing in the Mainland, '''they are however, deemed as foreigners administratively when opening or investing in businesses or purchasing real estates'''. Also, since November 2015, ROC nationals residing in [[Shanghai]] can enjoy the city's discounted health care, access to discounted public education, social insurance and pensions, among some other social services otherwise offered only to PRC nationals with ''[[Hukou system|hukou]]'' in Shanghai. These new rules have generated controversies due to the fact that most of these social services are not even accessible to PRC nationals with hukou outside Shanghai, as well as claims from [[Taiwanese independence]] supporters that the mainland authority is trying to establish Taiwan as an integral part of the PRC.<ref>{{cite web |title = \u53f0\u6e7e\u6c11\u4f17\u4eab\u4e0a\u6d77\u51c6\u5e02\u6c11\u5f85\u9047 \u65b0\u89c4\u5c06\u4e8e11\u67081\u65e5\u5b9e\u65bd |url = http://www.huaxia.com/xw/twxw/2015/09/4570187.html |website = \u534e\u590f\u7ecf\u7eac\u7f51 |access-date = 2015-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the ''Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area'' of the ROC, any [[Hukou system#Household registration in Taiwan|ROC national with Household Registration]] (ROC nationals with full citizenship rights in Taiwan) who obtains a passport issued to Mainland residents of the PRC or hukou of Mainland China, automatically loses his Household Registration in Taiwan, which in turn causes the loss of the person's citizenship rights in the ROC (since he or she has already obtained the ''de facto'' citizenship of Mainland China).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2017/07/31/2003675652|title=MAC urges public not to use Chinese passports - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com}}</ref> However, the person does not cease to be a ROC national and instead becomes a \"person of the Mainland area\" with ROC nationality, in addition to PRC nationality he acquires.<ref name=\"Mainland\" /> It is worth-noting that there are no similar legal restrictions for ROC nationals to obtain the permanent resident status of Hong Kong or Macau.

In 2015, Chinese nationals with ''hukou'' of Mainland China have visa-free or visa on arrival access to 45 countries and territories, ranking the Mainland Chinese passport 90th in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]]. Chinese nationals with Hong Kong permanent resident status, however, have visa-free or visa on arrival access to 152 countries and territories, while Chinese nationals with permanent status in Macau have access to 120 countries and territories. The HKSAR and MSAR passports are ranked at 20th and 36th place, respectively, by the Visa Restrictions Index. The high ranking of both passports can be attributed to the economic successes of both SARs, as well as the independent immigration policies from Mainland China under the [[One China, Two Systems]] policy.\n\nChinese nationals with hukou also need special permits and visa-like authorizations (locally known as [[Two-way permit]]s and exit endorsements) in order to visit Hong Kong and Macau, with a limit on the length of stay (normally 7 days) per trip; whilst Hong Kong and Macau residents need the [[Home Return Permit]] to visit Mainland China, although they are not subject to any limitations on the length of stay. Deportations between these territories are possible due to completely separate immigration regulations. These inner-country visa requirements make China unique as one of the few countries with different immigration controls within one country.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikisource|Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China}}\n* [[Chinese passport]]\n* [[Right of abode in Hong Kong]]\n* [[British nationality law and Hong Kong]]\n* [[British nationality law]]\n* [[Portuguese nationality law]]\n* [[Taiwanese nationality law]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n==== Publications ====\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Carroll |first=John |title=A Concise History of Hong Kong |year=2007 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D37ijXG-FykC |isbn=978-0-7425-3422-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Chuanbo |last2=Fan |first2=C.

Since July 2015, however, the PRC has amended the legislation to remove entry restrictions placed on ROC nationals, this includes the removal of the requirement to obtain entry endorsements as well as the 90-day stay limit per trip (the Travel Permit mentioned above is the only required document for travelling to Mainland China). '''ROC nationals are therefore generally free to enter the PRC and remain indefinitely.''' Currently ROC nationals can take up residence in the Mainland (PRC) without additional documentation and '''enjoy ''comparatively'' higher level of flexibility for employment than foreign nationals''', much like permanent residents of Hong Kong and Macau residing in the Mainland, '''they are however, deemed as foreigners administratively when opening or investing in businesses or purchasing real estates'''. Also, since November 2015, ROC nationals residing in [[Shanghai]] can enjoy the city's discounted health care, access to discounted public education, social insurance and pensions, among some other social services otherwise offered only to PRC nationals with ''[[Hukou system|hukou]]'' in Shanghai. These new rules have generated controversies due to the fact that most of these social services are not even accessible to PRC nationals with hukou outside Shanghai, as well as claims from [[Taiwanese independence]] supporters that the mainland authority is trying to establish Taiwan as an integral part of the PRC.<ref>{{cite web |title = \u53f0\u6e7e\u6c11\u4f17\u4eab\u4e0a\u6d77\u51c6\u5e02\u6c11\u5f85\u9047 \u65b0\u89c4\u5c06\u4e8e11\u67081\u65e5\u5b9e\u65bd |url = http://www.huaxia.com/xw/twxw/2015/09/4570187.html |website = \u534e\u590f\u7ecf\u7eac\u7f51 |access-date = 2015-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the ''Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area'' of the ROC, any [[Hukou system#Household registration in Taiwan|ROC national with Household Registration]] (ROC nationals with full citizenship rights in Taiwan) who obtains a passport issued to Mainland residents of the PRC or hukou of Mainland China, automatically loses his Household Registration in Taiwan, which in turn causes the loss of the person's citizenship rights in the ROC (since he or she has already obtained the ''de facto'' citizenship of Mainland China).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2017/07/31/2003675652|title=MAC urges public not to use Chinese passports - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com}}</ref> However, the person does not cease to be a ROC national and instead becomes a \"person of the Mainland area\" with ROC nationality, in addition to PRC nationality he acquires.<ref name=\"Mainland\" /> It is worth-noting that there are no similar legal restrictions for ROC nationals to obtain the permanent resident status of Hong Kong or Macau.

In 2015, Chinese nationals with ''hukou'' of Mainland China have visa-free or visa on arrival access to 45 countries and territories, ranking the Mainland Chinese passport 90th in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]]. Chinese nationals with Hong Kong permanent resident status, however, have visa-free or visa on arrival access to 152 countries and territories, while Chinese nationals with permanent status in Macau have access to 120 countries and territories. The HKSAR and MSAR passports are ranked at 20th and 36th place, respectively, by the Visa Restrictions Index. The high ranking of both passports can be attributed to the economic successes of both SARs, as well as the independent immigration policies from Mainland China under the [[One China, Two Systems]] policy.\n\nChinese nationals with hukou also need special permits and visa-like authorizations (locally known as [[Two-way permit]]s and exit endorsements) in order to visit Hong Kong and Macau, with a limit on the length of stay (normally 7 days) per trip; whilst Hong Kong and Macau residents need the [[Home Return Permit]] to visit Mainland China, although they are not subject to any limitations on the length of stay. Deportations between these territories are possible due to completely separate immigration regulations. These inner-country visa requirements make China unique as one of the few countries with different immigration controls within one country.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikisource|Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China}}\n* [[Chinese passport]]\n* [[Right of abode in Hong Kong]]\n* [[British nationality law and Hong Kong]]\n* [[British nationality law]]\n* [[Portuguese nationality law]]\n* [[Taiwanese nationality law]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n==== Publications ====\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Carroll |first=John |title=A Concise History of Hong Kong |year=2007 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D37ijXG-FykC |isbn=978-0-7425-3422-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Chuanbo |last2=Fan |first2=C.

Independent films are sometimes distinguishable by their content and style and the way in which the filmmakers' personal artistic vision is realized.

Waterworld II\u2014no.}} by Peter Callahan. 2001</ref>\n\nGenerally, the marketing of independent films is characterized by [[limited release]], often at [[independent movie theater]]s, but they can also have major marketing campaigns and a [[wide release]]. Independent films are often screened at local, national, or international [[film festivals]] before distribution (theatrical or retail release). An independent film production can rival a [[mainstream]] film production if it has the necessary funding and distribution.\n\n==History==\n===Edison Trust===\n{{Main|Edison Trust}}\nIn 1908, the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] or \"Edison Trust\" was formed as a [[trust (19th century)|trust]]. The Trust was a [[cartel]] that held a monopoly on film production and distribution comprising all the major film companies of the time ([[Edison Studios|Edison]], [[Biograph Studios|Biograph]], [[Vitagraph Studios|Vitagraph]], [[Essanay Studios|Essanay]], [[Selig Studios|Selig]], [[Lubin Studios|Lubin]], [[Kalem Studios|Kalem]], [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s|American Star]], [[Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res|American Path\u00e9]]), the leading distributor ([[George Kleine]]) and the biggest supplier of raw film, [[Eastman Kodak]]. A number of filmmakers declined or were refused membership to the trust and came to be described as \"independent\".\n\nAt the time of the formation of the MPPC, [[Thomas Edison]] owned most of the major [[patent]]s relating to motion pictures, including that for [[film stock|raw film]]. The MPPC vigorously enforced its patents, constantly bringing [[Lawsuit|suits]] and receiving injunctions against independent filmmakers. Because of this, a number of filmmakers responded by building their own cameras and moving their operations to [[Hollywood, California]], where the distance from Edison's home base of [[New Jersey]] made it more difficult for the MPPC to enforce its patents.<ref>\"La-La Land: The Origins\" Peter Edidin. ''[[New York Times]]''. New York, N.Y.: August 21, 2005. pg. 4.2. \"Los Angeles's distance from New York was also comforting to independent film producers, making it easier for them to avoid being harassed or sued by the Motion Picture Patents Company, AKA the Trust, which Thomas Edison helped create in 1909.\"</ref>\n\nThe Edison Trust was soon ended by two decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]: one in 1912, which canceled the patent on raw film, and a second in 1915, which cancelled all MPPC patents. Though these decisions succeeded at legalizing independent film, they would do little to remedy the ''[[de facto]]'' ban on small productions; the independent filmmakers who had fled to [[Southern California]] during the enforcement of the trust had already laid the groundwork for the [[studio system]] of [[classical Hollywood cinema]].\n\n===Studio system===\nIn early 1910, director [[D.W. Griffith]] was sent by the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph Company]] to the west coast with his acting troupe, consisting of performers [[Blanche Sweet]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], and others. They began filming on a vacant lot near Georgia Street in downtown [[Los Angeles]]. While there, the company decided to explore new territories, traveling several miles north to [[Hollywood]], a little village that was friendly and positive about the movie company filming there. Griffith then filmed the first movie ever shot in Hollywood, ''[[In Old California (1910 film)|In Old California]]'', a Biograph melodrama about [[California]] in the 1800s, while it belonged to Mexico. Biograph stayed there for months and made several films before returning to New York.\n\nDuring the Edison era of the early 1900s, many [[Jew]]ish immigrants had found jobs in the U.S. film industry. Under the Edison Trust, they were able to make their mark in a brand-new business: the exhibition of films in storefront theaters called [[Nickelodeon movie theater|nickelodeons]]. Within a few years, ambitious men like [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[Carl Laemmle]], [[Adolph Zukor]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], and the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] (Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack) had switched to the production side of the business. After hearing about Biograph's success in Hollywood, in 1913 many such would-be movie-makers headed west to avoid the fees imposed by Edison. Soon they were the heads of a new kind of enterprise: the [[movie studio]].\n\nBy establishing a new system of production, distribution, and exhibition which was independent of The Edison Trust in New York, these studios opened up new horizons for [[Cinema of the United States|cinema in the United States]]. The Hollywood oligopoly replaced the Edison monopoly. Within this new system, a [[pecking order]] was soon established which left little room for any newcomers. By the mid-1930s, at the top were the five major studios, [[20th Century Fox]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[RKO Pictures]], and [[Warner Bros.]] Then came three smaller companies, [[Columbia Pictures]], [[United Artists]], and [[Universal Studios]]. Finally there was \"[[Poverty Row]]\", a catch all term used to encompass any other smaller studio that managed to fight their way up into the increasingly exclusive movie business.\n\nWhile the small studios that made up Poverty Row could be characterized as existing \"independently\" of any major studio, they utilized the same kind of vertically and horizontally integrated systems of business as the larger players in the game. Though the eventual breakup of the studio system and its restrictive chain-theater distribution network would leave independent movie houses eager for the kind of populist, seat-filling product of the Poverty Row studios, that same paradigm shift would also lead to the decline and ultimate disappearance of \"Poverty Row\" as a Hollywood phenomenon. While the kinds of films produced by Poverty Row studios only grew in popularity, they would eventually become increasingly available both from major production companies and from independent producers who no longer needed to rely on a studio's ability to package and release their work.\n\nThis table lists the companies active in late 1935<!-- TCF was created from a merger in this year. --> illustrates the categories commonly used to characterize the Hollywood system.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Big Five majors\n!Little Three majors\n!Poverty Row (top four of many)\n|-\n|[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|[[United Artists]]\n|[[Grand National Films Inc.|Grand National]]\n|-\n|[[Paramount Pictures]]\n|[[Columbia Pictures]]\n|[[Republic Pictures]]\n|-\n|[[20th Century Fox]]\n|[[Universal Studios]]\n|[[Monogram Pictures]]\n|-\n|[[Warner Bros.]]\n|\n|[[Producers Releasing Corporation|Producers Releasing Corporation (a.k.a.

On February 5, 1919 four of the leading figures in American [[silent cinema]] ([[Mary Pickford]], [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], and [[D. W. Griffith]]) formed United Artists, the first independent studio in America. Each held a 20% stake, with the remaining 20% held by lawyer [[William Gibbs McAdoo]].<ref name=\"siklos\">Siklos, Richard (March 4, 2007). Mission Improbable: Tom Cruise as Mogul. ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> The idea for the venture originated with Fairbanks, Chaplin, Pickford, and cowboy star [[William S. Hart]] a year earlier as they were traveling around the U.S. selling [[Liberty bond]]s to help the [[World War I]] effort. Already veterans of Hollywood, the four film [[movie star|stars]] began to talk of forming their own company to better control their own work as well as their futures. They were spurred on by the actions of established Hollywood producers and distributors, who were making moves to tighten their control over their stars' salaries and creative license. With the addition of Griffith, planning began, but Hart bowed out before things had formalized. When he heard about their scheme, [[Richard A. Rowland]], head of [[Metro Pictures]], is said to have observed, \"The inmates are taking over the asylum.\"\n\nThe four partners, with advice from McAdoo (son-in-law and former [[U.S. Secretary of State|Treasury Secretary]] of then-President [[Woodrow Wilson]]), formed their distribution company, with [[Hiram Abrams]] as its first managing director. The original terms called for Pickford, Fairbanks, Griffith and Chaplin to independently produce five pictures each year, but by the time the company got under way in 1920\u20131921, [[feature films]] were becoming more expensive and more polished, and running times had settled at around ninety minutes (or eight reels). It was believed that no one, no matter how popular, could produce and star in five quality feature films a year. By 1924, Griffith had dropped out and the company was facing a crisis: either bring in others to help support a costly distribution system or concede defeat. The veteran producer [[Joseph Schenck]] was hired as president. Not only had he been producing pictures for a decade, but he brought along commitments for films starring his wife, [[Norma Talmadge]], his sister-in-law, [[Constance Talmadge]], and his brother-in-law, [[Buster Keaton]]. Contracts were signed with a number of independent producers, especially [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[Howard Hughes]] and later [[Alexander Korda]]. Schenck also formed a separate partnership with Pickford and Chaplin to buy and build theaters under the United Artists name.\n\nStill, even with a broadening of the company, UA struggled. The [[Sound film|coming of sound]] ended the careers of Pickford and Fairbanks. Chaplin, rich enough to do what he pleased, worked only occasionally. Schenck resigned in 1933 to organize a new company with [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], [[Twentieth Century Pictures]], which soon provided four pictures a year to UA's schedule. He was replaced as president by sales manager [[Al Lichtman]] who himself resigned after only a few months. Pickford produced a few films, and at various times Goldwyn, Korda, [[Walt Disney]], [[Walter Wanger]], and [[David O. Selznick]] were made \"producing partners\" (i.e., sharing in the profits), but ownership still rested with the founders. As the years passed and the dynamics of the business changed, these \"producing partners\"  drifted away. Goldwyn and Disney left for [[RKO]], Wanger for [[Universal Pictures]], and Selznick for [[retirement]]. By the late 1940s, United Artists had virtually ceased to exist as either a producer or distributor.\n\n===Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers===\n{{Main|Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers}}\nIn 1941, [[Mary Pickford]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[David O. Selznick]], [[Alexander Korda]], and [[Walter Wanger]]\u2014many of the same people who were members of United Artists\u2014founded the [[Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers]]. Later members included [[William Cagney]], [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Hal Roach]]. The Society aimed to preserve the rights of independent producers in an industry overwhelmingly controlled by the studio system. SIMPP fought to end [[monopolistic]] practices by the five major Hollywood studios which controlled the production, distribution, and exhibition of films. In 1942, the SIMPP filed an antitrust suit against Paramount's United Detroit Theatres. The complaint accused Paramount of conspiracy to control first-run and subsequent-run theaters in Detroit. It was the first [[United States antitrust law|antitrust suit]] brought by producers against exhibitors alleging monopoly and restraint of trade. In 1948, the [[United States Supreme Court]] [[Paramount Decision]] ordered the Hollywood [[movie studios]] to sell their theater chains and to eliminate certain anti-competitive practices. This effectively brought an end to the studio system of [[Golden Age of Hollywood|Hollywood's Golden Age]]. By 1958, many of the reasons for creating the SIMPP had been corrected and SIMPP closed its offices.\n\n===Low-budget films===\n{{Main|Low-budget film}}\nThe efforts of the SIMPP and the advent of inexpensive portable cameras during [[World War II]] effectively made it possible for any person in America with an interest in making films to write, produce, and direct one without the aid of any [[major film studio]]. These circumstances soon resulted in a number of critically acclaimed and highly influential works, including [[Maya Deren]]'s ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' in 1943, Kenneth Anger's ''[[Fireworks (1947 film)|Fireworks]]'' in 1947, and Morris Engel, Ruth Orkin and Ray Abrashkin's ''[[Little Fugitive (1953 film)|Little Fugitive]]'' in 1953. Filmmakers such as [[Ken Jacobs]] with little or no formal training began to experiment with new ways of making and shooting films.\n\n''Little Fugitive'' became the first independent film to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] at the American [[Academy Award]]s.<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1954 1954|Oscars.org]</ref> It also received Silver Lion at [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]]. Both Engel and Anger's films won acclaim overseas from the burgeoning [[French New Wave]], with ''Fireworks'' inspiring praise and an invitation to study under him in Europe from [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] citing ''Little Fugitive'' as an essential inspiration to his seminal work, ''[[The 400 Blows]]''. As the 1950s progressed, the new low-budget paradigm of filmmaking gained increased recognition internationally, with films such as [[Satyajit Ray]]'s critically acclaimed<ref name=bfipoll>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/history/1992.html |title=The Sight & Sound Top Ten Poll: 1992 |work=[[Sight & Sound]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=2008-05-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309164155/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/history/1992.html |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/take/one/full_list.php3?category=10 |title=Take One: The First Annual Village Voice Film Critics' Poll |accessdate=2006-07-27|year=1999 |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826201343/http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/take/one/full_list.php3?category=10|archivedate= 2007-08-26}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made, [[New York Times]], 2002.]</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/the_complete_list.html|title=All-time 100 Movies|accessdate=2008-05-19|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc|date=2005-02-12}}</ref> ''[[Apu Trilogy]]'' (1955\u20131959).\n\nUnlike the films made within the studio system, these new low-budget films could afford to take risks and explore new artistic territory outside the classical Hollywood narrative. Maya Deren was soon joined in New York by a crowd of like minded [[avant-garde film]]makers who were interested in creating [[art films|films as works of art]] rather than entertainment. Based upon a common belief that the \"official cinema\" was \"running out of breath\" and had become \"morally corrupt, aesthetically obsolete, thematically superficial, [and] temperamentally boring\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film-makerscoop.com/history.htm |title=The Film-Maker's Cooperative: A Brief History |accessdate=2008-05-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427100456/http://www.film-makerscoop.com/history.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2011 }}, [[The Film-Makers' Cooperative]]<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> this new crop of independents formed [[The Film-Makers' Cooperative]], an artist-run, non-profit organization which they would use to distribute their films through a centralized archive. Founded in 1962 by [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Shirley Clarke]], [[Gregory Markopoulos]], and others, the Cooperative provided an important outlet for many of cinema's creative luminaries in the 1960s, including [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] and [[Andy Warhol]]. When he returned to America, Ken Anger would debut many of his most important works there. Mekas and Brakhage would go on to found the [[Anthology Film Archives]] in 1970, which would likewise prove essential to the development and preservation of independent films, even to this day.\n\n===Exploitation boom and the MPAA rating system===\n{{Main|B movies (The exploitation boom)}}\nNot all low-budget films existed as non-commercial art ventures. The success of films like ''Little Fugitive'', which had been made with low (or sometimes [[no budget film|non-existent]]) budgets encouraged a huge boom in popularity for non-studio films. Low-budget film making promised exponentially greater returns (in terms of percentages) if the film could have a successful run in the theaters. During this time, independent producer/director [[Roger Corman]] began a sweeping body of work that would become legendary for its frugality and grueling shooting schedule. Until his so-called \"retirement\" as a director in 1971 (he continued to produce films even after this date) he would produce up to seven movies a year, matching and often exceeding the five-per-year schedule that the executives at United Artists had once thought impossible.\n\nLike those of the avante-garde, the films of [[Roger Corman]] took advantage of the fact that unlike the studio system, independent films had never been bound by its self-imposed [[production code]]. Corman's example (and that of others like him) would help start a [[B movies (The exploitation boom)|boom in independent B-movies]] in the 1960s, the principal aim of which was to bring in the [[youth marketing|youth market]] which the major studios had lost touch with. By promising [[Sex in film|sex]], wanton [[violence in film|violence]], [[Drug movie|drug use]], and [[nudity in film|nudity]], these films hoped to draw audiences to independent theaters by offering to show them what the major studios could not. [[Horror films|Horror]] and [[science fiction films]] experienced a period of tremendous growth during this time. As these tiny producers, theaters, and distributors continued to attempt to undercut one another, the B-grade shlock film soon fell to the level of the [[Z movie]], a niche category of films with production values so low that they became a spectacle in their own right. The [[cult film|cult]] audiences these pictures attracted soon made them ideal candidates for [[midnight movie]] screenings revolving around [[audience participation]] and [[cosplay]].\n\nIn 1968, a young filmmaker named [[George A. Romero]] shocked audiences with ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', a new kind of intense and unforgiving independent horror film. This film was released just after the abandonment of the production code, but before the adoption of the [[MPAA rating system]]. As such, it was the first and last film of its kind to enjoy a completely unrestricted screening, in which young children were able to witness Romero's new brand of highly realistic gore. This film would help to set the climate of independent horror for decades to come, as films like ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980) continued to push the envelope.\n\nWith the production code abandoned and violent and disturbing films like Romero's gaining popularity, Hollywood opted to placate the uneasy filmgoing public with the MPAA ratings system, which would place restrictions on ticket sales to young people. Unlike the production code, this rating system posed a threat to independent films in that it would affect the number of tickets they could sell and cut into the [[grindhouse]] cinema's share of the youth market. This change would further widen the divide between commercial and non-commercial films.\n\nHowever, having a film audience-classified is strictly voluntary for independents and there's no legal impediment to releasing movies on an unrated basis. However, unrated movies face obstacles in marketing because media outlets such as TV channels, newspapers and websites often place their own restrictions on movies that don't come with a built-in national rating in order to avoid presenting movies to inappropriately young audiences.<ref>Marich, Robert. Marketing To Moviegoers: Third Edition (2013). SIU Press books. p 350</ref>\n\n===New Hollywood and independent filmmaking===\n{{Main|New Hollywood}}\nFollowing the advent of [[television]] and the [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|Paramount Case]], the major studios attempted to lure audiences with spectacle. [[Widescreen]] processes and technical improvements, such as [[Cinemascope]], [[stereo]] sound, [[3-D film#The \"golden era\" (1952\u20131955)|3-D]] and others, were developed in an attempt to retain the dwindling audience by giving them a larger-than-life experience. The 1950s and early 1960s saw a Hollywood dominated by musicals, historical epics, and other films which benefited from these advances. This proved commercially viable during most of the 1950s. However, by the late 1960s, audience share was dwindling at an alarming rate. Several costly flops, including ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963) and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1969) put severe strain on the studios. Meanwhile, in 1951, lawyers-turned-producers [[Arthur Krim]] and [[Robert Benjamin]] had made a deal with the remaining stockholders of United Artists which would allow them to make an attempt to revive the company and, if the attempt was successful, buy it after five years.\n\nThe attempt was a success, and in 1955 United Artists became the first \"studio\" without an actual studio. UA leased space at the Pickford/Fairbanks Studio, but did not own a studio lot as such. Because of this, many of their films would be shot on location. Primarily acting as bankers, they offered money to independent producers. Thus UA did not have the overhead, the maintenance or the expensive production staff which ran up costs at other studios. UA went public in 1956, and as the other mainstream studios fell into decline, UA prospered, adding relationships with the [[Mirisch]] brothers, [[Billy Wilder]], [[Joseph E. Levine]] and others.\n\nBy the late 1950s, RKO had ceased film production, and the remaining four of big five had recognized that they did not know how to reach the youth audience. In an attempt to capture this audience, the Studios hired a host of young filmmakers (many of whom were mentored by [[Roger Corman]]) and allowed them to make their films with relatively little studio control. Warner Brothers offered first-time producer [[Warren Beatty]] 40% of the gross on his film ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967) instead of a minimal fee. The movie had grossed over $70 million worldwide by 1973. This initial successes paved the way for the studio to relinquish almost complete control to the [[film school generation]] and began what the media dubbed \"[[New Hollywood]].\"\n\n[[Dennis Hopper]], the American actor, made his writing and directing debut with ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969). Along with his producer/co-star/co-writer [[Peter Fonda]], Hopper was responsible for one of the first completely independent film of New Hollywood. ''Easy Rider'' debuted at [[Cannes film festival|Cannes]] and garnered the \"First Film Award\" ({{lang-fr|Prix de la premiere oeuvre}}) after which it received two Oscar nominations, one for best original screenplay and one for Corman-alum [[Jack Nicholson]]'s breakthrough performance in the supporting role of George Hanson, an alcoholic lawyer for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. Following on the heels of ''Easy Rider'' shortly afterwards was the revived United Artists' ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (also 1969), which, like ''Easy Rider'', took numerous cues from Ken Anger and his influences in the French New Wave. It became the first and only [[X rated]] film to win the Academy Award for best picture. ''Midnight Cowboy'' also held the distinction of featuring [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] roles by many of the top [[Warhol superstars]], who had already become symbols of the militantly anti-Hollywood climate of NYC's independent film community.\n\nWithin a month, another young Corman trainee, [[Francis Ford Coppola]], made his debut in [[Spain]] at the [[Donostia-San Sebastian International Film Festival]] with ''[[The Rain People]]'' (1969), a film he had produced through his own company, [[American Zoetrope]]. Though ''The Rain People'' was largely overlooked by American audiences, Zoetrope would become a powerful force in New Hollywood. Through Zoetrope, Coppola formed a distribution agreement with studio giant Warner Bros., which he would exploit to achieve wide releases for his films without making himself subject to their control. These three films provided the major Hollywood studios with both an example to follow and a new crop of talent to draw from. Zoetrope co-founder [[George Lucas]] made his feature film debut with ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971), also released by Zoetrope through their deal with Warner Bros., announcing himself as another major talent of New Hollywood. By the following year, two New Hollywood directors had become sufficiently established for Coppola to be offered oversight of Paramount's ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and Lucas had obtained studio funding for ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973) from Universal. In the mid-1970s, the major Hollywood studios continued to tap these new filmmakers for both ideas and personnel, producing films such as ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'' (1973) and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), all of which met with critical and commercial success. These successes by the members of New Hollywood led each of them in turn to make more and more extravagant demands, both on the studio and eventually on the audience.\n\nWhile most members of the New Hollywood generation were, or started out as, independent filmmakers, a number of their projects were produced and released by major studios. The New Hollywood generation soon became firmly entrenched in a revived incarnation of the studio system, which financed the development, production and distribution of their films. Very few of these filmmakers ever independently financed or independently released a film of their own, or ever worked on an independently financed production during the height of the generation's influence. Seemingly independent films such as ''Taxi Driver'', ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' and others were studio films: the scripts were based on studio pitches and subsequently paid for by the studios, the production financing was from the studio, and the marketing and distribution of the films were designed and controlled by the studio's advertising agency. Though Coppola made considerable efforts to resist the influence of the studios, opting to finance his risky 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' himself rather than compromise with skeptical studio executives, he, and filmmakers like him, had saved the old studios from financial ruin by providing them with a new formula for success.\n\nIndeed, it was during this period that the very definition of an independent film became blurred. Though ''Midnight Cowboy'' was financed by United Artists, the company was certainly a studio. Likewise, Zoetrope was another \"independent studio\" which worked within the system to make a space for independent directors who needed funding. George Lucas would leave Zoetrope in 1971 to create his own independent studio, [[Lucasfilm]], which would produce the [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' franchises. In fact, the only two movies of the movement which can be described as uncompromisingly independent are ''Easy Rider'' at the beginning, and [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[They All Laughed]]'', at the end. [[Peter Bogdanovich]] bought back the rights from the studio to his 1980 film and paid for its distribution out of his own pocket, convinced that the picture was better than what the studio believed \u2014 he eventually went bankrupt because of this.\n\nIn retrospect, it can be seen that [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) and [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) marked the beginning of the end for the New Hollywood. With their unprecedented box-office successes, these movies jump-started Hollywood's [[blockbuster mentality]], giving studios a new paradigm as to how to make money in this changing commercial landscape. The focus on [[high-concept]] premises, with greater concentration on tie-in merchandise (such as toys), spin-offs into other media (such as soundtracks), and the use of sequels (which had been made more respectable by Coppola's ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''), all showed the studios how to make money in the new environment.\n\nOn realizing how much money could potentially be made in films, major [[corporations]] started buying up the remaining Hollywood studios, saving them from the oblivion which befell RKO in the 50s. Eventually, even RKO was revived. The corporate mentality these companies brought to the filmmaking business would slowly squeeze out the more idiosyncratic of these young filmmakers, while ensconcing the more malleable and commercially successful of them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.raindance.org/what-is-independent-film/|title=What Is Independent Film? \u2013 Raindance|date=2014-01-19|work=Raindance|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> Like the original independents who fled the Edison Trust to form old Hollywood, the young film school graduates who had fled the studios to explore on-location shooting and dynamic, [[Italian neo-realism|neo-realist]] styles and structures ended up replacing the tyrants they had sought to dislodge with a more stable and all-pervasive base of power.\n\n===Outside Hollywood===\n\nDuring the 1970s, shifts in thematic depictions of sexuality and violence occurred in American cinema, prominently featuring heightened depictions of realistic sex and violence. Directors who wished to reach mainstream audiences of [[Old Hollywood]] quickly learned to [[Aestheticization of violence|stylize]] these themes to make their films appealing and attractive rather than repulsive or obscene. However, at the same time that the maverick film students of the [[American New Wave]] were developing the skills they would use to take over Hollywood, many of their peers had begun to develop their style of filmmaking in a different direction. Influenced by foreign and [[Art film|art house]] directors such as [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]],exploitation shockers (i.e. [[Joseph P. Mawra]], [[Michael Findlay]], and [[Henri Pachard]]) and avant-garde cinema, ([[Kenneth Anger]], [[Maya Deren]]) a number of young film makers began to experiment with transgression not as a box-office draw, but [[Transgressive art|as an artistic act]]. Directors such as [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] and [[David Lynch]] would make a name for themselves by the early 1970s for the bizarre and often disturbing imagery which characterized their films.\n\nWhen Lynch's first feature film, ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977), brought Lynch to the attention of producer [[Mel Brooks]], he soon found himself in charge of the $5 million film ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980) for Paramount. Though ''Eraserhead'' was strictly an out-of-pocket, low-budget, independent film, Lynch made the transition with unprecedented grace. The film was a huge commercial success, and earned eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] nods for Lynch. It also established his place as a commercially viable, if somewhat dark and unconventional, [[Hollywood]] director. Seeing Lynch as a fellow studio convert, [[George Lucas]], a fan of ''Eraserhead'' and now the darling of the studios, offered Lynch the opportunity to direct his next ''[[Star Wars]]'' sequel, ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983). However, Lynch had seen what had happened to Lucas and his comrades in arms after their failed attempt to do away with the studio system. He refused the opportunity, stating that he would rather work on his own projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html |title=David Lynch interview 1985 |publisher=Davidlynch.de |accessdate=2013-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011151810/http://davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html |archive-date=2010-10-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLynch instead chose to direct a big budget adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[science fiction]] [[novel]] ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' for [[Italy|Italian]] producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]]'s [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]], on the condition that the company release a second Lynch project, over which the director would have complete creative control. Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be the next ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', Lynch's ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'' (1984) was a critical and commercial flop, grossing a mere $27.4 million domestically against a $45 million budget. De Laurentiis, furious that the film had been a commercial disaster, was then forced to produce any film Lynch desired. He offered Lynch only $6 million in order to minimize the risk if the film had failed to recoup its costs; however, the film,  ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986) was a resounding success. Lynch subsequently returned to independent filmmaking, and did not work with another major studio for over a decade.\n\nUnlike the former, John Waters released most of his films during his early life through his own production company, [[Dreamlanders|Dreamland Productions]]. In the early 1980s, [[New Line Cinema]] agreed to work with him on ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' (1981). During the 1980s, Waters would become a pillar of the New York\u2013based independent film movement known as the \"[[Cinema of Transgression]]\", a term coined by [[Nick Zedd]] in 1985 to describe a loose-knit group of like-minded New York artists using [[shock value]] and [[humor]] in their [[super 8mm|Super 8 mm]] films and [[video art]]. Other key players in this movement included [[Kembra Pfahler]], [[Casandra Stark]], [[Beth B]], Tommy Turner, [[Richard Kern]] and [[Lydia Lunch]]. Rallying around such institutions as the Film-Makers' Cooperative and Anthology Film Archives, this new generation of independents devoted themselves to the defiance of the now-establishment New Hollywood, proposing that \"all film schools be blown up and all boring films never be made again.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/film/transgression.html |title=UbuWeb Film & Video: The Cinema of Transgression |publisher=Ubu.com |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref>\n\nThe development of no-budget film production company [[ASS Studios]] in 2011 brought guerrilla style tactics to their filmmaking. Founded by Courtney Fathom Sell & [[Reverend Jen Miller]], the now-defunct studio would utilize local performers and locations from the [[Lower East Side]] of [[New York City]] to create various short films which would then be screened in venues such as bars and [[Anthology Film Archives]]. Though mainly recognized for their short films, the studios' first and only feature [[Satan, Hold My Hand]] was made on a budget of just $27.00 while featuring an A-list Hollywood cast including [[Janeane Garofalo]] and was Produced by [[Jonathan Ames]], writer and creator of the [[HBO]] series [[Bored to Death]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/27295-courtney-fathom-sells-hi-8-high-life/|title=Courtney Fathom Sell's Hi-8 High Life|author=Scott Macaulay|work=Filmmaker Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/article/my_top_5_slightly_illegal_tips_for_no-budget_filmmakers|title=My Top 5 Slightly Illegal Tips For No-Budget Filmmakers|date=5 August 2011|work=Indiewire}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/29016-so-you-wanna-be-an-underground-filmmaker/|title=Courtney Fathom Sell: So You Wanna Be an Underground Filmmaker?|author=Scott Macaulay|work=Filmmaker Magazine}}</ref>\n\n===Independent Cinema movement===\n{{Further|Sundance Institute}}\nIn 1978, [[Sterling Van Wagenen]] and [[Charles Gary Allison]], with Chairperson [[Robert Redford]], (veteran of New Hollywood and star of ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'') founded the [[Utah/US Film Festival]] in an effort to attract more filmmakers to Utah and showcase what the potential of independent film could be. At the time, the main focus of the event was to present a series of retrospective films and filmmaker panel discussions; however it also included a small program of new independent films. The jury of the 1978 festival was headed by [[Charles Gary Allison|Gary Allison]], and included [[Verna Fields]], [[Linwood Gale Dunn]], [[Katharine Ross|Katherine Ross]], [[Charles E. Sellier Jr.]], [[Mark Rydell]], and [[Anthea Sylbert]]. In 1981, the same year that United Artists, bought out by MGM, ceased to exist as a venue for independent filmmakers, Sterling Van Wagenen left the film festival to help found the [[Sundance Institute]] with Robert Redford. In 1985, the now well-established Sundance Institute, headed by Sterling Van Wagenen, took over management of the US Film Festival, which was experiencing financial difficulties. [[Gary Beer]] and Sterling Van Wagenen spearheaded production of the inaugural Sundance Film Festival which included Program Director Tony Safford and Administrative Director Jenny Walz Selby.\n\nIn 1991, the festival was officially renamed the ''Sundance Film Festival'', after Redford's famous role as [[The Sundance Kid]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Lauren David Peden|title=Sundance Subdued|url=http://www.coastmagazine.com/archive/pre_dec05/travel_sundance.html|date=December 2005|publisher=Freedom Orange County Information (coastmagazine.com)|accessdate=2007-11-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202623/http://www.coastmagazine.com/archive/pre_dec05/travel_sundance.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> Through this festival the '''Independent Cinema movement''' was launched.

The third category comprised over half the features released in the United States and usually cost between $5 and $10 million to produce.<ref>McDonald, Paul and Wasco, Janet. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry. Malden, MA, US: Blackwell Publishing, 2008. p 30-31</ref>\n\nHollywood was producing these three different classes of feature films by means of three different types of producers. The superior products were the large, budget blockbusters and high-cost star vehicles marketed by the six major studio producer-distributors. Budgets on the major studios' pictures averaged $100 million, with approximately one-third of it spent on marketing because of the large release campaigns. Another class of Hollywood feature film included art films, specialty films, and other niche-market fare controlled by the conglomerates' indie subsidiaries. Budgets on these indie films averaged $40 million per release in the early 2000s, with $10 million to $15 million spent on marketing (MPA, 2006:12). The final class of film consisted of genre and specialty films administered by independent producer-distributors with only a few dozen or possibly a few hundred-release campaigns screens in select urban markets. Films like these usually cost less than $10 million, but frequently less than $5 million, with small marketing budgets that escalate if and when a particular film performs.<ref>McDonald, Paul and Wasco, Janet.

Oftentimes, aspiring filmmakers have other day-jobs to support themselves financially while they pitch their scripts and ideas to independent film production companies, talent agents, and wealthy investors.

Until digital alternatives became available, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was a major obstacle to independent filmmakers who wanted to make their own films. Successful films such as the ''[[Blair Witch Project]]'' (which grossed over 248.6 million USD while only spending 60,000 USD) have emerged from this new accessibility to filmmaking tools. In 2002, the cost of [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] [[Negative (photography)|film stock]] went up 23%, according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=\"VARIETY_2003\">[https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&articleid=VR1117895718&categoryid=10 Sharing Pix is Risky Business] variety.com. Retrieved June 23, 2007.</ref> The advent of consumer [[camcorder]]s in 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of [[digital video]] in the early 1990s, lowered the technology barrier to movie production. The [[personal computer]] and [[non-linear editing system]] have taken away the use of editing stands such as the KEM, dramatically reducing the costs of post-production, while technologies such as [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc]] and online video services have simplified distribution; [[video streaming]] services have made it possible to distribute a digital version of a film to an entire country or even the world, without involving shipping or warehousing of physical DVDs or film reels. [[3-D film|3-D]] technology is available to low-budget, independent filmmakers. \n\nOne of the examples of such a new indie approach to filmmaking is the 1999 Oscar-nominated documentary film ''[[Genghis Blues]]'' that was shot by the Belic brothers on two Hi8 consumer camcorders and won that year's Sundance Film Festival Audience Award for a Documentary. The movie had to be \"filmed out\" from interlaced digital video format to film running at traditional 24-frame per second rate, so interlacing artefacts are noticeable at times. In 2004 Panasonic released the DVX100 camcorder, which featured film-like 24-frame per second shooting rate. This gave independent filmmakers the ability to shoot video at frame rate considered standard for movies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmaking.net/faq/answers/faq172.asp |title=Internet Filmmaker's FAQ : |publisher=filmmaking.net |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref> and opened the possibility of clean digital frame to film frame conversion. Several acclaimed films were made with this camera, for example ''[[Iraq in Fragments]]''.\n\nEven though new cinema camera such as the [[Arriflex Alexa|Arri Alexa]], [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED]] Epic, and the many new [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLRs]] cost thousands of dollars to purchase, independent films are still cheaper than ever, creating footage that looks like 35 mm film without the same high cost. These cameras also perform better than traditional film because of its ability to perform in extremely dark/low light situations. In 2008 Canon released the first DSLR camera that could shoot full HD video, the [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]]. With the sensor larger than on a traditional camcorder, these DSLRs allow for a greater control over depth of field, great low-light capabilities, and a large variety of exchangeable lenses, including lenses from old film cameras \u2013 things which independent filmmakers have been longing {{not a typo|for for}} years. With the creation of new, light-weight and accessible cinema cameras, documentaries have also benefitted greatly. It was previously impossible to capture the extreme wild of mother nature because of the lack of maneuverability with film cameras; however, with the creation of DSLRs documentary filmmakers were able to reach hard to get places in order to capture what they couldn't have with film cameras.<ref>Eric Escobar from NAB, We Are All Geeks Now</ref>\n\nIn addition to new digital cameras, independent film makers are benefitting from the new editing software. Instead of needing a post-house to do the editing, independent film makers can now use a personal computer and cheap editing software to edit their films. Editing software available include [[Avid Media Composer]], [[Adobe Premiere Pro]], [[Final Cut Pro]], (Color Grading Software) [[DaVinci Resolve]], and [[List of video editing software|many more]]. There are also many free tutorials and courses available online to teach different post production skills needed to use these programs. These new technologies allow independent film makers to create films that are comparable to high-budget films.\n\n[[Francis Ford Coppola]], long an advocate of new technologies like [[non-linear editing system|non-linear editing]] and [[digital cameras]], said in 2007 that \"cinema is escaping being controlled by the financier, and that's a wonderful thing. You don't have to go hat-in-hand to some film distributor and say, 'Please will you let me make a movie?'\"<ref name=\"FFC quote\">{{cite book\n | last = Kirsner\n | first = Scott\n | title =

Independent films are often screened at local, national, or international [[film festivals]] before distribution (theatrical or retail release). An independent film production can rival a [[mainstream]] film production if it has the necessary funding and distribution.\n\n==History==\n===Edison Trust===\n{{Main|Edison Trust}}\nIn 1908, the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] or \"Edison Trust\" was formed as a [[trust (19th century)|trust]]. The Trust was a [[cartel]] that held a monopoly on film production and distribution comprising all the major film companies of the time ([[Edison Studios|Edison]], [[Biograph Studios|Biograph]], [[Vitagraph Studios|Vitagraph]], [[Essanay Studios|Essanay]], [[Selig Studios|Selig]], [[Lubin Studios|Lubin]], [[Kalem Studios|Kalem]], [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s|American Star]], [[Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res|American Path\u00e9]]), the leading distributor ([[George Kleine]]) and the biggest supplier of raw film, [[Eastman Kodak]]. A number of filmmakers declined or were refused membership to the trust and came to be described as \"independent\".\n\nAt the time of the formation of the MPPC, [[Thomas Edison]] owned most of the major [[patent]]s relating to motion pictures, including that for [[film stock|raw film]]. The MPPC vigorously enforced its patents, constantly bringing [[Lawsuit|suits]] and receiving injunctions against independent filmmakers. Because of this, a number of filmmakers responded by building their own cameras and moving their operations to [[Hollywood, California]], where the distance from Edison's home base of [[New Jersey]] made it more difficult for the MPPC to enforce its patents.<ref>\"La-La Land: The Origins\" Peter Edidin. ''[[New York Times]]''. New York, N.Y.: August 21, 2005. pg. 4.2. \"Los Angeles's distance from New York was also comforting to independent film producers, making it easier for them to avoid being harassed or sued by the Motion Picture Patents Company, AKA the Trust, which Thomas Edison helped create in 1909.\"</ref>\n\nThe Edison Trust was soon ended by two decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]: one in 1912, which canceled the patent on raw film, and a second in 1915, which cancelled all MPPC patents. Though these decisions succeeded at legalizing independent film, they would do little to remedy the ''[[de facto]]'' ban on small productions; the independent filmmakers who had fled to [[Southern California]] during the enforcement of the trust had already laid the groundwork for the [[studio system]] of [[classical Hollywood cinema]].\n\n===Studio system===\nIn early 1910, director [[D.W. Griffith]] was sent by the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph Company]] to the west coast with his acting troupe, consisting of performers [[Blanche Sweet]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], and others. They began filming on a vacant lot near Georgia Street in downtown [[Los Angeles]]. While there, the company decided to explore new territories, traveling several miles north to [[Hollywood]], a little village that was friendly and positive about the movie company filming there. Griffith then filmed the first movie ever shot in Hollywood, ''[[In Old California (1910 film)|In Old California]]'', a Biograph melodrama about [[California]] in the 1800s, while it belonged to Mexico. Biograph stayed there for months and made several films before returning to New York.\n\nDuring the Edison era of the early 1900s, many [[Jew]]ish immigrants had found jobs in the U.S. film industry. Under the Edison Trust, they were able to make their mark in a brand-new business: the exhibition of films in storefront theaters called [[Nickelodeon movie theater|nickelodeons]]. Within a few years, ambitious men like [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[Carl Laemmle]], [[Adolph Zukor]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], and the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] (Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack) had switched to the production side of the business. After hearing about Biograph's success in Hollywood, in 1913 many such would-be movie-makers headed west to avoid the fees imposed by Edison. Soon they were the heads of a new kind of enterprise: the [[movie studio]].\n\nBy establishing a new system of production, distribution, and exhibition which was independent of The Edison Trust in New York, these studios opened up new horizons for [[Cinema of the United States|cinema in the United States]]. The Hollywood oligopoly replaced the Edison monopoly. Within this new system, a [[pecking order]] was soon established which left little room for any newcomers. By the mid-1930s, at the top were the five major studios, [[20th Century Fox]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[RKO Pictures]], and [[Warner Bros.]] Then came three smaller companies, [[Columbia Pictures]], [[United Artists]], and [[Universal Studios]]. Finally there was \"[[Poverty Row]]\", a catch all term used to encompass any other smaller studio that managed to fight their way up into the increasingly exclusive movie business.\n\nWhile the small studios that made up Poverty Row could be characterized as existing \"independently\" of any major studio, they utilized the same kind of vertically and horizontally integrated systems of business as the larger players in the game. Though the eventual breakup of the studio system and its restrictive chain-theater distribution network would leave independent movie houses eager for the kind of populist, seat-filling product of the Poverty Row studios, that same paradigm shift would also lead to the decline and ultimate disappearance of \"Poverty Row\" as a Hollywood phenomenon. While the kinds of films produced by Poverty Row studios only grew in popularity, they would eventually become increasingly available both from major production companies and from independent producers who no longer needed to rely on a studio's ability to package and release their work.\n\nThis table lists the companies active in late 1935<!-- TCF was created from a merger in this year. --> illustrates the categories commonly used to characterize the Hollywood system.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Big Five majors\n!Little Three majors\n!Poverty Row (top four of many)\n|-\n|[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|[[United Artists]]\n|[[Grand National Films Inc.|Grand National]]\n|-\n|[[Paramount Pictures]]\n|[[Columbia Pictures]]\n|[[Republic Pictures]]\n|-\n|[[20th Century Fox]]\n|[[Universal Studios]]\n|[[Monogram Pictures]]\n|-\n|[[Warner Bros.]]\n|\n|[[Producers Releasing Corporation|Producers Releasing Corporation (a.k.a.

On February 5, 1919 four of the leading figures in American [[silent cinema]] ([[Mary Pickford]], [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], and [[D. W. Griffith]]) formed United Artists, the first independent studio in America. Each held a 20% stake, with the remaining 20% held by lawyer [[William Gibbs McAdoo]].<ref name=\"siklos\">Siklos, Richard (March 4, 2007). Mission Improbable: Tom Cruise as Mogul. ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> The idea for the venture originated with Fairbanks, Chaplin, Pickford, and cowboy star [[William S. Hart]] a year earlier as they were traveling around the U.S. selling [[Liberty bond]]s to help the [[World War I]] effort. Already veterans of Hollywood, the four film [[movie star|stars]] began to talk of forming their own company to better control their own work as well as their futures. They were spurred on by the actions of established Hollywood producers and distributors, who were making moves to tighten their control over their stars' salaries and creative license. With the addition of Griffith, planning began, but Hart bowed out before things had formalized. When he heard about their scheme, [[Richard A. Rowland]], head of [[Metro Pictures]], is said to have observed, \"The inmates are taking over the asylum.\"\n\nThe four partners, with advice from McAdoo (son-in-law and former [[U.S. Secretary of State|Treasury Secretary]] of then-President [[Woodrow Wilson]]), formed their distribution company, with [[Hiram Abrams]] as its first managing director. The original terms called for Pickford, Fairbanks, Griffith and Chaplin to independently produce five pictures each year, but by the time the company got under way in 1920\u20131921, [[feature films]] were becoming more expensive and more polished, and running times had settled at around ninety minutes (or eight reels). It was believed that no one, no matter how popular, could produce and star in five quality feature films a year. By 1924, Griffith had dropped out and the company was facing a crisis: either bring in others to help support a costly distribution system or concede defeat. The veteran producer [[Joseph Schenck]] was hired as president. Not only had he been producing pictures for a decade, but he brought along commitments for films starring his wife, [[Norma Talmadge]], his sister-in-law, [[Constance Talmadge]], and his brother-in-law, [[Buster Keaton]]. Contracts were signed with a number of independent producers, especially [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[Howard Hughes]] and later [[Alexander Korda]]. Schenck also formed a separate partnership with Pickford and Chaplin to buy and build theaters under the United Artists name.\n\nStill, even with a broadening of the company, UA struggled. The [[Sound film|coming of sound]] ended the careers of Pickford and Fairbanks. Chaplin, rich enough to do what he pleased, worked only occasionally. Schenck resigned in 1933 to organize a new company with [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], [[Twentieth Century Pictures]], which soon provided four pictures a year to UA's schedule. He was replaced as president by sales manager [[Al Lichtman]] who himself resigned after only a few months. Pickford produced a few films, and at various times Goldwyn, Korda, [[Walt Disney]], [[Walter Wanger]], and [[David O. Selznick]] were made \"producing partners\" (i.e., sharing in the profits), but ownership still rested with the founders. As the years passed and the dynamics of the business changed, these \"producing partners\"  drifted away. Goldwyn and Disney left for [[RKO]], Wanger for [[Universal Pictures]], and Selznick for [[retirement]]. By the late 1940s, United Artists had virtually ceased to exist as either a producer or distributor.\n\n===Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers===\n{{Main|Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers}}\nIn 1941, [[Mary Pickford]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[David O. Selznick]], [[Alexander Korda]], and [[Walter Wanger]]\u2014many of the same people who were members of United Artists\u2014founded the [[Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers]]. Later members included [[William Cagney]], [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Hal Roach]]. The Society aimed to preserve the rights of independent producers in an industry overwhelmingly controlled by the studio system. SIMPP fought to end [[monopolistic]] practices by the five major Hollywood studios which controlled the production, distribution, and exhibition of films. In 1942, the SIMPP filed an antitrust suit against Paramount's United Detroit Theatres. The complaint accused Paramount of conspiracy to control first-run and subsequent-run theaters in Detroit. It was the first [[United States antitrust law|antitrust suit]] brought by producers against exhibitors alleging monopoly and restraint of trade. In 1948, the [[United States Supreme Court]] [[Paramount Decision]] ordered the Hollywood [[movie studios]] to sell their theater chains and to eliminate certain anti-competitive practices. This effectively brought an end to the studio system of [[Golden Age of Hollywood|Hollywood's Golden Age]]. By 1958, many of the reasons for creating the SIMPP had been corrected and SIMPP closed its offices.\n\n===Low-budget films===\n{{Main|Low-budget film}}\nThe efforts of the SIMPP and the advent of inexpensive portable cameras during [[World War II]] effectively made it possible for any person in America with an interest in making films to write, produce, and direct one without the aid of any [[major film studio]]. These circumstances soon resulted in a number of critically acclaimed and highly influential works, including [[Maya Deren]]'s ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' in 1943, Kenneth Anger's ''[[Fireworks (1947 film)|Fireworks]]'' in 1947, and Morris Engel, Ruth Orkin and Ray Abrashkin's ''[[Little Fugitive (1953 film)|Little Fugitive]]'' in 1953. Filmmakers such as [[Ken Jacobs]] with little or no formal training began to experiment with new ways of making and shooting films.\n\n''Little Fugitive'' became the first independent film to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] at the American [[Academy Award]]s.<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1954 1954|Oscars.org]</ref> It also received Silver Lion at [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]]. Both Engel and Anger's films won acclaim overseas from the burgeoning [[French New Wave]], with ''Fireworks'' inspiring praise and an invitation to study under him in Europe from [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] citing ''Little Fugitive'' as an essential inspiration to his seminal work, ''[[The 400 Blows]]''. As the 1950s progressed, the new low-budget paradigm of filmmaking gained increased recognition internationally, with films such as [[Satyajit Ray]]'s critically acclaimed<ref name=bfipoll>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/history/1992.html |title=The Sight & Sound Top Ten Poll: 1992 |work=[[Sight & Sound]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=2008-05-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309164155/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/history/1992.html |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/take/one/full_list.php3?category=10 |title=Take One: The First Annual Village Voice Film Critics' Poll |accessdate=2006-07-27|year=1999 |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826201343/http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/take/one/full_list.php3?category=10|archivedate= 2007-08-26}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made, [[New York Times]], 2002.]</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/the_complete_list.html|title=All-time 100 Movies|accessdate=2008-05-19|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc|date=2005-02-12}}</ref> ''[[Apu Trilogy]]'' (1955\u20131959).\n\nUnlike the films made within the studio system, these new low-budget films could afford to take risks and explore new artistic territory outside the classical Hollywood narrative. Maya Deren was soon joined in New York by a crowd of like minded [[avant-garde film]]makers who were interested in creating [[art films|films as works of art]] rather than entertainment. Based upon a common belief that the \"official cinema\" was \"running out of breath\" and had become \"morally corrupt, aesthetically obsolete, thematically superficial, [and] temperamentally boring\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film-makerscoop.com/history.htm |title=The Film-Maker's Cooperative: A Brief History |accessdate=2008-05-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427100456/http://www.film-makerscoop.com/history.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2011 }}, [[The Film-Makers' Cooperative]]<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> this new crop of independents formed [[The Film-Makers' Cooperative]], an artist-run, non-profit organization which they would use to distribute their films through a centralized archive. Founded in 1962 by [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Shirley Clarke]], [[Gregory Markopoulos]], and others, the Cooperative provided an important outlet for many of cinema's creative luminaries in the 1960s, including [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] and [[Andy Warhol]]. When he returned to America, Ken Anger would debut many of his most important works there. Mekas and Brakhage would go on to found the [[Anthology Film Archives]] in 1970, which would likewise prove essential to the development and preservation of independent films, even to this day.\n\n===Exploitation boom and the MPAA rating system===\n{{Main|B movies (The exploitation boom)}}\nNot all low-budget films existed as non-commercial art ventures. The success of films like ''Little Fugitive'', which had been made with low (or sometimes [[no budget film|non-existent]]) budgets encouraged a huge boom in popularity for non-studio films. Low-budget film making promised exponentially greater returns (in terms of percentages) if the film could have a successful run in the theaters. During this time, independent producer/director [[Roger Corman]] began a sweeping body of work that would become legendary for its frugality and grueling shooting schedule. Until his so-called \"retirement\" as a director in 1971 (he continued to produce films even after this date) he would produce up to seven movies a year, matching and often exceeding the five-per-year schedule that the executives at United Artists had once thought impossible.\n\nLike those of the avante-garde, the films of [[Roger Corman]] took advantage of the fact that unlike the studio system, independent films had never been bound by its self-imposed [[production code]]. Corman's example (and that of others like him) would help start a [[B movies (The exploitation boom)|boom in independent B-movies]] in the 1960s, the principal aim of which was to bring in the [[youth marketing|youth market]] which the major studios had lost touch with. By promising [[Sex in film|sex]], wanton [[violence in film|violence]], [[Drug movie|drug use]], and [[nudity in film|nudity]], these films hoped to draw audiences to independent theaters by offering to show them what the major studios could not. [[Horror films|Horror]] and [[science fiction films]] experienced a period of tremendous growth during this time. As these tiny producers, theaters, and distributors continued to attempt to undercut one another, the B-grade shlock film soon fell to the level of the [[Z movie]], a niche category of films with production values so low that they became a spectacle in their own right. The [[cult movie|cult]] audiences these pictures attracted soon made them ideal candidates for [[midnight movie]] screenings revolving around [[audience participation]] and [[cosplay]].\n\nIn 1968, a young filmmaker named [[George A. Romero]] shocked audiences with ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', a new kind of intense and unforgiving independent horror film. This film was released just after the abandonment of the production code, but before the adoption of the [[MPAA rating system]]. As such, it was the first and last film of its kind to enjoy a completely unrestricted screening, in which young children were able to witness Romero's new brand of highly realistic gore. This film would help to set the climate of independent horror for decades to come, as films like ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980) continued to push the envelope.\n\nWith the production code abandoned and violent and disturbing films like Romero's gaining popularity, Hollywood opted to placate the uneasy filmgoing public with the MPAA ratings system, which would place restrictions on ticket sales to young people. Unlike the production code, this rating system posed a threat to independent films in that it would affect the number of tickets they could sell and cut into the [[grindhouse]] cinema's share of the youth market. This change would further widen the divide between commercial and non-commercial films.\n\nHowever, having a film audience-classified is strictly voluntary for independents and there's no legal impediment to releasing movies on an unrated basis. However, unrated movies face obstacles in marketing because media outlets such as TV channels, newspapers and websites often place their own restrictions on movies that don't come with a built-in national rating in order to avoid presenting movies to inappropriately young audiences.<ref>Marich, Robert. Marketing To Moviegoers: Third Edition (2013). SIU Press books. p 350</ref>\n\n===New Hollywood and independent filmmaking===\n{{Main|New Hollywood}}\nFollowing the advent of [[television]] and the [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|Paramount Case]], the major studios attempted to lure audiences with spectacle. [[Widescreen]] processes and technical improvements, such as [[Cinemascope]], [[stereo]] sound, [[3-D film#The \"golden era\" (1952\u20131955)|3-D]] and others, were developed in an attempt to retain the dwindling audience by giving them a larger-than-life experience. The 1950s and early 1960s saw a Hollywood dominated by musicals, historical epics, and other films which benefited from these advances. This proved commercially viable during most of the 1950s. However, by the late 1960s, audience share was dwindling at an alarming rate. Several costly flops, including ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963) and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1969) put severe strain on the studios. Meanwhile, in 1951, lawyers-turned-producers [[Arthur Krim]] and [[Robert Benjamin]] had made a deal with the remaining stockholders of United Artists which would allow them to make an attempt to revive the company and, if the attempt was successful, buy it after five years.\n\nThe attempt was a success, and in 1955 United Artists became the first \"studio\" without an actual studio. UA leased space at the Pickford/Fairbanks Studio, but did not own a studio lot as such. Because of this, many of their films would be shot on location. Primarily acting as bankers, they offered money to independent producers. Thus UA did not have the overhead, the maintenance or the expensive production staff which ran up costs at other studios. UA went public in 1956, and as the other mainstream studios fell into decline, UA prospered, adding relationships with the [[Mirisch]] brothers, [[Billy Wilder]], [[Joseph E. Levine]] and others.\n\nBy the late 1950s, RKO had ceased film production, and the remaining four of big five had recognized that they did not know how to reach the youth audience. In an attempt to capture this audience, the Studios hired a host of young filmmakers (many of whom were mentored by [[Roger Corman]]) and allowed them to make their films with relatively little studio control. Warner Brothers offered first-time producer [[Warren Beatty]] 40% of the gross on his film ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967) instead of a minimal fee. The movie had grossed over $70 million worldwide by 1973. This initial successes paved the way for the studio to relinquish almost complete control to the [[film school generation]] and began what the media dubbed \"[[New Hollywood]].\"\n\n[[Dennis Hopper]], the American actor, made his writing and directing debut with ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969). Along with his producer/co-star/co-writer [[Peter Fonda]], Hopper was responsible for one of the first completely independent film of New Hollywood. ''Easy Rider'' debuted at [[Cannes film festival|Cannes]] and garnered the \"First Film Award\" ({{lang-fr|Prix de la premiere oeuvre}}) after which it received two Oscar nominations, one for best original screenplay and one for Corman-alum [[Jack Nicholson]]'s breakthrough performance in the supporting role of George Hanson, an alcoholic lawyer for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. Following on the heels of ''Easy Rider'' shortly afterwards was the revived United Artists' ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (also 1969), which, like ''Easy Rider'', took numerous cues from Ken Anger and his influences in the French New Wave. It became the first and only [[X rated]] film to win the Academy Award for best picture. ''Midnight Cowboy'' also held the distinction of featuring [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] roles by many of the top [[Warhol superstars]], who had already become symbols of the militantly anti-Hollywood climate of NYC's independent film community.\n\nWithin a month, another young Corman trainee, [[Francis Ford Coppola]], made his debut in [[Spain]] at the [[Donostia-San Sebastian International Film Festival]] with ''[[The Rain People]]'' (1969), a film he had produced through his own company, [[American Zoetrope]]. Though ''The Rain People'' was largely overlooked by American audiences, Zoetrope would become a powerful force in New Hollywood. Through Zoetrope, Coppola formed a distribution agreement with studio giant Warner Bros., which he would exploit to achieve wide releases for his films without making himself subject to their control. These three films provided the major Hollywood studios with both an example to follow and a new crop of talent to draw from. Zoetrope co-founder [[George Lucas]] made his feature film debut with ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971), also released by Zoetrope through their deal with Warner Bros., announcing himself as another major talent of New Hollywood. By the following year, two New Hollywood directors had become sufficiently established for Coppola to be offered oversight of Paramount's ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and Lucas had obtained studio funding for ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973) from Universal. In the mid-1970s, the major Hollywood studios continued to tap these new filmmakers for both ideas and personnel, producing films such as ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'' (1973) and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), all of which met with critical and commercial success. These successes by the members of New Hollywood led each of them in turn to make more and more extravagant demands, both on the studio and eventually on the audience.\n\nWhile most members of the New Hollywood generation were, or started out as, independent filmmakers, a number of their projects were produced and released by major studios. The New Hollywood generation soon became firmly entrenched in a revived incarnation of the studio system, which financed the development, production and distribution of their films. Very few of these filmmakers ever independently financed or independently released a film of their own, or ever worked on an independently financed production during the height of the generation's influence. Seemingly independent films such as ''Taxi Driver'', ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' and others were studio films: the scripts were based on studio pitches and subsequently paid for by the studios, the production financing was from the studio, and the marketing and distribution of the films were designed and controlled by the studio's advertising agency. Though Coppola made considerable efforts to resist the influence of the studios, opting to finance his risky 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' himself rather than compromise with skeptical studio executives, he, and filmmakers like him, had saved the old studios from financial ruin by providing them with a new formula for success.\n\nIndeed, it was during this period that the very definition of an independent film became blurred. Though ''Midnight Cowboy'' was financed by United Artists, the company was certainly a studio. Likewise, Zoetrope was another \"independent studio\" which worked within the system to make a space for independent directors who needed funding. George Lucas would leave Zoetrope in 1971 to create his own independent studio, [[Lucasfilm]], which would produce the [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' franchises. In fact, the only two movies of the movement which can be described as uncompromisingly independent are ''Easy Rider'' at the beginning, and [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[They All Laughed]]'', at the end. [[Peter Bogdanovich]] bought back the rights from the studio to his 1980 film and paid for its distribution out of his own pocket, convinced that the picture was better than what the studio believed \u2014 he eventually went bankrupt because of this.\n\nIn retrospect, it can be seen that [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) and [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) marked the beginning of the end for the New Hollywood. With their unprecedented box-office successes, these movies jump-started Hollywood's [[blockbuster mentality]], giving studios a new paradigm as to how to make money in this changing commercial landscape. The focus on [[high-concept]] premises, with greater concentration on tie-in merchandise (such as toys), spin-offs into other media (such as soundtracks), and the use of sequels (which had been made more respectable by Coppola's ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''), all showed the studios how to make money in the new environment.\n\nOn realizing how much money could potentially be made in films, major [[corporations]] started buying up the remaining Hollywood studios, saving them from the oblivion which befell RKO in the 50s. Eventually, even RKO was revived. The corporate mentality these companies brought to the filmmaking business would slowly squeeze out the more idiosyncratic of these young filmmakers, while ensconcing the more malleable and commercially successful of them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.raindance.org/what-is-independent-film/|title=What Is Independent Film? \u2013 Raindance|date=2014-01-19|work=Raindance|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> Like the original independents who fled the Edison Trust to form old Hollywood, the young film school graduates who had fled the studios to explore on-location shooting and dynamic, [[Italian neo-realism|neo-realist]] styles and structures ended up replacing the tyrants they had sought to dislodge with a more stable and all-pervasive base of power.\n\n===Outside Hollywood===\n\nDuring the 1970s, shifts in thematic depictions of sexuality and violence occurred in American cinema, prominently featuring heightened depictions of realistic sex and violence. Directors who wished to reach mainstream audiences of [[Old Hollywood]] quickly learned to [[Aestheticization of violence|stylize]] these themes to make their films appealing and attractive rather than repulsive or obscene. However, at the same time that the maverick film students of the [[American New Wave]] were developing the skills they would use to take over Hollywood, many of their peers had begun to develop their style of filmmaking in a different direction. Influenced by foreign and [[Art film|art house]] directors such as [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]],exploitation shockers (i.e. [[Joseph P. Mawra]], [[Michael Findlay]], and [[Henri Pachard]]) and avant-garde cinema, ([[Kenneth Anger]], [[Maya Deren]]) a number of young film makers began to experiment with transgression not as a box-office draw, but [[Transgressive art|as an artistic act]]. Directors such as [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] and [[David Lynch]] would make a name for themselves by the early 1970s for the bizarre and often disturbing imagery which characterized their films.\n\nWhen Lynch's first feature film, ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977), brought Lynch to the attention of producer [[Mel Brooks]], he soon found himself in charge of the $5 million film ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980) for Paramount. Though ''Eraserhead'' was strictly an out-of-pocket, low-budget, independent film, Lynch made the transition with unprecedented grace. The film was a huge commercial success, and earned eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] nods for Lynch. It also established his place as a commercially viable, if somewhat dark and unconventional, [[Hollywood]] director. Seeing Lynch as a fellow studio convert, [[George Lucas]], a fan of ''Eraserhead'' and now the darling of the studios, offered Lynch the opportunity to direct his next ''[[Star Wars]]'' sequel, ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983). However, Lynch had seen what had happened to Lucas and his comrades in arms after their failed attempt to do away with the studio system. He refused the opportunity, stating that he would rather work on his own projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html |title=David Lynch interview 1985 |publisher=Davidlynch.de |accessdate=2013-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011151810/http://davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html |archive-date=2010-10-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLynch instead chose to direct a big budget adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[science fiction]] [[novel]] ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' for [[Italy|Italian]] producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]]'s [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]], on the condition that the company release a second Lynch project, over which the director would have complete creative control. Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be the next ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', Lynch's ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'' (1984) was a critical and commercial flop, grossing a mere $27.4 million domestically against a $45 million budget. De Laurentiis, furious that the film had been a commercial disaster, was then forced to produce any film Lynch desired. He offered Lynch only $6 million in order to minimize the risk if the film had failed to recoup its costs; however, the film,  ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986) was a resounding success. Lynch subsequently returned to independent filmmaking, and did not work with another major studio for over a decade.\n\nUnlike the former, John Waters released most of his films during his early life through his own production company, [[Dreamlanders|Dreamland Productions]]. In the early 1980s, [[New Line Cinema]] agreed to work with him on ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' (1981). During the 1980s, Waters would become a pillar of the New York\u2013based independent film movement known as the \"[[Cinema of Transgression]]\", a term coined by [[Nick Zedd]] in 1985 to describe a loose-knit group of like-minded New York artists using [[shock value]] and [[humor]] in their [[super 8mm|Super 8 mm]] films and [[video art]]. Other key players in this movement included [[Kembra Pfahler]], [[Casandra Stark]], [[Beth B]], Tommy Turner, [[Richard Kern]] and [[Lydia Lunch]]. Rallying around such institutions as the Film-Makers' Cooperative and Anthology Film Archives, this new generation of independents devoted themselves to the defiance of the now-establishment New Hollywood, proposing that \"all film schools be blown up and all boring films never be made again.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/film/transgression.html |title=UbuWeb Film & Video: The Cinema of Transgression |publisher=Ubu.com |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref>\n\nThe development of no-budget film production company [[ASS Studios]] in 2011 brought guerrilla style tactics to their filmmaking. Founded by Courtney Fathom Sell & [[Reverend Jen Miller]], the now-defunct studio would utilize local performers and locations from the [[Lower East Side]] of [[New York City]] to create various short films which would then be screened in venues such as bars and [[Anthology Film Archives]]. Though mainly recognized for their short films, the studios' first and only feature [[Satan, Hold My Hand]] was made on a budget of just $27.00 while featuring an A-list Hollywood cast including [[Janeane Garofalo]] and was Produced by [[Jonathan Ames]], writer and creator of the [[HBO]] series [[Bored to Death]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/27295-courtney-fathom-sells-hi-8-high-life/|title=Courtney Fathom Sell's Hi-8 High Life|author=Scott Macaulay|work=Filmmaker Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/article/my_top_5_slightly_illegal_tips_for_no-budget_filmmakers|title=My Top 5 Slightly Illegal Tips For No-Budget Filmmakers|date=5 August 2011|work=Indiewire}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/29016-so-you-wanna-be-an-underground-filmmaker/|title=Courtney Fathom Sell: So You Wanna Be an Underground Filmmaker?|author=Scott Macaulay|work=Filmmaker Magazine}}</ref>\n\n===Independent Cinema movement===\n{{Further|Sundance Institute}}\nIn 1978, [[Sterling Van Wagenen]] and [[Charles Gary Allison]], with Chairperson [[Robert Redford]], (veteran of New Hollywood and star of ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'') founded the [[Utah/US Film Festival]] in an effort to attract more filmmakers to Utah and showcase what the potential of independent film could be. At the time, the main focus of the event was to present a series of retrospective films and filmmaker panel discussions; however it also included a small program of new independent films. The jury of the 1978 festival was headed by [[Charles Gary Allison|Gary Allison]], and included [[Verna Fields]], [[Linwood Gale Dunn]], [[Katharine Ross|Katherine Ross]], [[Charles E. Sellier Jr.]], [[Mark Rydell]], and [[Anthea Sylbert]]. In 1981, the same year that United Artists, bought out by MGM, ceased to exist as a venue for independent filmmakers, Sterling Van Wagenen left the film festival to help found the [[Sundance Institute]] with Robert Redford. In 1985, the now well-established Sundance Institute, headed by Sterling Van Wagenen, took over management of the US Film Festival, which was experiencing financial difficulties. [[Gary Beer]] and Sterling Van Wagenen spearheaded production of the inaugural Sundance Film Festival which included Program Director Tony Safford and Administrative Director Jenny Walz Selby.\n\nIn 1991, the festival was officially renamed the ''Sundance Film Festival'', after Redford's famous role as [[The Sundance Kid]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Lauren David Peden|title=Sundance Subdued|url=http://www.coastmagazine.com/archive/pre_dec05/travel_sundance.html|date=December 2005|publisher=Freedom Orange County Information (coastmagazine.com)|accessdate=2007-11-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202623/http://www.coastmagazine.com/archive/pre_dec05/travel_sundance.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> Through this festival the '''Independent Cinema movement''' was launched.

The third category comprised over half the features released in the United States and usually cost between $5 and $10 million to produce.<ref>McDonald, Paul and Wasco, Janet. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry. Malden, MA, US: Blackwell Publishing, 2008. p 30-31</ref>\n\nHollywood was producing these three different classes of feature films by means of three different types of producers. The superior products were the large, budget blockbusters and high-cost star vehicles marketed by the six major studio producer-distributors. Budgets on the major studios' pictures averaged $100 million, with approximately one-third of it spent on marketing because of the large release campaigns. Another class of Hollywood feature film included art films, specialty films, and other niche-market fare controlled by the conglomerates' indie subsidiaries. Budgets on these indie films averaged $40 million per release in the early 2000s, with $10 million to $15 million spent on marketing (MPA, 2006:12). The final class of film consisted of genre and specialty films administered by independent producer-distributors with only a few dozen or possibly a few hundred-release campaigns screens in select urban markets. Films like these usually cost less than $10 million, but frequently less than $5 million, with small marketing budgets that escalate if and when a particular film performs.<ref>McDonald, Paul and Wasco, Janet.

These people may have little to no technical or academic training, but instead are self-titled \"filmmakers.\"  Aspiring filmmakers can range from those simply with access to a smartphone or digital camera, to those who write \"spec\" scripts (to pitch to studios), actively network, and use [[crowdsourcing]] and other financing to get their films professionally produced. Oftentimes, aspiring filmmakers have other day-jobs to support themselves financially while they pitch their scripts and ideas to independent film production companies, talent agents, and wealthy investors.

Until digital alternatives became available, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was a major obstacle to independent filmmakers who wanted to make their own films. Successful films such as the ''[[Blair Witch Project]]'' (which grossed over 248.6 million USD while only spending 60,000 USD) have emerged from this new accessibility to filmmaking tools. In 2002, the cost of [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] [[Negative (photography)|film stock]] went up 23%, according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=\"VARIETY_2003\">[https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&articleid=VR1117895718&categoryid=10 Sharing Pix is Risky Business] variety.com. Retrieved June 23, 2007.</ref> The advent of consumer [[camcorder]]s in 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of [[digital video]] in the early 1990s, lowered the technology barrier to movie production. The [[personal computer]] and [[non-linear editing system]] have taken away the use of editing stands such as the KEM, dramatically reducing the costs of post-production, while technologies such as [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc]] and online video services have simplified distribution; [[video streaming]] services have made it possible to distribute a digital version of a film to an entire country or even the world, without involving shipping or warehousing of physical DVDs or film reels. [[3-D film|3-D]] technology is available to low-budget, independent filmmakers. \n\nOne of the examples of such a new indie approach to filmmaking is the 1999 Oscar-nominated documentary film ''[[Genghis Blues]]'' that was shot by the Belic brothers on two Hi8 consumer camcorders and won that year's Sundance Film Festival Audience Award for a Documentary. The movie had to be \"filmed out\" from interlaced digital video format to film running at traditional 24-frame per second rate, so interlacing artefacts are noticeable at times. In 2004 Panasonic released the DVX100 camcorder, which featured film-like 24-frame per second shooting rate. This gave independent filmmakers the ability to shoot video at frame rate considered standard for movies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmaking.net/faq/answers/faq172.asp |title=Internet Filmmaker's FAQ : |publisher=filmmaking.net |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref> and opened the possibility of clean digital frame to film frame conversion. Several acclaimed films were made with this camera, for example ''[[Iraq in Fragments]]''.\n\nEven though new cinema camera such as the [[Arriflex Alexa|Arri Alexa]], [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED]] Epic, and the many new [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLRs]] cost thousands of dollars to purchase, independent films are still cheaper than ever, creating footage that looks like 35 mm film without the same high cost. These cameras also perform better than traditional film because of its ability to perform in extremely dark/low light situations. In 2008 Canon released the first DSLR camera that could shoot full HD video, the [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]]. With the sensor larger than on a traditional camcorder, these DSLRs allow for a greater control over depth of field, great low-light capabilities, and a large variety of exchangeable lenses, including lenses from old film cameras \u2013 things which independent filmmakers have been longing {{not a typo|for for}} years. With the creation of new, light-weight and accessible cinema cameras, documentaries have also benefitted greatly. It was previously impossible to capture the extreme wild of mother nature because of the lack of maneuverability with film cameras; however, with the creation of DSLRs documentary filmmakers were able to reach hard to get places in order to capture what they couldn't have with film cameras.<ref>Eric Escobar from NAB, We Are All Geeks Now</ref>\n\nIn addition to new digital cameras, independent film makers are benefitting from the new editing software. Instead of needing a post-house to do the editing, independent film makers can now use a personal computer and cheap editing software to edit their films. Editing software available include [[Avid Media Composer]], [[Adobe Premiere Pro]], [[Final Cut Pro]], (Color Grading Software) [[DaVinci Resolve]], and [[List of video editing software|many more]]. There are also many free tutorials and courses available online to teach different post production skills needed to use these programs. These new technologies allow independent film makers to create films that are comparable to high-budget films.\n\n[[Francis Ford Coppola]], long an advocate of new technologies like [[non-linear editing system|non-linear editing]] and [[digital cameras]], said in 2007 that \"cinema is escaping being controlled by the financier, and that's a wonderful thing.

Charles Landry and his colleagues at Comedia from the late 1980s onwards established the notion as a practical urban policy tool that saw creativity as a resource for urban development. This included the imagination of artists, scientists, businesses, ordinary people as well as the civic creativity of public officials defined as imaginative problem solving applied to public good objectives.<ref>Landry, Charles: An Advanced Introduction to the Creative City, Edward Elgar publishing, Cheltenham, 2019</ref>\n\n==Creativity and imagination in city making==\nThe Creative City proposed a new planning paradigm from which an at times contentious global movement emerged.

Its philosophy is that there is always more creative potential in a place. It posits that conditions need to be created for people to think, plan and act with imagination in harnessing opportunities or addressing seemingly intractable urban problems. It was a response to the dramatic economic, social and cultural transformations across the globe from the early 1980s onwards that required a re-assessment of cities' resources and potential.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://charleslandry.com/panel/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/03/Lineages-of-the-Creative-City.pdf|title=Lineages of the Creative City|last=|first=|date=|website=charleslandry.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>Creative infrastructure is a combination of the hard and the soft. The latter includes a city's mindset, how it approaches opportunities and problems; its atmosphere and incentives and regulatory regime. The soft infrastructure includes: A highly skilled and flexible labour force; dynamic thinkers, creators and implementers. It is not only artists or creative economy participants who are creative. It can anyone who addresses issues in an inventive way be it a social worker, a business person, a scientist or public servant. A culture of creativity is seen as crucial in how urban stakeholders operate. By encouraging and legitimizing the use of imagination within the public, private and community spheres, the ideas bank of possibilities and potential solutions to any urban problem will be broadened. The aim is to identify, nurture, attract and sustain talent so as to mobilize ideas, talents, and creative organizations with an appropriate set built environment and help to establish a creative milieu.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Araya|first=Daniel|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=6L-UNaQk1iwC&pg=PA366&lpg=PA366&dq=A+culture+of+creativity+is+seen+as+crucial+in+how+urban+stakeholders+operate.+By+encouraging+and+legitimizing+the+use+of+imagination+within+the+public,+private+and+community+spheres,+the+ideas+bank+of+possibilities+and+potential+solutions+to+any+urban+problem+will+be+broadened.&source=bl&ots=uJYiiNm5RY&sig=ACfU3U2J_8Xia2FsJDR27mDG7vri5DUzTg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi18dnm2bvoAhUr4YUKHdyOCGsQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=A%20culture%20of%20creativity%20is%20seen%20as%20crucial%20in%20how%20urban%20stakeholders%20operate.%20By%20encouraging%20and%20legitimizing%20the%20use%20of%20imagination%20within%20the%20public,%20private%20and%20community%20spheres,|title=Education in the Creative Economy: Knowledge and Learning in the Age of Innovation|last2=Peters|first2=Michael A.|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-1-4331-0744-3|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/creative_spirits_state_of_the_art.pdf|title=Creative Spirits|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Early developments==\nPartners for Livable Places ''\"later Communities\"'' founded in 1977 was important in the early stages of the creative city idea.

These are embodied in peoples' histories, skills, the repertoire of local assets and a city\u2019s physical landscape.

American Council for the Arts Synopsis von Eckhardt 1980</ref> Mercer added cultural planning has to be \"the strategic and integral use of cultural resources in urban and community development.\" Bianchini elaborated the term cultural resource in collaborative work with Landry. They stated: \"Cultural resources are the raw materials of the city and its value base; its assets replacing coal, steel or gold. Creativity is the method of exploiting these resources and helping them grow.\" This focus draws attention to the distinctive, the unique and the special in any place.\n\n==The emergence of the creative economy and creative class==\nThroughout the 1990s and the 2000s, the creative city concept was to some extent hijacked by a focus on the creative industries so losing sight of its larger aims that in periods of \u201ctransformation it is necessary to create the conditions for people, organizations and cities to think, plan and act with imagination to solve problems and create opportunities\u201d.<ref>Landry, Charles: An Advanced Introduction to the Creative City, Edward Elgar publishing, Cheltenham, 2019</ref> In the late 1980s, at its origins, it had focused on the role of artists and sectors like design, new media, music, film or performing arts as well as the associated cultural infrastructure like museums or galleries.

The core notion advocated a culture of creativity to be embedded into how the urban stakeholders operate stressing that by encouraging and legitimising the use of imagination in all spheres the ideasbank of possibilities and potential solutions broadens. Creativity is context driven. What was \u2018creative\u2019 in the 19th or 20th century will be different from what is creative in the 21<sup>st</sup>.

In other words, Florida's prescriptions in favour of fostering a creative class are, rather than being revolutionary, simply a way of bolstering the conventional economic model of the city. The idea of the creative class serves to create a cultural hierarchy, and as such reproduce inequalities; indeed, even Florida himself has even acknowledged that the areas he himself touts as hotspots of the creative class are at the same time home to shocking disparities in economic status among their residents. In order to explain this, he points to the inflation of housing prices that an influx of creatives can bring to an area, as well as to the creative class' reliance on service industries that typically pay their employees low wages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Jamie|date=2005|title=Struggling with the Creative Class|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2005.00620.x|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=740\u2013770|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2005.00620.x|issn=1468-2427}}</ref> \n\nCritics argue that the creative city idea has now become a catch-all phrase in danger of losing its meaning and in danger of hollowing out by general overuse of the word \u2018creative\u2019 as applied to people, activities, organizations, urban neighborhoods or cities that objectively are not especially creative. Cities still tend to restrict its meaning to the arts and cultural activities within the [[Creative industries|creative economy]] professions, calling any cultural plan a creative city plan, when such activities are only one aspect of a community's creativity. There is a tendency for cities to adopt the term without thinking through its real organizational consequences and the need to change their mindset. The creativity implied in the term, the creative city, is about lateral and integrative thinking in all aspects of city planning and urban development, placing people, not infrastructure, at the centre of planning processes.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hartley|first=John|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=sMnj88kYVmcC&pg=PT59&lpg=PT59&dq=creative+city+losing+losing+its+meaning&source=bl&ots=kryyc36noV&sig=ACfU3U2CKZUPZsDlBdILLsRuOOs4G0IbFw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi61fax87voAhVsQUEAHfFhBIwQ6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=creative%20city%20losing%20losing%20its%20meaning&f=false|title=Key Concepts in Creative Industries|last2=Potts|first2=Jason|last3=Flew|first3=Terry|last4=Cunningham|first4=Stuart|last5=Keane|first5=Michael|last6=Banks|first6=John|date=2012-11-19|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-0289-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe original Creative City vision of Landry has been almost entirely superseded by a Florida-based vision framed by economic innovation and its requisite skilled labour. The Creative City in many places has become a business project, not a framework for total urban policy transformation. It has scaled down its expectations, and no longer demands that urban policy develop a creative imagination. The \u201cthesis\u201d can be implemented as strategy without unsettling too many ruling assumptions on the role of cities in the global economic order.

It posits that conditions need to be created for people to think, plan and act with imagination in harnessing opportunities or addressing seemingly intractable urban problems.

The latter includes a city's mindset, how it approaches opportunities and problems; its atmosphere and incentives and regulatory regime. The soft infrastructure includes: A highly skilled and flexible labour force; dynamic thinkers, creators and implementers. It is not only artists or creative economy participants who are creative. It can anyone who addresses issues in an inventive way be it a social worker, a business person, a scientist or public servant. A culture of creativity is seen as crucial in how urban stakeholders operate. By encouraging and legitimizing the use of imagination within the public, private and community spheres, the ideas bank of possibilities and potential solutions to any urban problem will be broadened.

From the late 1970s onwards [[UNESCO]] and the [[Council of Europe]] began to investigate the cultural resources and their associated industries.

These are embodied in peoples' histories, skills, the repertoire of local assets and a city\u2019s physical landscape. It was introduced into the English speaking world by Franco Bianchini in 1990,<ref>Cultural Policy and Urban Development: the Experience of West European Cities and Its Implications for the EC, report for Directorate General XVI of the European Commission (August 1990).</ref><ref>Cultural Policy and Urban Regeneration: The West European Experience, Eds.

American Council for the Arts Synopsis von Eckhardt 1980</ref> Mercer added cultural planning has to be \"the strategic and integral use of cultural resources in urban and community development.\" Bianchini elaborated the term cultural resource in collaborative work with Landry. They stated: \"Cultural resources are the raw materials of the city and its value base; its assets replacing coal, steel or gold. Creativity is the method of exploiting these resources and helping them grow.\" This focus draws attention to the distinctive, the unique and the special in any place.\n\n{{fake heading|sub=2|The emergence of the creative economy and creative class}}\nThroughout the 1990s and the 2000s, the creative city concept was to some extent hijacked by a focus on the creative industries so losing sight of its larger aims that in periods of \u201ctransformation it is necessary to create the conditions for people, organizations and cities to think, plan and act with imagination to solve problems and create opportunities\u201d.<ref>Landry, Charles: An Advanced Introduction to the Creative City, Edward Elgar publishing, Cheltenham, 2019</ref> In the late 1980s, at its origins, it had focused on the role of artists and sectors like design, new media, music, film or performing arts as well as the associated cultural infrastructure like museums or galleries.

The core notion advocated a culture of creativity to be embedded into how the urban stakeholders operate stressing that by encouraging and legitimising the use of imagination in all spheres the ideasbank of possibilities and potential solutions broadens. Creativity is context driven. What was \u2018creative\u2019 in the 19th or 20th century will be different from what is creative in the 21<sup>st</sup>.

In other words, Florida's prescriptions in favour of fostering a creative class are, rather than being revolutionary, simply a way of bolstering the conventional economic model of the city. The idea of the creative class serves to create a cultural hierarchy, and as such reproduce inequalities; indeed, even Florida himself has even acknowledged that the areas he himself touts as hotspots of the creative class are at the same time home to shocking disparities in economic status among their residents. In order to explain this, he points to the inflation of housing prices that an influx of creatives can bring to an area, as well as to the creative class' reliance on service industries that typically pay their employees low wages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Jamie|date=2005|title=Struggling with the Creative Class|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2005.00620.x|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=740\u2013770|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2005.00620.x|issn=1468-2427}}</ref> \n\nCritics argue that the creative city idea has now become a catch-all phrase in danger of losing its meaning and in danger of hollowing out by general overuse of the word \u2018creative\u2019 as applied to people, activities, organizations, urban neighborhoods or cities that objectively are not especially creative. Cities still tend to restrict its meaning to the arts and cultural activities within the [[Creative industries|creative economy]] professions, calling any cultural plan a creative city plan, when such activities are only one aspect of a community's creativity. There is a tendency for cities to adopt the term without thinking through its real organizational consequences and the need to change their mindset. The creativity implied in the term, the creative city, is about lateral and integrative thinking in all aspects of city planning and urban development, placing people, not infrastructure, at the centre of planning processes.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hartley|first=John|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=sMnj88kYVmcC&pg=PT59&lpg=PT59&dq=creative+city+losing+losing+its+meaning&source=bl&ots=kryyc36noV&sig=ACfU3U2CKZUPZsDlBdILLsRuOOs4G0IbFw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi61fax87voAhVsQUEAHfFhBIwQ6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=creative%20city%20losing%20losing%20its%20meaning&f=false|title=Key Concepts in Creative Industries|last2=Potts|first2=Jason|last3=Flew|first3=Terry|last4=Cunningham|first4=Stuart|last5=Keane|first5=Michael|last6=Banks|first6=John|date=2012-11-19|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-0289-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe original Creative City vision of Landry has been almost entirely superseded by a Florida-based vision framed by economic innovation and its requisite skilled labour. The Creative City in many places has become a business project, not a framework for total urban policy transformation. It has scaled down its expectations, and no longer demands that urban policy develop a creative imagination. The \u201cthesis\u201d can be implemented as strategy without unsettling too many ruling assumptions on the role of cities in the global economic order.
