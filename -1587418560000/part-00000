Further exposure to that specific wind could only cause a dissipation of energy due to the breaking of wave tops and formation of \"whitecaps\". Waves in a given area typically have a range of heights. For weather reporting and for scientific analysis of wind wave statistics, their characteristic height over a period of time is usually expressed as ''[[significant wave height]]''. This figure represents an [[average]] height of the highest one-third of the waves in a given time period (usually chosen somewhere in the range from 20 minutes to twelve hours), or in a specific wave or storm system. The significant wave height is also the value a \"trained observer\" (e.g. from a ship's crew) would estimate from visual observation of a sea state. Given the variability of wave height, the largest individual waves are likely to be somewhat less than twice the reported significant wave height for a particular day or storm.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-3-540-25316-7 | last1 = Weisse | first1 = Ralf | first2 = Hans | last2 = von Storch | title = Marine climate change: Ocean waves, storms and surges in the perspective of climate change | year = 2008 | page = 51 }}</ref>\n\nWave formation on an initially flat water surface by wind is started by a random distribution of normal pressure of turbulent wind flow over the water.

[[Porto Covo]], west coast of Portugal]]\n\nThree different types of wind waves develop over time:\n* [[Capillary wave]]s, or ripples, dominated by surface tension effects.\n* [[Gravity waves]], dominated by gravitational and inertial forces.\n** Seas, raised locally by the wind.\n** [[Swell (ocean)|Swells]], which have travelled away from where they were raised by wind, and have to a greater or lesser extent dispersed.\n\nRipples appear on smooth water when the wind blows, but will die quickly if the wind stops. The restoring force that allows them to propagate is [[surface tension]]. Sea waves are larger-scale, often irregular motions that form under sustained winds. These waves tend to last much longer, even after the wind has died, and the restoring force that allows them to propagate is gravity. As waves propagate away from their area of origin, they naturally separate into groups of common direction and wavelength. The sets of waves formed in this manner are known as swells.\n\nIndividual \"[[rogue wave]]s\" (also called \"freak waves\", \"monster waves\", \"killer waves\", and \"king waves\") much higher than the other waves in the [[sea state]] can occur. In the case of the [[Draupner wave]], its {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} height was 2.2 times the [[significant wave height]]. Such waves are distinct from [[tide]]s, caused by the [[Moon]] and [[Sun]]'s [[tidal force|gravitational pull]], [[tsunami]]s that are caused by underwater [[earthquake]]s or [[landslide]]s, and waves generated by [[underwater explosion]]s or the fall of [[meteorite]]s\u2014all having far longer [[wavelength]]s than wind waves.\n\nThe largest ever recorded wind waves are not rogue waves, but standard waves in extreme sea states.

Most characteristics of ocean waves depend on the relationship between their wavelength and water depth. Wavelength determines the size of the orbits of water molecules within a wave, but water depth determines the shape of the orbits. The paths of water molecules in a wind wave are circular only when the wave is traveling in deep water. A wave cannot \"feel\" the bottom when it moves through water deeper than half its wavelength because too little wave energy is contained in the small circles below that depth. Waves moving through water deeper than half their wavelength are known as deep-water waves. On the other hand, the orbits of water molecules in waves moving through shallow water are flattened by the proximity of the sea surface bottom. Waves in water shallower than 1/20 their original wavelength are known as shallow-water waves. Transitional waves travel through water deeper than 1/20 their original wavelength but shallower than half their original wavelength.\n\nIn general, the longer the wavelength, the faster the wave energy will move through the water. The relationship between the wavelength, period, and velocity of any wave is:\n\n:::<math> C = {L}/{T} </math>\n\nwhere C is speed (celerity), L is wavelength, and T is time, or period (in seconds).  Thus the speed of the wave derives from the functional dependence <math> L(T) </math> of the wavelength on the period (the [[dispersion relation]]).\n\nThe speed of a deep-water wave may also be approximated by:\n\n:::<math> C = \\sqrt{{gL}/{2\\pi}} </math>\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity, {{convert|9.8|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} per second squared. Because g and \u03c0 (3.14) are constants, the equation can be reduced to:\n\n:::<math> C = 1.251\\sqrt{L} </math>\n\nwhen C is measured in meters per second and L in meters. Note that in both formulas the wave speed is proportional to the square root of the wavelength.\n\nThe speed of shallow-water waves is described by a different equation that may be written as:\n\n:::<math> C = \\sqrt{gd} = 3.1\\sqrt{d} </math>\n\nwhere C is speed (in meters per second), g is the acceleration due to gravity, and d is the depth of the water (in meters). The period of a wave remains unchanged regardless of the depth of water through which it is moving. As deep-water waves enter the shallows and feel the bottom, however, their speed is reduced and their crests \"bunch up,\" so their wavelength shortens.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Shoaling and refraction==\n[[File:Ripples Hierkonpolku Reila.jpg|thumb|Waves create [[ripple marks]] in beaches.]]\n{{main|Wave shoaling|Water wave refraction}}\nAs waves travel from deep to shallow water, their shape alters (wave height increases, speed decreases, and length decreases as wave orbits become asymmetrical). This process is called [[wave shoaling|shoaling]].\n\nWave [[refraction]] is the process that occurs when waves interact with the sea bed to slow the velocity of propagation as a function of wave length and period. As the waves slow down in shoaling water, the [[crest (physics)|crest]]s tend to realign at a decreasing angle to the depth contours. Varying depths along a wave crest cause the crest to travel at different [[phase speed]]s, with those parts of the wave in deeper water moving faster than those in [[waves in shallow water|shallow water]]. This process continues while the depth decreases, and reverses if it increases again, but the wave leaving the shoal area may have changed direction considerably. [[Ray tracing (physics)|Rays]]\u2014lines [[normal (geometry)|normal]] to wave crests between which a fixed amount of energy [[flux]] is contained\u2014converge on local shallows and shoals. Therefore, the [[wave energy]] between rays is concentrated as they converge, with a resulting increase in wave height.\n\nBecause these effects are related to a spatial variation in the phase speed, and because the phase speed also changes with the ambient current \u2013 due to the [[Doppler shift]] \u2013 the same effects of refraction and altering wave height also occur due to current variations. In the case of meeting an adverse current the wave ''steepens'', i.e. its wave height increases while the wave length decreases, similar to the shoaling when the water depth decreases.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0011-7471(64)90001-4 | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 529\u2013562 | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = M.

As a result, the upper parts will propagate at a higher velocity than the base and the leading face of the crest will become steeper and the trailing face flatter. This may be exaggerated to the extent that the leading face forms a barrel profile, with the crest falling forward and down as it extends over the air ahead of the wave.\n\nThree main types of breaking waves are identified by [[surfer]]s or [[Surf lifesaving|surf lifesavers]]. Their varying characteristics make them more or less suitable for surfing, and present different dangers.\n# Spilling, or rolling: these are the safest waves on which to surf. They can be found in most areas with relatively flat shorelines. They are the most common type of shorebreak. The deceleration of the wave base is gradual, and the velocity of the upper parts does not differ much with height. Breaking occurs mainly when the steepness ratio exceeds the stability limit.\n# Plunging, or dumping: these break suddenly and can \"dump\" swimmers\u2014pushing them to the bottom with great force. These are the preferred waves for experienced surfers. Strong offshore winds and long wave periods can cause dumpers. They are often found where there is a sudden rise in the sea floor, such as a reef or sandbar. Deceleration of the wave base is sufficient to cause upward acceleration and a significant forward velocity excess of the upper part of the crest. The peak rises and overtakes the forward face, forming a \"barrel\" or \"tube\" as it collapses.\n# Surging: these may never actually break as they approach the water's edge, as the water below them is very deep. They tend to form on steep shorelines. These waves can knock swimmers over and drag them back into deeper water. \nWhen the shoreline is near vertical, waves do not break, but are reflected. Most of the energy is retained in the wave as it returns to seaward. Interference patterns are caused by superposition of the incident and reflected waves, and the superposition may cause localised instability when peaks cross, and these peaks may break due to instability.

The [[phase speed]] (also called the celerity) of a surface gravity wave is \u2013 for pure [[periodic function|periodic]] wave motion of small-[[amplitude]] waves \u2013 well approximated by\n\n:<math>c=\\sqrt{\\frac{g \\lambda}{2\\pi} \\tanh \\left(\\frac{2\\pi d}{\\lambda}\\right)}</math>\n\nwhere\n:''c'' = [[phase speed]];\n:''\u03bb'' = [[wavelength]];\n:''d'' = water depth;\n:''g'' = [[standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface]].\n\nIn deep water, where <math>d \\ge \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda</math>, so <math>\\frac{2\\pi d}{\\lambda} \\ge \\pi</math> and the hyperbolic tangent approaches <math>1</math>, the speed <math>c</math> approximates\n\n:<math>c_\\text{deep}=\\sqrt{\\frac{g\\lambda}{2\\pi}}.</math>\n\nIn SI units, with <math>c_\\text{deep}</math> in m/s, <math>c_\\text{deep} \\approx 1.25\\sqrt\\lambda</math>, when <math>\\lambda</math> is measured in metres.\nThis expression tells us that waves of different wavelengths travel at different speeds. The fastest waves in a storm are the ones with the longest wavelength. As a result, after a storm, the first waves to arrive on the coast are the long-wavelength swells.\n\nFor intermediate and shallow water, the [[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)|Boussinesq equations]] are applicable, combining [[dispersion (water waves)|frequency dispersion]] and nonlinear effects. And in very shallow water, the [[shallow water equations]] can be used.\n\nIf the wavelength is very long compared to the water depth, the phase speed (by taking the [[Limit of a function|limit]] of {{var|c}} when the wavelength approaches infinity) can be approximated by\n\n:<math>c_\\text{shallow} = \\lim_{\\lambda\\rightarrow\\infty} c = \\sqrt{gd}.</math>\n\nOn the other hand, for very short wavelengths, [[surface tension]] plays an important role and the phase speed of these [[gravity-capillary wave]]s can (in deep water) be approximated by\n\n:<math>c_\\text{gravity-capillary}=\\sqrt{\\frac{g \\lambda}{2\\pi} + \\frac{2\\pi S}{\\rho\\lambda}}</math>\n\nwhere\n:''S'' = [[surface tension]] of the air-water interface;\n:<math>\\rho</math> = [[density]] of the water.<ref name=physics_handbook>{{cite book|title=Physics Handbook for Science and Engineering|year=2006|publisher=Studentliteratur|page=263|author=Carl Nordling, Jonny \u00d6stermalm|edition=Eight|isbn=978-91-44-04453-8}}</ref>\n\nWhen several wave trains are present, as is always the case in nature, the waves form groups.

As the wave height increases, the wave may become unstable when the [[crest (physics)|crest]] of the wave moves faster than the [[trough (physics)|trough]].

Simultaneous observations of wind speed and wave height are helping scientists to predict ocean waves. Wind speed is determined by the strength of the radar signal after it has bounced off the ocean surface and returned to the satellite. A calm sea serves as a good reflector and returns a strong signal; a rough sea tends to scatter the signals and returns a weak pulse. Wave height is determined by the shape of the return radar pulse.\nA calm sea with low waves returns a condensed pulse whereas a rough sea with high waves returns a stretched pulse. Comparing the two images above shows a high degree of correlation between wind speed and wave height. The strongest winds ({{convert|33.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on|disp=x|; }}) and highest waves are found in the Southern Ocean. The weakest winds \u2014 shown as areas of magenta and dark blue \u2014 are generally found in the tropical oceans.]]\n{{main|Wind wave model}}\n\nSurfers are very interested in the [[wind wave model|wave forecasts]]. There are many websites that provide predictions of the surf quality for the upcoming days and weeks. Wind wave models are driven by more general [[numerical weather prediction|weather models]] that predict the winds and pressures over the oceans, seas and lakes.\n\nWind wave models are also an important part of examining the impact of [[coastal protection|shore protection]] and [[beach nourishment]] proposals. For many beach areas there is only patchy information about the wave climate, therefore estimating the effect of wind waves is important for managing [[littoral]] environments.\n\nA wind generated wave can be predicted based on two parameters: wind speed at 10 m above the sea level and wind duration, which must blow over long periods of time to be considered fully developed. The significant wave height and peak frequency can then be predicted for a certain fetch length.<ref>Wood, AMM & Fleming, CA 1981, Coastal hydraulics, John Wiley & Sons, New York</ref>\n\n==Seismic signals==\n{{main|Microseism}}\nOcean water waves generate land seismic waves that propagate hundreds of kilometers into the land.<ref>[http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/people/seth/327/HV/Chapter_4_rev1.pdf Peter Bormann. Seismic Signals and Noise]</ref> These seismic signals usually have the period of 6&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;2 seconds. Such recordings were first reported and understood in about 1900.\n\nThere are two types of seismic \"ocean waves\". The primary waves are generated in shallow waters by direct water wave-land interaction and have the same period as the water waves (10 to 16 seconds). The more powerful secondary waves are generated by the superposition of ocean waves of equal period traveling in opposite directions, thus generating standing gravity waves \u2013 with an associated pressure oscillation at half the period, which is not diminishing with depth. The theory for microseism generation by standing waves was provided by [[Michael S. Longuet-Higgins|Michael Longuet-Higgins]] in 1950, after in 1941 Pierre Bernard suggested this relation with standing waves on the basis of observations.<ref>{{cite journal |first=P. | last=Bernard |author-link=P.

After the wind ceases to blow, wind waves are called [[swell (ocean)|swells]]. More generally, a swell consists of wind-generated waves that are not significantly affected by the local wind at that time. They have been generated elsewhere or some time ago.<ref>Holthuijsen (2007), page 5.</ref> Wind waves in the ocean are called ocean surface waves.\n\nWind waves have a certain amount of [[randomness]]: subsequent waves differ in height, duration, and shape with limited predictability.

Further exposure to that specific wind could only cause a dissipation of energy due to the breaking of wave tops and formation of \"whitecaps\". Waves in a given area typically have a range of heights. For weather reporting and for scientific analysis of wind wave statistics, their characteristic height over a period of time is usually expressed as ''[[significant wave height]]''. This figure represents an [[average]] height of the highest one-third of the waves in a given time period (usually chosen somewhere in the range from 20 minutes to twelve hours), or in a specific wave or storm system. The significant wave height is also the value a \"trained observer\" (e.g. from a ship's crew) would estimate from visual observation of a sea state. Given the variability of wave height, the largest individual waves are likely to be somewhat less than twice the reported significant wave height for a particular day or storm.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-3-540-25316-7 | last1 = Weisse | first1 = Ralf | first2 = Hans | last2 = von Storch | title = Marine climate change: Ocean waves, storms and surges in the perspective of climate change | year = 2008 | page = 51 }}</ref>\n\nWave formation on an initially flat water surface by wind is started by a random distribution of normal pressure of turbulent wind flow over the water.

[[John W. Miles]] suggested a surface wave generation mechanism which is initiated by turbulent wind shear flows based on the inviscid Orr-Sommerfeld equation in 1957. He found the energy transfer from wind to water surface is proportional to the curvature of the velocity profile of the wind at the point where the mean wind speed is equal to the wave speed. Since the wind speed profile is logarithmic to the water surface, the curvature has a negative sign at this point.

[[Porto Covo]], west coast of Portugal]]\n\nThree different types of wind waves develop over time:\n* [[Capillary wave]]s, or ripples, dominated by surface tension effects.\n* [[Gravity waves]], dominated by gravitational and inertial forces.\n** Seas, raised locally by the wind.\n** [[Swell (ocean)|Swells]], which have travelled away from where they were raised by wind, and have to a greater or lesser extent dispersed.\n\nRipples appear on smooth water when the wind blows, but will die quickly if the wind stops. The restoring force that allows them to propagate is [[surface tension]]. Sea waves are larger-scale, often irregular motions that form under sustained winds. These waves tend to last much longer, even after the wind has died, and the restoring force that allows them to propagate is gravity. As waves propagate away from their area of origin, they naturally separate into groups of common direction and wavelength. The sets of waves formed in this manner are known as swells.\n\nIndividual \"[[rogue wave]]s\" (also called \"freak waves\", \"monster waves\", \"killer waves\", and \"king waves\") much higher than the other waves in the [[sea state]] can occur. In the case of the [[Draupner wave]], its {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} height was 2.2 times the [[significant wave height]]. Such waves are distinct from [[tide]]s, caused by the [[Moon]] and [[Sun]]'s [[tidal force|gravitational pull]], [[tsunami]]s that are caused by underwater [[earthquake]]s or [[landslide]]s, and waves generated by [[underwater explosion]]s or the fall of [[meteorite]]s\u2014all having far longer [[wavelength]]s than wind waves.\n\nThe largest ever recorded wind waves are not rogue waves, but standard waves in extreme sea states.

Most characteristics of ocean waves depend on the relationship between their wavelength and water depth. Wavelength determines the size of the orbits of water molecules within a wave, but water depth determines the shape of the orbits. The paths of water molecules in a wind wave are circular only when the wave is traveling in deep water. A wave cannot \"feel\" the bottom when it moves through water deeper than half its wavelength because too little wave energy is contained in the small circles below that depth. Waves moving through water deeper than half their wavelength are known as deep-water waves. On the other hand, the orbits of water molecules in waves moving through shallow water are flattened by the proximity of the sea surface bottom. Waves in water shallower than 1/20 their original wavelength are known as shallow-water waves. Transitional waves travel through water deeper than 1/20 their original wavelength but shallower than half their original wavelength.\n\nIn general, the longer the wavelength, the faster the wave energy will move through the water. The relationship between the wavelength, period, and velocity of any wave is:\n\n:::<math> C = {L}/{T} </math>\n\nwhere C is speed (celerity), L is wavelength, and T is time, or period (in seconds).  Thus the speed of the wave derives from the functional dependence <math> L(T) </math> of the wavelength on the period (the [[dispersion relation]]).\n\nThe speed of a deep-water wave may also be approximated by:\n\n:::<math> C = \\sqrt{{gL}/{2\\pi}} </math>\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity, {{convert|9.8|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} per second squared. Because g and \u03c0 (3.14) are constants, the equation can be reduced to:\n\n:::<math> C = 1.251\\sqrt{L} </math>\n\nwhen C is measured in meters per second and L in meters. Note that in both formulas the wave speed is proportional to the square root of the wavelength.\n\nThe speed of shallow-water waves is described by a different equation that may be written as:\n\n:::<math> C = \\sqrt{gd} = 3.1\\sqrt{d} </math>\n\nwhere C is speed (in meters per second), g is the acceleration due to gravity, and d is the depth of the water (in meters). The period of a wave remains unchanged regardless of the depth of water through which it is moving. As deep-water waves enter the shallows and feel the bottom, however, their speed is reduced and their crests \"bunch up,\" so their wavelength shortens.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Shoaling and refraction==\n[[File:Ripples Hierkonpolku Reila.jpg|thumb|Waves create [[ripple marks]] in beaches.]]\n{{main|Wave shoaling|Water wave refraction}}\nAs waves travel from deep to shallow water, their shape alters (wave height increases, speed decreases, and length decreases as wave orbits become asymmetrical). This process is called [[wave shoaling|shoaling]].\n\nWave [[refraction]] is the process that occurs when waves interact with the sea bed to slow the velocity of propagation as a function of wave length and period. As the waves slow down in shoaling water, the [[crest (physics)|crest]]s tend to realign at a decreasing angle to the depth contours. Varying depths along a wave crest cause the crest to travel at different [[phase speed]]s, with those parts of the wave in deeper water moving faster than those in [[waves in shallow water|shallow water]]. This process continues while the depth decreases, and reverses if it increases again, but the wave leaving the shoal area may have changed direction considerably. [[Ray tracing (physics)|Rays]]\u2014lines [[normal (geometry)|normal]] to wave crests between which a fixed amount of energy [[flux]] is contained\u2014converge on local shallows and shoals. Therefore, the [[wave energy]] between rays is concentrated as they converge, with a resulting increase in wave height.\n\nBecause these effects are related to a spatial variation in the phase speed, and because the phase speed also changes with the ambient current \u2013 due to the [[Doppler shift]] \u2013 the same effects of refraction and altering wave height also occur due to current variations. In the case of meeting an adverse current the wave ''steepens'', i.e. its wave height increases while the wave length decreases, similar to the shoaling when the water depth decreases.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0011-7471(64)90001-4 | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 529\u2013562 | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = M.

A wave breaks when it runs into [[Waves and shallow water|shallow water]], or when two wave systems oppose and combine forces. When the slope, or steepness ratio, of a wave is too great, breaking is inevitable.\n\nIndividual waves in deep water break when the wave steepness\u2014the [[ratio]] of the [[wave height]] ''H'' to the [[wavelength]] ''\u03bb''\u2014exceeds about 0.17, so for ''H''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.17&nbsp;''\u03bb''. In shallow water, with the water depth small compared to the wavelength, the individual waves break when their wave height ''H'' is larger than 0.8 times the water depth ''h'', that is ''H''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.8&nbsp;''h''.<ref>{{Cite book |author= R.J. Dean and R.A. Dalrymple |title=Coastal processes with engineering applications |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-60275-4 }} p. 96\u201397.</ref> Waves can also break if the wind grows strong enough to blow the crest off the base of the wave.\n\nIn shallow water the base of the wave is decelerated by drag on the seabed. As a result, the upper parts will propagate at a higher velocity than the base and the leading face of the crest will become steeper and the trailing face flatter. This may be exaggerated to the extent that the leading face forms a barrel profile, with the crest falling forward and down as it extends over the air ahead of the wave.\n\nThree main types of breaking waves are identified by [[surfer]]s or [[Surf lifesaving|surf lifesavers]]. Their varying characteristics make them more or less suitable for surfing, and present different dangers.\n# Spilling, or rolling: these are the safest waves on which to surf. They can be found in most areas with relatively flat shorelines. They are the most common type of shorebreak. The deceleration of the wave base is gradual, and the velocity of the upper parts does not differ much with height. Breaking occurs mainly when the steepness ratio exceeds the stability limit.\n# Plunging, or dumping: these break suddenly and can \"dump\" swimmers\u2014pushing them to the bottom with great force. These are the preferred waves for experienced surfers. Strong offshore winds and long wave periods can cause dumpers. They are often found where there is a sudden rise in the sea floor, such as a reef or sandbar. Deceleration of the wave base is sufficient to cause upward acceleration and a significant forward velocity excess of the upper part of the crest. The peak rises and overtakes the forward face, forming a \"barrel\" or \"tube\" as it collapses.\n# Surging: these may never actually break as they approach the water's edge, as the water below them is very deep. They tend to form on steep shorelines. These waves can knock swimmers over and drag them back into deeper water. \nWhen the shoreline is near vertical, waves do not break, but are reflected. Most of the energy is retained in the wave as it returns to seaward. Interference patterns are caused by superposition of the incident and reflected waves, and the superposition may cause localised instability when peaks cross, and these peaks may break due to instability.

As the [[wind]] blows, pressure and friction perturb the equilibrium of the water surface and transfer energy from the air to the water, forming waves.

Wind speed is determined by the strength of the radar signal after it has bounced off the ocean surface and returned to the satellite. A calm sea serves as a good reflector and returns a strong signal; a rough sea tends to scatter the signals and returns a weak pulse. Wave height is determined by the shape of the return radar pulse.\nA calm sea with low waves returns a condensed pulse whereas a rough sea with high waves returns a stretched pulse. Comparing the two images above shows a high degree of correlation between wind speed and wave height.

For many beach areas there is only patchy information about the wave climate, therefore estimating the effect of wind waves is important for managing [[littoral]] environments.\n\nA wind generated wave can be predicted based on two parameters: wind speed at 10 m above the sea level and wind duration, which must blow over long periods of time to be considered fully developed.

The more powerful secondary waves are generated by the superposition of ocean waves of equal period traveling in opposite directions, thus generating standing gravity waves \u2013 with an associated pressure oscillation at half the period, which is not diminishing with depth.

On January 31, 1943, despite mechanical problems with his aircraft, he pressed forward with a mission and [[Aviators who became ace in a day|shot down five Japanese aircraft in minutes]] before being shot down himself. DeBlanc parachuted to safety and was rescued by native islanders, traded for a sack of rice, and picked up by a Navy seaplane. He received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions that day. He served in the Marine Corps Reserve until 1972. In that time, he also taught school and completed graduate and doctoral degrees in math, physics and education.\n\n==U.S. Naval service==\nDeBlanc enlisted in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] (USNR) as a [[Seaman (rank)#United States|seaman second class]] on 29 July 1941, and received flight training at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base in [[New Orleans]], for two weeks, before going to the [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi|Naval Air Station]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], to continue his training. His Naval enlistment was terminated under honorable conditions on 15 October, and he was appointed an Aviation Cadet, USNR, on the following day. DeBlanc was one of approximately 24,500 [[Cajun]] G.I.s to serve during World War II.<ref>Bernard, Shane K. (2003) The Cajuns: Americanization Of A People. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. Pp.10\u201311.</ref>\n\n==Marine Corps service==\nCommissioned as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[Marine Forces Reserve|Marine Corps Reserve]] on 4 May 1942, DeBlanc moved to San Diego to join Headquarters Squadron, [[2nd Marine Aircraft Wing]]. In July, he was assigned to the Advance Carrier Training Group, where he remained under instruction until 6 August.\n\nHe was placed in the new pilot's pool until, with less than 10 hours of flight time in the [[F4F Wildcat]], he joined [[VMF-112]], [[Marine Aircraft Group 11]], [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]] in October. Two weeks later, he left for overseas and arrived at [[Guadalcanal]] on 2 November. On 13 November, Japanese [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" bombers attempted to [[torpedo]] Allied ships and were intercepted by [[VMF-112]], and in that action DeBlanc shot down three. He was promoted to [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] on 19 December. On 29 January 1943, DeBlanc was forced to ditch out of his Wildcat and luckily landed in the wake of an American destroyer that was fleeing across [[Ironbottom Sound]] due to a Japanese air raid. He was rescued by the destroyer and returned to flight status immediately after.<ref>Hammel ''Marines at War'', p. 25.''</ref>\n\n===Medal of Honor action===\nOn 31 January, First Lieutenant DeBlanc was flying a Wildcat over Japanese-held [[Kolombangara]] island in the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons Islands]] leading eight [[F4F Wildcat]]s from VMF-112 on an escort mission for a strike force of 12 Douglas [[SBD Dauntless]] [[dive bomber]]s sent to attack Japanese shipping. ''En route'' to the target area, DeBlanc discovered and reported to Guadalcanal that his fighter had developed a serious fuel leak which made return to base unlikely and he requested that rescue forces be alerted.\n\nLeading the escorts directly to the target area, DeBlanc and the other Wildcats observed a pair of  [[Mitsubishi F1M]] \"Pete\" float planes attacking the Dauntlesses from above and behind, and he dove to disrupt their attack. DeBlanc's aircraft was fired at by the rear gunners on the \"Petes\", but he maneuvered evasively and pressed home an attack on the first, exploding it, then maneuvered and took the second under fire, hitting it in the fuel tanks and setting it afire. Although the SBDs hit their targets successfully, and the escort mission was completed, DeBlanc remained in the target area to cover the withdrawal of the Dauntlesses, despite a critically low fuel supply, and began a climb back to altitude.\n\nBy this time, night was falling, but DeBlanc observed a formation of [[Nakajima Ki-43]] \"Oscar\" [[Imperial Japanese Army]] fighters headed for the dive bombers. Surprising them from beneath, he damaged one and shot down its wingman when the latter left the formation. The others broke off their attack of the dive bombers and turned on the Wildcats. DeBlanc and his wingman attempted to defend themselves using the [[Thach Weave]], but his wingman swung too wide during the maneuver and was shot down. DeBlanc himself was saved when a third Wildcat flown by Lt. James Lavell Secrest, approaching from head-on, overflew his aircraft and forced a pursuing \"Oscar\" to dive away.\n\nDeBlanc attempted to disengage but was attacked by two more \"Oscars\". He turned towards them in a climbing head-on attack, and the first exploded in the exchange of fire. The second maneuvered behind him, however, but DeBlanc managed to slow his Wildcat abruptly and force his remaining opponent to overshoot him, and he also shot it down for his fifth victory of the day. DeBlanc was then surprised by a fighter he had not detected. Rounds struck his aircraft, ripped his [[wrist watch]] from his arm, smashed the instrument panel, and set afire the Wildcat's engine. DeBlanc was forced to bail out at low altitude over [[Vella Gulf]] near Japanese-held Kolombangara. The total time of the action from arrival in the target area to his own bailout was approximately five minutes.\n\nLanding in the sea, DeBlanc discovered that he was badly wounded in the back, arms and legs. Supported only by his [[life jacket]], he swam for the beach. After six hours in the water, he reached shore, and for three days subsisted on coconuts he found in an abandoned hut while his wounds went unattended. He was taken by a group of indigenous people who bartered him for a sack of rice to another tribe that hid him and cared for his wounds. The tribal members carried DeBlanc by outrigger canoe to the home of an [[Anglican]] [[missionary]], who forwarded him to two [[Coastwatchers]], who immediately attempted contact with the Allied authorities by clandestine radio. On 12 February, three days before his 22nd birthday, a Navy [[PBY Catalina]] patrol bomber landed in the sea off the island and tribal members paddled DeBlanc out to it in a canoe. He was flown back to his base and to the hospital.\n\n(Note: the chronology and aircraft types are those provided by DeBlanc for the recreation of this action and vary slightly from the citation, which is reproduced below. The Japanese Ki-43 was often mistaken for the [[A6M Zero]] fighter in the heat of combat.)\n\n===Further wartime service===\nPromoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] on 1 June, he was transferred to [[VMF-122]], Marine Aircraft Group 11, in July, and returned to the United States about six weeks later. Assigned to Headquarters Squadron 41, Marine Base Defense Air Group 41, [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]], [[Santa Ana, California]], DeBlanc remained with that unit until December 1943, when he was transferred to Headquarters Squadron, [[Marine Aircraft Group 32]]. Two months later he rejoined Marine Base Defense Air Group 41. After one month with them, DeBlanc was assigned to [[VMF-461]], Marine Base Defense Air Group 43 at [[El Centro, California]].\n\nIn November 1944, Captain DeBlanc returned to the Central Pacific for a second tour of overseas duty. He flew with [[VMF-422]] in the [[Marshall Islands]] until May 1945, when he was transferred to [[VMF-212]], engaged in the [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]]. He continued flying in the Ryukyus until the end of the war, shooting down one more Japanese plane to bring his total to nine. He returned to the U.S. in October 1945 and was detached to Naval Air Station in Seattle, Washington.\n\n===Decorations===\nOn December 6, 1946, DeBlanc was presented the [[Medal of Honor]] by President [[Harry S. Truman]] in the [[White House]] \"for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty\" for his actions in the Solomon Islands on January 31, 1943.\n\nIn addition to the Medal of Honor, DeBlanc holds the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]; the [[Purple Heart]]; the [[Air Medal]] with four gold stars in lieu of second through fifth award; [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with one bronze star; Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three bronze stars; American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Naval Aviator Badge.jpg|200px|alt=A golden badge depicting a shield superimposed over an anchor and a pair of wings]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Medal of Honor ribbon.svg|width=106|alt=A light blue ribbon with five white five pointed stars}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Distinguished Flying Cross ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Purple Heart ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=4|type=award-star|ribbon=Air Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=United States Navy Presidential Unit Citation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=American Campaign Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=3|type=service-star|ribbon=Asiatic-Pacific Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!1st Row\n|colspan=\"14\" align=\"center\"|[[Medal of Honor]]\n|-\n!2nd Row\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Purple Heart]] \n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Air Medal]] with four gold stars\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with one bronze star\n|-\n!3rd Row\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[American Defense Service Medal]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[American Campaign Medal]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with three bronze stars\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[World War II Victory Medal (United States)|World War II Victory Medal]]\n|} </center>\n\n===Medal of Honor citation===\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\n<center>\n'''FIRST LIEUTENANT JEFFERSON J. DEBLANC'''<br/>\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE\n</center>\nfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\n:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as Leader of a Section of Six Fighter Planes in Marine Fighting Squadron ONE HUNDRED TWELVE, during aerial operations against enemy Japanese forces off Kolombangara Island in the Solomons Group, 31 January 1943. Taking off with his section as escort for a strike force of dive bombers and torpedo planes ordered to attack Japanese surface vessels, First Lieutenant DeBlanc led his flight directly to the target area where, at 14,000 feet, our strike force encountered a large number Japanese Zeros protecting the enemy's surface craft. In company with the other fighters, First Lieutenant DeBlanc instantly engaged the hostile planes and aggressively countered their repeated attempts to drive off our bombers, persevering in his efforts to protect the diving planes and waging fierce combat until, picking up a call for assistance from the dive bombers under attack by enemy float planes at 1,000 feet, he broke off his engagement with the Zeros, plunged into the formation of float planes and disrupted the savage attack, enabling our dive bombers and torpedo planes to complete their runs on the Japanese surface disposition and to withdraw without further incident. Although his escort mission was fulfilled upon the safe retirement of the bombers, First Lieutenant DeBlanc courageously remained on the scene despite a rapidly diminishing fuel supply and, boldly challenging the enemy's superior number of float planes, fought a valiant battle against terrific odds, seizing the tactical advantage and striking repeatedly to destroy three of the hostile aircraft and to disperse the remainder. Prepared to maneuver his damaged plane back to base, he had climbed aloft and set his course when he discovered two Zeros closing in behind. Undaunted, he opened fire and blasted both Zeros from the sky in short, bitterly fought action which resulted in such hopeless damage to his plane that he was forced to bail out at a perilously low altitude atop the trees on enemy-held Kolombangara. A gallant officer, a superb airman and an indomitable fighter, First Lieutenant DeBlanc had rendered decisive assistance during a critical stage of operations, and his unwavering fortitude in the face of overwhelming opposition reflects the highest credit upon himself and adds new luster to the traditions of the [[Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]].\n\n/S/ HARRY S. TRUMAN\n\n==Post-war career==\nAfter returning to the U.S., DeBlanc continued his education \u2013 earning a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S. degree]] in physics and math from [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette|Southwestern Louisiana Institute]] in 1947; an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] Education (physics) from [[Louisiana State University]] in 1951 and a second master's degree in Education (mathematics) in 1963; and earning a [[doctoral degree|doctorate]] (Ed.D) in Education from [[McNeese State University]] in 1973.\n\nDeBlanc was discharged from active duty on December 31, 1945. He returned to his home in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana]], and was assigned to the 8th [[USMCR|Marine Corps Reserve]] District, later serving as commander of Marine Air Reserve Group 18. DeBlanc retired from the [[USMCR|Marine Corps Reserve]] as a colonel on July 1, 1972.\n\nIn the mid 1970s and 1980s, DeBlanc taught middle and high school Math and Physics at AFCENT International School (currently AFNORTH International School), Brunssum, The Netherlands. He was the most awesome teacher anyone could ever have; inspiring, positive, hilarious, & brilliant. He was a champion for us all, his indomitable, always-positive spirit pushing us beyond what we thought we could do, to what he knew we could do.\n\nIn 2006, DeBlanc appeared on an episode of the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series ''[[Dogfights]]''. In the episode, titled 'Guadalcanal', DeBlanc's \"[[ace in a day]]\" action is depicted. The episode was the fourth episode of the first season of the series, which recreated historical air combat campaigns using modern computer graphics. Also in the episode, DeBlanc humorously declared that on the day he was rescued and traded back to the Navy by natives, he \"knew exactly what I was worth that day \u2013 one bag of rice!\"\n\nOn the morning of Thanksgiving Day, November 22, 2007, Jefferson DeBlanc died in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], age 86, from complications due to pneumonia.<ref name=Obit>{{Cite news|accessdate=2007-11-24|url=http://www.nola.com/newsflash/louisiana/index.ssf?/base/news-35/119594275228270.xml&storylist=louisiana|title=Ace fighter pilot, Medal of Honor recipient dies, age 86|author=Associated Press|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=November 24, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219155353/http://www.nola.com/newsflash/louisiana/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-35%2F119594275228270.xml&storylist=louisiana|archivedate=December 19, 2007}}</ref> He was the last surviving World War II recipient of the Medal of Honor from Louisiana.\n\nHe is buried in Saint Michael's Cemetery, Saint Martinville, St. Martin Parish, Louisiana.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|World War II}}\n*[[List of Medal of Honor recipients]]\n*[[List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II#D|List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II]]\n*[[George C.

He was rescued by the destroyer and returned to flight status immediately after.<ref>Hammel ''Marines at War'', p. 25.''</ref>\n\n===Medal of Honor action===\nOn 31 January, First Lieutenant DeBlanc was flying a Wildcat over Japanese-held [[Kolombangara]] island in the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons Islands]] leading eight [[F4F Wildcat]]s from VMF-112 on an escort mission for a strike force of 12 Douglas [[SBD Dauntless]] [[dive bomber]]s sent to attack Japanese shipping. ''En route'' to the target area, DeBlanc discovered and reported to Guadalcanal that his fighter had developed a serious fuel leak which made return to base unlikely and he requested that rescue forces be alerted.\n\nLeading the escorts directly to the target area, DeBlanc and the other Wildcats observed a pair of  [[Mitsubishi F1M]] \"Pete\" float planes attacking the Dauntlesses from above and behind, and he dove to disrupt their attack. DeBlanc's aircraft was fired at by the rear gunners on the \"Petes\", but he maneuvered evasively and pressed home an attack on the first, exploding it, then maneuvered and took the second under fire, hitting it in the fuel tanks and setting it afire. Although the SBDs hit their targets successfully, and the escort mission was completed, DeBlanc remained in the target area to cover the withdrawal of the Dauntlesses, despite a critically low fuel supply, and began a climb back to altitude.\n\nBy this time, night was falling, but DeBlanc observed a formation of [[Nakajima Ki-43]] \"Oscar\" [[Imperial Japanese Army]] fighters headed for the dive bombers. Surprising them from beneath, he damaged one and shot down its wingman when the latter left the formation. The others broke off their attack of the dive bombers and turned on the Wildcats. DeBlanc and his wingman attempted to defend themselves using the [[Thach Weave]], but his wingman swung too wide during the maneuver and was shot down. DeBlanc himself was saved when a third Wildcat flown by Lt. James Lavell Secrest, approaching from head-on, overflew his aircraft and forced a pursuing \"Oscar\" to dive away.\n\nDeBlanc attempted to disengage but was attacked by two more \"Oscars\". He turned towards them in a climbing head-on attack, and the first exploded in the exchange of fire. The second maneuvered behind him, however, but DeBlanc managed to slow his Wildcat abruptly and force his remaining opponent to overshoot him, and he also shot it down for his fifth victory of the day. DeBlanc was then surprised by a fighter he had not detected. Rounds struck his aircraft, ripped his [[wrist watch]] from his arm, smashed the instrument panel, and set afire the Wildcat's engine. DeBlanc was forced to bail out at low altitude over [[Vella Gulf]] near Japanese-held Kolombangara. The total time of the action from arrival in the target area to his own bailout was approximately five minutes.\n\nLanding in the sea, DeBlanc discovered that he was badly wounded in the back, arms and legs. Supported only by his [[life jacket]], he swam for the beach. After six hours in the water, he reached shore, and for three days subsisted on coconuts he found in an abandoned hut while his wounds went unattended. He was taken by a group of indigenous people who bartered him for a sack of rice to another tribe that hid him and cared for his wounds. The tribal members carried DeBlanc by outrigger canoe to the home of an [[Anglican]] [[missionary]], who forwarded him to two [[Coastwatchers]], who immediately attempted contact with the Allied authorities by clandestine radio. On 12 February, three days before his 22nd birthday, a Navy [[PBY Catalina]] patrol bomber landed in the sea off the island and tribal members paddled DeBlanc out to it in a canoe. He was flown back to his base and to the hospital.\n\n(Note: the chronology and aircraft types are those provided by DeBlanc for the recreation of this action and vary slightly from the citation, which is reproduced below. The Japanese Ki-43 was often mistaken for the [[A6M Zero]] fighter in the heat of combat.)\n\n===Further wartime service===\nPromoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] on 1 June, he was transferred to [[VMF-122]], Marine Aircraft Group 11, in July, and returned to the United States about six weeks later. Assigned to Headquarters Squadron 41, Marine Base Defense Air Group 41, [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]], [[Santa Ana, California]], DeBlanc remained with that unit until December 1943, when he was transferred to Headquarters Squadron, [[Marine Aircraft Group 32]]. Two months later he rejoined Marine Base Defense Air Group 41. After one month with them, DeBlanc was assigned to [[VMF-461]], Marine Base Defense Air Group 43 at [[El Centro, California]].\n\nIn November 1944, Captain DeBlanc returned to the Central Pacific for a second tour of overseas duty. He flew with [[VMF-422]] in the [[Marshall Islands]] until May 1945, when he was transferred to [[VMF-212]], engaged in the [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]]. He continued flying in the Ryukyus until the end of the war, shooting down one more Japanese plane to bring his total to nine. He returned to the U.S. in October 1945 and was detached to Naval Air Station in Seattle, Washington.\n\n===Decorations===\nOn December 6, 1946, DeBlanc was presented the [[Medal of Honor]] by President [[Harry S. Truman]] in the [[White House]] \"for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty\" for his actions in the Solomon Islands on January 31, 1943.\n\nIn addition to the Medal of Honor, DeBlanc holds the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]; the [[Purple Heart]]; the [[Air Medal]] with four gold stars in lieu of second through fifth award; [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with one bronze star; Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three bronze stars; American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Naval Aviator Badge.jpg|200px|alt=A golden badge depicting a shield superimposed over an anchor and a pair of wings]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Medal of Honor ribbon.svg|width=106|alt=A light blue ribbon with five white five pointed stars}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Distinguished Flying Cross ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Purple Heart ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=4|type=award-star|ribbon=Air Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=United States Navy Presidential Unit Citation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=American Campaign Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=3|type=service-star|ribbon=Asiatic-Pacific Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!1st Row\n|colspan=\"14\" align=\"center\"|[[Medal of Honor]]\n|-\n!2nd Row\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Purple Heart]] \n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Air Medal]] with four gold stars\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with one bronze star\n|-\n!3rd Row\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[American Defense Service Medal]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[American Campaign Medal]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with three bronze stars\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[World War II Victory Medal (United States)|World War II Victory Medal]]\n|} </center>\n\n===Medal of Honor citation===\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\n<center>\n'''FIRST LIEUTENANT JEFFERSON J. DEBLANC'''<br/>\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE\n</center>\nfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\n:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as Leader of a Section of Six Fighter Planes in Marine Fighting Squadron ONE HUNDRED TWELVE, during aerial operations against enemy Japanese forces off Kolombangara Island in the Solomons Group, 31 January 1943. Taking off with his section as escort for a strike force of dive bombers and torpedo planes ordered to attack Japanese surface vessels, First Lieutenant DeBlanc led his flight directly to the target area where, at 14,000 feet, our strike force encountered a large number Japanese Zeros protecting the enemy's surface craft. In company with the other fighters, First Lieutenant DeBlanc instantly engaged the hostile planes and aggressively countered their repeated attempts to drive off our bombers, persevering in his efforts to protect the diving planes and waging fierce combat until, picking up a call for assistance from the dive bombers under attack by enemy float planes at 1,000 feet, he broke off his engagement with the Zeros, plunged into the formation of float planes and disrupted the savage attack, enabling our dive bombers and torpedo planes to complete their runs on the Japanese surface disposition and to withdraw without further incident. Although his escort mission was fulfilled upon the safe retirement of the bombers, First Lieutenant DeBlanc courageously remained on the scene despite a rapidly diminishing fuel supply and, boldly challenging the enemy's superior number of float planes, fought a valiant battle against terrific odds, seizing the tactical advantage and striking repeatedly to destroy three of the hostile aircraft and to disperse the remainder. Prepared to maneuver his damaged plane back to base, he had climbed aloft and set his course when he discovered two Zeros closing in behind. Undaunted, he opened fire and blasted both Zeros from the sky in short, bitterly fought action which resulted in such hopeless damage to his plane that he was forced to bail out at a perilously low altitude atop the trees on enemy-held Kolombangara. A gallant officer, a superb airman and an indomitable fighter, First Lieutenant DeBlanc had rendered decisive assistance during a critical stage of operations, and his unwavering fortitude in the face of overwhelming opposition reflects the highest credit upon himself and adds new luster to the traditions of the [[Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]].\n\n/S/ HARRY S. TRUMAN\n\n==Post-war career==\nAfter returning to the U.S., DeBlanc continued his education \u2013 earning a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S. degree]] in physics and math from [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette|Southwestern Louisiana Institute]] in 1947; an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] Education (physics) from [[Louisiana State University]] in 1951 and a second master's degree in Education (mathematics) in 1963; and earning a [[doctoral degree|doctorate]] (Ed.D) in Education from [[McNeese State University]] in 1973.\n\nDeBlanc was discharged from active duty on December 31, 1945. He returned to his home in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana]], and was assigned to the 8th [[USMCR|Marine Corps Reserve]] District, later serving as commander of Marine Air Reserve Group 18. DeBlanc retired from the [[USMCR|Marine Corps Reserve]] as a colonel on July 1, 1972.\n\nIn the mid 1970s and 1980s, DeBlanc taught middle and high school Math and Physics at AFCENT International School (currently AFNORTH International School), Brunssum, The Netherlands. He was the most awesome teacher anyone could ever have; inspiring, positive, hilarious, & brilliant. He was a champion for us all, his indomitable, always-positive spirit pushing us beyond what we thought we could do, to what he knew we could do.\n\nIn 2006, DeBlanc appeared on an episode of the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series ''[[Dogfights]]''. In the episode, titled 'Guadalcanal', DeBlanc's \"[[ace in a day]]\" action is depicted. The episode was the fourth episode of the first season of the series, which recreated historical air combat campaigns using modern computer graphics. Also in the episode, DeBlanc humorously declared that on the day he was rescued and traded back to the Navy by natives, he \"knew exactly what I was worth that day \u2013 one bag of rice!\"\n\nOn the morning of Thanksgiving Day, November 22, 2007, Jefferson DeBlanc died in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], age 86, from complications due to pneumonia.<ref name=Obit>{{Cite news|accessdate=2007-11-24|url=http://www.nola.com/newsflash/louisiana/index.ssf?/base/news-35/119594275228270.xml&storylist=louisiana|title=Ace fighter pilot, Medal of Honor recipient dies, age 86|author=Associated Press|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=November 24, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219155353/http://www.nola.com/newsflash/louisiana/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-35%2F119594275228270.xml&storylist=louisiana|archivedate=December 19, 2007}}</ref> He was the last surviving World War II recipient of the Medal of Honor from Louisiana.\n\nHe is buried in Saint Michael's Cemetery, Saint Martinville, St. Martin Parish, Louisiana.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|World War II}}\n*[[List of Medal of Honor recipients]]\n*[[List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II#D|List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II]]\n*[[George C.

Known as \"China's first publisher\", he co-founded the [[Commercial Press]] in 1897 and oversaw its operations until his assassination in 1941.\n\n==Early life==\nXia Ruifang was born in 1871 in [[Qingpu District]] near [[Shanghai]]. His mother was a ''baomu'' (part-nurse, part-maid) who worked for the family of John Marshall Willoughby Farnham.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=189}} At age 11, Xia and his mother moved to Shanghai and attended the Presbyterian Qingxin Hall school, which Farnham was the director of. At Qingxin, Xia learnt printing and interned at the American Presbyterian Mission Press. Graduating in 1889, he found employment as a typesetter at the Chinese-language ''Wenhui bao'' and subsequently the English-language ''North China Herald''.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=189}}\n\n==Career==\nUnhappy with his treatment at the ''Herald'', Xia decided to found his own publishing firm with the help of Qingxin schoolmates Bao Xianen, Bao Xianchang, and Gao Fengchi.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=190}} Their first project, a Chinese translation of an English textbook, sold some three thousand copies. Spurred by the success of their maiden venture, the four partners quickly invested in printers from [[Japan]] and established their headquarters at a three-room shop near Jiangxi Lane; the Baos' sisters christened the start-up ''Shangwu yinshu guan'' or [[The Commercial Press]].{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=190}} In 1898, the company acquired the Japanese printshop ''Xiuwen yinshuaju'' and relocated to larger premises, this time a twelve-room building along Shunqing Lane in Beijing Road. Xia was credited with being the \"brains\" of the group who secured funding while the Baos did the actual printing; Gao continued working for the American Presbyterian Mission Press. In 1902, a fire destroyed most of the equipment that the Press had inherited from ''Xiuwen'', although the company was still able to publish five new volumes of its English-Chinese textbook.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=191}}\n\nAs the company was short on manpower, Xia had to juggle many roles, including editor, manager, proofreader, and accountant; he even personally went down to the firm's paper supplier in [[Pudong]] to collect paper. With a monthly salary of twenty-four ''[[yuan]]'', Xia had to sell insurance for a side income. Following a series of botched translation projects, Xia was faced with a cash flow problem; he was advised by his writer friend Bao Tianxiao to establish a proper editorial office and invite new partners to better manage the business.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=195}} In 1901, Xia managed to convince the [[Hanlin Academy|Hanlin]] scholar Zhang Yuanji to invest in his company; Sheng in turn recruited a partner and the company, now renamed to ''Shangwu yinshu guan gufen youxian gongsi'' or Commercial Press, Limited, saw its capital rise from 3,750 to 50,000 ''yuan''.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|pp=195\u2013196}}\n\nNow able to publish his own books, Xia moved to a retail space in Henan Road and purchased a building on Fujian North Road that he converted into a workshop. The Commercial Press' first editorial office was established in Tangjia Lane and staffed by some four or five persons personally recommended by Zhang, with the philosopher [[Cai Yuanpei]] serving as supervising editor.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=196}} Seeing it as a chance to improve the country's educational system, Cai handpicked educators from Nanyang Public Institute (now [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]), including Jiang Weiqiao and Wu Danchu to edit textbooks on a diverse list of topics including Chinese literature, history, and geography.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=196}} With the introduction of Zhang Yuanji and associates, there were now two camps in the company: the \"Church Band\" led by the Bao brothers and comprising [[Ningbo]] Presbyterians, and the \"Scholars' School\" led by Zhang and comprising intellectuals from [[Fujian]], [[Jiangsu]], and [[Zhejiang]]. Xia identified with the former group but ensured that there would be no conflict between the two.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=196}}\n\nHowever, in 1902, the company's textbook projects came to a standstill after Cai Yuanpei fled to [[Qingdao]] to avoid prosecution for sedition; Zhang took over as supervising editor a year later and enacted sweeping changes that allowed the firm to fend off competitors like Kkinkodo, Wenming, and Nanyang. The textbook collection envisaged by Cai finally came to fruition in 1904 after a series of major overhauls and a record-breaking few hundred thousand copies were sold in a few months, thus establishing the Commercial Press as the unrivalled leader in the Chinese publication industry.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|pp=196\u2013198}} They would continue to \"utterly dominate\" the textbook market in China, which had previously been largely untapped, until around 1911.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|pp=196\u2013199}}\n\n==Personal life and death==\nXia was a practising Chinese Christian who married one of the sisters of his Commercial Press co-founders, the Bao brothers.{{Sfn|Austin|2011|p=75}} On 10 January 1914, at approximately 17:00 local time, Xia was stabbed to death in front of the company's Henan Road location, at age 43.

The Commercial Press' first editorial office was established in Tangjia Lane and staffed by some four or five persons personally recommended by Zhang, with the philosopher [[Cai Yuanpei]] serving as supervising editor.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=196}} Seeing it as a chance to improve the country's educational system, Cai handpicked educators from Nanyang Public Institute (now [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]), including Jiang Weiqiao and Wu Danchu to edit textbooks on a diverse list of topics including Chinese literature, history, and geography.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=196}} With the introduction of Zhang Yuanji and associates, there were now two camps in the company: the \"Church Band\" led by the Bao brothers and comprising [[Ningbo]] Presbyterians, and the \"Scholars' School\" led by Zhang and comprising intellectuals from [[Fujian]], [[Jiangsu]], and [[Zhejiang]]. Xia identified with the former group but ensured that there would be no conflict between the two.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=196}}\n\nHowever, in 1902, the company's textbook projects came to a standstill after Cai Yuanpei fled to [[Qingdao]] to avoid prosecution for sedition; Zhang took over as supervising editor a year later and enacted sweeping changes that allowed the firm to fend off competitors like Kkinkodo, Wenming, and Nanyang. The textbook collection envisaged by Cai finally came to fruition in 1904 after a series of major overhauls and a record-breaking few hundred thousand copies were sold in a few months, thus establishing the Commercial Press as the unrivalled leader in the Chinese publication industry.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|pp=196\u2013198}} They would continue to \"utterly dominate\" the textbook market in China, which had previously been largely untapped, until around 1911.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|pp=196\u2013199}}\n\n==Personal life and death==\nXia was a practising Chinese Christian who married one of the sisters of his Commerical Press co-founders, the Bao brothers.{{Sfn|Austin|2011|p=75}} On 10 January 1914, at approximately 17:00 local time, Xia was stabbed to death in front of the company's Henan Road location, at age 43. He was reportedly killed for voicing his dissatisfaction with the military actions of [[Chen Qimei]].<ref name=ifeng>{{cite news|url=http://finance.ifeng.com/news/history/people/20090415/545054.shtml|script-title=zh:\u590f\u745e\u82b3\uff1a\u51fa\u7248\u5de8\u4eba\u7684\u7f14\u9020\u8005|trans-title=Xia Ruifang: a trailblazing publisher|language=Chinese|date=15 April 2009|last=Liyu|first=Zhao}}</ref> Yet it was also speculated that Xia's competitors may have sanctioned his assassination, as just four days before he had attempted to acquire rival firm Kinkodo which had invested in the Commercial Press.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=216}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.shine.cn/district/jing-an/Publishing-housetoasts-its-birthplace/shdaily.shtml|title=Publishing housetoasts its birthplace|date=27 February 2017|last=Qian|first=Li|newspaper=[[Shanghai Daily]]}}</ref> A third theory, promulgated by a [[San Diego]] publication on Xia's American descendants, alleges that Xia was killed by nationalists for his Chinese translations of the [[Bible]].<ref name=world>{{cite news|newspaper=The World of Chinese|first=Hatty|last=Liu|url=https://www.pressreader.com/china/the-world-of-chinese/20170315/281565175633536|title=The curious assassination of China's first publisher|date=15 March 2017}}</ref> Xia was replaced by Gao Fengchi as general manager and Zhang Yuanji as manager.{{Sfn|Reed|2011|p=216}} Xia Ruifang is now regarded as \"China's first publisher\" who founded the country's first \"modern publishing company\".<ref name=world/>\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first=Denise|last=Austin|title=\"Kingdom-Minded\" People: Christian Identity and the Contributions of Chinese Business Christians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fGAj-7uI1AC|year=2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-20402-4}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first=Christopher|last=Reed|title=Gutenberg in Shanghai: Chinese Print Capitalism, 1876-1937|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xabu9_VII18C|year=2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-4121-4}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Xia, Ruifang}}\n[[Category:1871 births]]\n[[Category:1941 deaths]]\n[[Category:Assassinated Chinese people]]\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePersonal life and death:clean up,typo(s) fixed: Commerical \u2192 Commercial", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_Ruifang"}

''Eating You Alive'' leading nutritionists and medical professionals provide a practical look at why Americans are so unhealthy, what is accountable for this, and how using whole-food, plant-based foods can improve an individual\u2019s health. The film encourages society to care for their well-being and health. \n\nThe documentary features [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[James Cameron]], [[Neal D.

To film ''Eating You Alive'' the production team flew around the nation, to catch interviews with the best scientific researchers and physicians; as well as movie stars, gourmet cooks, and people that have witnessed changes from across the globe with the goal of creating a film that teaches and encourages well-being.\n\n== Film Summary ==\nThe documentary discussed the benefits of a proper diet to reduce millions of Americans' deaths each year due to chronic diseases. Each year millions of deaths worldwide are due to chronic diseases <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/infographic/chronic-diseases.htm|title=Chronic Diseases in America {{!}} CDC|date=2020-02-24|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>, Cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death at 17.3 million per year. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm|title=Heart Disease Facts {{!}} cdc.gov|last=CDC|date=2019-12-02|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe film mainly focuses and address the continuous rise of chronic diseases in Americans as a result of diet habits, it criticizes Americans diet, and how a change in nutrition can reverse the effects of chronic diseases. The film advised tips and innovative ways of consuming products that can improve the well-being, where people that have switched from the traditional American diet to a whole-food, plant-based lifestyle have showed major improvement. Besides, it addressed certain flaws in the health care system concerning American's health and their diet as well as pollution consequences tied to the American's diet because of the animals being consumed because of the amount of methane produced by the livestock.\n\nThe film stated that chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and disabilities of Americans in the US, where chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes are affecting \u00be of the adult American population and the direct causes can be traced to the food eaten in their daily diets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aicr.org/resources/blog/focus-on-the-food-not-calories-to-lower-cancer-chronic-disease-risk/|title=Focus on the Food - Not Calories - to Lower Cancer, Chronic Disease Risk|date=2015-09-18|website=American Institute for Cancer Research|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> The documentary talks about the correlation of the American diet and its contribution, as physicians referred to in the film, to the most obese population in the history of the human race where 68.8 % of American adults are overweight or obese.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity|title=Overweight & Obesity Statistics {{!}} NIDDK|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> Physicians and nutritionists in the documentary addressed how food in the American diet has certain chemical components that have \u201censlaved\u201d people into the vast consumption of these foods. These experts claimed that the food consumed in the diets of Americans can lead to developing chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and believed that if foods cause diseases, they can also cure them.\n\nThe documentary exposed that the standard American diet, or also known as the [[Western pattern diet]], is high on sugar, fats, and salts. The experts went on to say that in the last decade, Americans diet have increased dramatically the intake of sugar, meat, fat, and calories; claiming that these components trigger dopamine reward signals creating dependence and addiction of certain foods, and in the case of sugar, the ability to suppress the immune system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/trs916/summary/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases  Report of the joint WHO/FAO expert consultation|website=WHO|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe documentary addressed flaws in the health care system that contribute to the underlying causes of chronic diseases concerning American's diet and health. The film criticized how the medical system is focused on treating the symptoms of diseases and no the causes and how to prevent them, where the American health care program is outstanding at managing cancer and illness signs but not the prevention. Throughout the film, various physicians expressed concern about medical school education and the lack of education towards nutrition. The physicians stated that nutrition topics were not addressed as it should be and very minimalist. They emphasized that doctors are taught in the first place on how to treat diseases but not how to prevent them. The documentary discussed an issue of billions of dollars being spent on medical care, experimental medicines and revolutionary health-enhancing technologies, but still, more Americans are suffering from debilitating chronic illness.\n\nIn the film, experts concluded that to the problem of chronic diseases, the remedy is better eating, especially a [[Whole food]], [[Plant-based diet]], where such conditions as high blood pressure,diabetes, and cancer could be mediated through dietary means instead of medication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/how-plant-based-food-helps-fight-cancer/art-20457590|title=How plant-based food helps fight cancer|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> Experts said that a whole diet focused on plants can not only eliminate a variety of diseases but can also reverse them. The experts, as well as witnesses who previously have been ill, expressed that plant-based nutrition can lower cholesterol levels, thus reversing Cardiovascular illnesses. Physicians and nutritionists stated that giving up dairy, meat and processed food can lead to losing a variety of chronic diseases.\n\n== Stories ==\nDan and Sheanne Moskaluk from British Columbia, Canada.\n\nAt a point in time, Sheanne weighed 293 pounds. She had gained weight because of pregnancies. She had tried diets such as [[Weight Watchers (diet)]] and [[Jenny Craig, Inc.]], which led to some weight loss but ended gaining more weight after. Dan suffered from high cholesterol levels and pre-diabetic symptoms.\n\nDan suffered from progressively increasingly intense stomach distress that resulted in a ride to the emergency department. Dan was given a CT; he was awaiting the findings of the scan to support his fears, as kidney stones have occurred in his family. When speaking with his physician he was told that it was not kidney stones, but kidney cancer and that one huge tumor was his in right kidney. He eventually discovered that he had Phase IV [[Renal cell carcinoma]]. \n\nHe was told that it was months to two years before cancer would take him. Dan\u2019s cancer magnitude was believed to quietly grow for 10 to 15 years. The tumor had developed into his lungs, and neck so he underwent an urgent surgical operation to have the kidney and associated lymph nodes removed with a high risk he could pass away during the operation.\n\nHe was put on a trial treatment that would help his immune system fight the back aggressive cancer but developed a severe reaction to the treatment forcing him to quit. After such events, both Dan and Sheanne embarked on a nutritional program that focused on eating greens, beans, nuts, and seeds. Weeks after surgery results showed that Dan recovered from the surgery and doctors were amazed at how well the surgery site healed and Sheanne lost over 80 lbs. Six months after Dan\u2019s initial diagnosis of Stage IV terminal cancer, he was off medical treatment. \n\n== References ==\n<references />\n[[Category:Documentaries]]\n[[Category:Health]]\n[[Category:Plant-based diets]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = Eating You Alive\n| director       = Paul David Kennamer Jr.\n| producer       = Kelly L.

Besides, it addressed certain flaws in the health care system concerning American's health and their diet as well as pollution consequences tied to the American's diet because of the animals being consumed because of the amount of methane produced by the livestock.\n\nThe film stated that chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and disabilities of Americans in the US, where chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes are affecting \u00be of the adult American population and the direct causes can be traced to the food eaten in their daily diets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aicr.org/resources/blog/focus-on-the-food-not-calories-to-lower-cancer-chronic-disease-risk/|title=Focus on the Food - Not Calories - to Lower Cancer, Chronic Disease Risk|date=2015-09-18|website=American Institute for Cancer Research|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> The documentary talks about the correlation of the American diet and its contribution, as physicians referred to in the film, to the most obese population in the history of the human race where 68.8 % of American adults are overweight or obese.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity|title=Overweight & Obesity Statistics {{!}} NIDDK|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> Physicians and nutritionists in the documentary addressed how food in the American diet has certain chemical components that have \u201censlaved\u201d people into the vast consumption of these foods. These experts claimed that the food consumed in the diets of Americans can lead to developing chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and believed that if foods cause diseases, they can also cure them.\n\nThe documentary exposed that the standard American diet, or also known as the [[Western pattern diet]], is high on sugar, fats, and salts. The experts went on to say that in the last decade, Americans diet have increased dramatically the intake of sugar, meat, fat, and calories; claiming that these components trigger dopamine reward signals creating dependence and addiction of certain foods, and in the case of sugar, the ability to suppress the immune system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/trs916/summary/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases  Report of the joint WHO/FAO expert consultation|website=WHO|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe documentary addressed flaws in the health care system that contribute to the underlying causes of chronic diseases concerning American's diet and health.

Throughout the film, various physicians expressed concern about medical school education and the lack of education towards nutrition. The physicians stated that nutrition topics were not addressed as it should be and very minimalist.

She had gained weight because of pregnancies. She had tried diets such as [[Weight Watchers (diet)]] and [[Jenny Craig, Inc.]], which led to some weight loss but ended gaining more weight after. Dan suffered from high cholesterol levels and pre-diabetic symptoms.\n\nDan suffered from progressively increasingly intense stomach distress that resulted in a ride to the emergency department. Dan was given a CT; he was awaiting the findings of the scan to support his fears, as kidney stones have occurred in his family. When speaking with his physician he was told that it was not kidney stones, but kidney cancer and that one huge tumor was his in right kidney. He eventually discovered that he had Phase IV [[Renal cell carcinoma]]. \n\nHe was told that it was months to two years before cancer would take him. Dan\u2019s cancer magnitude was believed to quietly grow for 10 to 15 years. The tumor had developed into his lungs, and neck so he underwent an urgent surgical operation to have the kidney and associated lymph nodes removed with a high risk he could pass away during the operation.\n\nHe was put on a trial treatment that would help his immune system fight the back aggressive cancer but developed a severe reaction to the treatment forcing him to quit. After such events, both Dan and Sheanne embarked on a nutritional program that focused on eating greens, beans, nuts, and seeds. Weeks after surgery results showed that Dan recovered from the surgery and doctors were amazed at how well the surgery site healed and Sheanne lost over 80 lbs. Six months after Dan\u2019s initial diagnosis of Stage IV terminal cancer, he was off medical treatment. \n\n== References ==\n<references />\n[[Category:Documentaries]]\n[[Category:Health]]\n[[Category:Plant-based diets]]\n", "name_user": "Ldiaz281", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_You_Alive_(Documentary_2018)"}

{"title_page": "Flute choir", "text_new": "A '''flute choir''' is an instrumental chamber ensemble consisting of range extensions of the [[flute family]]. Although a flute quartet can, in some cases depending on instrumentation, be considered a flute choir, most flute choirs extend the melodic range of the group in either direction with the addition of \"melody\" flutes. Most flute ensembles of five or more people can be considered a flute choir, although this is not a fixed number.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe modern definition of a flute choir is a recent development; likewise, the abundance of literature specifically written for the ensemble has grown alongside the ensemble itself. In the 1960s, flute choirs began to surface within colleges and communities. As there was very little music available for the instrumentation, directors of the individual groups arranged and composed music for the group. Over time, these groups learned of each other. The performers' love of the flute family eventually led to the formation of the [[National Flute Association]].

Although a flute quartet can, in some cases depending on instrumentation, be considered a flute choir, most flute choirs extend the melodic range of the group in either direction with the addition of \"melody\" flutes. Most flute ensembles of five or more people can be considered a flute choir, although this is not a fixed number.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe modern definition of a flute choir is a recent development; likewise, the abundance of literature specifically written for the ensemble has grown alongside the ensemble itself. In the 1960s, flute choirs began to surface within colleges and communities. As there was very little music available for the instrumentation, directors of the individual groups arranged and composed music for the group. Over time, these groups learned of each other. The performers' love of the flute family eventually led to the formation of the [[National Flute Association]]. In turn, this led to an increase not only in music written for the flute and flute choir, but also to an increase in flute choirs.

Los Angeles and Southern California is often as much a \u201ccharacter\u201d in his work as the human characters. Novelist and Anthony Award finalist, S.W. Lauden has said of Marks\u2019 work: \u201c\u2026[it\u2019s] almost as if the region was one of the main characters.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lauden|first1=S.W.|title=Interrogation: Paul D.

Lauden|accessdate=27 July 2015|date=2015-07-27}}</ref>\n\nHis stories often deal with the changing nature of the city and the displacement it causes people. His characters are frequently people who time has passed by or who no longer fit in today\u2019s society.\n\nMarks\u2019 first novel, the Shamus-Award winning ''White Heat'', takes place during the Rodney King Riots and deals with race and racism in the context of a mystery-thriller. Vortex, his second full length work, is also set in Los Angeles and updates the noir theme of a soldier returning home from war feeling alienated. Both are heavily influenced by the Los Angeles region and vibe. His Ellery Queen Reader's Choice Award-winning short story, ''Ghosts of Bunker Hill'', is set in the [[Angelino Heights]] community of old Victorian houses and LA\u2019s downtown [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles|Bunker Hill]] neighborhood, and was inspired by his explorations of the area before it was torn down for redevelopment.\n\nThough mostly known for [[mystery novels]], crime and [[noir fiction]], he writes in a variety of genres, including mainstream and literary. ''Terminal Island'', the story of Japanese immigrants in a fishing community off the coast of Los Angeles and their interaction with a new white neighbor during World War II was published in ''[[Weber (journal)|Weber: The Contemporary West]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weber: The Contemporary West|url=https://www.weber.edu/WSUImages/weberjournal/JournalPDFs/FallIssue09.pdf|website=Weber.edu|publisher=Weber State University}}</ref>\n\nMarks\u2019 influences include [[Raymond Chandler]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[David Goodis]], [[Dorothy B. Hughes]], [[John Fante]], [[Ross Macdonald]], [[Walter Mosley]], [[James Ellroy]] and even artist [[Edward Hopper]]. He\u2019s also been influenced by [[film noir]], [[Los Angeles]] history, including the Hollywood \u201cdream factories,\u201d and various styles of music.\n\nHe studied short story writing under [[T.C. Boyle]], at USC. Marks' non-fiction articles have appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner]]'', and ''American Premiere'' magazine.

He is co-editor of the ''Coast to Coast: Sea to Shining Sea'' mystery anthologies from Down & Out Books.\n\nAccording to Steven Bingen, co-author of ''MGM: Hollywood\u2019s Greatest Backlot'', Marks is also the last person to have shot a film on the [[MGM]] backlot. \u201cThat 40 page chronological list I mentioned of films shot at the studio ends with his [Paul D.

Los Angeles and Southern California is often as much a \u201ccharacter\u201d in his work as the human characters. Novelist and Anthony Award finalist, S.W. Lauden has said of Marks\u2019 work: \u201c\u2026[it\u2019s] almost as if the region was one of the main characters.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lauden|first1=S.W.|title=Interrogation: Paul D.

Lauden|accessdate=27 July 2015|date=2015-07-27}}</ref>\n\nHis stories often deal with the changing nature of the city and the displacement it causes people. His characters are frequently people who time has passed by or who no longer fit in today\u2019s society.\n\nMarks\u2019 first novel, the Shamus-Award winning ''White Heat'', takes place during the Rodney King Riots and deals with race and racism in the context of a mystery-thriller. Vortex, his second full length work, is also set in Los Angeles and updates the noir theme of a soldier returning home from war feeling alienated. Both are heavily influenced by the Los Angeles region and vibe. His Ellery Queen Reader's Choice Award-winning short story, ''Ghosts of Bunker Hill'', is set in the [[Angelino Heights]] community of old Victorian houses and LA\u2019s downtown [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles|Bunker Hill]] neighborhood, and was inspired by his explorations of the area before it was torn down for redevelopment.\n\nThough mostly known for [[mystery novels]], crime and [[noir fiction]], he writes in a variety of genres, including mainstream and literary. ''Terminal Island'', the story of Japanese immigrants in a fishing community off the coast of Los Angeles and their interaction with a new white neighbor during World War II was published in ''[[Weber (journal)|Weber: The Contemporary West]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weber: The Contemporary West|url=https://www.weber.edu/WSUImages/weberjournal/JournalPDFs/FallIssue09.pdf|website=Weber.edu|publisher=Weber State University}}</ref>\n\nMarks\u2019 influences include [[Raymond Chandler]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[David Goodis]], [[Dorothy B. Hughes]], [[John Fante]], [[Ross Macdonald]], [[Walter Mosley]], [[James Ellroy]] and even artist [[Edward Hopper]]. He\u2019s also been influenced by [[film noir]], [[Los Angeles]] history, including the Hollywood \u201cdream factories,\u201d and various styles of music.\n\nHe studied short story writing under [[T.C. Boyle]], at USC. Marks' non-fiction articles have appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner]]'', and ''American Premiere'' magazine. He was also a contributing editor to ''The Hollywood Gazette''.\n\nMarks blogs on a periodic basis at: [http://7CriminalMinds.blogspot.com 7CriminalMinds.blogspot.com] and [http://SleuthSayers.org SleuthSayers.org]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== P.I.

It may rise to as high as 100 particles/cm{{sup|3}}.\n\nSince the interplanetary medium is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], it has the characteristics of a plasma, rather than a simple gas; for example, it carries with it the Sun's magnetic field, is highly electrically conductive (resulting in the [[heliospheric current sheet]]), forms plasma [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]s where it comes into contact with a planetary magnetosphere or at the [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]], and exhibits filamentation (such as in [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]]).\n\nThe plasma in the interplanetary medium is also responsible for the strength of the Sun's magnetic field at the orbit of the Earth being over 100 times greater than originally anticipated. If space were a vacuum, then the Sun's {{10^|\u22124}} tesla magnetic dipole field would reduce with the cube of the distance to about {{10^|\u221211}} tesla. But satellite observations show that it is about 100 times greater at around {{10^|\u22129}} tesla. [[Magnetohydrodynamic]] (MHD) theory predicts that the motion of a conducting fluid (e.g., the interplanetary medium) in a magnetic field induces electric currents which in turn generate magnetic fields, and in this respect it behaves like an [[MHD dynamo]].\n\n==Extent of the interplanetary medium==\nThe outer edge of the [[heliosphere]] is the boundary between the flow of the solar wind and the [[interstellar medium]]. This boundary is known as the [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] and is believed to be a fairly sharp transition of the order of 110 to 160 [[astronomical unit]]s from the Sun. The interplanetary medium thus fills the roughly spherical volume contained within the heliopause.\n\n==Interaction with planets==\nHow the interplanetary medium interacts with planets depends on whether they have [[magnetic field]]s or not. Bodies such as the [[Moon]] have no magnetic field and the [[solar wind]] can impact directly on their surface. Over billions of years, the [[lunar regolith]] has acted as a collector for solar wind particles, and so studies of rocks from the [[geology of the Moon|lunar surface]] can be valuable in studies of the solar wind.\n\nHigh-energy particles from the solar wind impacting on the lunar surface also cause it to emit faintly at [[X-ray]] wavelengths.\n\nPlanets with their own magnetic field, such as the Earth and [[Jupiter]], are surrounded by a [[magnetosphere]] within which their magnetic field is dominant over the [[Sun]]'s. This disrupts the flow of the solar wind, which is channelled around the magnetosphere. Material from the solar wind can \"leak\" into the magnetosphere, causing [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]] and also populating the [[Van Allen radiation belts]] with ionised material.\n\n==Observable phenomena of the interplanetary medium==\nThe interplanetary medium is responsible for several effects which can be seen from Earth. The [[Zodiacal light]] is a broad band of faint light sometimes seen after sunset and before sunrise, stretched along the [[ecliptic]] and brightest near the horizon. It is caused by sunlight scattering off [[dust]] particles in the interplanetary medium between the Earth and the Sun.\n\nA similar effect is the [[Gegenschein]], which is seen directly opposite to the Sun's position in the sky. It is much fainter than the Zodiacal light, and is caused by sunlight reflecting off dust particles outside the Earth's orbit.\n\n==History==\nThe term \"interplanetary\" appears to have been first used in print in 1691 by the scientist [[Robert Boyle]]: \"The air is different from the \u00e6ther (or vacuum) in the... interplanetary spaces\" Boyle ''Hist. Air''.\n\nThe notion that space is considered to be a [[vacuum]] filled with an \"[[Aether (classical element)|aether]]\", or just a cold, dark vacuum continued up until the 1950s (see below).\n\nIn 1898, American astronomer [[Charles Augustus Young]] wrote: \"Inter-planetary space is a vacuum, far more perfect than anything we can produce by artificial means...\" (''The Elements of Astronomy'', Charles Augustus Young, 1898).\n\nAnd Akasofu recounted that: \"The view that interplanetary space is a vacuum into which the Sun intermittently emitted corpuscular streams was changed radically by [[Ludwig Biermann]] (1951, 1953) who proposed on the basis of comet tails, that the Sun continuously blows its atmosphere out in all directions at supersonic speed\" ([[Syun-Ichi Akasofu]], ''Exploring the Secrets of the Aurora'', 2002)\n\nTufts University Professor of astronomy, Kenneth R.
