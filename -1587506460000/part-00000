When Amelia got sick, in 1950 he sold his shop property and moved his workshop to their Long Island home to be close to her and look after her.

Only one source says March 15, 1885<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> and his obituary states his age to be 69 in December 1954, which would then indicate the birth year as 1885. The draft card of 1942 reveals his birth place to be Dzia\u0142y\u0144, but it is unclear, which of the 4 places of this name in Poland it could have been. \n\nAccording to Fairfield's book, he built his first violin already at age 9 in 1895, which would indicate that he came from a luthier or a musical family. In 1903, by the age of 17, he was a trained violin maker.<ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> \n\nAs many Poles of the time would leave the poverty and the Russian and German nationalist oppression of partitioned Poland, he joined his family in the [[United States]]. The year [[1904]], when he would be 17-18 years old, is listed as the year of his immigration in the 1920 New York census, where his name is misspelled William Wikanoski and transcribed as Wikanski. <ref name=\"1920census\">1920 US New York Census, Brooklyn</ref>\n<br>As many Poles would do to assimilate in the United States, it seems he changed his Polish first name to a somewhat similar English name with the same initial, William, which would not be given as a child name in Poland, unless as the German form Wilhelm, known in the German speaking partitions of Poland. One source lists his Polish first name as Wladyslaw.<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> In the New York census records, there are several people listed with the last name Wilkanowski. At least one male relative of Wilkanowski already resided in New York - the father of his cousin Maximilian, born in New York. In [[1905]], William and his wife Amelia had their daughter Helen; several children followed, listed as 7 children, all born in New York and speaking Polish and English, by the year 1920.<ref name=\"1920census\"></ref>\n\nInitially, William worked in the shop of Oliver Ditson of Boston. In the 1930s, he worked for Fred [[Gretsch]] ([[New York City]]), out of his own workshop and store in 58 Nassau Street, Brooklyn, New York. William was also a violinist himself and was a member of a polka band in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref>\n\n==Career in the United States==\nHe was listed as a violin maker in [[Brooklyn]] by 1933, and at least one violin made in Brooklyn dates to 1924. From 1937 to 1941, he worked in both an era and a location renowned for the [[jazz guitar]]. Gretsch offered Wilkanowski's violins in a 1940 flyer with the text \"his own personal work\u2026no other hand touches them.\" His violins were offered from $50\u2013150.\n\nWilkanowski is thought to have produced 5,000 violins and 100 [[viola]]s by 1942. <ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> Some of the higher quality violins were marked with an inlayed logo of the stylized letter ''W''; these instruments are thought to be entirely of his own making, while many of the others were made in the shops with assistants. The Gretsch Company released the Synchromatic line during the early '40s also, which were also [[archtop guitar]]s, but shared no other similarities with Wilkanowski guitars. His role in the Synchromatic is not known.\n\nAlthough known for his violins, Wilkanowski also produced a limited number of archtop guitars. The guitars were never catalogued. By 1942 he had sold 30 of these instruments, each unique in appointments and features, at $400 each, except for two deluxe Airway guitars, sold for $600. This price was in line with what was being charged for a D\u2019Angelico New Yorker, or a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] Super 400. There is no evidence of guitars made by Wilkanowski after 1943, instead he continued making and successfully selling violins until 1952.\n\n== Features of his guitars ==\nMost of the Wilkanowski guitars would look not like regular jazz guitars, but very much like oversized and slightly squished violins or small cellos with an added guitar neck. Some of his guitars did not have the cello shape, but rather a more conventional archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock is thought to have been the main influence in the headstock for the current [[Ovation Guitar]]. Many of his guitars have the unique flattened oval Wilkanowski headstock, although some featured a violin like scroll of aluminium, and some of his headstocks would just be like conventional guitar headstock. The backs of most of his guitars were one piece of flamed [[maple]], with no center joint. The wood William used would often be the Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple. The finishing techniques included very light stain, or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, standard shape, segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared.  Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several of the guitars are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One of these guitars, the Airway W-4 model with abalone shell inlayed rim around the entire body front and abalone ornaments on the neck, was given as a gift to Johnny Cash by his wife June in the 1980s. Johnny kept this guitar until his death, and the instrument was subsequently sold at the [[Johnny Cash]] estate auction by [[Sotheby's]] in 2004,<ref name=\"Cash\"></ref> for 30,000 dollars,<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref> to appear again on auctions later.\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nWilliam married a fellow Pole, Michalina Amelia Glowinska<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> in New York and together they have raised 7 daughters: Genevieve (1907-1977), Carolyne, Helen, Florence, Irene, Viola and Natalie (1924-2009), and the 2 sons Henry (1922-1965) and Theodore Joseph (1919-1969). His wife would go by her middle name Amelia, sometimes registered as Emilia. In the 1940 New York census, she is listed as Emily and 53 years old, 1 year older than William listed as \"Wm\", 52 years old. Five of their youngest children - the 3 girls and 2 sons - are listed living with the parents in the same 1940 census, which indicates their 4 oldest daughters already moved out and married.<ref name=\"1940census\">1940 US Census, New York, Brooklyn</ref> The name Joseph seems to have been significant to Wilkanowski, who would also label some of his violins with the name \"Juzek\", which is the slightly misspelled Polish diminutive of Joseph. \n\nIn 1942, both of Wilkanowski's sons were drafted for the World War 2 Young Man Draft. \nHenry was sent to fight in Germany with his infantry battalion, which earned him a military grave at the Long Island National cemetery,<ref name=\"graveHenry\">[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/82604147/henry-wilkanowski] Grave of Henry Wilkanowski</ref> and Theodore became a corporal in WWII.<ref name=\"graveTheodore\">\n[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29543508/theodore-j-wilkanowski] Grave of Theodore J. Wilkanowski</ref> <br>\nIn Henry's draft card, there is a detailed description of William as the head (of the house) of the draftee. This 1942 draft card provides the date and place of William's birth, misspelled as the non-existing place \"Dziatyn\" (as the Polish small letter [[\u0142]] looks very much like the Latin [[t]]), his age as 56, his height as 5'4, his weight as 155 pounds, his eye color as brown, hair as gray and complexion as ruddy. In the occupation field, William was not disclosed as a luthier, but as self employed.<ref name=\"draft1942\"></ref><br>\n\nThe obituary in The Brooklyn Eagle of Saturday, December 11, 1954 describes in detail the death of William as suicide by hanging and that his body was found Wednesday the 8th of December in his home by Henry, who stopped by to pick his father up for a family dinner. William was interred on Monday December 13, 1954 in the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in Westbury, Nassau County NY, next to his wife.<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref>\n\nAfter his death, a number of unfinished and dusty violins were found in his home. It seems as some of them were then finished by his coworkers or family members, as some Wilkanowski violins have labels dated later than 1952.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref>\n\n== Litterature ==\n* Bacon, Tony.

In [[1905]], William and his wife Amelia had their daughter Helen; several children followed, listed as 7 children, all born in New York and speaking Polish, by the year 1920.<ref name=\"1920census\"></ref>\n\nWilliam worked in the shops of Ditson (Boston) and Fred [[Gretsch]] ([[New York City]]) until he opened his own workshop and store in Brooklyn, New York. He was also a violinist himself and was a member of a polka band in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref>\n\n==Career in the United States==\nHe was listed as a violin maker in [[Brooklyn]] by 1933, and at least one violin made in Brooklyn dates to 1924. From 1937 to 1941, he worked in both an era and a location renowned for the [[jazz guitar]]. Gretsch offered Wilkanowski's violins in a 1940 flyer with the text \"his own personal work\u2026no other hand touches them.\" His violins were offered from $50\u2013150.\n\nWilkanowski is thought to have produced 5,000 violins and 100 [[viola]]s by 1942. <ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> Some of the higher quality violins were marked with an inlayed logo of the stylized letter ''W''; these instruments are thought to be entirely of his own making, while many of the others were made in the shops with assistants. The Gretsch Company released the Synchromatic line during the early '40s also, which were also [[archtop guitar]]s, but shared no other similarities with Wilkanowski guitars. His role in the Synchromatic is not known.\n\nAlthough known for his violins, Wilkanowski also produced a limited number of archtop guitars.  By 1942 he had sold 30 of these instruments, each unique in appointments and features, at $400 each, except for two deluxe Airway guitars, sold for $600. This price was in line with what was being charged for a D\u2019Angelico New Yorker, or a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] Super 400. There is no evidence of guitars made by Wilkanowski after 1943, instead he continued making and successfully selling violins until 1952.\n\n== Features of his guitars ==\nMost of the Wilkanowski guitars would look not like regular jazz guitars, but very much like oversized and slightly squished violins or small cellos with an added guitar neck. Some of his guitars did not have the cello shape, but rather a more conventional archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock is thought to have been the main influence in the headstock for the current [[Ovation Guitar]]. Many of his guitars have the unique flattened oval Wilkanowski headstock, although some featured a violin like scroll of aluminium, and some of his headstocks would just be like conventional guitar headstock. The backs of most of his guitars were one piece of flamed [[maple]], with no center joint. The wood William used would often be the Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple. The finishing techniques included very light stain, or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, standard shape, segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared.  Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several of the guitars are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One of these guitars, the Airway W-4 model with abalone shell inlayed rim around the entire body front and abalone ornaments on the neck, was given as a gift to Johnny Cash by his wife June in the 1980s. Johnny kept this guitar until his death, and the instrument was subsequently sold at the [[Johnny Cash]] estate auction by [[Sotheby's]] in 2004, to appear again on auction in 2009.<ref name=\"Cash\"></ref>\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nWilliam married a fellow Pole, Michalina Amelia Glowinska<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> in New York and together they have raised 7 daughters: Genevieve (1907-1977), Carolyne, Helen, Florence, Irene, Viola and Natalie (1924-2009), and the 2 sons Henry (1922-1965) and Theodore Joseph (1919-1969). His wife would go by her middle name Amelia, sometimes registered as Emilia. In the 1940 New York census, she is listed as Emily and 53 years old, 1 year older than William listed as \"Wm\", 52 years old. Five of their youngest children - the 3 girls and 2 sons - are listed living with the parents in the same 1940 census, which indicates their 4 oldest daughters already moved out and married.<ref name=\"1940census\">1940 US Census, New York, Brooklyn</ref> The name Joseph seems to have been significant to Wilkanowski, who would also label some of his violins with the name \"Juzek\", which is the slightly misspelled Polish diminutive of Joseph. \n\nIn 1942, both of Wilkanowski's sons were drafted for the World War 2 Young Man Draft. \nHenry was sent to fight in Germany with his infantry battalion, which earned him a military grave at the Long Island National cemetery,<ref name=\"graveHenry\">[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/82604147/henry-wilkanowski] Grave of Henry Wilkanowski</ref> and Theodore became a corporal in WWII.<ref name=\"graveTheodore\">\n[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29543508/theodore-j-wilkanowski] Grave of Theodore J. Wilkanowski</ref> <br>\nIn Henry's draft card, there is a detailed description of William as the head (of the house) of the draftee. This 1942 draft card provides the date and place of William's birth, misspelled as the non-existing place \"Dziatyn\" (as the Polish small letter [[\u0142]] looks very much like the Latin [[t]]), his age as 56, his height as 5'4, his weight as 155 pounds, his eye color as brown, hair as gray and complexion as ruddy. In the occupation field, William was not disclosed as a luthier, but as self employed.<ref name=\"draft1942\"></ref><br>\n\nThe obituary in The Brooklyn Eagle of Saturday, December 11, 1954 describes in detail the death of William as suicide by hanging and that his body was found Wednesday the 8th of December in his home by Henry, who stopped by to pick his father up for a family dinner. William was interred on Monday December 13, 1954 in the Cemetery of the Holy Rood, next to his wife.<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref>\n\nAfter his death, a number of unfinished and dusty violins were found in his home. It seems as some of them were then finished by his coworkers or family members, as some Wilkanowski violins have labels dated later than 1952.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref>\n\n== Litterature ==\n* Bacon, Tony.

He is best known for hosting the [[late-night talk shows]] ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', and since 2010, ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' on the cable channel [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]. Prior to his hosting career, he was a writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.\n\nBorn in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Massachusetts]], O'Brien was raised in an [[Irish Catholic]] family. He served as president of ''[[The Harvard Lampoon]]'' while attending [[Harvard University]], and was a writer for the sketch comedy series ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]''. After writing for several comedy shows in Los Angeles, he joined the writing staff of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. O'Brien was a writer and producer for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' for two seasons until he was commissioned by [[NBC]] to take over [[David Letterman]]'s position as host of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' in 1993. A virtual unknown to the public, O'Brien's initial ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]'' tenure received unfavorable reviews and remained on a multiweek renewal cycle during its early years. The show generally improved over time and was highly regarded by the time of his departure in 2009. Afterwards, O'Brien relocated from New York to Los Angeles to host his own incarnation of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' for seven months until network politics prompted a [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|host change]] in 2010.\n\nKnown for his spontaneous hosting style, which has been characterized as \"awkward, self-deprecating humor\", O'Brien's late-night programs combine the \"lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven short films (remotes)\".<ref name=\"NewYorkT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24Conan-t.html?pagewanted=all|title= Heeeere's . . .

comedian, writer, podcaster, and producer. He is best known for hosting the [[late-night talk shows]] ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', and since 2010, ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' on the cable channel [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]. Prior to his hosting career, he was a writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.\n\nBorn in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Massachusetts]], O'Brien was raised in an [[Irish Catholic]] family. He served as president of ''[[The Harvard Lampoon]]'' while attending [[Harvard University]], and was a writer for the sketch comedy series ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]''. After writing for several comedy shows in Los Angeles, he joined the writing staff of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. O'Brien was a writer and producer for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' for two seasons until he was commissioned by [[NBC]] to take over [[David Letterman]]'s position as host of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' in 1993. A virtual unknown to the public, O'Brien's initial ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]'' tenure received unfavorable reviews and remained on a multiweek renewal cycle during its early years. The show generally improved over time and was highly regarded by the time of his departure in 2009. Afterwards, O'Brien relocated from New York to Los Angeles to host his own incarnation of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' for seven months until network politics prompted a [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|host change]] in 2010.\n\nKnown for his spontaneous hosting style, which has been characterized as \"awkward, self-deprecating humor\", O'Brien's late-night programs combine the \"lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven short films (remotes)\".<ref name=\"NewYorkT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24Conan-t.html?pagewanted=all|title= Heeeere's . . .

They have generally maintained a varying degree of influence over many of the smaller mob families outside New York, including ties with the [[Philadelphia crime family|Philadelphia]], [[Patriarca crime family|Patriarca]], and [[Buffalo crime family|Buffalo]] crime families.\n\nThe current \"family\" was founded by [[Lucky Luciano|Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano]], and was known as the '''Luciano crime family''' from 1931 to 1957, when it was renamed after [[crime boss|boss]] [[Vito Genovese]]. Originally in control of the waterfront on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side of Manhattan]] and the [[Fulton Fish Market]], the family was run for years by \"the Oddfather\", [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent \"the Chin\" Gigante]], who feigned insanity by shuffling unshaven through New York's [[Greenwich Village]] wearing a tattered bath robe and muttering to himself incoherently to avoid prosecution.\n\nThe Genovese family is the oldest and the largest of the \"Five Families\". Finding new ways to make money in the 21st century, the family took advantage of lax [[due diligence]] by banks during the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] with a wave of [[mortgage fraud]]s. Prosecutors say [[loan shark]] victims obtained [[home equity loan]]s to pay off debts to their mob bankers. The family found ways to use new technology to improve on [[Gaming law|illegal gambling]], with customers placing bets through offshore sites via the [[Internet]].\n\nAlthough the leadership of the Genovese family seemed to have been in limbo after the death of Gigante in 2005, they appear to be the most organized and powerful family in the [[United States]], with sources believing that [[Liborio Bellomo|Liborio \"Barney\" Bellomo]] is the current boss of the organization.<ref name=\"castff\">[http://www.wmob.com/cast.html The Frank And Fritzy Show: Cast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314123945/http://www.wmob.com/cast.html |date=2008-03-14 }} - the wiretap network - wmob.com</ref> Unique in today's Mafia, the family has benefited greatly from members following \"[[Omert\u00e0]],\" a code of conduct emphasizing secrecy and non-cooperation with law enforcement and the justice system.

Morello's half brothers [[Nicholas Morello|Nicholas]], [[Vincenzo Terranova|Vincenzo]], [[Ciro Terranova|Ciro]] and the rest of [[Giuseppe Morello#Early life|his family]] joined him in New York the following year. The Morello brothers formed the 107th Street Mob and began dominating the Italian neighborhood of [[East Harlem]], parts of [[Manhattan]], and [[the Bronx]].\n\nOne of Giuseppe Morello's strongest allies was [[Ignazio Lupo|Ignazio \"the Wolf\" Lupo]], a mobster who controlled Manhattan's [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]]. In 1903, Lupo married Morello's half sister, uniting both organizations. The Morello-Lupo alliance continued to prosper in 1903, when the group began a major [[counterfeit]]ing ring with powerful Sicilian ''[[Made man|mafioso]]'' [[Vito Cascioferro|Vito Cascio Ferro]], printing $5 bills in Sicily and [[smuggling]] them into the [[United States]]. New York police detective [[Joseph Petrosino]] began investigating the Morello family's counterfeiting operation, the [[barrel murder]]s and the [[Black Hand (extortion)|black hand]] [[extortion]] letters. On November 15, 1909, Morello, Lupo and others were arrested on counterfeiting charges. In February 1910, Morello and Lupo were sentenced to 25 and 30 years in prison, respectively.<ref name=\"Capeci guide\">[[Jerry Capeci|Capeci, Jerry]].

The Morellos had an alliance with [[Giosue Gallucci]], a prominent East Harlem businessman and [[Camorra|Camorrista]] with local political connections. On May 17, 1915, Gallucci was murdered in a power struggle between the Morellos and the [[Camorra in New York|Neapolitan Camorra organization]], which consisted of two [[Brooklyn]] gangs run by [[Pellegrino Morano]] and [[Alessandro Vollero]]. The fight over Gallucci's [[racket (crime)|racket]]s became known as the [[Mafia-Camorra War]]. After months of fighting, Morano offered a [[truce]]. A meeting was arranged at a Navy Street cafe owned by Vollero. On September 7, 1916, Nicholas Morello and his bodyguard [[Mafia\u2013Camorra War|Charles Ubriaco]] were ambushed and killed upon arrival by five members of the Camorra gang.<ref name=\"Morello, Ubriaco dead\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/09/08/105463376.pdf 2 Die In Pistol Fight in Brooklyn Street], The New York Times, September 8, 1916</ref> In 1917, Morano was charged with Morello's murder after Camorrista [[Ralph Daniello]] implicated him in the murder. By 1918, law enforcement had sent many Camorra gang members to prison, decimating the Camorra in New York and ending the war. Many of the remaining Camorra members joined the Morello family.\n\nThe Morellos now faced stronger rivals than the Camorra. With the passage of [[Prohibition]] in 1919 and the ban of alcohol sales, the family regrouped and built a lucrative [[rum-running|bootlegging]] operation in Manhattan. In 1920, both Morello and Lupo were released from prison and Brooklyn Mafia [[Boss (crime)|boss]] [[Salvatore D'Aquila]] ordered their murders. This is when [[Joe Masseria|Joseph Masseria]] and [[Umberto Valenti (gangster)|Rocco Valenti]], a former Brooklyn Camorra, began to fight for control of the Morello family.<ref>David Critchley ''The Origin of Organized Crime in America: The New York City Mafia, 1891\u20131931'' pg.155</ref> On December 29, 1920, Masseria's men murdered Valenti's ally, Salvatore Mauro.

Their rivalry eventually escalated into the bloody [[Castellammarese War]].\n\nIn early 1931, Luciano decided to eliminate Masseria.

This first panel included acting boss [[Thomas Eboli|Thomas \"Tommy Ryan\" Eboli]], underboss [[Gerardo Catena|Gerardo \"Jerry\" Catena]], and Catena's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Philip Lombardo|Philip \"Benny Squint\" Lombardo]]. After Genovese died in 1969, Lombardo was named his successor. However, the family appointed a series of \"front bosses\" to masquerade as the official family boss. The aim of these deceptions was to protect Lombardo by confusing law enforcement about who was the true leader of the family. In the late 1960s, Gambino loaned $4 million to Eboli for a drug scheme in an attempt to gain control of the Genovese family. When Eboli failed to pay back his debt, Gambino, with Commission approval, murdered Eboli in 1972.\n\nAfter Eboli's death, Genovese ''capo'' and Gambino ally [[Frank Tieri (mobster)|Frank \"Funzi\" Tieri]] was appointed as the new front boss. In reality, the Genovese family created a new ruling panel to run the family. This second panel consisted of Catena, Lombardo and [[Michele Miranda|Michele \"Big Mike\" Miranda]]. In 1981, Tieri became the first ''Cosa Nostra'' boss to be convicted under the new [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO Act]] and died in prison later that year.<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/genovese1/7.html Epic saga of the Genovese Crime Family] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217022341/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/genovese1/7.html |date=2007-12-17 }}(Page 7) - By Anthony Bruno - Crime Library on truTV.com</ref> After Tieri's imprisonment, the family reshuffled its leadership. The ''capo'' of the Manhattan faction, [[Anthony Salerno|Anthony \"Fat Tony\" Salerno]], became the new front boss. Lombardo, the ''de facto'' boss of the family, soon retired and [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent \"Chin\" Gigante]], the triggerman on the failed Costello hit, took actual control of the family.<ref name=\"cs8\" />\n\nIn 1985, Salerno was convicted in the [[Mafia Commission Trial]] and sentenced to 100 years in federal prison.<ref name=\"judge sentences 8\">{{cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|title= Judge Sentences 8 Mafia Leaders to Prison Terms |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/14/nyregion/judge-sentences-8-mafia-leaders-to-prison-terms.html?src=pm|accessdate=October 13, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 14, 1987}}</ref> In 1986, shortly after Salerno's conviction in the Commission Trial, Salerno's longtime right-hand man, [[Vincent Cafaro|Vincent \"The Fish\" Cafaro]], turned [[informant]], and told the FBI that Salerno had been the front boss for head Gigante.

His best-known tactic to confuse law enforcement was by pretending [[insanity]]. Gigante frequently walked down New York streets in a [[bathrobe]], mumbling incoherently. He succeeded in convincing court-appointed [[psychiatrist]]s that his mental illness was worsening, and avoided several criminal prosecutions. The New York media soon nicknamed him \"The Oddfather\".<ref name=\"cs9\">[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/genovese1/9.html Epic saga of the Genovese Crime Family] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212091455/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/genovese1/9.html |date=2008-02-12 }}(page 9) - By Anthony Bruno - Crime Library on truTV.com</ref>\n\nGigante reportedly operated from the [[Triangle Social Club]] in [[Greenwich Village]] in Manhattan. He never left his house during the day, fearing that the FBI would sneak in and plant a bug. At night, he would sneak away from his house and conduct family business when FBI surveillance was more lax. Even then, he only whispered to keep from being picked up by wiretaps. To avoid incrimination from undercover surveillance, Gigante decreed that any mobster who spoke his name would face severe punishment. In the case of his own crime family, anyone who spoke his name would be killed on the spot. When necessary, mobsters would either point to their chins or make a \"C\" with thumb and forefinger when referring to him. In this way, Gigante managed to stay on the streets while the city's other four bosses ended up getting long prison terms.\n\nAnother evasive measure Gigante used from 1992 onward was a reformed \"administration\" structure. Gigante was unnerved by Salerno's conviction and long sentence, and decided he needed greater protection. However, the \"front boss\" ruse no longer protected him. To solve this problem, Gigante instituted two new posts, the \"street boss\" and the \"messenger.\" The street boss ran the family's day-to-day operations under Gigante's remote direction. The messenger delivered Gigante's instructions to his ''capos'' and soldiers. As a result of these changes, Gigante did not directly communicate with other family mobsters, with the exception of his sons, Vincent Esposito and Andrew Gigante, and a few other close associates. While the public and media were watching Gigante, other family leaders were running the day-to-day operations of the family. Underboss [[Venero Mangano|Venero \"Benny Eggs\" Mangano]] operated out of Brooklyn and ran the family's [[Venero Mangano#1991 Windows case|window replacement rackets]]. ''Consigliere'' [[Louis Manna|Louis \"Bobby\" Manna]] operated out of [[New Jersey]] and supervised four ''capos'' around that area during the 1980s.\n\nIn 1985, Gigante and other family bosses were shocked and enraged by the murder of [[Paul Castellano]], the Gambino family boss. An ambitious Gambino ''capo'', [[John Gotti]], had capitalized on discontent in that family to murder Castellano and his underboss outside a Manhattan restaurant and become the new Gambino boss. Gotti had violated ''Cosa Nostra'' protocol by failing to obtain prior approval for the murder from the Commission. Gigante\u2014who had been the triggerman on the last unsanctioned hit on a boss with the failed attempt against Costello\u2014now controlled the Commission and he decided to kill Gotti. Gigante, Lucchese boss [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]] and underboss [[Anthony Casso|Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso]] hatched a scheme to kill Gotti with a [[car bomb]]. On April 13, 1986, a bomb exploded in Gambino underboss [[Frank DeCicco]]'s car, killing him. However, Gotti was not in the car that day and escaped harm.<ref name=\"cs9\" /> Although Gigante eventually made peace with Gotti, he remained the most powerful boss in New York. The Genoveses dominated [[construction]] and [[Trade union|union]] rackets, [[gambling]] rackets, and operations at the Fulton Fish Market and the waterfront operations. During this period, Gigante used intimidation and murder to maintain control of the family.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, law enforcement used several high-profile government informants and witnesses to finally put Gigante in prison. Faced with criminal prosecution, Gambino underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano]] agreed to testify against Gotti and other ''Cosa Nostra'' leaders, including Gigante. Philadelphia underboss [[Phil Leonetti]] also became a government witness and testified that during the 1980s, Gigante had ordered the murders of several Philadelphia associates. Finally, Casso implicated Gigante in the 1986 plan to kill Gotti, DeCicco and [[Gene Gotti|Eugene \"Gene\" Gotti]]. While in prison, Gigante was recorded as saying that he'd feigned insanity for forty years. In 1997, he was convicted on racketeering and conspiracy charges and sentenced to twelve years in federal prison. While Gigante was in prison, the Genovese family was run by acting boss [[Matthew Ianniello|Matthew \"Matty the Horse\" Ianniello]],<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/07/28/mafia.racketeering/index.html Reputed Genovese family members indicted] From Marissa Muller, CNN, July 28, 2005</ref> he received help from ''capos'' Ernest Muscarella, [[Dominick Cirillo]], and Gigante's brother [[Mario Gigante|Mario]].\n\nGigante was indicted in 2002 for running his family from prison and for delaying his initial trial by feigning insanity. Prosecutors also obtained evidence that he'd used his son, Andrew, to deliver instructions to his soldiers and had enlisted several members of his family to keep up the charade that he was insane. Had he been convicted, Gigante faced an additional twenty years in prison, which at his age would have effectively been a life sentence. Rather than risk having his relatives charged with [[obstruction of justice]], Gigante pleaded guilty in April 2003 and accepted an additional three years in prison. On December 19, 2005, Gigante died in prison from [[heart disease]].\n\nSince the 1990s, infamous mobsters in top positions of the other Five Families have become informants and testified against many mobsters, putting bosses, ''capos'', and soldiers into prison. The most prominent government witness was [[Bonanno crime family]] boss [[Joseph Massino|Joseph \"Big Joe\" Massino]], who started cooperating in 2005. Mangano, Manna, ''capo'' [[James Ida|James \"Little Jimmy\" Ida]] and street boss [[Liborio Bellomo|Liborio \"Barney\" Bellomo]] received lengthy prison sentences on murder, racketeering and conspiracy convictions. U.S. law enforcement systematically broke down the Genovese crime family, as well as the other Mafia families. Despite these indictments, the Genovese family remains a formidable power with approximately 250 made men and fourteen active crews as of 2005, according to [[Selwyn Raab]].\n\n===Current position and leadership===\nWhen Gigante died in late 2005, the leadership went to Genovese ''capo'' [[Daniel Leo (mobster)|Daniel \"Danny the Lion\" Leo]], who was apparently running the day-to-day activities of the Genovese crime family by 2006.<ref name=\"Capeci\">Capeci, Jerry, \"[http://www.nysun.com/article/44363 Meet the Genovese Crime Family's New Boss], November 30, 2006, ''The New York Sun''</ref> That same year, Cirillo was reportedly promoted to ''consigliere'' behind bars and Mangano was released from prison.

In December 2008, Bellomo was [[parole]]d after serving twelve years. What role Bellomo plays in the Genovese hierarchy is open to speculation, but he is likely to have a major say in the running of the family once his tight parole restrictions are over.\n\nA March 2009 article in the ''[[New York Post]]'' claimed Leo was still acting boss despite his incarceration.

They have generally maintained a varying degree of influence over many of the smaller mob families outside New York, including ties with the [[Philadelphia crime family|Philadelphia]], [[Patriarca crime family|Patriarca]], and [[Buffalo crime family|Buffalo]] crime families.\n\nThe current \"family\" was founded by [[Lucky Luciano|Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano]], and was known as the '''Luciano crime family''' from 1931 to 1957, when it was renamed after [[crime boss|boss]] [[Vito Genovese]]. Originally in control of the waterfront on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side of Manhattan]] and the [[Fulton Fish Market]], the family was run for years by \"the Oddfather\", [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent \"the Chin\" Gigante]], who feigned insanity by shuffling unshaven through New York's [[Greenwich Village]] wearing a tattered bath robe and muttering to himself incoherently to avoid prosecution.\n\nThe Genovese family is the oldest and the largest of the \"Five Families\". Finding new ways to make money in the 21st century, the family took advantage of lax [[due diligence]] by banks during the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] with a wave of [[mortgage fraud]]s. Prosecutors say [[loan shark]] victims obtained [[home equity loan]]s to pay off debts to their mob bankers. The family found ways to use new technology to improve on [[Gaming law|illegal gambling]], with customers placing bets through offshore sites via the [[Internet]].\n\nAlthough the leadership of the Genovese family seemed to have been in limbo after the death of Gigante in 2005, they appear to be the most organized and powerful family in the [[United States]], with sources believing that [[Liborio Bellomo|Liborio \"Barney\" Bellomo]] is the current boss of the organization.<ref name=\"castff\">[http://www.wmob.com/cast.html The Frank And Fritzy Show: Cast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314123945/http://www.wmob.com/cast.html |date=2008-03-14 }} - the wiretap network - wmob.com</ref> Unique in today's Mafia, the family has benefited greatly from members following \"[[Omert\u00e0]],\" a code of conduct emphasizing secrecy and non-cooperation with law enforcement and the justice system.

Morello's half brothers [[Nicholas Morello|Nicholas]], [[Vincenzo Terranova|Vincenzo]], [[Ciro Terranova|Ciro]] and the rest of [[Giuseppe Morello#Early life|his family]] joined him in New York the following year. The Morello brothers formed the 107th Street Mob and began dominating the Italian neighborhood of [[East Harlem]], parts of [[Manhattan]], and [[the Bronx]].\n\nOne of Giuseppe Morello's strongest allies was [[Ignazio Lupo|Ignazio \"the Wolf\" Lupo]], a mobster who controlled Manhattan's [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]]. In 1903, Lupo married Morello's half sister, uniting both organizations. The Morello-Lupo alliance continued to prosper in 1903, when the group began a major [[counterfeit]]ing ring with powerful Sicilian ''[[Made man|mafioso]]'' [[Vito Cascioferro|Vito Cascio Ferro]], printing $5 bills in Sicily and [[smuggling]] them into the [[United States]]. New York police detective [[Joseph Petrosino]] began investigating the Morello family's counterfeiting operation, the [[barrel murder]]s and the [[Black Hand (extortion)|black hand]] [[extortion]] letters. On November 15, 1909, Morello, Lupo and others were arrested on counterfeiting charges.

The Morellos had an alliance with [[Giosue Gallucci]], a prominent East Harlem businessman and [[Camorra|Camorrista]] with local political connections. On May 17, 1915, Gallucci was murdered in a power struggle between the Morellos and the [[Camorra in New York|Neapolitan Camorra organization]], which consisted of two [[Brooklyn]] gangs run by [[Pellegrino Morano]] and [[Alessandro Vollero]]. The fight over Gallucci's [[racket (crime)|racket]]s became known as the [[Mafia-Camorra War]]. After months of fighting, Morano offered a [[truce]]. A meeting was arranged at a Navy Street cafe owned by Vollero. On September 7, 1916, Nicholas Morello and his bodyguard [[Mafia\u2013Camorra War|Charles Ubriaco]] were ambushed and killed upon arrival by five members of the Camorra gang.<ref name=\"Morello, Ubriaco dead\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/09/08/105463376.pdf 2 Die In Pistol Fight in Brooklyn Street], The New York Times, September 8, 1916</ref> In 1917, Morano was charged with Morello's murder after Camorrista [[Ralph Daniello]] implicated him in the murder. By 1918, law enforcement had sent many Camorra gang members to prison, decimating the Camorra in New York and ending the war. Many of the remaining Camorra members joined the Morello family.\n\nThe Morellos now faced stronger rivals than the Camorra. With the passage of [[Prohibition]] in 1919 and the ban of alcohol sales, the family regrouped and built a lucrative [[rum-running|bootlegging]] operation in Manhattan. In 1920, both Morello and Lupo were released from prison and Brooklyn Mafia [[Boss (crime)|boss]] [[Salvatore D'Aquila]] ordered their murders. This is when [[Joe Masseria|Joseph Masseria]] and [[Umberto Valenti (gangster)|Rocco Valenti]], a former Brooklyn Camorra, began to fight for control of the Morello family.<ref>David Critchley ''The Origin of Organized Crime in America: The New York City Mafia, 1891\u20131931'' pg.155</ref> On December 29, 1920, Masseria's men murdered Valenti's ally, Salvatore Mauro.

After Genovese died in 1969, Lombardo was named his successor. However, the family appointed a series of \"front bosses\" to masquerade as the official family boss. The aim of these deceptions was to protect Lombardo by confusing law enforcement about who was the true leader of the family. In the late 1960s, Gambino loaned $4 million to Eboli for a drug scheme in an attempt to gain control of the Genovese family. When Eboli failed to pay back his debt, Gambino, with Commission approval, murdered Eboli in 1972.\n\nAfter Eboli's death, Genovese ''capo'' and Gambino ally [[Frank Tieri (mobster)|Frank \"Funzi\" Tieri]] was appointed as the new front boss. In reality, the Genovese family created a new ruling panel to run the family. This second panel consisted of Catena, Lombardo and [[Michele Miranda|Michele \"Big Mike\" Miranda]].

At night, he would sneak away from his house and conduct family business when FBI surveillance was more lax. Even then, he only whispered to keep from being picked up by wiretaps. To avoid incrimination from undercover surveillance, Gigante decreed that any mobster who spoke his name would face severe punishment. In the case of his own crime family, anyone who spoke his name would be killed on the spot. When necessary, mobsters would either point to their chins or make a \"C\" with thumb and forefinger when referring to him. In this way, Gigante managed to stay on the streets while the city's other four bosses ended up getting long prison terms.\n\nAnother evasive measure Gigante used from 1992 onward was a reformed \"administration\" structure. Gigante was unnerved by Salerno's conviction and long sentence, and decided he needed greater protection. However, the \"front boss\" ruse no longer protected him. To solve this problem, Gigante instituted two new posts, the \"street boss\" and the \"messenger.\" The street boss ran the family's day-to-day operations under Gigante's remote direction. The messenger delivered Gigante's instructions to his ''capos'' and soldiers. As a result of these changes, Gigante did not directly communicate with other family mobsters, with the exception of his sons, Vincent Esposito and Andrew Gigante, and a few other close associates. While the public and media were watching Gigante, other family leaders were running the day-to-day operations of the family. Underboss [[Venero Mangano|Venero \"Benny Eggs\" Mangano]] operated out of Brooklyn and ran the family's [[Venero Mangano#1991 Windows case|window replacement rackets]]. ''Consigliere'' [[Louis Manna|Louis \"Bobby\" Manna]] operated out of [[New Jersey]] and supervised four ''capos'' around that area during the 1980s.\n\nIn 1985, Gigante and other family bosses were shocked and enraged by the murder of [[Paul Castellano]], the Gambino family boss. An ambitious Gambino ''capo'', [[John Gotti]], had capitalized on discontent in that family to murder Castellano and his underboss outside a Manhattan restaurant and become the new Gambino boss. Gotti had violated ''Cosa Nostra'' protocol by failing to obtain prior approval for the murder from the Commission. Gigante\u2014who had been the triggerman on the last unsanctioned hit on a boss with the failed attempt against Costello\u2014now controlled the Commission and he decided to kill Gotti. Gigante, Lucchese boss [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]] and underboss [[Anthony Casso|Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso]] hatched a scheme to kill Gotti with a [[car bomb]]. On April 13, 1986, a bomb exploded in Gambino underboss [[Frank DeCicco]]'s car, killing him. However, Gotti was not in the car that day and escaped harm.<ref name=\"cs9\" /> Although Gigante eventually made peace with Gotti, he remained the most powerful boss in New York. The Genoveses dominated [[construction]] and [[Trade union|union]] rackets, [[gambling]] rackets, and operations at the Fulton Fish Market and the waterfront operations. During this period, Gigante used intimidation and murder to maintain control of the family.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, law enforcement used several high-profile government informants and witnesses to finally put Gigante in prison. Faced with criminal prosecution, Gambino underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano]] agreed to testify against Gotti and other ''Cosa Nostra'' leaders, including Gigante. Philadelphia underboss [[Phil Leonetti]] also became a government witness and testified that during the 1980s, Gigante had ordered the murders of several Philadelphia associates. Finally, Casso implicated Gigante in the 1986 plan to kill Gotti, DeCicco and [[Gene Gotti|Eugene \"Gene\" Gotti]]. While in prison, Gigante was recorded as saying that he'd feigned insanity for forty years. In 1997, he was convicted on racketeering and conspiracy charges and sentenced to twelve years in federal prison. While Gigante was in prison, the Genovese family was run by acting boss [[Matthew Ianniello|Matthew \"Matty the Horse\" Ianniello]],<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/07/28/mafia.racketeering/index.html Reputed Genovese family members indicted] From Marissa Muller, CNN, July 28, 2005</ref> he received help from ''capos'' Ernest Muscarella, [[Dominick Cirillo]], and Gigante's brother [[Mario Gigante|Mario]].\n\nGigante was indicted in 2002 for running his family from prison and for delaying his initial trial by feigning insanity. Prosecutors also obtained evidence that he'd used his son, Andrew, to deliver instructions to his soldiers and had enlisted several members of his family to keep up the charade that he was insane. Had he been convicted, Gigante faced an additional twenty years in prison, which at his age would have effectively been a life sentence. Rather than risk having his relatives charged with [[obstruction of justice]], Gigante pleaded guilty in April 2003 and accepted an additional three years in prison. On December 19, 2005, Gigante died in prison from [[heart disease]].\n\nSince the 1990s, infamous mobsters in top positions of the other Five Families have become informants and testified against many mobsters, putting bosses, ''capos'', and soldiers into prison. The most prominent government witness was [[Bonanno crime family]] boss [[Joseph Massino|Joseph \"Big Joe\" Massino]], who started cooperating in 2005. Mangano, Manna, ''capo'' [[James Ida|James \"Little Jimmy\" Ida]] and street boss [[Liborio Bellomo|Liborio \"Barney\" Bellomo]] received lengthy prison sentences on murder, racketeering and conspiracy convictions. U.S. law enforcement systematically broke down the Genovese crime family, as well as the other Mafia families. Despite these indictments, the Genovese family remains a formidable power with approximately 250 made men and fourteen active crews as of 2005, according to [[Selwyn Raab]].\n\n===Current position and leadership===\nWhen Gigante died in late 2005, the leadership went to Genovese ''capo'' [[Daniel Leo (mobster)|Daniel \"Danny the Lion\" Leo]], who was apparently running the day-to-day activities of the Genovese crime family by 2006.<ref name=\"Capeci\">Capeci, Jerry, \"[http://www.nysun.com/article/44363 Meet the Genovese Crime Family's New Boss], November 30, 2006, ''The New York Sun''</ref> That same year, Cirillo was reportedly promoted to ''consigliere'' behind bars and Mangano was released from prison.

In December 2008, Bellomo was [[parole]]d after serving twelve years. What role Bellomo plays in the Genovese hierarchy is open to speculation, but he is likely to have a major say in the running of the family once his tight parole restrictions are over.\n\nA March 2009 article in the ''[[New York Post]]'' claimed Leo was still acting boss despite his incarceration.

It is affiliated with the United States [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The State Chairman is [[James Dickey (Texas politician)|James Dickey]], an insurance executive from [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], and the Vice-Chairman is Alma Jackson of [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. The RPT is headquartered in [[Downtown Austin|Downtown]] [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The RPT is legally classified as a [[political action committee]] whose structure is determined by state law and by [https://www.texasgop.org/rules/ party rules] not in conflict with state law.\n\n==History==\n[[File:George H. W. Bush, President of the United States, 1989 official portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|President [[George H.W. Bush]] (1989-1993)]]\n[[File:George-W-Bush.jpeg|thumb|right|President [[George W. Bush]] (2001-2009)]]\n\nThe Republican Party developed dramatically in Texas during Reconstruction after constitutional amendments freeing the slaves and giving suffrage to black males, as blacks joined the party that had ensured the end of slavery. African-American leaders, frequently men of [[mixed race]] who had been free and educated before the war, provided leadership in extending education and work opportunities to blacks after the war. They supported establishment of a public school system for the first time. Men such as [[William Madison McDonald]] in Fort Worth, [[Norris Wright Cuney]] in Galveston, and [[Henry Clay Ferguson]] worked for the black community and the state.\n\nIn 1870, [[Edmund J. Davis|Edmund Davis]] was elected Governor, but was soundly defeated in 1874. In the year 1876, Republicans had made gradual gains in Texas, earning nearly one-third of the statewide vote and electing a small number of candidates to the State Legislature (including several African Americans).\n\nAfter the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], the Republican Party of Texas gradually lost power, and after the turn of the century, the \"Lily Whites\" pushed blacks out of power. The Democrats passed [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchising]] laws near the turn of the century requiring [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] be paid prior to voter registration; together with the party establishing white primaries, black voting dropped dramatically, from more than 100,000 statewide in the 1890s, to 5,000 in 1906.<ref name=\"MOTTU\">{{cite book | title=African-American Pioneers of Texas: From the Old West to the New Frontiers (Teacher's Manual) | publisher=Museum of Texas Tech University: Education Division | page=25 | url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/museumttu/a-a.%20teacher's%20manual.pdf | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205173917/http://www.depts.ttu.edu/museumttu/A-A.%20Teacher%27s%20Manual.pdf | archivedate=February 5, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>  Mexican Americans and poor whites were also adversely affected by such measures. For more than 100 years, the Republicans were a minority party in the state. As a result, the biggest base of electoral support for the Republican Party in Texas during this time was the [[German Texan]] community in the [[Texas Hill Country]], with the majority-German [[Gillespie County, Texas|Gillespie]], [[Guadalupe County, Texas|Guadalupe]] and [[Kendall County, Texas|Kendall]] counties constituting the most Republican counties in the state of Texas throughout the late 19th and into the 20th century. \n\nBetween the departing of [[Robert B. Hawley]] from his second [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] term in 1901 and the seating of [[Bruce Alger]] in 1954, the sole Republican to represent Texas in Congress was [[Harry M. Wurzbach]], a politician from the German Texan community in the Hill Country who served in the U.S. House for most of the 1920s and left office in 1931.<ref>Wurzbach's election and re-election as a Republican were something of an anomaly. He is the eponym honored in the Wurzbach Parkway in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]].</ref> The first Republican statewide primary was held in 1926, but drew only 15,239 voters. By contrast, the Democratic primary in the same year drew 821,234 voters, as disfranchisement was well established, and Texas was essentially a one-party, white-only voting state.

That same year, three Republicans were elected to the [[Texas House of Representatives]], and the first Republican was elected to the [[Texas Senate]] in 39 years. By 1972, Texas Republicans had increased their gains to 17 members of the Texas House and 3 members of the Texas Senate.<ref name=history/>\n\nThe true turning point for Texas Republicans occurred in the May 1976 primary, when [[Ronald Reagan]] defeated [[Gerald Ford]] by a two-to-one margin in the state's presidential primary.

Bush]] (2001-2009)]]\n\nThe Republican Party developed dramatically in Texas during Reconstruction after constitutional amendments freeing the slaves and giving suffrage to black males, as blacks joined the party that had ensured the end of slavery. African-American leaders, frequently men of [[mixed race]] who had been free and educated before the war, provided leadership in extending education and work opportunities to blacks after the war. They supported establishment of a public school system for the first time. Men such as [[William Madison McDonald]] in Fort Worth, [[Norris Wright Cuney]] in Galveston, and [[Henry Clay Ferguson]] worked for the black community and the state.\n\nIn 1870, [[Edmund J. Davis|Edmund Davis]] was elected Governor, but was soundly defeated in 1874. In the year 1876, Republicans had made gradual gains in Texas, earning nearly one-third of the statewide vote and electing a small number of candidates to the State Legislature (including several African Americans).\n\nAfter the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], the Republican Party of Texas gradually lost power, and after the turn of the century, the \"Lily Whites\" pushed blacks out of power. The Democrats passed [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchising]] laws near the turn of the century requiring [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] be paid prior to voter registration; together with the party establishing white primaries, black voting dropped dramatically, from more than 100,000 statewide in the 1890s, to 5,000 in 1906.<ref name=\"MOTTU\">{{cite book | title=African-American Pioneers of Texas: From the Old West to the New Frontiers (Teacher's Manual) | publisher=Museum of Texas Tech University: Education Division | page=25 | url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/museumttu/a-a.%20teacher's%20manual.pdf | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205173917/http://www.depts.ttu.edu/museumttu/A-A.%20Teacher%27s%20Manual.pdf | archivedate=February 5, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>  Mexican Americans and poor whites were also adversely affected by such measures. For more than 100 years, the Republicans were a minority party in the state. As a result, the biggest base of electoral support for the Republican Party in Texas during this time was the [[German Texan]] community in the [[Texas Hill Country]], with the majority-German [[Gillespie County, Texas|Gillespie]], [[Guadalupe County, Texas|Guadalupe]] and [[Kendall County, Texas|Kendall]] counties constituting the most Republican counties in the state of Texas throughout the late 19th and into the 20th century. \n\nBetween the departing of [[Robert B. Hawley]] from his second [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] term in 1901 and the seating of [[Bruce Alger]] in 1954, the sole Republican to represent Texas in Congress was [[Harry M. Wurzbach]], a politician from the German Texan community in the Hill Country who served in the U.S. House for most of the 1920s and left office in 1931.<ref>Wurzbach's election and re-election as a Republican were something of an anomaly. He is the eponym honored in the Wurzbach Parkway in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]].</ref> The first Republican statewide primary was held in 1926, but drew only 15,239 voters. By contrast, the Democratic primary in the same year drew 821,234 voters, as disfranchisement was well established, and Texas was essentially a one-party, white-only voting state.
