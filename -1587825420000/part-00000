The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Lebanon have yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they did participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|2000]], when they hosted the event, and in [[2019 Asian Cup|2019]], the first time through regular qualification. Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but it was not ratified by FIFA. [[1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match|Lebanon's first FIFA-recognised game]], however, was played in 1940 against [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]]. During their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 qualification campaign]] for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC Fourth Round|fourth qualifying round]] for the first time thanks to a 2\u20131 victory against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at home in 2011 but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing at the bottom of their group. At the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 Asian Cup]], Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup#Ranking of third-placed teams|third-place ranking]] on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also competes in the [[WAFF Championship]], the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and the [[Football at the Pan Arab Games|Pan Arab Games]]. As hosts, they have finished third\u2014once at the Arab Nations Cup and twice at the Pan Arab Games.\n\nInspired by their [[Cedrus libani|national symbol]], the Lebanese team is known as \"the Cedars\" ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632}}) by fans and media. Their home kit is primarily red and their away kit white, a reference to their [[Flag of Lebanon|national flag]]. After a steady decline in their [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA ranking]] from 1998 to 2016, Lebanon jumped 66 places (from 147th in 2016 to 81st in 2018) and reached their highest rank to date\u201477th\u2014in September 2018.

football]] since their inception in 1933. The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Lebanon have yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they did participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|2000]], when they hosted the event, and in [[2019 Asian Cup|2019]], the first time through regular qualification. Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but it was not ratified by FIFA. [[1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match|Lebanon's first FIFA-recognised game]], however, was played in 1940 against [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]]. During their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 qualification campaign]] for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC Fourth Round|fourth qualifying round]] for the first time thanks to a 2\u20131 victory against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at home in 2011 but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing at the bottom of their group. At the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 Asian Cup]], Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup#Ranking of third-placed teams|third-place ranking]] on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also competes in the [[WAFF Championship]], the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and the [[Football at the Pan Arab Games|Pan Arab Games]]. As hosts, they have finished third\u2014once at the Arab Nations Cup and twice at the Pan Arab Games.\n\nInspired by their [[Cedrus libani|national symbol]], the Lebanese team is known as \"the Cedars\" ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632}}) by fans and media.

This was also the first book to feature the group of characters that featured in many of his future works: Bertram ('Berry') Pleydell, his wife and cousin Daphne Pleydell, Daphne's brother Boy Pleydell, another cousin Jonathan ('Jonah') Mansel, and Jonah's younger sister Jill Mansel.  The group of five - Berry, Daphne, Boy, Jonah and Jill - later came to be known collectively as 'Berry and Co'.{{sfn|Usborne|1974|pp=28-29}}\n\nThe short stories in the collection were originally published in ''[[The Windsor Magazine]]'',{{sfn|Smithers|1982|loc=Appendix I}} their publication in book form having been suggested to Mercer by the ''Windsor'''s editor Arthur Hutchinson.{{sfn|Smithers|1982|p=78}}\n\n== Plot ==\nFifteen short stories recounting the comic adventures of Boy, Daphne, Berry, Jonah and Jill, set in [[Hampshire]], [[Devon]], [[Cotswolds|The Cotswolds]], and [[Austria]]. They are narrated in the first person by Boy.\n\n== Background ==\n\nMercer was living in London and working as a barrister at the time these stories were written. He had sold short stories previously to [[Punch magazine|Punch]] (1910), [[The Harmsworth Red Magazine| the Harmsworth Red magazine]] (1910) and [[Pearson's Magazine]] (1910 and 1912) before developing a working relationship with the Windsor Magazine that continued (with breaks during the war years and between 1929 and 1935) until the magazine's final issue in 1939. The Berry family characters first appear in ''The Babes in the Wood'' in Pearson's in September 1910, in a story that has never appeared in book form. <ref> ''The Best of Berry'' (Dents Classic Thrillers 1989) introduction by [[Jack Adrian]] </ref>\n\n== Chapters == \n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chapter\n! scope=\"col\" | Book Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Windsor Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Volume\n! scope=\"col\" | Issue\n! scope=\"col\" | Pages\n! scope=\"col\" | Illustrator\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1\n| Punch And Judy\n| Punch And Judy\n| October 1911\n| XXXIV\n| 202\n| 541-551\n| H Radcliffe-Wilson\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2\n| Clothes And The Man\n| There Is A Tide\n| August 1913\n| XXXVIII\n| 224\n| 263-271\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3\n| When It Was Dark\n| A Drive In The Dark\n| November 1911\n| XXXIV\n| 203\n| 669-676\n| Fred Pegram\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4\n| Adam And New Year's Eve\n| Fair Exchange\n| January 1914\n| XXXIX\n| 229\n| 209-218\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5\n| The Judgement of Paris\n| The Judgement of Paris\n| June 1914\n| XL\n| 234\n| 79-86\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 6\n| Which To Adore\n| Which To Adore\n| March 1914\n| XXXIX\n| 231\n| 486-494\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7\n| Every Picture Tells A Story\n| Every Picture Tells A Story\n| July 1914\n| XL\n| 235\n| 201-208\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 8\n| The Busy Beers\n| Busy Bees\n| September 1911\n| XXXIV\n| 201\n| 391-398\n| A Wallis Mills\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 9\n| A Point Of Honour\n| A Point Of Honour\n| October 1913\n| XXXVIII\n| 226\n| 501-507\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 10\n| Pride Goeth Before\n| Pride Goeth Before\n| April 1914\n| XXXIX\n| 232\n| 672-678\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 11\n| The Love Scene\n| The Love Scene\n| September 1913\n| XXXVIII\n| 225\n| 383-391\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 12\n| The Order Of The Bath\n| The Order Of The Bath\n| May 1914\n| XXXIX\n| 233\n| 685-693\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 13\n| A Lucid Interval\n| A Lucid Interval\n| November 1913\n| XXXVIII\n| 227\n| 621-627\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 14\n| A Private View\n| A Private View\n| July 1913\n| XXXVIII\n| 223\n| 141-148\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 15\n| All Found\n| All Found\n| February 1914\n| XXXIX\n| 230\n| 371-378\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n|}\n\n== Illustrations ==\n\nThe first edition of the book, published in 1914, included plates of the illustrations by George Cecil Wilmhurst (1873-1930), originally included in the Windsor Magazine serialisations, for the stories included as chapters 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.

Morgan described his \"takeaway\" of one of his books as: {{cquote|Society is, always has been and always will be a structure for the exploitation and oppression of the majority through systems of political force dictated by an \u00e9lite, enforced by thugs, uniformed or not, and upheld by a wilful ignorance and stupidity on the part of the majority whom the system oppresses.<ref>Morgan discussing his \"take away\" of his novel ''[[Altered Carbon]]'', in  [http://www.saxonbullock.com/2014/04/never-mind-the-cyberpunks-an-interview-with-richard-morgan-2002/ \"Never Mind the Cyberpunks: An Interview with Richard Morgan\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426082539/http://www.saxonbullock.com/2014/04/never-mind-the-cyberpunks-an-interview-with-richard-morgan-2002/ |date=26 April 2016 }}, SaxonBullock.com.

After graduating he started [[teaching English as a foreign language|teaching English]] in order to travel the world. After 14 years and a post at the [[University of Strathclyde]], his first novel was published and he became a full-time writer. He lived in [[Glasgow]] until 2015, when he moved to [[Saxlingham Nethergate]] with his wife Virginia and their son Daniel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.edp24.co.uk/going-out/altered-carbon-author-richard-morgan-on-new-netflix-adaptation-1-5403512 |title=Meet the Norfolk author behind Netflix's biggest new series |date=18 February 2018 |work=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref>\n\n==Literary career==\nIn 2002, Morgan's first novel ''[[Altered Carbon]]'' was published, combining elements of \"[[cyberpunk]]\" and [[hardboiled]] [[detective fiction]] and featuring the [[antihero]] [[Takeshi Kovacs]]. The film rights for the book sold for a reported figure of $1,000,000 to [[film producer]] [[Joel Silver]], enabling Morgan to become a full-time writer. In 2003 the U.S. edition received the [[Philip K. Dick Award#2003|Philip K. Dick Award]].\n\nIn 2003, ''[[Broken Angels (novel)|Broken Angels]]'' was published, the sequel to ''Altered Carbon'', again featuring Takeshi Kovacs and blending science fiction and [[war novel|war fiction]] in a similar way to his cross-[[genre]] d\u00e9but.\n\n''[[Market Forces]]'', Morgan's first non-Kovacs novel, is set in the not-too-distant future. It was originally written as a short story, then as a screenplay (both unpublished). After the success of his first two works, it was released as a novel and optioned as a film.\n\nMorgan's third, and he has stated final,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1899.html |title=Interview with Richard Morgan |date=16 August 2005 |work=IT Conversations }}</ref> Kovacs novel ''[[Woken Furies]]'' was released in the UK in March 2005 and in the U.S. in September 2005.\n\nMorgan wrote two six issue miniseries for [[Marvel Comics]] under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint. His first story, ''[[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]: Homecoming'' published monthly in 2004 was followed by a second, ''Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her'' published monthly in 2005; both are available in collected editions. According to Morgan's official website the series was \"an artefact of limited appeal\" and is unlikely to be continued, although he has other comic projects in development.\n\n''[[Black Man]]'' was released in May 2007 in the UK and in June 2007 in the United States (as ''Thirteen'' or ''Th1rte3n''). According to the author, the book is about the constraints of physicality and the fact that people are locked into who they are. These are things he could not deal with in the Kovacs universe, because for Kovacs and people like him mortality is avoidable: they just skip into a new body.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Moira Gunn]] |title=Tech Nation |url=http://www.yourmomsbasement.com/archives/2005/08/interview_with_2.html |publisher=Your Mom's Basement |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804051247/http://www.yourmomsbasement.com/archives/2005/08/interview_with_2.html |archivedate=4 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The novel won the 2008 [[Arthur C.

They will silence trans people by ignoring evidence, dismiss them as vandals, and pretend to be neutral when really they're just transphobic. They have repeatedly misgendered the Roman Empress [[Elagabalus]], and refused to remove someone's deadname even when their victims explicitly asked them to. They devote their time in dismissing and erasing evidence of transphobia instead of looking into it, because in truth they hate trans people and are glad that trans people are being, raped, murdered, and having their rights stripped.

Morgan described his \"takeaway\" of one of his books as: {{cquote|Society is, always has been and always will be a structure for the exploitation and oppression of the majority through systems of political force dictated by an \u00e9lite, enforced by thugs, uniformed or not, and upheld by a wilful ignorance and stupidity on the part of the majority whom the system oppresses.<ref>Morgan discussing his \"take away\" of his novel ''[[Altered Carbon]]'', in  [http://www.saxonbullock.com/2014/04/never-mind-the-cyberpunks-an-interview-with-richard-morgan-2002/ \"Never Mind the Cyberpunks: An Interview with Richard Morgan\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426082539/http://www.saxonbullock.com/2014/04/never-mind-the-cyberpunks-an-interview-with-richard-morgan-2002/ |date=26 April 2016 }}, SaxonBullock.com.  Originally published online at SlateMagazine.co.uk, 2002.</ref>}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in [[London]], and brought up in the village of [[Hethersett]], near [[Norwich]], Morgan studied history at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]]. After graduating he started [[teaching English as a foreign language|teaching English]] in order to travel the world. After 14 years and a post at the [[University of Strathclyde]], his first novel was published and he became a full-time writer. He lived in [[Glasgow]] until 2015, when he moved to [[Saxlingham Nethergate]] with his wife Virginia and their son Daniel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.edp24.co.uk/going-out/altered-carbon-author-richard-morgan-on-new-netflix-adaptation-1-5403512 |title=Meet the Norfolk author behind Netflix's biggest new series |date=18 February 2018 |work=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref>\n\n==Literary career==\nIn 2002, Morgan's first novel ''[[Altered Carbon]]'' was published, combining elements of \"[[cyberpunk]]\" and [[hardboiled]] [[detective fiction]] and featuring the [[antihero]] [[Takeshi Kovacs]]. The film rights for the book sold for a reported figure of $1,000,000 to [[film producer]] [[Joel Silver]], enabling Morgan to become a full-time writer. In 2003 the U.S. edition received the [[Philip K. Dick Award#2003|Philip K. Dick Award]].\n\nIn 2003, ''[[Broken Angels (novel)|Broken Angels]]'' was published, the sequel to ''Altered Carbon'', again featuring Takeshi Kovacs and blending science fiction and [[war novel|war fiction]] in a similar way to his cross-[[genre]] d\u00e9but.\n\n''[[Market Forces]]'', Morgan's first non-Kovacs novel, is set in the not-too-distant future. It was originally written as a short story, then as a screenplay (both unpublished). After the success of his first two works, it was released as a novel and optioned as a film.\n\nMorgan's third, and he has stated final,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1899.html |title=Interview with Richard Morgan |date=16 August 2005 |work=IT Conversations }}</ref> Kovacs novel ''[[Woken Furies]]'' was released in the UK in March 2005 and in the U.S. in September 2005.\n\nMorgan wrote two six issue miniseries for [[Marvel Comics]] under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint. His first story, ''[[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]: Homecoming'' published monthly in 2004 was followed by a second, ''Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her'' published monthly in 2005; both are available in collected editions. According to Morgan's official website the series was \"an artefact of limited appeal\" and is unlikely to be continued, although he has other comic projects in development.\n\n''[[Black Man]]'' was released in May 2007 in the UK and in June 2007 in the United States (as ''Thirteen'' or ''Th1rte3n''). According to the author, the book is about the constraints of physicality and the fact that people are locked into who they are. These are things he could not deal with in the Kovacs universe, because for Kovacs and people like him mortality is avoidable: they just skip into a new body.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Moira Gunn]] |title=Tech Nation |url=http://www.yourmomsbasement.com/archives/2005/08/interview_with_2.html |publisher=Your Mom's Basement |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804051247/http://www.yourmomsbasement.com/archives/2005/08/interview_with_2.html |archivedate=4 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The novel won the 2008 [[Arthur C.

It takes different metaphorical guises, but at root it\u2019s always the same sense of something grand and worthwhile being abandoned by vicious and stupid men in favour of short-term profit and tribal hegemony. You see it in the regressive politics of the Protectorate in the Kovacs novels, the way both the Yhelteth Empire and the\u2009\u2014\u2009so-called\u2009\u2014\u2009Free Cities fail their duty as civilisations in ''A Land Fit for Heroes''. So also with ''Thin Air''\u2009\u2014\u2009the landscape is littered with the markers of a retreat from the grand scheme of terraforming and building a home for humanity on Mars, in favour of an ultraprofitable corporate stasis and an ongoing lie of highly emotive intangibles sold to the general populace in lieu of actual progress.<ref name=\"H\u00e9lice interview\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.revistahelice.com/revista_textos/n_25/Helice.%202019%20Oto%C3%B1o-Invierno%20MARTIAN%20POLITICS%20AND%20THE%20HARD-BOILED%20ANTI-HERO.pdf |title=Martian Politics and the Hard-Boiled Anti-Hero: Richard Morgan\u2019s ''Thin Air'' |author=Sara Mart\u00edn Alegre |year=2018 |journal=Revista H\u00e9lice |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=84\u201395 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065914/https://www.revistahelice.com/revista_textos/n_25/Helice.%202019%20Oto%C3%B1o-Invierno%20MARTIAN%20POLITICS%20AND%20THE%20HARD-BOILED%20ANTI-HERO.pdf |archivedate=4 February 2019 |access-date=3 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}\n\nA graphic novel titled ''Altered Carbon: Download Blues'', which continues to follow the character Takeshi Kovacs, was released in July 2019.\n\nAn animated feature entitled ''Altered Carbon: Resleeved'' was released in 2020 on Netflix.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Takeshi Kovacs novels===\n* ''[[Altered Carbon]]'' ([[2002 in literature|2002]]) {{ISBN|0-575-07390-X}}\n* ''[[Broken Angels (novel)|Broken Angels]]'' ([[2003 in literature|2003]]) {{ISBN|0-575-07550-3}}\n* ''[[Woken Furies]]'' ([[2005 in literature|2005]]) {{ISBN|0-575-07325-X}}\n* ''[[Altered Carbon: Download Blues]]'' ([[2019 in literature|2019]]) {{ISBN|978-1524109677}}\n\n===''A Land Fit For Heroes''===\n* ''[[The Steel Remains]]'' (2008) {{ISBN|0-575-07792-1}}\n* ''[[The Cold Commands]]'' (2011) {{ISBN|0-575-07793-X}}\n* ''[[The Dark Defiles]]'' (2014) {{ISBN|0575088605}}<ref name=\"defiles\" />\n\n=== Black Man novels ===\n* ''[[Black Man]]'' ([[2007 in literature|2007]]) {{ISBN|0-575-07513-9}} (known as ''Thirteen'' or ''Th1rte3n'' in the United States {{ISBN|0-345-48525-4}})\n* ''[[Thin Air (2018 novel)|Thin Air]]'' (2018) {{ISBN|9780575075146}}\n\n===Other novels===\n* ''[[Market Forces]]'' ([[2004 in literature|2004]]) {{ISBN|0-575-07584-8}}\n\n===Graphic novels===\n* ''[[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow: Homecoming]]'' ([[2005 in literature|2005]]) {{ISBN|0-7851-1493-9}}\n* ''[[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her]]'' ([[2006 in literature|2006]]) {{ISBN|0-7851-1768-7}}\n*''[[Altered Carbon: Download Blues]]'' ([[2019 in literature|2019]]) {{ISBN|978-1524109677}}\n\n===Video games===\n* ''[[Crysis 2]]'' ([[2011 in video gaming|2011]])\n* ''[[Syndicate (2012 video game)|Syndicate]]'' ([[2012 in video gaming|2012]])\n* ''A Land Fit For Heroes'' (2015)\n\n===Music===\n* \"Woken Furies\" from the album ''Dark All Day'' by [[Gunship (band)|Gunship]] (2018)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Richard Morgan}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{isfdb name|name=Richard Morgan}}\n\n===Interviews===\n* [http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue373/interview.html ''Science Fiction Weekly'' interview]\n* [http://www.jivemagazine.com/article.php?pid=3718 ''JIVE Magazine'' interview]\n* [http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/intrm.htm ''InfinityPlus'' interview]\n* [http://www.yourmomsbasement.com/archives/2005/08/richard_morgan_1.html Morgan Week interviews and reviews]\n* [http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/morgan_interview/ Interview ''Clarkesworld Magazine'' 2008-9]\n* [http://www.scifidimensions.com/main/2008/08/15/podcast-13-richard-k-morgan/ Interview on the SciFiDimensions Podcast]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-ach|aw}}\n{{s-bef |before=[[Carol Emshwiller]]<br/>for ''[[The Mount (novel)|The Mount]]'' }}\n{{s-ttl |title=[[Philip K.

At trial, the majority of the ''[[dikast]]s'' (male-citizen jurors chosen by lot) voted to convict him of the two charges; then, consistent with common legal practice, voted to determine his punishment, and agreed to a sentence of death to be executed by Socrates\u2019s drinking a poisonous beverage of [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]].\n\nPrimary-source accounts of the trial and execution of Socrates are the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' by [[Plato]] and the ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]''  by [[Xenophon of Athens]], who had been his student; contemporary interpretations include ''The Trial of Socrates'' (1988) by the journalist [[I. F. Stone]], and ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths'' (2009) by the Classics scholar [[Robin Waterfield]].<ref>Stone, I.F. (1988). The Trial of Socrates. New York: Little, Brown. Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths by Robin Waterfield, Norton, 2009</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{Socrates}}\nBefore the philosopher Socrates was tried for moral corruption and impiety, the citizens of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] knew him as an intellectual and moral gadfly of their society. In the comic play, ''[[The Clouds]]'' (423 BC), [[Aristophanes]] represents Socrates as a [[Sophism|sophistic]] philosopher who teaches the young man Pheidippides how to formulate arguments that justify striking and beating his father. Despite Socrates denying he had any relation with the Sophists, the playwright indicates that Athenians associated the philosophic teachings of Socrates with [[Sophism]]. As philosophers, the Sophists were men of ambiguous reputation, \"they were a set of charlatans that appeared in Greece in the fifth century BC, and earned ample livelihood by imposing on public credulity: professing to teach virtue, they really taught the art of fallacious discourse, and meanwhile propagated immoral practical doctrines.\"<ref>Kerferd, G.B.''The Sophistic Movement''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009.6.</ref>\n\nBesides ''The Clouds'', the comic play ''[[The Wasps]]'' (422 BC) also depicts inter-generational conflict, between an older man and a young man. Such representations of inter-generational social conflict among the men of Athens, especially in the decade from 425 to 415 BC, can reflect contrasting positions regarding opposition to or support for the Athenian invasion of Sicily.<ref> name=Waterfield>Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2009.</ref> Many Athenians blamed the teachings of the Sophists and of Socrates for instilling the younger generation with a morally nihilistic, disrespectful attitude towards their society.\n\nSocrates left no written works, but his student and friend, [[Plato]], wrote [[Socratic dialogue]]s, featuring Socrates as the protagonist. As a teacher, competitor intellectuals resented Socrates's ''elenctic examination'' method for intellectual inquiry, because its questions threatened their credibility as men of [[wisdom]] and [[virtue]].<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 21d\u2013e, 23a, 23e.</ref>\n\nOne will sometimes find the claim that Socrates described himself as the \"[[gadfly (social)|gadfly]]\" of Athens which, like a sluggish horse, needed to be aroused by his \"stinging\".<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 30e\u201331a.</ref>  In the Greek text of his defense given by Plato, Socrates never actually uses that term (viz., \"gadfly\" [Grk., ''[[:wiktionary:oestrus|o\u00eestros]]''])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oi)=stros&la=greek&can=oi)=stros0&prior=oi)/stros#lexicon|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> to describe himself.  Rather, his reference is merely allusive, as he (literally) says only that he has attached himself to the City (''proskeimenon t\u0113 polei'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=pro/skeimai |title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> in order to sting it.<ref>See the Greek text in H.N.

Putnam's Sons, 1919), p. 112</ref>  Nevertheless, he does make the bold claim that he is a god's gift to the Athenians.<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 31a-b</ref>\n\nSocrates' [[elenctic]] method was often imitated by the young men of Athens.<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 23c.</ref>\n\n===Association with Alcibiades and the Thirty Tyrants===\n[[Alcibiades]], an Athenian general who had been the main proponent of the disastrous [[Sicilian Expedition]] during the [[Peloponnesian Wars]], where virtually the entire Athenian invading force of more than 50,000 soldiers and non-combatants (e.g., the rowers of the [[Trireme]]s) was killed or captured and enslaved, was a student and close friend of Socrates, and his messmate during the siege of Potidaea (433\u2013429 BC). Socrates remained Alcibiades' close friend, admirer, and mentor for about five or six years.<ref name=Waterfield>Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2009.</ref> While a masterful orator, Alcibiades has been described by at least two 20th century psychologists as exhibiting the classic features of [[psychopathy]]<ref>Anna C. Salter, ''Predators: Pedophiles, And Other Sex Offenders'', Basic Books, 2005, p. 128.</ref><ref>Hervey M. Cleckley. The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues about the So-Called Psychopathic Personality. Martino Fine Books; 2 edition (2015) (original ed. 1941)</ref>. During his career, Alcibiades famously defected to Sparta, Athens' arch-enemy, after being summoned to trial, then to Persia after being caught in an affair with the wife of his benefactor (the King of Sparta). He then defected back to Athens after successfully persuading the Athenians that Persia would come to their aid against Sparta (though Persia had no intention of doing so). Finally driven out of Athens after the defeat of the [[Battle of Notium]] against Sparta, Alcibiades was assassinated in [[Phrygia]] in 404 BC by his Spartan enemies.\n\nAnother possible source of resentment was the political views that he and his associates were thought to have embraced. [[Critias]], who appears in two of Plato's Socratic dialogues, was a leader of the [[Thirty Tyrants]] (the ruthless [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] regime that ruled Athens, as puppets of Sparta and backed by Spartan troops, for eight months in 404\u2013403 BC until they were overthrown). Several of the Thirty had been students of Socrates, but there is also a record of their falling out.<ref>Xenophon. ''Memorabilia'', 1.2.29\u201338.</ref>\n\nAs with many of the issues surrounding Socrates' conviction, the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is far from straightforward. During the reign of the Thirty, many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that \"Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the [[Pythagoreans]] who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.\"<ref name=Waterfield/>{{Rp|183}} Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates\u2019 contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens, even without participating in the Thirty\u2019s bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty\u2019s cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of the expatriate Thirty.<ref name=Waterfield/> Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on one documented occasion. Plato\u2019s ''Apology'' has the character of Socrates describe that the Thirty ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon from Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him. While Socrates did not obey this order, he did nothing to warn Leon, who was subsequently apprehended by the other four men.<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 32c.</ref>\n\n=== Support for Oligarchic Rule and Contempt for Athenian Democracy ===\n\nAccording to the portraits left by some of Socrates' followers, Socrates himself seems to have openly espoused certain anti-democratic views, most prominent perhaps being the view that it is not majority opinion that yields correct policy but rather genuine knowledge and professional competence, which is [[Technocracy|possessed by only a few]].<ref>Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0208&layout=&loc=1.2.1 1.2.9]; Plato, ''Crito'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Crito+47c 47c\u2013d], ''Laches'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0176&layout=&loc=Lach.+184e 184e].</ref>  Plato also portrays him as being severely critical of some of the most prominent and well-respected leaders of the Athenian democracy;<ref>'' Gorgias'' 503c\u2013d, 515d\u2013517c.</ref> and even has him claim that the officials selected by the Athenian system of governance cannot credibly be regarded as benefactors, since it is not any group of ''many'' that benefits, but only \"someone or very few persons\".<ref>''Apology of Socrates'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Apol.+25a 25a-b].</ref>  Finally, Socrates was known as often praising the laws of the undemocratic regimes of [[Sparta]] and [[Crete]].<ref>Plato, ''Crito'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Crito+52e 52e].</ref> Plato himself reinforced anti-democratic ideas in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', advocating rule by elite, enlightened \"Philosopher-Kings\".\n\nThe totalitarian Thirty Tyrants had anointed themselves as the elite, and in the minds of his Athenian accusers, Socrates was guilty because he was suspected of introducing oligarchic ideas to them. [[Larry Gonick]], in his \"[[Cartoon History of the Universe]]\"<ref> Gonick, Larry. \"Cartoon History of the Universe Vol 1-7\". Volume 7 \u2013 All about Athens. Doubleday Books, 1990. {{ISBN|0385-26520-4}}.</ref> writes, \"''The trial of Socrates has always seemed mysterious...the charges sound vague and unreal...because behind the stated charges was Socrates's real crime: preaching a philosophy that produced Alcibiades and Critias... but of course he couldn't be prosecuted for that under the amnesty'' (which had been declared after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants)... ''so his accusers made it \"not believing the Gods of the city, introducing new gods, and corrupting the youth.''\"\n\nApart from his views on politics, Socrates held unusual views on religion. He made several references to his spirit, or ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimonion]]'', although he explicitly claimed that it never urged him on, but only warned him against various prospective actions.<ref>''Socrates Legacy''[https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/socrates]</ref>\n\n==Historical descriptions of the trial==\n{{Wikisource|Euthyphro}}\n{{Wikisource|Apology (Plato)}}\n{{Wikisource|Crito}}\n{{Wikisource|Phaedo}}\n\nThe extant, primary sources about the history of the trial and execution of Socrates are: the ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]'', by Xenophon of Athens, a historian; and the [[tetralogy]] of Socratic dialogues \u2014 ''[[Euthyphro]]'', the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Socratic Apology]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', by Plato, a philosopher who had been a student of [[Socrates]].\n\nIn ''The Indictment of Socrates'' (392 BC), the [[Sophism|sophist]] rhetorician [[Polycrates (sophist)|Polycrates]] (440\u2013370) presents the prosecution speech, by [[Anytus]], which condemned Socrates for his political and religious activities in [[Classical Athens|Athens]] before the year 403 BC. In presenting such a prosecution, which addressed matters external to the charges of moral corruption and impiety, for which the Athenian ''[[polis]]'' was trying Socrates, Anytus violated the political [[amnesty]] granted in the agreement of reconciliation (403\u2013402 BC)<ref>Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York, 2009. p. 196.</ref> that granted amnesty to a man for political and religious actions taken before or during the rule of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], \"under which all further charges and official recriminations concerning the [reign of] terror were forbidden\".<ref>Martin, Thomas R. ''Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times''. Yale University, 2009. p. 162.</ref>\n\nMoreover, the legal and religious particulars against Socrates that Polycrates reported in ''The Indictment of Socrates'' are addressed in the replies by Xenophon and the sophist [[Libanius|Libanius of Antioch]] (314\u2013390).\n\n==Trial==\n[[File: He drank the contents as though it were a draught of Wine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Death of Socrates (399 BC): He drank the contents as though it were a draught of wine.]]\n\nFormal accusation was the second element of the trial of Socrates, which the accuser, [[Meletus]], swore to be true, before the [[archon]] (a state officer with mostly religious duties) who considered the evidence and determined that there was an actionable case of \"moral corruption of Athenian youth\" and \"[[impiety]]\", for which the philosopher must legally answer; the archon summoned Socrates for a trial by jury.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filonik|first=Jakub|date=2013|title=Athenian Impiety Trials: A Reappraisal|journal=Dike|issue=16|doi=10.13130/1128-8221/4290|pmid=}}</ref>\n\nAthenian juries were drawn by lottery, from a group of hundreds of male-citizen volunteers; such a great jury usually ensured a majority verdict in a trial. Although neither [[Plato]] nor [[Xenophon of Athens]] identifies the number of jurors, a jury of 500 men likely was the legal norm. In the  ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' (36a\u2013b), about Socrates\u2019s defense at trial, Plato said that if just 30 of the votes had been otherwise, then Socrates would have been acquitted (36a), and that (perhaps) less than three-fifths of the jury voted against him (36b).<ref>The second point is tenable if Socrates\u2019s claim (36a\u2013b) entails that Meletus, Lycon, and Anytus each was responsible for one-third of the votes against Socrates, who implies that Meletus failed to persuade less than one-fifth of the judges. The jury of 500 or 501 men, based either on [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] (2.41) or on the Aristotelian ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Athenaion Politeia]]'' (68). See P. Rhodes, 1981, ''Commentary on the Aristotelian \"Athenaion Politeia\"'', p. 729.</ref>\n\nHaving been found guilty of corruption and impiety, Socrates and the prosecutor suggested sentences for the punishment of his crimes against the city-state of Athens. Expressing surprise at the few votes required for an acquittal, Socrates joked that he be punished with free meals at the [[Prytaneum]] (the city\u2019s sacred hearth), an honour usually held for a [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]] of Athens, and for the victorious athletes of an Olympiad. After that failed suggestion, Socrates then offered to pay a fine of 100 drachmae\u2014one-fifth of his property\u2014which largesse testified to his integrity and poverty as a philosopher. Finally, a fine of 3,000 drachmae was agreed, proposed by Plato, [[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], Critobulus, and Apollodorus, who guaranteed payment\u2014nonetheless, the prosecutor of the trial of Socrates proposed the death penalty for the impious philosopher. (Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, 2.42).\n\nIn the event, friends, followers, and students encouraged Socrates to flee Athens, action which the citizens expected; yet, on principle, Socrates refused to flout the law and escape his legal responsibility to Athens. (''[[Crito]]'') Therefore, faithful to his teaching of civic obedience to the law, the 70-year-old Socrates executed his death-sentence and drank the hemlock, as condemned at trial. (See: ''[[Phaedo]]'')\n\n==Interpretations of the trial of Socrates==\n===Ancient===\nIn the time of the trial of Socrates, the year 399 BC, the city-state of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] recently had perdured the trials and tribulations of Spartan [[hegemony]] and the thirteen-month r\u00e9gime of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], imposed consequent to the Athenian defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404 BC). At the request of the pro\u2013Sparta [[Lysander]], a Spartan admiral, the Thirty men, led by [[Critias]] and [[Theramenes]], were installed to govern Athens, and to revise the city\u2019s democratic laws, which were inscribed to a wall of the [[Stoa Basileios]]. Their political actions meant to facilitate the subordination of Athenian government\u2014from [[democracy]] to [[oligarchy]]\u2014in service to [[Sparta]].<ref>Xenophon, [[Hellenica (Xenophon)|''Hellenica'']], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Hell.+2.3.15&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206 2.3.15\u201316]</ref>\n\nMoreover, the Thirty Tyrants also appointed a council of 500 men to perform the judicial functions that once had belonged to every Athenian citizen.<ref name=AC35.1>[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/athenian_const.html Aristotle, ''Athenian Constitution'', 35.1 (350 BC).]</ref><ref>Krentz, Peter.

Stone. ''The Trial of Socrates'', 1988.</ref>\n\nIn ''The Trial of Socrates'' (1988), [[I. F. Stone]] said that Socrates wanted to be sentenced to death, to justify his philosophic opposition to the Athenian democracy of that time, and because, as a man, he saw that old age would be an unpleasant time for him.\n\nIn the play ''[[Socrates on Trial (play)|Socrates on Trial]]'' (2007), Andrew Irvine said that for loyalty to Athenian democracy, Socrates willingly accepted the guilty-verdict voted by the jurors of his trial. \"During a time of war, and great social and intellectual upheaval, Socrates felt compelled to express his views, openly, regardless of the consequences. As a result, he is remembered today, not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards, but also for his loyalty to the view that, in a democracy, the best way for a man to serve himself, his friends, and his city\u2014even during times of war\u2014is by being loyal to, and by speaking publicly about, the truth.\"<ref>Irvine, Andrew D.  Introduction, ''Socrates on Trial'', Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIn ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths'' (2009), [[Robin Waterfield]] said that the death of Socrates was an act of volition motivated by a greater purpose; Socrates \"saw himself as healing the City\u2019s ills by his voluntary death\".<ref name=Waterfield/>{{Rp|204}} Waterfield said that Socrates, with his unconventional methods of [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] enquiry, attempted to resolve the political confusion then occurring in the city-state of Athens, by willingly being the scapegoat, whose death would quiet old disputes, which then would allow progress towards political harmony and social peace for the Athenian polis.<ref name=Waterfield/>\n\nIn ''The New Trial of Socrates'' (2012), an international panel of ten judges held a [[Mock trial|mock re-trial]] of Socrates to resolve the matter of the charges leveled against him by [[Meletus]], [[Anytus]], and [[Apology (Plato)|Lycon]], that: \"Socrates is a doer of evil and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the state, and he believes in other new divinities of his own\"; by split decision, five judges voted \"guilty\" and five judges voted \"not guilty\", which acquitted Socrates of corruption of the young and of impiety against the Athenian pantheon. Limiting themselves to the facts of the case against Socrates, the judges did not consider any sentence; the judges who voted the philosopher guilty said that they would not have considered the death penalty for Socrates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Socrates acquitted in ancient trial re-run |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZNTTgYc0VcusOWcootqMJvuhAqw |publisher=Google/AFP |date=25 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130161519/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZNTTgYc0VcusOWcootqMJvuhAqw |archivedate=January 30, 2014 }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120614034706/http://www.sgt.gr/en/programme/event/688 The New Trial of Socrates.] Onassis Cultural Centre</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Meno]]\n* [[Phaedo]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=Socrates and Legal Obligation|last=Allen|first=Reginald E.|year=1980|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis}}\n* {{cite book|title=Socrates on Trial|last=Brickhouse|first=Thomas C.|year=1989|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}\n* {{cite book |title= The Trial and Execution of Socrates: Sources and Controversies |last= Brickhouse |first= Thomas C. |last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas D.|year= 2002 |publisher= Oxford University |location= New York }}\n* {{cite book|title=Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Plato and the Trial of Socrates|last=Brickhouse|first=Thomas C.|last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas D.|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}\n* {{cite book|title=Plato's Affair with Tragedy|last=Cameron|first=Alister|year=1978|publisher=University of Cincinnati|location=Cincinnati}}\n* {{cite book |title= Socrates Against Athens |last= Colaiaco |first= James A. |year= 2001 |publisher= Routledge |location= New York}}\n* {{cite book|title=Reexamining Socrates in the Apology|last=Fagan|first=Patricia|last2=Russon|first2=John|year=2009|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston}}\n* Filonik, Jakub (2013). {{doi|10.13130/1128-8221/4290}} \"Athenian impiety trials: a reappraisal\".

At trial, the majority of the ''[[dikast]]s'' (male-citizen jurors chosen by lot) voted to convict him of the two charges; then, consistent with common legal practice, voted to determine his punishment, and agreed to a sentence of death to be executed by Socrates\u2019s drinking a poisonous beverage of [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]].\n\nPrimary-source accounts of the trial and execution of Socrates are the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' by [[Plato]] and the ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]''  by [[Xenophon of Athens]], who had been his student; contemporary interpretations include ''The Trial of Socrates'' (1988) by the journalist [[I. F. Stone]], and ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths'' (2009) by the Classics scholar [[Robin Waterfield]].<ref>Stone, I.F. (1988). The Trial of Socrates. New York: Little, Brown. Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths by Robin Waterfield, Norton, 2009</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{Socrates}}\nBefore the philosopher Socrates was tried for moral corruption and impiety, the citizens of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] knew him as an intellectual and moral gadfly of their society. In the comic play, ''[[The Clouds]]'' (423 BC), [[Aristophanes]] represents Socrates as a [[Sophism|sophistic]] philosopher who teaches the young man Pheidippides how to formulate arguments that justify striking and beating his father. Despite Socrates denying he had any relation with the Sophists, the playwright indicates that Athenians associated the philosophic teachings of Socrates with [[Sophism]]. As philosophers, the Sophists were men of ambiguous reputation, \"they were a set of charlatans that appeared in Greece in the fifth century BC, and earned ample livelihood by imposing on public credulity: professing to teach virtue, they really taught the art of fallacious discourse, and meanwhile propagated immoral practical doctrines.\"<ref>Kerferd, G.B.''The Sophistic Movement''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009.6.</ref>\n\nBesides ''The Clouds'', the comic play ''[[The Wasps]]'' (422 BC) also depicts inter-generational conflict, between an older man and a young man. Such representations of inter-generational social conflict among the men of Athens, especially in the decade from 425 to 415 BC, can reflect contrasting positions regarding opposition to or support for the Athenian invasion of Sicily.<ref> name=Waterfield>Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2009.</ref> Many Athenians blamed the teachings of the Sophists and of Socrates for instilling the younger generation with a morally nihilistic, disrespectful attitude towards their society.\n\nSocrates left no written works, but his student and friend, [[Plato]], wrote [[Socratic dialogue]]s, featuring Socrates as the protagonist. As a teacher, competitor intellectuals resented Socrates's ''elenctic examination'' method for intellectual inquiry, because its questions threatened their credibility as men of [[wisdom]] and [[virtue]].<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 21d\u2013e, 23a, 23e.</ref>\n\nOne will sometimes find the claim that Socrates described himself as the \"[[gadfly (social)|gadfly]]\" of Athens which, like a sluggish horse, needed to be aroused by his \"stinging\".<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 30e\u201331a.</ref>  In the Greek text of his defense given by Plato, Socrates never actually uses that term (viz., \"gadfly\" [Grk., ''[[:wiktionary:oestrus|o\u00eestros]]''])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oi)=stros&la=greek&can=oi)=stros0&prior=oi)/stros#lexicon|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> to describe himself.

''Apology'', 23c.</ref>\n\n===Association with Alcibiades and the Thirty Tyrants===\n[[Alcibiades]], an Athenian general who had been the main proponent of the disastrous [[Sicilian Expedition]] during the [[Peloponnesian Wars]], where virtually the entire Athenian invading force of more than 50,000 soldiers and non-combatants (e.g., the rowers of the [[Trireme]]s) was killed or captured and enslaved, was a student and close friend of Socrates, and his messmate during the siege of Potidaea (433\u2013429 BC). Socrates remained Alcibiades' close friend, admirer, and mentor for about five or six years.<ref name=Waterfield>Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2009.</ref> While a masterful orator, Alcibiades has been described by at least two 20th century psychologists as exhibiting the classic features of [[psychopathy]]<ref>Anna C. Salter, ''Predators: Pedophiles, And Other Sex Offenders'', Basic Books, 2005, p. 128.</ref><ref>Hervey M. Cleckley. The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues about the So-Called Psychopathic Personality. Martino Fine Books; 2 edition (2015) (original ed. 1941)</ref>. During his career, Alcibiades famously defected to Sparta, Athens' arch-enemy, after being summoned to trial, then to Persia after being caught in an affair with the wife of his benefactor (the King of Sparta). He then defected back to Athens after successfully persuading the Athenians that Persia would come to their aid against Sparta (though Persia had no intention of doing so). Finally driven out of Athens after the defeat of the [[Battle of Notium]] against Sparta, Alcibiades was assassinated in [[Phrygia]] in 404 BC by his Spartan enemies.\n\nAnother possible source of resentment was the political views that he and his associates were thought to have embraced. [[Critias]], who appears in two of Plato's Socratic dialogues, was a leader of the [[Thirty Tyrants]] (the ruthless [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] regime that ruled Athens, as puppets of Sparta and backed by Spartan troops, for eight months in 404\u2013403 BC until they were overthrown). Several of the Thirty had been students of Socrates, but there is also a record of their falling out.<ref>Xenophon. ''Memorabilia'', 1.2.29\u201338.</ref>\n\nAs with many of the issues surrounding Socrates' conviction, the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is far from straightforward. During the reign of the Thirty, many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that \"Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the [[Pythagoreans]] who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.\"<ref name=Waterfield/>{{Rp|183}} Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates\u2019 contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens, even without participating in the Thirty\u2019s bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty\u2019s cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of the expatriate Thirty.<ref name=Waterfield/> Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on one documented occasion. Plato\u2019s ''Apology'' has the character of Socrates describe that the Thirty ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon from Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him. While Socrates did not obey this order, he did nothing to warn Leon, who was subsequently apprehended by the other four men.<ref>Plato. ''Apology'', 32c.</ref>\n\n=== Support for Oligarchic Rule and Contempt for Athenian Democracy ===\n\nAccording to the portraits left by some of Socrates' followers, Socrates himself seems to have openly espoused certain anti-democratic views, most prominent perhaps being the view that it is not majority opinion that yields correct policy but rather genuine knowledge and professional competence, which is [[Technocracy|possessed by only a few]].<ref>Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0208&layout=&loc=1.2.1 1.2.9]; Plato, ''Crito'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Crito+47c 47c\u2013d], ''Laches'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0176&layout=&loc=Lach.+184e 184e].</ref>  Plato also portrays him as being severely critical of some of the most prominent and well-respected leaders of the Athenian democracy;<ref>'' Gorgias'' 503c\u2013d, 515d\u2013517c.</ref> and even has him claim that the officials selected by the Athenian system of governance cannot credibly be regarded as benefactors, since it is not any group of ''many'' that benefits, but only \"someone or very few persons\".<ref>''Apology of Socrates'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Apol.+25a 25a-b].</ref>  Finally, Socrates was known as often praising the laws of the undemocratic regimes of [[Sparta]] and [[Crete]].<ref>Plato, ''Crito'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&layout=&loc=Crito+52e 52e].</ref> Plato himself reinforced anti-democratic ideas in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', advocating rule by elite, enlightened \"Philosopher-Kings\".\n\nThe totalitarian Thirty Tyrants had anointed themselves as the elite, and in the minds of his Athenian accusers, Socrates was guilty because he was suspected of introducing oligarchic ideas to them. [[Larry Gonick]], in his \"[[Cartoon History of the Universe]]\"<ref> Gonick, Larry. \"Cartoon History of the Universe Vol 1-7\". Volume 7 \u2013 All about Athens. Doubleday Books, 1990. {{ISBN|0385-26520-4}}.</ref> writes, \"''The trial of Socrates has always seemed mysterious...the charges sound vague and unreal...because behind the stated charges was Socrates's real crime: preaching a philosophy that produced Alcibiades and Critias... but of course he couldn't be prosecuted for that under the amnesty'' (which had been declared after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants)... ''so his accusers made it \"not believing the Gods of the city, introducing new gods, and corrupting the youth.''\"\n\nApart from his views on politics, Socrates held unusual views on religion. He made several references to his spirit, or ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimonion]]'', although he explicitly claimed that it never urged him on, but only warned him against various prospective actions.<ref>''Socrates Legacy''[https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/socrates]</ref>\n\n==Historical descriptions of the trial==\n{{Wikisource|Euthyphro}}\n{{Wikisource|Apology (Plato)}}\n{{Wikisource|Crito}}\n{{Wikisource|Phaedo}}\n\nThe extant, primary sources about the history of the trial and execution of Socrates are: the ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]'', by Xenophon of Athens, a historian; and the [[tetralogy]] of Socratic dialogues \u2014 ''[[Euthyphro]]'', the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Socratic Apology]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', by Plato, a philosopher who had been a student of [[Socrates]].\n\nIn ''The Indictment of Socrates'' (392 BC), the [[Sophism|sophist]] rhetorician [[Polycrates (sophist)|Polycrates]] (440\u2013370) presents the prosecution speech, by [[Anytus]], which condemned Socrates for his political and religious activities in [[Classical Athens|Athens]] before the year 403 BC. In presenting such a prosecution, which addressed matters external to the charges of moral corruption and impiety, for which the Athenian ''[[polis]]'' was trying Socrates, Anytus violated the political [[amnesty]] granted in the agreement of reconciliation (403\u2013402 BC)<ref>Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York, 2009. p. 196.</ref> that granted amnesty to a man for political and religious actions taken before or during the rule of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], \"under which all further charges and official recriminations concerning the [reign of] terror were forbidden\".<ref>Martin, Thomas R. ''Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times''. Yale University, 2009. p. 162.</ref>\n\nMoreover, the legal and religious particulars against Socrates that Polycrates reported in ''The Indictment of Socrates'' are addressed in the replies by Xenophon and the sophist [[Libanius|Libanius of Antioch]] (314\u2013390).\n\n==Trial==\n[[File: He drank the contents as though it were a draught of Wine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Death of Socrates (399 BC): He drank the contents as though it were a draught of wine.]]\n\nFormal accusation was the second element of the trial of Socrates, which the accuser, [[Meletus]], swore to be true, before the [[archon]] (a state officer with mostly religious duties) who considered the evidence and determined that there was an actionable case of \"moral corruption of Athenian youth\" and \"[[impiety]]\", for which the philosopher must legally answer; the archon summoned Socrates for a trial by jury.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filonik|first=Jakub|date=2013|title=Athenian Impiety Trials: A Reappraisal|journal=Dike|issue=16|doi=10.13130/1128-8221/4290|pmid=}}</ref>\n\nAthenian juries were drawn by lottery, from a group of hundreds of male-citizen volunteers; such a great jury usually ensured a majority verdict in a trial. Although neither [[Plato]] nor [[Xenophon of Athens]] identifies the number of jurors, a jury of 500 men likely was the legal norm. In the  ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' (36a\u2013b), about Socrates\u2019s defense at trial, Plato said that if just 30 of the votes had been otherwise, then Socrates would have been acquitted (36a), and that (perhaps) less than three-fifths of the jury voted against him (36b).<ref>The second point is tenable if Socrates\u2019s claim (36a\u2013b) entails that Meletus, Lycon, and Anytus each was responsible for one-third of the votes against Socrates, who implies that Meletus failed to persuade less than one-fifth of the judges. The jury of 500 or 501 men, based either on [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] (2.41) or on the Aristotelian ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Athenaion Politeia]]'' (68). See P. Rhodes, 1981, ''Commentary on the Aristotelian \"Athenaion Politeia\"'', p. 729.</ref>\n\nHaving been found guilty of corruption and impiety, Socrates and the prosecutor suggested sentences for the punishment of his crimes against the city-state of Athens. Expressing surprise at the few votes required for an acquittal, Socrates joked that he be punished with free meals at the [[Prytaneum]] (the city\u2019s sacred hearth), an honour usually held for a [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]] of Athens, and for the victorious athletes of an Olympiad. After that failed suggestion, Socrates then offered to pay a fine of 100 drachmae\u2014one-fifth of his property\u2014which largesse testified to his integrity and poverty as a philosopher. Finally, a fine of 3,000 drachmae was agreed, proposed by Plato, [[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], Critobulus, and Apollodorus, who guaranteed payment\u2014nonetheless, the prosecutor of the trial of Socrates proposed the death penalty for the impious philosopher. (Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, 2.42).\n\nIn the event, friends, followers, and students encouraged Socrates to flee Athens, action which the citizens expected; yet, on principle, Socrates refused to flout the law and escape his legal responsibility to Athens. (''[[Crito]]'') Therefore, faithful to his teaching of civic obedience to the law, the 70-year-old Socrates executed his death-sentence and drank the hemlock, as condemned at trial. (See: ''[[Phaedo]]'')\n\n==Interpretations of the trial of Socrates==\n===Ancient===\nIn the time of the trial of Socrates, the year 399 BC, the city-state of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] recently had perdured the trials and tribulations of Spartan [[hegemony]] and the thirteen-month r\u00e9gime of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], imposed consequent to the Athenian defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404 BC). At the request of the pro\u2013Sparta [[Lysander]], a Spartan admiral, the Thirty men, led by [[Critias]] and [[Theramenes]], were installed to govern Athens, and to revise the city\u2019s democratic laws, which were inscribed to a wall of the [[Stoa Basileios]]; their political actions meant to facilitate the subordination of Athenian government\u2014from [[democracy]] to [[oligarchy]]\u2014in service to [[Sparta]].<ref>Xenophon, [[Hellenica (Xenophon)|''Hellenica'']], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Hell.+2.3.15&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206 2.3.15\u201316]</ref>\n\nMoreover, the Thirty Tyrants also appointed a council of 500 men to perform the judicial functions that once had belonged to every Athenian citizen.<ref name=AC35.1>[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/athenian_const.html Aristotle, ''Athenian Constitution'', 35.1 (350 BC).]</ref><ref>Krentz, Peter.

Stone. ''The Trial of Socrates'', 1988.</ref>\n\nIn ''The Trial of Socrates'' (1988), [[I. F. Stone]] said that Socrates wanted to be sentenced to death, to justify his philosophic opposition to the Athenian democracy of that time, and because, as a man, he saw that old age would be an unpleasant time for him.\n\nIn the play ''[[Socrates on Trial (play)|Socrates on Trial]]'' (2007), Andrew Irvine said that for loyalty to Athenian democracy, Socrates willingly accepted the guilty-verdict voted by the jurors of his trial. \"During a time of war, and great social and intellectual upheaval, Socrates felt compelled to express his views, openly, regardless of the consequences. As a result, he is remembered today, not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards, but also for his loyalty to the view that, in a democracy, the best way for a man to serve himself, his friends, and his city\u2014even during times of war\u2014is by being loyal to, and by speaking publicly about, the truth.\"<ref>Irvine, Andrew D.  Introduction, ''Socrates on Trial'', Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIn ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths'' (2009), [[Robin Waterfield]] said that the death of Socrates was an act of volition motivated by a greater purpose; Socrates \"saw himself as healing the City\u2019s ills by his voluntary death\".<ref name=Waterfield/>{{Rp|204}} Waterfield said that Socrates, with his unconventional methods of [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] enquiry, attempted to resolve the political confusion then occurring in the city-state of Athens, by willingly being the scapegoat, whose death would quiet old disputes, which then would allow progress towards political harmony and social peace for the Athenian polis.<ref name=Waterfield/>\n\nIn ''The New Trial of Socrates'' (2012), an international panel of ten judges held a [[Mock trial|mock re-trial]] of Socrates to resolve the matter of the charges leveled against him by [[Meletus]], [[Anytus]], and [[Apology (Plato)|Lycon]], that: \"Socrates is a doer of evil and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the state, and he believes in other new divinities of his own\"; by split decision, five judges voted \"guilty\" and five judges voted \"not guilty\", which acquitted Socrates of corruption of the young and of impiety against the Athenian pantheon. Limiting themselves to the facts of the case against Socrates, the judges did not consider any sentence; the judges who voted the philosopher guilty said that they would not have considered the death penalty for Socrates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Socrates acquitted in ancient trial re-run |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZNTTgYc0VcusOWcootqMJvuhAqw |publisher=Google/AFP |date=25 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130161519/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZNTTgYc0VcusOWcootqMJvuhAqw |archivedate=January 30, 2014 }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120614034706/http://www.sgt.gr/en/programme/event/688 The New Trial of Socrates.] Onassis Cultural Centre</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Meno]]\n* [[Phaedo]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=Socrates and Legal Obligation|last=Allen|first=Reginald E.|year=1980|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis}}\n* {{cite book|title=Socrates on Trial|last=Brickhouse|first=Thomas C.|year=1989|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}\n* {{cite book |title= The Trial and Execution of Socrates: Sources and Controversies |last= Brickhouse |first= Thomas C. |last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas D.|year= 2002 |publisher= Oxford University |location= New York }}\n* {{cite book|title=Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Plato and the Trial of Socrates|last=Brickhouse|first=Thomas C.|last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas D.|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}\n* {{cite book|title=Plato's Affair with Tragedy|last=Cameron|first=Alister|year=1978|publisher=University of Cincinnati|location=Cincinnati}}\n* {{cite book |title= Socrates Against Athens |last= Colaiaco |first= James A. |year= 2001 |publisher= Routledge |location= New York}}\n* {{cite book|title=Reexamining Socrates in the Apology|last=Fagan|first=Patricia|last2=Russon|first2=John|year=2009|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston}}\n* Filonik, Jakub (2013). {{doi|10.13130/1128-8221/4290}} \"Athenian impiety trials: a reappraisal\".
