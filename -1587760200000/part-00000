The Games combine summer and winter Olympic events.\n\nThe event is covered mostly by Barbara Warblers, a stork, and \"anchorturtle\" Henry Hummel. The [[100-meter dash]] is covered in the style of a [[drag racing|drag race]] by Jackie Fuelit.\n\nUnlike the real Olympics, continents are represented rather than countries. The continents featured are North America, South America, [[Eurasia]], Europe, Africa, Australia, and Asia. Eurasia represents the [[USSR]], whereas Europe represents Western and Central Europe.\n\nThe only mention of areas other than continents are the New York City Rats soccer team, Dean Wilson being from California, a Central American marathon runner named Pep\u00e9 Repanosa, an [[Acapulco]] cliff diver named \"Primo Cabeza\", marathon runner Terry Hornsby being from [[Boulder, Colorado]], Ren\u00e9 Fromage being from France, and Kurt W\u00fcfner appearing at the [[Alpine skiing|downhill]] event right before a [[Scandinavia]]n is given a gold medal.\n\nAlthough many of the segments stand alone, there are some recurring events and important characters. The largest such story is the coverage of the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]], where competitors Ren\u00e9 Fromage and Kit Mambo are the favorites to win. Both are determined to win \u2013 Fromage having devoted his entire life to the marathon, Mambo determined to make a name for herself \u2013 they find themselves surprised when their minds wander to thoughts of mutual admiration and then to love, culminating in the pair holding hands for the rest of the race and crossing the finish line together.  Another important story is that of Kurt W\u00fcffner, a West German [[dachshund]] [[skiing|skier]], and his disappearance to [[Shangri-la|Dogra-la]] during a mountain climbing expedition shortly after the [[slalom skiing|slalom]] event.\n\nA minor story features an [[American alligator|alligator]] named Bolt Jenkins. He was \"born as a handbag\" and told he would never walk again. A song during his story reveals that he lives in the [[Sanitary sewer|sewers]]. After seeing a frog named Boris Amphibiensky break the world record for the [[high jump]], Jenkins has an epiphany, and becomes determined to break the record. Jenkins goes on to set world records in the high jump, the [[pole vault]], and later the [[100-meter dash]]. Jenkins sacrifices his gold medal in the hundred meter dash to an African competitor and favorite whom Jenkins considers to be his superior.\n\nSome events are only referenced rather than being covered. In the song \"We've Made It to the Top\", various events are shown that are otherwise not covered:\n*[[Hammer Throw]]\n*[[Shot put]]\n*[[Javelin throw|Javelin]]\n*[[Cycling]]\n*[[Relay Racing]]\n*[[Discus]]\n*[[Field hockey]]\n\nAlso referenced but not covered:\n*[[Boxing]]- only a highlight reel is provided after the match, despite being previewed as \"coming up after the basketball game\"\n*[[Speed Skating]]- previewed, but not actually shown\n*[[Water Polo]]- mentioned as happening earlier in the week\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gilda Radner]] as Barbra Warblers / Brenda Springer / Cora Lee Perrier / Tatyana Tushenko / Dorrie Turnell / The Contessa\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Rugs Turkell / Joey Gongolong / Art Antica\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Keen Hacksaw / Mayor of Animalympic Island / Burnt Woody / Mark Spritz\n* Michael Fremer as Henry Hummel / Ren\u00e9 Fromage / Kit Mambo / Bolt Jenkins / Kurt Wuffner / Dean Wilson / Mele / Count Maurice Boar-Deaux / Jackie Fuelit / Bear McLane / Guy Lafluke / Bjorn Freeborg / Mamo Ululu\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/Animalympics/|title=Animalympics|work=Behind the Voice Actors|date=September 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Animalympics'' was commissioned by [[NBC]] in 1978, as the network intended [[Lisberger Studios]] to create it as two hour-long specials to be paired alongside coverage of both the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] and the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] then held in [[Moscow]].

Thomas said that he was one of 29 children and belonged to a set of triplets, which seems an impossibility and for which there is no other evidence. A modern Dempster, James, reasons, on a website established by him at [http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~jdempster/Thomas.html#TOP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212075228/http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~jdempster/Thomas.html |date=12 February 2012 }}, that 9 is a plausible figure. As it has been established by other documentation that Thomas was the third son, fourth child, and that his parents were married in 1568, allowing an interval of 18 months James arrives at 1574 or 1575, which makes Thomas considerably less precocious. However, this article, following the sources on which it is based, presumes a birth at 1579.</ref> \u2013 6 September 1625) was a Scottish scholar and historian. Born into the aristocracy in [[Aberdeenshire]], which comprises regions of both the [[Scottish highlands]] and the [[Scottish lowlands]], he was sent abroad as a youth for his education. The Dempsters were Catholic in an increasingly Protestant country and had a reputation for being quarrelsome. Thomas' brother James, outlawed for an attack on his father, spent some years as a pirate in the northern islands, escaped by volunteering for military service in the [[Low Countries]] and was drawn and quartered there for insubordination. Thomas' father lost the family fortune in clan feuding and was beheaded for forgery.\n\nFor these and political and religious reasons in these often violent [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan times]] Thomas was unable to come home except for visits. Of uncommon and impressive height and intellectual ability he became an itinerant professor in France and Italy, driven from place to place by a series of colourful personal incidents in which he fought duels or opposed officers of the law. He eventually found refuge and patronage under Grand Duke [[Cosimo II]] of [[Tuscany]], who commissioned a work on the Etruscans. Three years later Thomas handed the duke a ''magnum opus'', the manuscript of ''De Etruria Regali Libri Septem'', \"Seven Books about Royal Etruria\",<ref>\"Royal Hetruria\" was Dempster's own English name for the book, used in a letter recounting its loss to him. Rowland, pages 98\u201399. Dempster's Hetruria has been mainly altered to Etruria in this article, following Coke's convention.</ref> in the [[Latin language]], the first detailed study of every aspect of [[Etruscan civilisation]], considered a brilliant work. In 1723 [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (fifth creation)|Thomas Coke]] finally undertook to publish an enhanced edition of it. The original manuscript remains in Coke's library at Holkham.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\n====Clan Dempster====\nThomas Dempster<ref>Dempster alternates with Dempstar in the land charters abbreviated by Robertson.</ref> was born at Cliftbog, [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]] (near [[Turriff]]),<ref>A minority view places his birth at [[Brechin]].</ref> to the sister of the Baron of Balquhain,<ref>The 10th. Her father was Willam Lesley, 9th Baron of Balquhain.</ref> according to him in his autobiography, and Thomas Dempster Laird of Muiresk,<ref>Often spelled Muresk.</ref> [[Auchterless]] and Killesmont, sheriff (until 1586) of [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]] and [[Buchan]]. A [[Laird]] had the rank of [[Baron]]. As the Baron of Balquhain was a member of [[Clan Leslie]], a lowland clan (as was Clan Dempster), Thomas' mother is identified with Jean Leslie. A land charter from the king of Scotland in 1592<ref>Robertson pages 570\u2013571.</ref> defines or redefines the lands to be owned by Thomas and his wife Jeanne Leslie (Jean elsewhere in the charters) and inherited by his heirs Robert (2nd son), Thomas (3rd son), and George, who are called \"legitimate offspring\", and also John, Archibald and Charles Dempster. Girls could not inherit, so they are not listed. The oldest son, James, is missing from the record.\n\nBy birth Jeanne was connected to [[Clan Forbes]].<ref>Her mother, Janet, daughter of 6th Lord Forbes.</ref> The marriage seems to have taken place a few years before [[Clan Leslie]] joined with [[Clan Gordon]] in their feud against [[Clan Forbes]]. The Leslie's were supporters of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] pretender to the throne of England, who was imprisoned (and eventually executed) by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] and her son, the future [[James I of England]], taken away to be raised [[protestant]]. These events may or may not have something to do with the later accusations that Thomas was an intelligencer for James I.\n\nA permanent tutor was hired for Thomas: Andrew Ogston. Thomas reported that under Andrew he learned the alphabet in a single hour at age three. He may have been older; in any case, Andrew recognised talent in his pupil. He sent him to Grammar School<ref>There were no public schools as Americans know them in the British Isles at that time. The public in general had no right to an education and did not receive one. The school in Aberdeen was for a paying clientele.</ref> briefly in [[Aberdeen]], and in 1588, the year the [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated, at the age of ten (or 14) Thomas left home to enter [[Pembroke Hall, Cambridge]], an [[Anglican]] institution.<ref>{{acad|id=DMSR589T|name=Dempster, Thomas}}</ref>\n\n====The fall of the clan====\nMeanwhile, Thomas senior had taken a mistress, Isabella, from Clan Gordon, which must have been a bitter blow to his wife. Apparently Isabella charmed not only Thomas but James, who married her. Thomas reaction was swift: he disinherited his oldest son. James and a band of Gordons waylaid Thomas and party on the road between estates. Thomas was shot several times in the legs and suffered a sword blow to the head, as a result of which James became an outlaw, surviving by banditry in [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]]. The younger Thomas' uncle, John Dempster, an Edinburgh lawyer, insisted he be educated abroad to remove him from the environment.<ref name=MO>Mor\u00e9r.</ref>\n\nThe elder Dempster continued to make decisions that were the ruin of the family. Clan feuding was an expensive activity from which every clan suffered. The elder Thomas had already lost much of his estate to pay for feuds with [[Clan Currer]] and [[Clan Grant]]. He decided now to sell the estate at Muiresk to the [[Earl of Erroll]] to prevent his eldest son from ever inheriting it. The earl took advantage of some fine print in the law, now obscure, to evade payment.<ref>Dictionary of National Biography.</ref>\n\n===Education abroad===\n\n====Scots College of Paris====\nThomas and tutor started out for Paris. He was ten in the most precocious dating scheme, possibly as old as 14 in others. They had no sooner reached the continent when they were robbed of all their possessions and probably beaten as well, as Ogston died not long after. Their assailants remain unknown except that they were French soldiers. However, a [[good Samaritan]] stepped forward: Walter Brus, an officer in the French army, who was of Scottish descent, and judging from the name, perhaps not of the humblest birth. Walter sent him on to Paris, where other officers of Scottish descent in the French army took up a subscription to place him at the University of Paris.<ref>Stephen page 336.</ref>\n\nAccording to the structure of the university at the time, Thomas would have entered the [[Scots College (Paris)|Scots College]] there; the fact that the subscription was of Scottish officers indicates that that is the most likely possibility. If true, it shows that Brus' motivations were not entirely altruistic. The Scots Colleges abroad were being used as training and staging areas for Scottish priests intended to enter Scotland in the wake of the invading army and play the most significant role in its reconversion. The failure of the invasion left them in place (without much work to do other than intelligence and conspiracy).\n\n====Diversions to Belgium and Rome====\nAt the [[University of Paris]] Thomas became deathly ill with \"the plague\"<ref>This is the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' term. Thomas' own term (page 674) is ''lues horrenda''.</ref> and on recovering was sent by someone in charge of his destiny to the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]] in the [[Southern Netherlands]] (now Belgium), to study under [[Justus Lipsius]]. Thomas himself gives that as a reason,<ref name=\"Page 675\">Page 675.</ref> but otherwise does not have a clear explanation for the change, stating only that Belgium was a \"safe refuge\".<ref>Tutum portum ([[accusative case]]), page 674.</ref> Instead he was diverted from this plan by [[William Crichton (Jesuit)|William Crichton]], [[Jesuit]],<ref>1535\u20131617, recruited into the Jesuits by [[William Hay (Jesuit)|William Hay]] on the latter's mission to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], 1592, subsequent member of an unsuccessful mission to convert [[James VI and I]], even though he had been released from the [[Tower of London]] on condition that he not return to England.</ref> then Superior of the [[Scots College, Douai]], which is a good indication that forces unknown to young Thomas were at work in his life. He did not matriculate at Louvain.\n\nThe [[University of Douai]] was founded by [[Philip II of Spain]] as part of his military build-up against England and was at first identical to the [[English College, Douai|English College]] there. This college was a refuge and rallying point for English Catholics fleeing the re-establishment of Protestantism after the death of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Mary had won for herself the popular title \"Bloody Mary\" for her methods in attempting to reimpose Catholicism on England. Philip II, who had been married to Mary 1554\u20131558, used the seminarians from Douai openly as agents. They were often in England illegally to establish contacts and maintain a bridgehead, so to speak, for reconversion.\n\nThe mastermind in the strategy to reconquer Great Britain for Catholicism and Spain was that of Philip II. He was supported in this effort by a long series of short-term popes (some very short-term), such as [[Innocent IX]] (1591), [[Gregory XIV]] (1590\u20131591), etc., who basically followed his strategy. [[Clement VIII]] (1592\u20131605), Cardinal Aldobrandini since 1585, changed the policy and stood against Philip, after his military defeat by the English.\n\nIn the latter part of the 16th century, deeming that the reconversion structure needed strengthening, the popes established a number of Scots Colleges, typically through the Jesuits. One of these was the Scots College at Douai, founded by its first Superior, Father William Crighton (P. Gulielmus Creighton), who held the office 1581\u20131597, according to the records of the college.<ref>''Records of the Scots Colleges'', page 96.</ref>\n\nApparently Crighton had been asked by \"the pope\": perhaps [[Pope Sixtus V]] (1585\u20131590) to provide Scottish students for seminary study at Rome. The Scots College at Rome did not receive its foundation [[Papal bull|bull]] from [[Clement VIII]] until 1600, but the request specifically for Scotsmen evidences an early interest in that direction. How Crighton got Dempster's name remains as unknown as why he was deported from Paris, but Thomas was one of four selected and did not enroll at Louvain, but journeyed straight to Rome. He mentions that Cardinal Aldobrandini was raising an army there and calls him also Clement VIII, perhaps in anticipation of later events. Dempster says that he was in a ''seminarium Romanum'' with \"the choicest nobility of Italy\",<ref name=\"Page 675\"/> which he would not have been if the Scots College had existed then.\n\n====Scots College of Douai====\nThe Roman plan came to nothing when, as Dempster says, \"the lethal disease recurred.\"<ref name=\"Page 675\"/> Acting on medical advice the church authorities returned him to Belgium for a change of climate. After an arduous and dangerous journey north of the Alps he connected at [[Tournai]] with [[James Cheyne]], a member of his network of Scottish patrons. Securing funding from \"the king of Spain\", who must have been Philip II, and \"[[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert]]\",<ref>Dempster page 675.</ref> Cheyne sent him to the [[Scottish College, Douai]], from which, after a few years, he graduated.\n\nThe name of Thomas Demster appears as Item Number 64 in the Register of Alumni for the college, applying to the year 1593, with a very brief entry next to his name, \"etiam seminarii alumnus.\" Apparently the college accepted both seminarians and seculars, and this notification identified Thomas as a seminarian.  If the 1579 birthdate is true, Thomas would have been 14. Of his stay there he had little to say, only that he took first prize in poetry and second in philosophy.\n<!--Let's not invent any English riots. No one at Douai would care in the slightest, as they were dedicated to her overthrow. This is the sense of humour of some Protestant liar, which the word scurrilous reveals: He went to the English college at [[Douai]], where he remained three years and took his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]] degree. While at Douai he wrote a scurrilous attack on Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], which caused a riot among the English students.-->\n\nHe showed such ability that, when still in his teens, he became lecturer on the [[Humanities]] at the [[University of Douai]]. After a short stay, he returned to Paris, to take his degree of doctor of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\n===Itinerant professor===\nDempster's first position as a doctor was a regent, or full professor, of the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre]], at age 17. He soon left Paris for [[Toulouse]], which in turn he was forced to leave by the hostility of the city authorities, aroused by his violent assertion of university rights. He was than elected professor of [[elocution|eloquence]] at the academy of [[N\u00eemes]]. A murderous attack upon him by one of the defeated candidates and his supporters was followed by a [[libel]] case, which, though he ultimately won, forced him to leave the town.\n\nA short stay in Spain, as tutor to the son of [[Marshal de Saint Luc]], was terminated by another quarrel; and Dempster returned to Scotland in 1608 with the intention of claiming his father's estates. Finding his relatives unsympathetic, and falling into heated controversy with the [[Presbyterian]] clergy, he returned to Paris in 1609, where he remained for seven years, becoming professor in several colleges.\n\nIn the end, his temporary connection with the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Beauvais]] was ended by a fight, in which he defeated officers of the king's guard, forcing him once again to change his place of residence. The story is told in Latin by [[Gian Vittorio Rossi]], a contemporary. He begins with a characterisation of Dempster that has been much repeated:<ref>In ''Pinotheca'', \"Picture Gallery\", written by Rossi under the pen-name in Latin of Janus Nicius Erythraeus, in Italian Giano Nicio Eritreo. The Latin is given in ''The Classical Journal'' of March and June 1821, Volume XXIII, ''Sketch of the Character of Thomas Dempster'' by M., pages 119 following. Downloadable Google Books.</ref> \"But, I don't know by what pact, those most mild-mannered sisters (the [[Muses]]) ... have embraced Thomas Dempster, a Scot, a man made for war and contention ... he allowed almost no day to go by empty of strife ... but that he should fight another by sword, or, if he had no sword, with fists ....\" In the story, Dempster whips a student on the bare back for dueling, but the student, unable to bear the insult, brings in three relatives who happen to belong to the ''custodes corporis Regis'', the king's own bodyguard. In response Dempster arms the other students, surrounds the guardsmen and puts them in chains in the bell tower. In the resulting inquiry, \"such a storm arose\" that Thomas departed for England. The story says distinctly that England was a \"safe refuge\", meaning between the lines that Catholic prosecutors could not extradite him or threaten him with agents.\n\nThe story goes on to say that in England he met a woman (Susanna Valeria) \"so abundant, so favored by Venus that nothing else would do but that he have her to wife.\" At this point the story skips over a small matter, intentionally or not, that might well explain Thomas' future apparent inability to settle in one place, even as a renowned and successful scholar. The dedication of his edition of [[Johannes Rosinus|Rosinus']] ''Antiquitatum romanarum corpus absolutissimum'' to [[James I of England|King James I]], a Protestant (the king of the King James Bible), even though he, Dempster, was a Catholic, had won him an invitation to the English court; and in 1615 he went to London. There James I appointed him historiographer royal.<ref name=\"MO\" />\n\n===\"Escape\" to Italy===\nHe was not there long. Even though England was totally safe for him, and he had already been preferred by a king who admired him, and had married an English girl, complaining that he was not accepted by the Protestants and could not find advancement because of them he set sail for Rome with his wife. [[Pope Paul V]] immediately drew what may have been the correct conclusion and threw him into prison as a spy. However, the good pope changed his mind shortly, perhaps still hoping to reconvert the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and decided accept the matter graciously, placing Thomas in Italy. He used his influence with [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], to get Thomas appointed to the professorship of the ''[[Pandects]]'' at [[Pisa]]. The Grand Duke commissioned him also to write a definitive work on the Etruscans.\n\nIn 1619 his daughter died shortly after birth, the only child he was to have. In 1620 after the execution of his father he began to call himself the Baron of Muiresk, which in Scotland was considered an illegitimate claim. His brother James, though disinherited from the estate, still had a claim to the title, which was considered to end with his death, as he had no heir. In any case Thomas was not the second son but the third. The second (Robert) had no heirs, either, which did not strengthen the case of the Dempsters. They were forced to accept the end of their clan; that is, there were no further charters to Dempsters from the king, nor was anyone entitled to be called Baron Dempster or use the coat of arms. Modern Dempsters, of course, may do as they please in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they reside.\n\nAt Pisa Thomas worked very hard on his commission, sometimes 14 hours per day. The strain was too much for his wife, perhaps depressed also by her loss. She ran off with an Englishman, but later returned. The issue of adultery came up again. Violent accusations followed, indignantly repudiated; a diplomatic correspondence ensued, and a demand was made, and supported by the grand duke, for an apology, which the professor refused to make, preferring to lose his chair. He set out once more for Scotland, but was intercepted by the Florentine cardinal [[Luigi Capponi]], who persuaded him to remain at [[Bologna]] as professor of Humanity. This was the most distinguished post in the most famous of continental universities, and Dempster was at the height of his fame. Though his ''Roman Antiquities'' and ''Scotia ilustrior'' had been placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]]'' pending correction, [[Pope Urban VIII]] made him a knight and gave him a pension.\n\nIt was in Bologna that Thomas made friends with Matteo Pellegrini, who was to complete his autobiography posthumously and described \"Dempsterus\" as a man \"outstanding in body and mind: his height was above the average height of the common man: his hair was nearly black and the colour of his skin not far from that: his head was huge and the carriage of his body completely regal; his strength and ferocity were as outstanding as that of a soldier ....\"<ref>Burton, pages 260\u2013261.</ref>\n\n===End===\nThomas was not to enjoy his honours long. His wife ran off again, this time with a student. He pursued them as far as [[Vicenza]]. Becoming ill with a fever he returned to [[Bologna]], where he died on 6 September at age 46 (or 50). He is buried there.\n\n==Publications==\n[[File:Dempster, Thomas \u2013 Keraunos kai obelos in glossas librorum quatuor Institutionum, 1622 \u2013 BEIC 14136595.jpg|thumb|''Keraunos kai obelos in glossas librorum quatuor Institutionum'', 1622]]\n\nDempster was equally at home in [[philology]], criticism, law, biography, and history.

Much of what it says about him; for example, that his mother had 29 children and that he himself was one of triplets, is counted as prevarication. The low quality of this work after so much brilliance remains unexplained.\n*Some of his [[Latin]] verse is printed in the first volume (pp.&nbsp;306\u2013354) of ''Delitiae poetarum Scotorum'' (Amsterdam, 1637).\n\n==The rescue of ''De Etruria Regali''==\nDempster's major work was rescued from oblivion by [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (fifth creation)|Thomas Coke]] (1697\u20131759) later [[Earl of Leicester]]. Aged 15, he started on the [[Grand Tour]], and in Etruria befriended the Grand Duke [[Cosimo III]]. Through him he discovered the existence of Dempster's manuscript, which he purchased from its then owner, Antonio Maria Salvini.<ref>The abbot, 1653\u20131729, Greek scholar and Italian dictionarist. It isn't clear how Dempster's manuscript descended from ownership by [[Cosimo II]] to Salvini's extensive and famous collection.</ref> This he published apparently at his own expense; however, the publication was not exactly of the original. Filippo Buonarroti of Florence emended the text and added a critical apparatus. The duke had his own engravers enhance Dempster's illustrations with new ones drawn from artefacts in various collections. In all the work came to contain about 100 copperplate engravings.<ref>In the process he had Biscioni copy the manuscript, which took about a year. He had intended to keep only the copy, but Biscioni sent him both, which remained at Holkhom.</ref> It came out in two volumes, folio, at [[Florence]], 1723\u20131724, under the comprehensive title:\n:\"Thomae Dempsteri a Muresk Scoti Pandectarum in Pisano Lyceo Professoris Ordinarii de Etruria Regali libri septem, opus posthumum, in duas partes divisum, nunc primum editi curante Tho. Coke\"<ref>Dempster's title, \"De Hetruria Regali Libri Septem\" can be seen embedded in this one without the ''H''. The ''Pandectarum'', \"Of Encyclopedia\" (Pandectae), is not Dempster's; the idea is \"seven books of Encyclopedia about ....\" The ''editi curante Tho. Coke'' identifies Coke as the publisher, not the editor. Otherwise, the rest of the title identifies Dempster and states that the work is posthumous.</ref>\n\nA Latin dedication to Cosimo III, dated 1725, London, was added in 1726 by Coke. A folio supplement was published by Passeri, 1767. The publication of the book sparked the first public wave of interest in the Etruscans throughout academic Italy.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | author=Dempster, Thomas | title=Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum sive De Scriptoribus Scotis Editio Altera Tom.

Thomas said that he was one of 29 children and belonged to a set of triplets, which seems an impossibility and for which there is no other evidence. A modern Dempster, James, reasons, on a website established by him at [http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~jdempster/Thomas.html#TOP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212075228/http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~jdempster/Thomas.html |date=12 February 2012 }}, that 9 is a plausible figure. As it has been established by other documentation that Thomas was the third son, fourth child, and that his parents were married in 1568, allowing an interval of 18 months James arrives at 1574 or 1575, which makes Thomas considerably less precocious. However, this article, following the sources on which it is based, presumes a birth at 1579.</ref> \u2013 6 September 1625) was a Scottish scholar and historian. Born into the aristocracy in [[Aberdeenshire]], which comprises regions of both the [[Scottish highlands]] and the [[Scottish lowlands]], he was sent abroad as a youth for his education. The Dempsters were Catholic in an increasingly Protestant country and had a reputation for being quarrelsome. Thomas' brother James, outlawed for an attack on his father, spent some years as a pirate in the northern islands, escaped by volunteering for military service in the [[Low Countries]] and was drawn and quartered there for insubordination. Thomas' father lost the family fortune in clan feuding and was beheaded for forgery.\n\nFor these and political and religious reasons in these often violent [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan times]] Thomas was unable to come home except for visits. Of uncommon and impressive height and intellectual ability he became an itinerant professor in France and Italy, driven from place to place by a series of colourful personal incidents in which he fought duels or opposed officers of the law. He eventually found refuge and patronage under Grand Duke [[Cosimo II]] of [[Tuscany]], who commissioned a work on the Etruscans. Three years later Thomas handed the duke a ''magnum opus'', the manuscript of ''De Etruria Regali Libri Septem'', \"Seven Books about Royal Etruria\",<ref>\"Royal Hetruria\" was Dempster's own English name for the book, used in a letter recounting its loss to him. Rowland, pages 98\u201399. Dempster's Hetruria has been mainly altered to Etruria in this article, following Coke's convention.</ref> in the [[Latin language]], the first detailed study of every aspect of [[Etruscan civilisation]], considered a brilliant work. In 1723 [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (fifth creation)|Thomas Coke]] finally undertook to publish an enhanced edition of it. The original manuscript remains in Coke's library at Holkham.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\n====Clan Dempster====\nThomas Dempster<ref>Dempster alternates with Dempstar in the land charters abbreviated by Robertson.</ref> was born at Cliftbog, [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]] (near [[Turriff]]),<ref>A minority view places his birth at [[Brechin]].</ref> to the sister of the Baron of Balquhain,<ref>The 10th. Her father was Willam Lesley, 9th Baron of Balquhain.</ref> according to him in his autobiography, and Thomas Dempster Laird of Muiresk,<ref>Often spelled Muresk.</ref> [[Auchterless]] and Killesmont, sheriff (until 1586) of [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]] and [[Buchan]]. A [[Laird]] had the rank of [[Baron]]. As the Baron of Balquhain was a member of [[Clan Leslie]], a lowland clan (as was Clan Dempster), Thomas' mother is identified with Jean Leslie. A land charter from the king of Scotland in 1592<ref>Robertson pages 570\u2013571.</ref> defines or redefines the lands to be owned by Thomas and his wife Jeanne Leslie (Jean elsewhere in the charters) and inherited by his heirs Robert (2nd son), Thomas (3rd son), and George, who are called \"legitimate offspring\", and also John, Archibald and Charles Dempster. Girls could not inherit, so they are not listed. The oldest son, James, is missing from the record.\n\nBy birth Jeanne was connected to [[Clan Forbes]].<ref>Her mother, Janet, daughter of 6th Lord Forbes.</ref> The marriage seems to have taken place a few years before [[Clan Leslie]] joined with [[Clan Gordon]] in their feud against [[Clan Forbes]]. The Leslie's were supporters of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] pretender to the throne of England, who was imprisoned (and eventually executed) by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] and her son, the future [[James I of England]], taken away to be raised [[protestant]]. These events may or may not have something to do with the later accusations that Thomas was an intelligencer for James I.\n\nA permanent tutor was hired for Thomas: Andrew Ogston. Thomas reported that under Andrew he learned the alphabet in a single hour at age three. He may have been older; in any case, Andrew recognised talent in his pupil. He sent him to Grammar School<ref>There were no public schools as Americans know them in the British Isles at that time. The public in general had no right to an education and did not receive one. The school in Aberdeen was for a paying clientele.</ref> briefly in [[Aberdeen]], and in 1588, the year the [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated, at the age of ten (or 14) Thomas left home to enter [[Pembroke Hall, Cambridge]], an [[Anglican]] institution.<ref>{{acad|id=DMSR589T|name=Dempster, Thomas}}</ref>\n\n====The fall of the clan====\nMeanwhile, Thomas senior had taken a mistress, Isabella, from Clan Gordon, which must have been a bitter blow to his wife. Apparently Isabella charmed not only Thomas but James, who married her. Thomas reaction was swift: he disinherited his oldest son. James and a band of Gordons waylaid Thomas and party on the road between estates. Thomas was shot several times in the legs and suffered a sword blow to the head, as a result of which James became an outlaw, surviving by banditry in [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]]. The younger Thomas' uncle, John Dempster, an Edinburgh lawyer, insisted he be educated abroad to remove him from the environment.<ref name=MO>Mor\u00e9r.</ref>\n\nThe elder Dempster continued to make decisions that were the ruin of the family. Clan feuding was an expensive activity from which every clan suffered. The elder Thomas had already lost much of his estate to pay for feuds with [[Clan Currer]] and [[Clan Grant]]. He decided now to sell the estate at Muiresk to the [[Earl of Erroll]] to prevent his eldest son from ever inheriting it. The earl took advantage of some fine print in the law, now obscure, to evade payment.<ref>Dictionary of National Biography.</ref>\n\n===Education abroad===\n\n====Scots College of Paris====\nThomas and tutor started out for Paris. He was ten in the most precocious dating scheme, possibly as old as 14 in others. They had no sooner reached the continent when they were robbed of all their possessions and probably beaten as well, as Ogston died not long after. Their assailants remain unknown except that they were French soldiers. However, a [[good Samaritan]] stepped forward: Walter Brus, an officer in the French army, who was of Scottish descent, and judging from the name, perhaps not of the humblest birth. Walter sent him on to Paris, where other officers of Scottish descent in the French army took up a subscription to place him at the University of Paris.<ref>Stephen page 336.</ref>\n\nAccording to the structure of the university at the time, Thomas would have entered the [[Scots College (Paris)|Scots College]] there; the fact that the subscription was of Scottish officers indicates that that is the most likely possibility. If true, it shows that Brus' motivations were not entirely altruistic. The Scots Colleges abroad were being used as training and staging areas for Scottish priests intended to enter Scotland in the wake of the invading army and play the most significant role in its reconversion. The failure of the invasion left them in place (without much work to do other than intelligence and conspiracy).\n\n====Diversions to Belgium and Rome====\nAt the [[University of Paris]] Thomas became deathly ill with \"the plague\"<ref>This is the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' term. Thomas' own term (page 674) is ''lues horrenda''.</ref> and on recovering was sent by someone in charge of his destiny to the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]] in the [[Southern Netherlands]] (now Belgium), to study under [[Justus Lipsius]]. Thomas himself gives that as a reason,<ref name=\"Page 675\">Page 675.</ref> but otherwise does not have a clear explanation for the change, stating only that Belgium was a \"safe refuge\".<ref>Tutum portum ([[accusative case]]), page 674.</ref> Instead he was diverted from this plan by [[William Crichton (Jesuit)|William Crichton]], [[Jesuit]],<ref>1535\u20131617, recruited into the Jesuits by [[William Hay (Jesuit)|William Hay]] on the latter's mission to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], 1592, subsequent member of an unsuccessful mission to convert [[James VI and I]], even though he had been released from the [[Tower of London]] on condition that he not return to England.</ref> then Superior of the [[Scots College, Douai]], which is a good indication that forces unknown to young Thomas were at work in his life. He did not matriculate at Louvain.\n\nThe [[University of Douai]] was founded by [[Philip II of Spain]] as part of his military build-up against England and was at first identical to the [[English College, Douai|English College]] there. This college was a refuge and rallying point for English Catholics fleeing the re-establishment of Protestantism after the death of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Mary had won for herself the popular title \"Bloody Mary\" for her methods in attempting to reimpose Catholicism on England. Philip II, who had been married to Mary 1554\u20131558, used the seminarians from Douai openly as agents. They were often in England illegally to establish contacts and maintain a bridgehead, so to speak, for reconversion.\n\nThe mastermind in the strategy to reconquer Great Britain for Catholicism and Spain was that of Philip II. He was supported in this effort by a long series of short-term popes (some very short-term), such as [[Innocent IX]] (1591), [[Gregory XIV]] (1590\u20131591), etc., who basically followed his strategy. [[Clement VIII]] (1592\u20131605), Cardinal Aldobrandini since 1585, changed the policy and stood against Philip, after his military defeat by the English.\n\nIn the latter part of the 16th century, deeming that the reconversion structure needed strengthening, the popes established a number of Scots Colleges, typically through the Jesuits. One of these was the Scots College at Douai, founded by its first Superior, Father William Crighton (P. Gulielmus Creighton), who held the office 1581\u20131597, according to the records of the college.<ref>''Records of the Scots Colleges'', page 96.</ref>\n\nApparently Crighton had been asked by \"the pope\": perhaps [[Pope Sixtus V]] (1585\u20131590) to provide Scottish students for seminary study at Rome. The Scots College at Rome did not receive its foundation [[Papal bull|bull]] from [[Clement VIII]] until 1600, but the request specifically for Scotsmen evidences an early interest in that direction. How Crighton got Dempster's name remains as unknown as why he was deported from Paris, but Thomas was one of four selected and did not enroll at Louvain, but journeyed straight to Rome. He mentions that Cardinal Aldobrandini was raising an army there and calls him also Clement VIII, perhaps in anticipation of later events. Dempster says that he was in a ''seminarium Romanum'' with \"the choicest nobility of Italy\",<ref name=\"Page 675\"/> which he would not have been if the Scots College had existed then.\n\n====Scots College of Douai====\nThe Roman plan came to nothing when, as Dempster says, \"the lethal disease recurred.\"<ref name=\"Page 675\"/> Acting on medical advice the church authorities returned him to Belgium for a change of climate. After an arduous and dangerous journey north of the Alps he connected at [[Tournai]] with [[James Cheyne]], a member of his network of Scottish patrons. Securing funding from \"the king of Spain\", who must have been Philip II, and \"[[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert]]\",<ref>Dempster page 675.</ref> Cheyne sent him to the [[Scottish College, Douai]], from which, after a few years, he graduated.\n\nThe name of Thomas Demster appears as Item Number 64 in the Register of Alumni for the college, applying to the year 1593, with a very brief entry next to his name, \"etiam seminarii alumnus.\" Apparently the college accepted both seminarians and seculars, and this notification identified Thomas as a seminarian.  If the 1579 birthdate is true, Thomas would have been 14. Of his stay there he had little to say, only that he took first prize in poetry and second in philosophy.\n<!--Let's not invent any English riots. No one at Douai would care in the slightest, as they were dedicated to her overthrow. This is the sense of humour of some Protestant liar, which the word scurrilous reveals: He went to the English college at [[Douai]], where he remained three years and took his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]] degree. While at Douai he wrote a scurrilous attack on Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], which caused a riot among the English students.-->\n\nHe showed such ability that, when still in his teens, he became lecturer on the [[Humanities]] at the [[University of Douai]]. After a short stay, he returned to Paris, to take his degree of doctor of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\n===Itinerant professor===\nDempster's first position as a doctor was a regent, or full professor, of the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre]], at age 17. He soon left Paris for [[Toulouse]], which in turn he was forced to leave by the hostility of the city authorities, aroused by his violent assertion of university rights. He was than elected professor of [[elocution|eloquence]] at the academy of [[N\u00eemes]]. A murderous attack upon him by one of the defeated candidates and his supporters was followed by a [[libel]] case, which, though he ultimately won, forced him to leave the town.\n\nA short stay in Spain, as tutor to the son of [[Marshal de Saint Luc]], was terminated by another quarrel; and Dempster returned to Scotland in 1608 with the intention of claiming his father's estates. Finding his relatives unsympathetic, and falling into heated controversy with the [[Presbyterian]] clergy, he returned to Paris in 1609, where he remained for seven years, becoming professor in several colleges.\n\nIn the end, his temporary connection with the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Beauvais]] was ended by a fight, in which he defeated officers of the king's guard, forcing him once again to change his place of residence. The story is told in Latin by [[Gian Vittorio Rossi]], a contemporary. He begins with a characterisation of Dempster that has been much repeated:<ref>In ''Pinotheca'', \"Picture Gallery\", written by Rossi under the pen-name in Latin of Janus Nicius Erythraeus, in Italian Giano Nicio Eritreo. The Latin is given in ''The Classical Journal'' of March and June 1821, Volume XXIII, ''Sketch of the Character of Thomas Dempster'' by M., pages 119 following. Downloadable Google Books.</ref> \"But, I don't know by what pact, those most mild-mannered sisters (the [[Muses]]) ... have embraced Thomas Dempster, a Scot, a man made for war and contention ... he allowed almost no day to go by empty of strife ... but that he should fight another by sword, or, if he had no sword, with fists ....\" In the story, Dempster whips a student on the bare back for dueling, but the student, unable to bear the insult, brings in three relatives who happen to belong to the ''custodes corporis Regis'', the king's own bodyguard. In response Dempster arms the other students, surrounds the guardsmen and puts them in chains in the bell tower. In the resulting inquiry, \"such a storm arose\" that Thomas departed for England. The story says distinctly that England was a \"safe refuge\", meaning between the lines that Catholic prosecutors could not extradite him or threaten him with agents.\n\nThe story goes on to say that in England he met a woman (Susanna Valeria) \"so abundant, so favored by Venus that nothing else would do but that he have her to wife.\" At this point the story skips over a small matter, intentionally or not, that might well explain Thomas' future apparent inability to settle in one place, even as a renowned and successful scholar. The dedication of his edition of [[Johannes Rosinus|Rosinus']] ''Antiquitatum romanarum corpus absolutissimum'' to [[James I of England|King James I]], a Protestant (the king of the King James Bible), even though he, Dempster, was a Catholic, had won him an invitation to the English court; and in 1615 he went to London. There James I appointed him historiographer royal.<ref name=\"MO\" />\n\n===\"Escape\" to Italy===\nHe was not there long. Even though England was totally safe for him, and he had already been preferred by a king who admired him, and had married an English girl, complaining that he was not accepted by the Protestants and could not find advancement because of them he set sail for Rome with his wife. [[Pope Paul V]] immediately drew what may have been the correct conclusion and threw him into prison as a spy. However, the good pope changed his mind shortly, perhaps still hoping to reconvert the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and decided accept the matter graciously, placing Thomas in Italy. He used his influence with [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], to get Thomas appointed to the professorship of the ''[[Pandects]]'' at [[Pisa]]. The Grand Duke commissioned him also to write a definitive work on the Etruscans.\n\nIn 1619 his daughter died shortly after birth, the only child he was to have. In 1620 after the execution of his father he began to call himself the Baron of Muiresk, which in Scotland was considered an illegitimate claim. His brother James, though disinherited from the estate, still had a claim to the title, which was considered to end with his death, as he had no heir. In any case Thomas was not the second son but the third. The second (Robert) had no heirs, either, which did not strengthen the case of the Dempsters. They were forced to accept the end of their clan; that is, there were no further charters to Dempsters from the king, nor was anyone entitled to be called Baron Dempster or use the coat of arms. Modern Dempsters, of course, may do as they please in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they reside.\n\nAt Pisa Thomas worked very hard on his commission, sometimes 14 hours per day. The strain was too much for his wife, perhaps depressed also by her loss. She ran off with an Englishman, but later returned. The issue of adultery came up again. Violent accusations followed, indignantly repudiated; a diplomatic correspondence ensued, and a demand was made, and supported by the grand duke, for an apology, which the professor refused to make, preferring to lose his chair. He set out once more for Scotland, but was intercepted by the Florentine cardinal [[Luigi Capponi]], who persuaded him to remain at [[Bologna]] as professor of Humanity. This was the most distinguished post in the most famous of continental universities, and Dempster was at the height of his fame. Though his ''Roman Antiquities'' and ''Scotia ilustrior'' had been placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]]'' pending correction, [[Pope Urban VIII]] made him a knight and gave him a pension.\n\nIt was in Bologna that Thomas made friends with Matteo Pellegrini, who was to complete his autobiography posthumously and described \"Dempsterus\" as a man \"outstanding in body and mind: his height was above the average height of the common man: his hair was nearly black and the colour of his skin not far from that: his head was huge and the carriage of his body completely regal; his strength and ferocity were as outstanding as that of a soldier ....\"<ref>Burton, pages 260\u2013261.</ref>\n\n===End===\nThomas was not to enjoy his honours long. His wife ran off again, this time with a student. He pursued them as far as [[Vicenza]]. Becoming ill with a fever he returned to [[Bologna]], where he died on 6 September at age 46 (or 50). He is buried there.\n\n==Publications==\n[[File:Dempster, Thomas \u2013 Keraunos kai obelos in glossas librorum quatuor Institutionum, 1622 \u2013 BEIC 14136595.jpg|thumb|''Keraunos kai obelos in glossas librorum quatuor Institutionum'', 1622]]\n\nDempster was equally at home in [[philology]], criticism, law, biography, and history. He was a master of the [[Latin language]] and wrote in Latin, as was still the academic custom of the times. His works are:\n\n*An edition of [[Johannes Rosinus|Rosinus']] ''Antiquitatum Romanarum corpus absolutissimum''  \"The Most Complete Body of Roman Antiquities\" (Paris, 1613). Dedicated to [[James I of England|James I]]. This is the work that came to the attention of the king.\n*''Panegyricus Jacobo M.'' (Magnae) ''Britanniae Regi'', \"[[Panegyric]] to James, King of Great Britain (London, 1616)\"\n*Poetic contributions ''In Obitum Aldinae Catellae: lachrymae poeticae'', \"On the Death of the Puppy Aldina: Poetic tears\" (Paris, 1622).\n* {{Cite book|title=Keraunos kai obelos in glossas librorum quatuor Institutionum|volume=|publisher=Nicol\u00f2 Tebaldini|location=Bologna|year=1622|language=la|url=https://gutenberg.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=14136595}}\n*An edition of [[Benedetto Accolti the Elder|Benedetto Accolti]]'s ''De bello a Christianis contra barbaros'', \"Of the Christian War against the Barbarians\" (1623).\n*''Historia ecclesiastica gentis Scotarum'', \"Ecclesiastical History of the Scottish Nation\" (Bologna, 1627). Mor\u00e9r asserts that this \"is one of the most discredited works ever written in the field of Scottish history.\"<ref>Below.</ref> The 1911 [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] says: \"In this he tries to prove that [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Bernard]] (Sapiens), [[Alcuin]], [[Saint Boniface]] and [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] were all Scots, and even [[Boadicea]] becomes a Scottish author.\" The last chapter was intended as his autobiography, which Matteo Pellegrini, a friend at Bologna, completed posthumously. Much of what it says about him; for example, that his mother had 29 children and that he himself was one of triplets, is counted as prevarication. The low quality of this work after so much brilliance remains unexplained.\n*Some of his [[Latin]] verse is printed in the first volume (pp.&nbsp;306\u2013354) of ''Delitiae poetarum Scotorum'' (Amsterdam, 1637).\n\n==The rescue of ''De Etruria Regali''==\nDempster's major work was rescued from oblivion by [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (fifth creation)|Thomas Coke]] (1697\u20131759) later [[Earl of Leicester]]. Aged 15, he started on the [[Grand Tour]], and in Etruria befriended the Grand Duke [[Cosimo III]]. Through him he discovered the existence of Dempster's manuscript, which he purchased from its then owner, Antonio Maria Salvini.<ref>The abbot, 1653\u20131729, Greek scholar and Italian dictionarist. It isn't clear how Dempster's manuscript descended from ownership by [[Cosimo II]] to Salvini's extensive and famous collection.</ref> This he published apparently at his own expense; however, the publication was not exactly of the original. Filippo Buonarroti of Florence emended the text and added a critical apparatus. The duke had his own engravers enhance Dempster's illustrations with new ones drawn from artefacts in various collections. In all the work came to contain about 100 copperplate engravings.<ref>In the process he had Biscioni copy the manuscript, which took about a year. He had intended to keep only the copy, but Biscioni sent him both, which remained at Holkhom.</ref> It came out in two volumes, folio, at [[Florence]], 1723\u20131724, under the comprehensive title:\n:\"Thomae Dempsteri a Muresk Scoti Pandectarum in Pisano Lyceo Professoris Ordinarii de Etruria Regali libri septem, opus posthumum, in duas partes divisum, nunc primum editi curante Tho. Coke\"<ref>Dempster's title, \"De Hetruria Regali Libri Septem\" can be seen embedded in this one without the ''H''. The ''Pandectarum'', \"Of Encyclopedia\" (Pandectae), is not Dempster's; the idea is \"seven books of Encyclopedia about ....\" The ''editi curante Tho. Coke'' identifies Coke as the publisher, not the editor. Otherwise, the rest of the title identifies Dempster and states that the work is posthumous.</ref>\n\nA Latin dedication to Cosimo III, dated 1725, London, was added in 1726 by Coke. A folio supplement was published by Passeri, 1767. The publication of the book sparked the first public wave of interest in the Etruscans throughout academic Italy.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | author=Dempster, Thomas | title=Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum sive De Scriptoribus Scotis Editio Altera Tom.

Beside this church, the monastery compound contains a fortified entrance gate, a university, a hotel complex for visitors, monastic cells including the Konrad's cell. The church is surrounded by adjoining four towers at each corner.\n\nThis monastery is associated with the [[Union of Brest]] personalities like [[Josaphat Kuntsevych]], [[Ruthenian Catholic Archeparchy of Polotsk\u2013Vitebsk|Archbishop of Polatsk]] who took vows here and spent first years of his monastic life, as well as a prominent reformer of the Basilian Order, [[Veliamyn Rutsky]].\n\n==History==\n===The church===\nAccording to a legend, the first wooden church was built in the 14th century by Grand Princess [[Uliana of Tver]], a spouse of the Grand Prince [[Algirdas]]. The church was built in place where in 1347 the Algirdas noblemen Antony, Johan, and Eustachy died as the first martyrs for Christian faith and the first Christian saints in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].\n\nThe first stone church of Holy Trinity with a belfry was built by [[Konstanty Ostrogski]] in 1514 as a token of appreciation for a victory of Polish-Lithuanian forces over Muscovite troops near Orsha ([[Battle of Orsha]]). The original church was built in Gothic style. In first half of the 17th century to the church were added three chapels. In 1609 on an edict of the [[King of Poland]] [[Sigismund III Vasa]] the church and monastery was transferred to the Basialian Order.<ref>Yurko, I.

In the chapel's [[crypt]] were buried father of the founder, Theodor Skumin-Tyszkiewicz (d.1618), the founder himself, and his wife, Barbara Naruszewicz (d.1627). In the chapel is preserved her marble gravestone, a work of Italian masters. Nowadays in the chapel are constantly held liturgies in [[Byzantine rite]].\n\nThe second chapel that is located to the left of main entrance called ''St.Luke'' was built in 1622 on the funds of Eustachy Korsak-Ho\u0142ubicki, a big supporter of the Union ([[Union of Brest]]). Beside its founder, in the crypt underneath the chapel rest his sons Ivan and Grigori. To this noble family of Korsaks belongs archimandrite the Basilian monastery of Vilnius [[Rafajil Korsak|Rafajil Mykola Korsak]], later &ndash; a proto-archimandrite of the Basilian Order, Metropolitan of Kiev for Eastern-rite Catholics.\n\nThe third chapel is called ''Exaltation of the True and Life-creating Cross of our Lord''. The founder of this chapel with a family crypt was a scribe of Grand Duchy of Lithuania Jan Kolenda in 1628.\n\nIn the church survived valuable tombstones. Unique landmark of the Renaissance epoch in Lithuania is a tombstone of Vilna [[Burgomaster]] Othanasius Braha and his son Antony with a coat of arms, Cyrillic inscription and rich floral ornament dated 1576. Draws attention a tombstone of Jelenski sisters with sentimental inscription which comes from 1758.\n\nIn 1670 significant funds to renew the church contributed [[Great Hetman of Lithuania]] [[Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Pac]] and Great Treasurer Hieronymus Kryszpin-Kirchenstein, particularly towards the altar of Saint [[Josaphat Kuntsevych]].\n\nThe [[Basilian monks]] were banished from the monastery in 1821 and the wing of the men's monastery was converted into a prison.<ref name=\"vienuolynai\">{{cite web |title=Vilniaus buv\u0119s bazilijon\u0173 vienuolynas ir \u0160v\u010d.

According to a legend, the icon was written by St.[[Luke the Evangelist]] and for long years it was an ancestral relic of Greek emperors in [[Constantinople]]. It is believed that a niece of the last Byzantine Emperor, [[Sophia Palaiologina]] who married the [[Great Prince of Muscovy]] [[Ivan III of Moscow]], brought the icon to [[Moscow]]. While unconfirmed, there exists another version that the icon was transferred to the Great Prince of Moscow from [[prince of Halych]] who received it sometime ago as a present from Byzantine Emperors. Regardless of its past history, the fact states that Ivan III blessed his daughter [[Helena of Moscow]] with the icon when he gave her out in marriage for the [[Great Prince of Lithuania]] [[Alexander Jagiellon]].

It belongs to the [[Order of Saint Basil the Great]] and the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. \n\nThe church is dedicated to the [[Holy Trinity]]. Beside this church, the monastery compound contains a fortified entrance gate, a university, a hotel complex for visitors, monastic cells including the Konrad's cell. The church is surrounded by adjoining four towers at each corner.\n\nThis monastery is associated with the [[Union of Brest]] personalities like [[Josaphat Kuntsevych]], [[Ruthenian Catholic Archeparchy of Polotsk\u2013Vitebsk|Archbishop of Polatsk]] who took vows here and spent first years of his monastic life, as well as a prominent reformer of the Basilian Order, [[Veliamyn Rutsky]].\n\n==History==\n===The church===\nAccording to a legend, the first wooden church was built in the 14th century by Grand Princess [[Uliana of Tver]], a spouse of the Grand Prince [[Algirdas]]. The church was built in place where in 1347 the Algirdas noblemen Antony, Johan, and Eustachy died as the first martyrs for Christian faith and the first Christian saints in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].\n\nThe first stone church of Holy Trinity with a belfry was built by [[Konstanty Ostrogski]] in 1514 as a token of appreciation for a victory of Polish-Lithuanian forces over Muscovite troops near Orsha ([[Battle of Orsha]]). The original church was built in Gothic style. In first half of the 17th century to the church were added three chapels. In 1609 on an edict of the [[King of Poland]] [[Sigismund III Vasa]] the church and monastery was transferred to the Basialian Order.<ref>Yurko, I.

In the chapel's [[crypt]] were buried father of the founder, Theodor Skumin-Tyszkiewicz (d.1618), the founder himself, and his wife, Barbara Naruszewicz (d.1627). In the chapel is preserved her marble gravestone, a work of Italian masters. Nowadays in the chapel are constantly held liturgies in [[Byzantine rite]].\n\nThe second chapel that is located to the left of main entrance called ''St.Luke'' was built in 1622 on the funds of Eustachy Korsak-Ho\u0142ubicki, a big supporter of the Union ([[Union of Brest]]). Beside its founder, in the crypt underneath the chapel rest his sons Ivan and Grigori. To this noble family of Korsaks belongs archimandrite the Basilian monastery of Vilnius [[Rafajil Korsak|Rafajil Mykola Korsak]], later &ndash; a proto-archimandrite of the Basilian Order, Metropolitan of Kiev for Eastern-rite Catholics.\n\nThe third chapel is called ''Exaltation of the True and Life-creating Cross of our Lord''. The founder of this chapel with a family crypt was a scribe of Grand Duchy of Lithuania Jan Kolenda in 1628.\n\nIn the church survived valuable tombstones. Unique landmark of the Renaissance epoch in Lithuania is a tombstone of Vilna [[Burgomaster]] Othanasius Braha and his son Antony with a coat of arms, Cyrillic inscription and rich floral ornament dated 1576. Draws attention a tombstone of Jelenski sisters with sentimental inscription which comes from 1758.\n\nIn 1670 significant funds to renew the church contributed [[Great Hetman of Lithuania]] [[Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Pac]] and Great Treasurer Hieronymus Kryszpin-Kirchenstein, particularly towards the altar of Saint [[Josaphat Kuntsevych]].\n\nThe [[Basilian monks]] were banished from the monastery in 1821 and the wing of the men's monastery was converted into a prison.<ref name=\"vienuolynai\">{{cite web |title=Vilniaus buv\u0119s bazilijon\u0173 vienuolynas ir \u0160v\u010d.

According to a legend, the icon was written by St.[[Luke the Evangelist]] and for long years it was an ancestral relic of Greek emperors in [[Constantinople]]. It is believed that a niece of the last Byzantine Emperor, [[Sophia Palaiologina]] who married the [[Great Prince of Muscovy]] [[Ivan III of Moscow]], brought the icon to [[Moscow]]. While unconfirmed, there exists another version that the icon was transferred to the Great Prince of Moscow from [[prince of Halych]] who received it sometime ago as a present from Byzantine Emperors. Regardless of its past history, the fact states that Ivan III blessed his daughter [[Helena of Moscow]] with the icon when he gave her out in marriage for the [[Great Prince of Lithuania]] [[Alexander Jagiellon]]. The icon was brought to the capital of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and received name of Vilna. In 1866 during restoration, it was discovered that the top level is egg based [[tempera]] paint indicating very old origin of the icon.

Tensions grew in Wilmington and other areas because of a shortage of supplies; Confederate currency had no value and the South was impoverished at the end of the long war.\n\nIn 1868, North Carolina ratified the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], resulting in the recognition of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], and in the state legislature and governorship falling under Republican rule. Democrats greatly resented this \"radical\" change, which they deemed as being brought about by blacks, Unionist [[carpetbagger]]s, and [[race traitor]]s.<ref name=NCPedia>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of North Carolina|title=Convention of 1875 |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/government/convention-1875|year=2006|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|editor=William S.

Many white Democrats had been embittered since the Confederacy's defeat. Insurgent veterans joined the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), which orchestrated considerable violence at elections in order to suppress the black vote.\n\nDemocrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870. After the KKK was suppressed by the federal government through the [[Force Act of 1870]], new [[paramilitary]] groups arose in the South. By 1874, chapters of [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a [[paramilitary]] arm of the Democratic Party, had formed in North Carolina.\n\nDemocrats developed a plan to reverse \"home rule,\" meaning local officials would no longer be elected, but appointed by the state.  They began circumventing legislation by taking over the state's judiciary, and adopted 30 amendments to the state constitution including lowering the number of judges on the state supreme court, putting the lower courts and local governments under the control of the state legislature, rescinding the votes of certain types of criminals, mandating segregated public schools, outlawing interracial relationships and granting the General Assembly the power to modify or nullify any local government.<ref name=NCPedia/> By adopting these things, the Democrats became identified as would-be bastions for white Americans.<ref name=NCPedia/>  However, their control was largely limited to the western part of the state, within counties where, demographically, there were few blacks.<ref name=NCPedia/>\n\nAs the Democrats chipped away at Republican rule, things came to a head with the 1876 gubernatorial campaign of [[Zebulon Baird Vance|Zebulon B. Vance]], a former Confederate soldier and governor.  Vance called the Republican party \"begotten by a scalawag out of a mulatto and born in an outhouse.\"  Through Vance, the Democrats saw their biggest opening to begin implementing their agenda in the eastern part of the state.<ref name=NNC>{{cite book|last=Avedis Logan|first=Frenise A.|title=The Negro in North Carolina, 1876-1894|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/government/convention-1875|pages=8\u201310|year=1964|publisher=University of North Carolina Press}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in that region, poor white cotton farmers, fed up with the capitalism of big banks and railroad companies \u2013 high freight rates and [[Laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]] \u2013 aligned themselves with the labor movement.

They also began trying to dismantle the Democratic stronghold in the less-populated western part of the state, that allowed the Democrats more political power through gerrymandering.<ref name=Betrayed2/>  And, they encouraged blacks to vote, which was an estimated 120,000 Republican sympathizers.<ref name=Betrayed2/>\n\nBy 1898, Wilmington's key political power was in the hands of \"The Big Four\", who were representative of the Fusion party \u2013 the mayor, Dr. Silas P.

The Ring wielded political power using patronage, money, and an effective press through the ''Wilmington Post'' and ''The Daily Record''.<ref name=Ring/>\n\nThis shift and consolidation of power horrified white Democrats, who contested the new laws, taking their grievances to the state Supreme Court, which did not rule in their favor. Defeated at the polls and in the courtroom, the Democrats, desperate to avoid another loss, became aware of discord between the Fusion alliance of black Republicans and white Populists, although it appeared that the Fusionists would sweep the upcoming elections of 1898, if voters voted on the issues.<ref name=NewYorker/><ref name=NO/><ref name=Betrayed2/><ref name=Cracks>{{cite book|last=Crow|first=Jeffrey J.|title=Cracking the Solid South: Populism and the Fusionist Interlude|year=1984|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|editors=Lindsey Butler and Alan Watson}}</ref>\n\n====Issues====\nThe economic issues, on which the Fusion party built its alliance, included:\n[[File:Survival of the Fittest.jpg|thumb|right|The gold standard triumphant, [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'' magazine]]]]\n\n#'''[[Free silver|Free Coinage]]''': Currency reform was an emotional issue and the Fusionists built a pragmatic political coalition around it.

However, after the War, when most whites were in debt, it created a recognition of a community.<ref name=Debt/>  The community then began to band together to push for political and economic reforms, and negotiated for favorable rates. Conversely, blacks deemed debt another form of slavery, one that was immoral, and sought to avoid it.<ref name=Debt/> They were often subject to high, non-negotiable interest rates. Recognizing that poor whites \u2013 who advocated doing away with credit systems altogether, in favor of a \"pure-cash\" system \u2013 had an incentive to keep debt low, and that poor blacks were less well off than poor whites, Fusionists sought a platform to align their interests.<ref name=Debt/> By 1892, poor whites were incensed at Zebulon Vance and the Democrats, who had pledged to stand with the Farmers Alliance on the issue of debt but had failed to do anything about the issue. In July 1890, Eugene Beddingfield, an influential member of the North Carolina State Farmers Alliance, had warned Vance about the extent of their anger:\n\n:{{quote|text=The people are very restless.

She advocated that white men should resort to vigilante justice as a way for them to restore that protection:\n\n{{quote|When there is not enough religion in the pulpit to organize a crusade against sin; nor justice in the court house to promptly punish crime; nor manhood enough in the nation to put a sheltering arm about innocence and virtue \u2013 if it needs lynching to protect woman's dearest possession from the ravening human beasts \u2013 then I say lynch, a thousand times a week if necessary.<ref name=Ring/>|Mrs. W. H. Felton, August 11, 1897}}\n\nIn response to Felton's speech, and the danger it imposed upon black men, 32-year-old Alexander Manly wrote an editorial, refuting it and addressing white women having consensual sex with black men:\n\n{{quote|A Mrs. Felton from Georgia, makes a speech before the Agricultural Society, at Tybee, Ga., in which she advocates lynching as an extreme measure. This woman makes a strong plea for womanhood and if the alleged crimes of rape were half so frequent as is oftimes reported, her plea would be worthy of consideration.\n\nMrs. Felton, like many other so-called Christians, loses sight of the basic principle of the religion of Christ in her plea for one class of people as against another ...\n\nMrs. Felton begins well for she admits that education will better protect the girls on the farm from the assaulter. This we admit and it should not be confined to the white any more than to the colored girls. The papers are filled often with reports of rapes of white women and the subsequent lynchings of the alleged rapists. The editors pour forth volumes of aspersions against all Negroes because of the few who may be guilty. If the papers and speakers of the other race would condemn the commission of the crime because it is crime and not try to make it appear that the Negroes were the only criminals, they would find their strongest allies in the intelligent Negroes themselves; and together the whites and blacks would root the evil out of both races.\n\nWe suggest that the whites guard their women more closely, as Mrs. Felton says, thus giving no opportunity for the human fiend, be he white or black. You leave your goods out of doors and then complain because they are taken away. Poor white men are careless in the matter of protecting their women, especially on the farms. They are careless of their conduct toward them and our experience teaches us that the women of that race are not any more particular in the matter of clandestine meetings with colored men than are the white men with colored women. Meetings of this kind go on for some time until the woman's infatuation, or the man's boldness, bring attention to them, and the man is lynched for rape. Every Negro lynched is called a \"big burly, black brute\", when in fact many ... were sufficiently attractive for white girls of culture and refinement to fall in love with them as is very well known to all.\n\nMrs. Felton must begin at the fountain head if she wishes to purify the stream.  Teach your men purity. Let virtue be something more than an excuse for them to intimidate and torture a helpless people. Tell your men that it is no worse for a black man to be intimate with a white woman than for the white man to be intimate with a colored woman.\n\nYou set yourselves down as a lot of carping hypocrites in fact you cry aloud for the virtue of your women while you seek to destroy the morality of ours. Don't ever think that your women will remain pure while you are debauching ours.

All shades of political beliefs were represented: but in the presence of what they believed to be an overwhelming crisis, they brushed aside the great principles that divide parties and individuals, and stood together as one man.

It was not the wild and freakish organization of irresponsible men, but the deliberate action of determined citizens ... Military preparations, so extensive as to suggest assault from some foreign foe, must have had unusual inspiration and definite purpose.\n\nThe fiat had gone forth; and it was expected that the Negroes, when they learned that the right of suffrage was to be denied them, would resist. From their churches and from their lodges had come reports of incendiary speeches, of impassioned appeals to the blacks to use the bullet that had no respect for color, and the kerosene and torch that would play havoc with the white man's cotton in bale and ware house. It was this fear of the Negro uprising in defence of his electorate \u2014 of a forcible and revengeful retaliation \u2014 that offered an ostensible ground for the general display of arms; but if the truth be told, the reason thus offered was little more than a fortunate excuse. The whites had determined to regain their supremacy; and the wholesale armament was intended to convey to the blacks an earnest of this decision. There would have been rapid-fire guns and Winchester rifles if every church had held a silent pulpit, and every lodge-room where the Negroes met had been empty.

We are prepared to treat the Negroes with justice in all matters which do not involve sacrifice of the intelligent and progressive portion of the community. But are equally prepared now and immediately to enforce what we know to be our rights. \n# That we have been, in our desire for harmony and peace, blinded both to our interests and our rights. A climax was reached when the Negro paper of this city published an article so vile and slanderous that it would in most communities have resulted in a lynching, and yet there is no punishment, provided by the courts, adequate for the offense. We, therefore, owe it to the people of this community and city, as protection against such license in the future, that \"The Record\" cease to be published and that its editor be banished from this community.\n# We demand that he leave the city forever within 24 hours after the issuance of this Proclamation. Second, that the printing press from which \"The Record\" has been issued be shipped from the city without delay; that we be notified within 12 hours of the acceptance or rejection of this demand.\n\nIf the demand is agreed to, we counsel forbearance on the part of the white men.

J. Allen Kirk gave this statement about the experience:\n\n{{quote|It was a great sight to see them marching from death, and the colored women, colored men, colored children, colored enterprises and colored people all exposed to death. Firing began, and it seemed like a mighty battle in war time. The shrieks and screams of children, of mothers, of wives were heard, such as caused the blood of the most inhuman person to creep. Thousands of women, children and men rushed to the swamps and there lay upon the earth in the cold to freeze and starve. The woods were filled with colored people. The streets were dotted with their dead bodies. A white gentleman said that he saw ten bodies lying in the undertakers office at one time. Some of their bodies were left lying in the streets until up in the next day following the riot. Some were found by the stench and miasma that came forth from their decaying bodies under their houses. Every colored man who passed through the streets had either to be guarded by one of the crowd or have a paper (pass) giving him the right to pass. All colored men at the cotton press and oil mills were ordered not to leave their labor but stop there, while their wives and children were shrieking and crying in the midst of the flying balls and in sight of the cannons and Gatling gun. All the white people had gone out of that part of the City, this army of men marched through the streets, sword buckled to their sides, giving the command to fire. Men stood at their labor wringing their hands and weeping, but they dare not move to the protection of their homes. And then when they passed through the streets had to hold up their hands and be searched. The little white boys of the city searched them and took from them every means of defence, and if they resisted, they were shot down ... The city was under military rule; no Negro was allowed to come  into the city without being examined or without passing through with his boss, for whom he labored. Colored women were examined and their hats taken off and search was made even under their clothing. They went from house to house looking for Negroes that they considered offensive; took arms they had hidden and killed them for the least expression of manhood. They gathered around colored homes, firing like great sportsmen firing at rabbits in an open field and when one would jump his man, from sixty to one hundred shots would be turned loose upon him. His escape was impossible. One fellow was walking along a railroad and they shot him down without any provocation. It is said by an eye witness that men lay upon the street dead and dying, while members of their race walked by helpless and unable to do them any good or their families. Negro stores were closed and the owners thereof driven out of the city and even shipped away at the point of the gun. Some of the churches were searched for ammunition, and cannons turned toward the door in the attitude of blowing up the church if the pastor or officers did not open them that they might go through.<ref name=Herald>{{cite news|author=J.

Rountree went on to chair a special joint committee overseeing the disenfranchisement amendment, a committee that existed to circumvent the U.S. Constitution which, in fact, granted blacks the right to vote.<ref name=Betrayed2/>\n\nThe legislature passed a law requiring new voters to pay a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]], and passed a state constitutional amendment requiring prospective voters to demonstrate, to local elected officials, that they could read and write any section of the Constitution \u2013 practices that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|discriminated against]] poor whites, and more than 50,000 black men.<ref name=Disenfranchise>{{cite news|title=NORTH CAROLINA BOURBON PLANS.; USING THE POLL TAX QUESTION AND PROHIBITION TO FURTHER DEMOCRATIC SCHEMES.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/02/22/98912374.pdf|date=February 22, 1881|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>  However, to make sure that as few poor whites as possible would be hurt by the law, and prevented from voting Democrat, Rountree invoked a \"[[Grandfather clause]]\". The clause guaranteed the right to register and vote, bypassing the literacy requirement, if the voter, or a voter's lineal ancestor, was eligible to vote in his state of residence prior to January 1, 1867.

He painted the white mob not as murderous lawbreakers, but as peaceful, law-abiding citizens who simply wanted to restore law and order. He also portrayed any violence committed by whites as either being accidental or executed in self-defense, effectively laying blame on both sides:<ref name=NewYorker/><ref name=NO/>\n\n{{quote|Demand was made for the negroes to reply to our ultimatum to them [to destroy the black newspaper and leave town forever, or have it destroyed/be removed by force], and their reply was delayed or sent astray (whether purposely or not, I do not know), and that caused all the trouble. The people came to me. Although two other men were in command, they demanded that I should lead them. I took my Winchester rifle, assumed my position at the head of the procession, and marched to the \"Record\" office. We designed merely to destroy the press. I took a couple of men to the door, when our demand to open was not answered, and burst it in. Not I personally, for I have not the strength, but those with me did it.\n\nWe wrecked the [newspaper] house. I believe that the fire which occurred was purely accidental; it certainly was unintentional on our part ... ''\n\nI then marched the column back through the streets down to the armory, lined them up, and stood on the stoop and made a speech to them. I said: \"Now you have performed the duty which you called on me to lead you to perform. now let us go quietly to our homes, and about our business, and obey the law, unless we are forced, in self-defense, to do other wise.\" I came home ... In about an hour, or less time, the trouble commenced over in the other end of town, by the negroes starting to come over here. I was not there at the time ...\n\nThen they got seven of the negro leaders, brought them downtown, and put them in jail. I had been elected mayor by that time. It was certainly the strangest performance in American history, though we literally followed the law, as the Fusionists made it themselves. There has not been a single illegal act committed in the change of government. Simply, the old board went out, and the new board came in \u2014 strictly according to law. In regard to those men who had been brought to the jail a crowd said that they intended to destroy them; that they were the leaders, and that they were going to take the men out of the jail ... I stayed up the whole night myself, and the forces stayed up all night, and we saved those wretched creatures' lives.\n\nI waited until next morning at nine o'clock and then I made the troops form a hollow square in front of the jail. We placed the scoundrels in the midst of the square and marched them to the railroad station. I bought and gave them tickets to Richmond, and told them to go and to never show up again. That bunch were all negroes ...\n\nThe negroes here have always professed to have faith in me. When I made the speech in the Opera House they were astounded. One of the leaders said: \"My God! when so conservative a man as Colonel Waddell talks about filling the river with dead niggers, I want to get out of town!\"  Since this trouble many negroes have come to me and said they are glad I have taken charge ...\n\nAs to the government we have established, it is a perfectly legal one. The law, passed by the Republican Legislature itself, has been complied with. There was no intimidation used in the establishment of the present city government. The old government had become satisfied of their inefficiency and utterly helpless imbecility, and believed if they did not resign they would be run out of town ...\n\nI believe the negroes are as much rejoiced as the white people that order has been evolved out of chaos.<ref name=Atlantic/><ref>Alfred M.

'Essentially, it crippled a segment of our population that hasn't recovered in 106 years,' said [[Harper Peterson]], former mayor of Wilmington and commission member.\" According to Umfleet, \"massacre\", rather than \"riot\", \"does apply.

They quoted white supremacist governor [[Charles Aycock]], who was \"passionately interested in good government\", on \"the menace of negro suffrage\": \"[T]he only hope of good government in North Carolina, and the other Southern States, rested upon the assured political supremacy of the white race\".

Tensions grew in Wilmington and other areas because of a shortage of supplies; Confederate currency had no value and the South was impoverished at the end of the long war.\n\nIn 1868, North Carolina ratified the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], resulting in the recognition of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], and in the state legislature and governorship falling under Republican rule.

Many white Democrats had been embittered since the Confederacy's defeat. Insurgent veterans joined the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), which orchestrated considerable violence at elections in order to suppress the black vote.\n\nDemocrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870. After the KKK was suppressed by the federal government through the [[Force Act of 1870]], new [[paramilitary]] groups arose in the South. By 1874, chapters of [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a [[paramilitary]] arm of the Democratic Party, had formed in North Carolina.\n\nDemocrats developed a plan to reverse \"home rule,\" meaning local officials would no longer be elected, but appointed by the state.  They began circumventing legislation by taking over the state's judiciary, and adopted 30 amendments to the state constitution including lowering the number of judges on the state supreme court, putting the lower courts and local governments under the control of the state legislature, rescinding the votes of certain types of criminals, mandating segregated public schools, outlawing interracial relationships and granting the General Assembly the power to modify or nullify any local government.<ref name=NCPedia/> By adopting these things, the Democrats became identified as would-be bastions for white Americans.<ref name=NCPedia/>  However, their control was largely limited to the western part of the state, within counties where, demographically, there were few blacks.<ref name=NCPedia/>\n\nAs the Democrats chipped away at Republican rule, things came to a head with the 1876 gubernatorial campaign of [[Zebulon Baird Vance|Zebulon B.

August 24, 1898.]]\nFor some time, Josephus Daniels had used Wilmington as a symbol of \"Negro domination\" because its government was biracial, ignoring the fact that it was dominated by a two-thirds white majority.  Many newspapers published pictures and stories implying that African-American men were sexually attacking white women in the city.<ref name=\"McLaurin\"/> This belief was championed throughout the country following a speech by [[Rebecca Latimer Felton]], a prominent [[Women's suffrage|women's suffragist]], and wife of Georgia populist [[William H. Felton]], at the Georgia Agricultural Society, about the problems farm wives faced.<ref name=Ring/> She stressed that, of all the threats farm wives face, there was none greater than \"the black rapist\", due to the failure of white men to protect them. She advocated that white men should resort to vigilante justice as a way for them to restore that protection:\n\n{{quote|When there is not enough religion in the pulpit to organize a crusade against sin; nor justice in the court house to promptly punish crime; nor manhood enough in the nation to put a sheltering arm about innocence and virtue \u2013 if it needs lynching to protect woman's dearest possession from the ravening human beasts \u2013 then I say lynch, a thousand times a week if necessary.<ref name=Ring/>|Mrs. W. H. Felton, August 11, 1897}}\n\nIn response to Felton's speech, and the danger it imposed upon black men, 32-year-old Alexander Manly wrote an editorial, refuting it and addressing white women having consensual sex with black men:\n\n{{quote|A Mrs. Felton from Georgia, makes a speech before the Agricultural Society, at Tybee, Ga., in which she advocates lynching as an extreme measure. This woman makes a strong plea for womanhood and if the alleged crimes of rape were half so frequent as is oftimes reported, her plea would be worthy of consideration.\n\nMrs. Felton, like many other so-called Christians, loses sight of the basic principle of the religion of Christ in her plea for one class of people as against another ...\n\nMrs. Felton begins well for she admits that education will better protect the girls on the farm from the assaulter. This we admit and it should not be confined to the white any more than to the colored girls. The papers are filled often with reports of rapes of white women and the subsequent lynchings of the alleged rapists. The editors pour forth volumes of aspersions against all Negroes because of the few who may be guilty. If the papers and speakers of the other race would condemn the commission of the crime because it is crime and not try to make it appear that the Negroes were the only criminals, they would find their strongest allies in the intelligent Negroes themselves; and together the whites and blacks would root the evil out of both races.\n\nWe suggest that the whites guard their women more closely, as Mrs. Felton says, thus giving no opportunity for the human fiend, be he white or black. You leave your goods out of doors and then complain because they are taken away. Poor white men are careless in the matter of protecting their women, especially on the farms. They are careless of their conduct toward them and our experience teaches us that the women of that race are not any more particular in the matter of clandestine meetings with colored men than are the white men with colored women. Meetings of this kind go on for some time until the woman's infatuation, or the man's boldness, bring attention to them, and the man is lynched for rape. Every Negro lynched is called a \"big burly, black brute\", when in fact many ... were sufficiently attractive for white girls of culture and refinement to fall in love with them as is very well known to all.\n\nMrs. Felton must begin at the fountain head if she wishes to purify the stream.  Teach your men purity. Let virtue be something more than an excuse for them to intimidate and torture a helpless people. Tell your men that it is no worse for a black man to be intimate with a white woman than for the white man to be intimate with a colored woman.\n\nYou set yourselves down as a lot of carping hypocrites in fact you cry aloud for the virtue of your women while you seek to destroy the morality of ours. Don't ever think that your women will remain pure while you are debauching ours.

He and supporters moved his entire press from the corner of Water Street and Princess Street to a frame building on Seventh Street between Ann and Nun.  He had planned to move to Love and Charity Hall (aka Ruth Hall), on South Seventh Street, but it declined to take him as a tenant because his presence would have greatly increased the building's insurance rate.

West, went to Wilmington to cover the White Supremacy Campaign. He wrote:\n\n{{quote|In Wilmington, I found a very remarkable condition of affairs. The city might have been preparing for a siege instead of an election ... All shades of political beliefs were represented: but in the presence of what they believed to be an overwhelming crisis, they brushed aside the great principles that divide parties and individuals, and stood together as one man. When I emphasize the fact, that every block in every ward was thus organized, and that the precautionary meetings were attended by ministers, lawyers, doctors, merchants, railroad officials, cotton exporters, and, indeed, by the reputable, taxpaying, substantial men of the city, the extent and significance of this armed movement can, perhaps, be realized. It was not the wild and freakish organization of irresponsible men, but the deliberate action of determined citizens ... Military preparations, so extensive as to suggest assault from some foreign foe, must have had unusual inspiration and definite purpose.\n\nThe fiat had gone forth; and it was expected that the Negroes, when they learned that the right of suffrage was to be denied them, would resist. From their churches and from their lodges had come reports of incendiary speeches, of impassioned appeals to the blacks to use the bullet that had no respect for color, and the kerosene and torch that would play havoc with the white man's cotton in bale and ware house. It was this fear of the Negro uprising in defence of his electorate \u2014 of a forcible and revengeful retaliation \u2014 that offered an ostensible ground for the general display of arms; but if the truth be told, the reason thus offered was little more than a fortunate excuse. The whites had determined to regain their supremacy; and the wholesale armament was intended to convey to the blacks an earnest of this decision. There would have been rapid-fire guns and Winchester rifles if every church had held a silent pulpit, and every lodge-room where the Negroes met had been empty. White supremacy, therefore, was the magnet that attracted, the tie that bound, the one overwhelming force that dominated everything.<ref name=RaceWarInNC/>}}\n\nThe Democrats hired two detectives to investigate the rumors, including one black detective.

Every colored man who passed through the streets had either to be guarded by one of the crowd or have a paper (pass) giving him the right to pass.

All the white people had gone out of that part of the City, this army of men marched through the streets, sword buckled to their sides, giving the command to fire. Men stood at their labor wringing their hands and weeping, but they dare not move to the protection of their homes. And then when they passed through the streets had to hold up their hands and be searched. The little white boys of the city searched them and took from them every means of defence, and if they resisted, they were shot down ...

They went from house to house looking for Negroes that they considered offensive; took arms they had hidden and killed them for the least expression of manhood. They gathered around colored homes, firing like great sportsmen firing at rabbits in an open field and when one would jump his man, from sixty to one hundred shots would be turned loose upon him. His escape was impossible. One fellow was walking along a railroad and they shot him down without any provocation. It is said by an eye witness that men lay upon the street dead and dying, while members of their race walked by helpless and unable to do them any good or their families. Negro stores were closed and the owners thereof driven out of the city and even shipped away at the point of the gun. Some of the churches were searched for ammunition, and cannons turned toward the door in the attitude of blowing up the church if the pastor or officers did not open them that they might go through.<ref name=Herald>{{cite news|author=J.

Rountree went on to chair a special joint committee overseeing the disenfranchisement amendment, a committee that existed to circumvent the U.S. Constitution which, in fact, granted blacks the right to vote.<ref name=Betrayed2/>\n\nThe legislature passed a law requiring new voters to pay a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]], and passed a state constitutional amendment requiring prospective voters to demonstrate, to local elected officials, that they could read and write any section of the Constitution \u2013 practices that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|discriminated against]] poor whites, and more than 50,000 black men.<ref name=Disenfranchise>{{cite news|title=NORTH CAROLINA BOURBON PLANS.; USING THE POLL TAX QUESTION AND PROHIBITION TO FURTHER DEMOCRATIC SCHEMES.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/02/22/98912374.pdf|date=February 22, 1881|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>  However, to make sure that as few poor whites as possible would be hurt by the law, and prevented from voting Democrat, Rountree invoked a \"[[Grandfather clause]]\". The clause guaranteed the right to register and vote, bypassing the literacy requirement, if the voter, or a voter's lineal ancestor, was eligible to vote in his state of residence prior to January 1, 1867.  This excluded practically any black man from voting.<ref name=Grandfather>{{cite web|author=James L.

They also passed laws mandating racial segregation of public facilities, and martial law-like impositions on African Americans.  The [[US Supreme Court]] (at the time) upheld such measures.\n\n===Election of 1900===\nTwo years after the coup, the Democrats again ran on \"negro domination\" with disenfranchisement of blacks on the ballot.

The article, \"The Story of The Wilmington, North Carolina, Race Riots\" included the first known use of the term \"race riot\".<ref name=TPM>{{cite news|last=Railton|first=Ben|title=What We Talk About When We Talk About 'Race Riots'|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/race-riots|date=November 25, 2014|newspaper=Talking Points Memo}}</ref><ref name=Yahoo>{{cite news|last=Perkiss|first=Abagail|title=The language of protest: Race, rioting, and the memory of Ferguson|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/language-protest-talk-talk-ferguson-100609505.html|date=December 3, 2014|newspaper=Yahoo News}}</ref>\n\nDespite vowing to \"choke the Cape Fear River with carcasses\", and the fact that some members of the white mob posed for a photograph in front of the charred remnants of ''The Daily Record,'' in the article Waddell painted himself as a reluctant, non-violent leader \u2013 or accidental hero \u2013 \"called upon\" to lead under \"intolerable conditions\".  He painted the white mob not as murderous lawbreakers, but as peaceful, law-abiding citizens who simply wanted to restore law and order. He also portrayed any violence committed by whites as either being accidental or executed in self-defense, effectively laying blame on both sides:<ref name=NewYorker/><ref name=NO/>\n\n{{quote|Demand was made for the negroes to reply to our ultimatum to them [to destroy the black newspaper and leave town forever, or have it destroyed/be removed by force], and their reply was delayed or sent astray (whether purposely or not, I do not know), and that caused all the trouble. The people came to me. Although two other men were in command, they demanded that I should lead them. I took my Winchester rifle, assumed my position at the head of the procession, and marched to the \"Record\" office. We designed merely to destroy the press. I took a couple of men to the door, when our demand to open was not answered, and burst it in. Not I personally, for I have not the strength, but those with me did it.\n\nWe wrecked the [newspaper] house. I believe that the fire which occurred was purely accidental; it certainly was unintentional on our part ... ''\n\nI then marched the column back through the streets down to the armory, lined them up, and stood on the stoop and made a speech to them. I said: \"Now you have performed the duty which you called on me to lead you to perform. now let us go quietly to our homes, and about our business, and obey the law, unless we are forced, in self-defense, to do other wise.\" I came home ... In about an hour, or less time, the trouble commenced over in the other end of town, by the negroes starting to come over here. I was not there at the time ...\n\nThen they got seven of the negro leaders, brought them downtown, and put them in jail. I had been elected mayor by that time. It was certainly the strangest performance in American history, though we literally followed the law, as the Fusionists made it themselves. There has not been a single illegal act committed in the change of government. Simply, the old board went out, and the new board came in \u2014 strictly according to law. In regard to those men who had been brought to the jail a crowd said that they intended to destroy them; that they were the leaders, and that they were going to take the men out of the jail ... I stayed up the whole night myself, and the forces stayed up all night, and we saved those wretched creatures' lives.\n\nI waited until next morning at nine o'clock and then I made the troops form a hollow square in front of the jail. We placed the scoundrels in the midst of the square and marched them to the railroad station. I bought and gave them tickets to Richmond, and told them to go and to never show up again. That bunch were all negroes ...\n\nThe negroes here have always professed to have faith in me. When I made the speech in the Opera House they were astounded. One of the leaders said: \"My God! when so conservative a man as Colonel Waddell talks about filling the river with dead niggers, I want to get out of town!\"  Since this trouble many negroes have come to me and said they are glad I have taken charge ...\n\nAs to the government we have established, it is a perfectly legal one. The law, passed by the Republican Legislature itself, has been complied with. There was no intimidation used in the establishment of the present city government.

When a young Andrews was taken by her parents to be examined by a [[ENT specialist|throat specialist]], the doctor concluded that she had \"an almost adult [[larynx]].\"<ref name=\":0\" /> In spite of the fact that her voice teacher, English soprano [[Lilian Stiles-Allen]], continually encouraged her to pursue opera, Andrews herself felt that her voice was unsuited for the genre and \"too big a stretch\". At the time, Andrews described her own voice as \"extremely high and thin\", feeling that it lacked \"the necessary guts and weight for opera\", preferring musical theatre instead. As Andrews aged, so did her voice, which began to naturally deepen. Losing her vast upper register, her \"top notes\" became increasingly difficult to sing while \"her middle register matured into the warm golden tone\" for which she has become known, according to Tim Wong of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/timwong/100075040/julie-andrews-the-operatic-sensation-that-never-was/|title = Julie Andrews, the operatic sensation that never was|date = 26 May 2014|accessdate = 23 August 2014|website = The Daily Telegraphy|publisher = Telegraph Media Group Limited|last = Wong|first = Tim|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306122658/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/timwong/100075040/julie-andrews-the-operatic-sensation-that-never-was/|archive-date = 6 March 2016|url-status=dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMusically, Andrews had always preferred singing music that was \"bright and sunny\", choosing to avoid songs that were sad, depressing, upsetting, or written in a minor key, for fear of losing her voice \"in a mess of emotion\".

Wells, mmn = Morris</ref> in Surrey. In 1940, Ted Wells sent young Julia to live with her mother and stepfather, whom the elder Wells thought would be better able to provide for his talented daughter's artistic training. According to Julie Andrews' 2008 autobiography ''Home'', while Julie had been used to calling Ted Andrews \"Uncle Ted\", her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as \"Pop\", while her father remained \"Dad\" or \"Daddy\" to her. Julie disliked this change.\n\nThe Andrews family was \"very poor\" and they \"lived in a bad [[slum]] area of London,\" Andrews recalled, adding, \"That was a very black period in my life.\" According to Andrews, her stepfather was violent and an alcoholic.<ref name=\"Brockes2008-03-30\" /> Ted Andrews twice, while drunk, tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter, resulting in Andrews fitting a lock on her door.<ref name=\"Brockes2008-03-30\" /> As the stage career of Ted and Barbara Andrews improved, they were able to afford better surroundings, first to [[Beckenham]] and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews' hometown of [[Hersham]].

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Camp would not attend the trip East due to ill health.  Another important event to note is the football teams of Rush Medical College and Lake Forest combining for the remainder of the 1895 season.  Rush would bolster the Lake Forest ranks, while also attempting Lake Forest's reportedly impossible schedule of [[1895 Northwestern Purple football team|Northwestern]], [[1895 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], who at the time had a combined record of 9-3, with Michigan undefeated.

They had even lost to the minor team Amour, 6 to 0, and so when a merger was proposed between them and Rush, the agreement was made.

The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.

Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.

It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.

CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] (all retroactively).\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

CAA also began preparation for their journey to the east, and sent out the first roster of those going.

Camp would not attend the trip East due to ill health.  Another important event to note is the football teams of Rush Medical College and Lake Forest combining for the remainder of the 1895 season.  Rush would bolster the Lake Forest ranks, while also attempting Lake Forest's reportedly impossible schedule of [[1895 Northwestern Purple football team|Northwestern]], [[1895 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], who at the time had a combined record of 9-3, with Michigan undefeated.  Lake Forest had also just come from contests between the likes of [[1895 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] and [[1895 Chicago Maroons football team|Chicago]], who had beaten them 52 to 0 and 26 to 5 respectively.  They had even lost to the minor team Amour, 6 to 0, and so when a merger was proposed between them and Rush, the agreement was made.

Thomas scores the first Touchdown, followed by Blaney twice to end the first half.  Blaney attained another touchdown at the beginning of the next half, with Thomas also scoring the last touchdown, and Brown rounding out the score to 30 with his impeccable kicking.  Although the score is large, one writer for The Inter Ocean newspaper claimed that CAA played horribly.  He asserted that \"if yesterday's showing is a test of the ability at the game, it [The Chicago AA team] would have to work hard to defeat the Yohokas Pigskin Pelters or any like organization.\"  In other news, the CAA would hold a practice with the Illinois Cycling Club this afternoon, the last practice before their trip east on October 24th at 10:30 A.

Under the watchful eyes of 2800 spectators, CAA had the ball on Newton's 5 yard line, with 35 seconds to go.  First, second, and third down went by with no gain for the Chicago AA Eleven.  With 10 seconds remaining, it was still Chicago's possession, and with one last shove at the Newton Defensive Line, Full Back Brown rolled into the endzone over a mass of players, achieving a walk-off touchdown and subsequent PAT.  The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.  Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player,Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.  Brown also had a good game, and Bartl got injured.  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49425460/chicago-athletes-win-their-game-at/|title=Chicago Athletes Win Their Game at Newton, Mass, 4 To 0.|date=1895-10-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n===October 29: CAA at MIT===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs MIT\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= MIT Engineers\n|V1=24|V2=22\n|H1=0|H2=0\n|Date= October 29, 1895\n|Location= Cambridge, MA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3:30pm\n|ElapsedTime= 40 minutes (two 20 minute halves)\n|Attendance= 500\n|Weather=\n|Referee= F.

The two teams were in poor condition, but MIT was worse, having six substitutes starting, instead of their more experienced players.  The football teams had also played a tie game in 1894, where both organizations were in their prime.  Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.  With 4 minutes left to play the game was called, as MIT had absolutely no chance of recovering the deficit, and were thoroughly defeated.\n\n'''October 31st-''' The Philadelphia Inquirer named Chicago AA,\"strongest eleven in the west, college or otherwise.\"  The game against Penn decided to be at 3:00 in the afternoon, with an admission of 50 cents, and an extra 25 for reserved seating.  It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.  Penn was 10-0, having shut out 9 and outscored their opponents 349 to 6.  Chicago lost that contest 10 to 12, but was the first opponent of the season to scored double digits against the Quakers.\n\n===October 29: CAA at Penn===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs Penn\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= Penn Quakers\n|V1=0|V2=4\n|H1=4|H2=8\n|Date= November 1, 1895\n|Location= Franklin Field, Philadelphia, PA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3pm\n|ElapsedTime= \n|Attendance=\n|Weather=\n|Referee= [[Laurie Bliss]]\n|Umpire= Leonard and Hatfield\n|Injured= \n|Linesmen= Woodruff\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nCAA played rough, dirty in the eyes of some, as they lost to the superior university team of Pennsylvania, 4 to 12. CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] (all retroactively).\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.
