The aim was to replace the troublesome K 12 V 230 DR engine with a less powerful, but more reliable design. After 2000, 9 more locomotives have been supplied to private freight operators in Italy. Four more have been delivered to a Czech private freight company.

The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marian Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter is a spoof of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' when Marian's niece Raven (played by guest [[Bernadette Peters]]) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marian assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marian meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marian forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marian also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marian's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marian who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|Oldest Man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marian's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, ''As My World Still Turns'', actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".

The band was formed in 1965 in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] as '''The Rogues''' and changed their name prior to their first Canadian Top 40 hit \"Opportunity\".\n\nThe band is best known for containing well-known Canadian guitarist [[Domenic Troiano]] who recorded with [[The James Gang]] and [[The Guess Who]] in the Seventies, and drummer [[Pentti Glan]], who later played with [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Lou Reed]] (Glan was the drummer on Reed's 1974 live album, \"[[Rock n Roll Animal]]\").  The band also contained [[Roy Kenner]], who later became the lead singer with the James Gang, both during and after the period when Troiano was lead guitarist with that band.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nMandala's origins can be traced back to The Rogues, the house band at the Club Bluenote in [[Toronto]] during the summer of 1964. Keyboard player Josef Chirowski (born March 2, 1947 in Germany), bass player Don Elliot (born December 8, 1944 in Toronto) and drummer Pentti \"Whitey\" Glan (born July 8, 1946 in Finland) had worked together previously in several outfits, most notably Whitey & The Roulettes, who also contained future [[Luke & The Apostles]] and [[McKenna Mendelson Mainline]] guitarist, [[Mike McKenna (musician)|Mike McKenna]].\n\nThe band adopted the name The Rogues when singer George Olliver (born January 25, 1946 in Toronto) and former Robbie Lane & The Disciples guitarist [[Domenic Troiano]] (born Dominic Michaele Antonio Troiano, January 17, 1946 in Modugno, Italy, naturalized Canadian in 1955) joined in 1965. For a very brief period at the end of 1965, future [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] singer [[David Clayton-Thomas]] also augmented the line up after parting with his previous support band, The Shays.\n\nIn the spring of 1966, The Rogues (minus Clayton-Thomas) briefly became The Five Rogues and consolidated their local reputation with regular appearances on the city's vibrant club scene, playing at venues like the Hawk's Nest, the Club El Mocambo and the Gogue Inn.\n\nOne show at the Gogue Inn, advertised in the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"After Four\" section for May 25, 1966, found the group opening for [[Wilson Pickett]] alongside another local group, R K & The Associates, who featured future Mandala singer [[Roy Kenner]]. During this hectic period, the band also performed throughout Ontario, appearing at notable venues like the Whitby Arena and Oshawa's Jubilee Pavilion.  Around this time, the group also recorded two tracks as demos \u2013 \"I Can't Hold Out No Longer\" and \"I'll Make It Up To You\".\n\n===Five Rogues become Mandala===\nIn mid-September 1966, the group's manager, Rafael Markowitz (aka Randy Martin), a former TV clown, sensed a change in the music scene and decided to reinvent the group's image and name. Mandala is a symbol (a circle within a circle within a circle), which is used by Buddhist monks as an aid to contemplation.\n\nMarkowitz envisioned the band as being a channel for the audience to release its emotions and the newly named outfit, decked in pinstripe, gangster-style suits and aided by strobe lights, returned to the Toronto scene in early October with its \"Soul Crusade\", which was met with mass hysteria.\n\n===Hollywood===\nThe US market soon beckoned and in late November, Mandala made a brief exploratory trip to Los Angeles performing for four nights at the [[Whiskey A Go Go]]. While there, the band played three weekends at the [[Hullabaloo (club)|Hullabaloo]] where they attracted 1,400 fans by word of mouth. On the way home, the group stopped off in Chicago and recorded Troiano's \"Opportunity\" at [[Chess Records|Chess Studios]], with [[The Dells]] providing backing vocals. Issued as Mandala's debut single on [[Decca Records|Decca's]] subsidiary label, KR, \"Opportunity\" swiftly climbed up Toronto's [[CHUM Chart]], peaking at #3 on February 20, 1967.\n\nAfter gigging extensively in the Toronto area throughout the early part of 1967, Mandala travelled to New York in early March for an extended engagement at [[Steve Paul]]'s [[The Scene (performance venue)|The Scene]], alongside folk singer/songwriter [[Eric Andersen]], the shows running from March 6 to April 2.\n\n===Murray the K's Easter Rock Extravaganza===\nWhile in New York, Mandala also participated in [[Murray the K|Murray the K's]] Easter Rock Extravaganza, which was held at [[RKO Pantages Theatre|RKO Theatre]] in Manhattan from March 25 to April 4 and also featured [[The Blues Project]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[The Who]], [[Wilson Pickett]], [[Jim and Jean]], [[Chicago Loop (band)|The Chicago Loop]] and [[Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels]] among others. Following the show, the band joined [[Wilson Pickett]] and [[Mitch Ryder and The Detroit Wheels]] for a number of dates in the New York area before returning to Toronto in early April.\n\nThat same month, KR released a second single, \"Give & Take\", which made #21 on the CHUM chart. The group also began work on its \"Soul Crusade\" album at Toronto Sound but internal differences ground the sessions to a halt.\n\nMandala returned to New York several times over the next few months, performing at Steve Paul's The Scene from April 25-May 5 and for a one-off show on July 18. They also travelled to Montreal to perform at the Garden of Stars from July 30-August 5 during Expo.\n\nHowever, internal differences were starting to pull the group apart. Shortly after another short trip to New York to play Steve Paul's The Scene on September 27, 1967, singer George Olliver left to form his own band. Chirowski also departed at this point to work briefly for Canadian Pacific Railways during the day and perform with The Power Project in the evenings.\n\n===Roy Kenner and Atlantic Records===\nA new line up of the band featuring singer Roy Kenner (born  January 14, 1948 in Toronto) and keyboard player Henry Babraj, from Roy Kenner & The Associates, made its public debut at the Roost in Ottawa on October 8, 1967.\n\nThe following month, Mandala embarked on their fourth US tour, kicking off with a show at the Cheetah in Hollywood. The tour included an appearance at the Swing Auditorium in San Bernardino, California on November 13 alongside [[Buffalo Springfield]] and The Yellow Payges.\n\nIn early 1968, [[Atlantic Records]] chief [[Ahmet Ertegun]] acted on a tip from producer [[Phil Spector]] and bought the group's contract from Decca. With the green light to record, Mandala laid down six tracks at Atlantic Studios, New York in February, including the [[Arif Mardin]] produced single \"Love It-is\", which reached #9 on the CHUM chart when it was released in July.\n\nTwo months later, the band completed sessions for its long-awaited debut album, \"Soul Crusade\" and then remained in the States to tour before returning to Toronto in June, around which time Henry Babraj appears to have left the group.  One or more local Toronto players may have been used for local and regional and U.S. shows but Babraj's permanent replacement was Hugh Sullivan from Mr Paul & The Blues Council, who joined Mandala in the Bahamas. Soon afterwards, the group recorded at least two Coca-Cola commercials.\n\nAs the group seemed on the verge of a major breakthrough disaster struck. In October 1968, Don Elliot was involved in a serious car accident and was forced to leave Mandala leaving the rest of the group to complete a Canadian tour with Sullivan covering bass on keyboards.\n\nMore bad news lay in store. The band's final single, \"You Got Me\", failed to chart while sales for the \"Soul Crusade\" album were disappointing. Shortly after appearing at the Detroit Pop Festival and the Grand Rapids Pop Festival in Michigan during April 1969, the band recruited bass player [[Prakash John]] from The Stone Soul Children but the end was in sight and on June 1, 1969, Mandala played their final show at the Hawk's Nest in Toronto.\n\n==Aftermath==\nBass player Don Elliot subsequently joined [[Leigh Ashford]] and then played in Milestone in the early Seventies.\n\nAfter fronting his group, The Soul Children, original singer George Olliver recorded and toured with Natural Gas in the late Sixties. He then fronted George Olliver and Friends, which also contained former Mandala member, Barry Hutt.\n\nKeyboard player Josef Chirowski meanwhile played with various Toronto bands before becoming a member of the highly respected rock band, [[Crowbar (Canadian band)|Crowbar]].\n\nHugh Sullivan briefly played with [[Merryweather (band)|Merryweather]] while Kenner, Troiano, Glan and John regrouped as [[Bush (Canadian band)|Bush]] and recorded a lone album in 1971.\n\nKenner and Troiano subsequently recorded with [[The James Gang]] in 1972\u20131974, while Chirowski, Glan and John became notable session and touring musicians, playing with the likes of [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Lou Reed]], among others.  Troiano later developed a successful solo career, which included Kenner at various points.  Kenner stayed in and around Toronto, developing an expertise in advertising vocals.  John established the Toronto-based rhythm and blues band, [[The Lincolns]], which continues playing today.\n\nDomenic Troiano died of cancer in 2005. Pentti Glan died in 2017.\n\n==Discography==\n* 45 \u2013 \"Opportunity\" / \"Lost Love\" (KR 0115) \u2013 1967\n* 45 \u2013 \"Give and Take\" / \"From Toronto '67\" (KR 0121) \u2013 1967\n* 45 \u2013 \"Love-Itis\" / \"Mellow Carmello Palumbo\" (Atlantic 2512) \u2013 1968\n* 45 \u2013 \"You Got Me\" / \"Help Me\" (Atlantic 2576) \u2013 1968\n* LP \u2013 ''Soul Crusade'' (Atlantic SD 8184) \u2013 1968\n\n==References==\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n* Article on Mandala at Classic rock page [https://web.archive.org/web/20061016095413/http://www.classicrockpage.com/everheardof/Mandala.htm]\n* \"Los Angeles 'Sun-set' raves over The Mandala\", Toronto Daily Star, December 12, 1966, page 18\n* \"The Soul Sound of The Mandala\", Canadian Teen Magazine, January\u2013February 1967.\n* \"This time, only a few shrieks for the Mandala\", Toronto Daily Star, June 28, 1967, page 36\n* RPM Weekly magazine, week starting November 14, 1967.\n* The Toronto Telegram's \"After Four\" section on Thursdays advertised live gigs for the forthcoming week.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mandala}}\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1965]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1970]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Toronto]]\n[[Category:Canadian rhythm and blues music groups]]\n[[Category:1965 establishments in Ontario]]\n[[Category:1970 disestablishments in Ontario]]\n", "text_old": "{{No footnotes|date=July 2014}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = Mandala\n| image           = Mandala (1967).png\n| image_size      = 250px\n| landscape       = <!-- yes, if wide image, otherwise leave blank -->\n| alt             = \n| caption         = The group in 1967\n| background      = group_or_band\n| alias           = The Rogues\n| origin          = [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada\n| genre           = [[Rhythm and Blues]]\n| years_active    = {{start date|1965}}\u2013{{end date|1970}}\n| label           = \n| associated_acts = \n| website         = <!-- {{URL|example.com}} -->\n| current_members = \n| past_members    = [[Domenic Troiano]]<br/>[[Roy Kenner]]<br/>Joey Chirowski<br/>Don Elliot<br/>George Olliver<br/>[[Pentti Glan]]\n}}\n'''Mandala''' was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] and [[Soul music|soul]] band from the 1960s. The band was formed in 1965 in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] as '''The Rogues''' and changed their name prior to their first Canadian Top 40 hit \"Opportunity\".\n\nThe band is best known for containing well-known Canadian guitarist [[Domenic Troiano]] who recorded with [[The James Gang]] and [[The Guess Who]] in the Seventies, and drummer [[Pentti Glan]], who later played with [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Lou Reed]] (Glan was the drummer on Reed's 1974 live album, \"[[Rock n Roll Animal]]\").  The band also contained [[Roy Kenner]], who later became the lead singer with the James Gang, both during and after the period when Troiano was lead guitarist with that band.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nMandala's origins can be traced back to The Rogues, the house band at the Club Bluenote in [[Toronto]] during the summer of 1964. Keyboard player Josef Chirowski (born March 2, 1947 in Germany), bass player Don Elliot (born December 8, 1944 in Toronto) and drummer Pentti \"Whitey\" Glan (born July 8, 1946 in Finland) had worked together previously in several outfits, most notably Whitey & The Roulettes, who also contained future [[Luke & The Apostles]] and [[McKenna Mendelson Mainline]] guitarist, [[Mike McKenna (musician)|Mike McKenna]].\n\nThe band adopted the name The Rogues when singer George Olliver (born January 25, 1946 in Toronto) and former Robbie Lane & The Disciples guitarist [[Domenic Troiano]] (born Dominic Michaele Antonio Troiano, January 17, 1946 in Modugno, Italy, naturalized Canadian in 1955) joined in 1965. For a very brief period at the end of 1965, future [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] singer [[David Clayton-Thomas]] also augmented the line up after parting with his previous support band, The Shays.\n\nIn the spring of 1966, The Rogues (minus Clayton-Thomas) briefly became The Five Rogues and consolidated their local reputation with regular appearances on the city's vibrant club scene, playing at venues like the Hawk's Nest, the Club El Mocambo and the Gogue Inn.\n\nOne show at the Gogue Inn, advertised in the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"After Four\" section for May 25, 1966, found the group opening for [[Wilson Pickett]] alongside another local group, R K & The Associates, who featured future Mandala singer [[Roy Kenner]]. During this hectic period, the band also performed throughout Ontario, appearing at notable venues like the Whitby Arena and Oshawa's Jubilee Pavilion.  Around this time, the group also recorded two tracks as demos \u2013 \"I Can't Hold Out No Longer\" and \"I'll Make It Up To You\".\n\n===Five Rogues become Mandala===\nIn mid-September 1966, the group's manager, Rafael Markowitz (aka Randy Martin), a former TV clown, sensed a change in the music scene and decided to reinvent the group's image and name. Mandala is a symbol (a circle within a circle within a circle), which is used by Buddhist monks as an aid to contemplation.\n\nMarkowitz envisioned the band as being a channel for the audience to release its emotions and the newly named outfit, decked in pinstripe, gangster-style suits and aided by strobe lights, returned to the Toronto scene in early October with its \"Soul Crusade\", which was met with mass hysteria.\n\n===Hollywood===\nThe US market soon beckoned and in late November, Mandala made a brief exploratory trip to Los Angeles performing for four nights at the [[Whiskey A Go Go]]. While there, the band played three weekends at the [[Hullabaloo (club)|Hullabaloo]] where they attracted 1,400 fans by word of mouth. On the way home, the group stopped off in Chicago and recorded Troiano's \"Opportunity\" at [[Chess Records|Chess Studios]], with [[The Dells]] providing backing vocals. Issued as Mandala's debut single on [[Decca Records|Decca's]] subsidiary label, KR, \"Opportunity\" swiftly climbed up Toronto's [[CHUM Chart]], peaking at #3 on February 20, 1967.\n\nAfter gigging extensively in the Toronto area throughout the early part of 1967, Mandala travelled to New York in early March for an extended engagement at [[Steve Paul]]'s [[The Scene (performance venue)|The Scene]], alongside folk singer/songwriter [[Eric Andersen]], the shows running from March 6 to April 2.\n\n===Murray the K's Easter Rock Extravaganza===\nWhile in New York, Mandala also participated in [[Murray the K|Murray the K's]] Easter Rock Extravaganza, which was held at [[RKO Pantages Theatre|RKO Theatre]] in Manhattan from March 25 to April 4 and also featured [[The Blues Project]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[The Who]], [[Wilson Pickett]], [[Jim and Jean]], [[Chicago Loop (band)|The Chicago Loop]] and [[Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels]] among others.

He is Dylan's longest-running sideman, and has sometimes been characterized as his \"musical director\" as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bassplayer.com/artists/tony-garnier-the-song-whisperer |title=Tony Garnier: The Song Whisperer |last=Jisi |first=Chris |date=2015-05-07 |website=bassplayer.com |publisher=NewBay's Music Group |access-date=2018-12-05 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his work with Dylan, Garnier has recorded with [[Tom Waits]], [[Loudon Wainwright III]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Marc Ribot]], [[Eric Andersen]] and [[Chris O'Connell]], former female singer of [[Asleep at the Wheel]], Western swing band with whom he also played and recorded from 1976 to 1978, and [[The Lounge Lizards]]. He also played with [[Robert Gordon (musician)|Robert Gordon]] in the early 1980s.  He was also a long-time sideman for [[David Johansen]] in his [[Buster Poindexter]] persona, and was also briefly a member of the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' house band.\n\nHis musical heritage descends from the Camelia Brass Band in New Orleans led by his grandfather, D'Jalma Garnier, (also spelled Ganier while with Camelia Brass Band), a legendary early jazz player noted on the Preservation Hall roster in the New Orleans French Quarter. Garnier is one of numerous grandsons descended from D'Jalma Thomas Garnier the New Orleans bandleader, trumpet player, pianist and violinist said to have taught Louis Armstrong at the New Orleans Boys Home for Colored Waifs. Tony Garnier is the younger brother of [[D'Jalma Garnier]] born 1954, the fiddler, composer, guitarist, and \"pedestrian scholar\" of Louisiana Creole fame. The two brothers, along with first cousin Stephen \"Stevo\" Th\u00e9ard, are the only descendants of Papa Garnier to become professional musicians in the legacy of this significant New Orleans musical family.

He also played with [[Robert Gordon (musician)|Robert Gordon]] in the early 1980s.  He was also a long-time sideman for [[David Johansen]] in his [[Buster Poindexter]] persona, and was also briefly a member of the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' house band.\n\nHis musical heritage descends from the Camelia Brass Band in New Orleans led by his grandfather, D'Jalma Garnier, (also spelled Ganier while with Camelia Brass Band), a legendary early jazz player noted on the Preservation Hall roster in the New Orleans French Quarter. Garnier is one of numerous grandsons descended from D'Jalma Thomas Garnier the New Orleans bandleader, trumpet player, pianist and violinist said to have taught Louis Armstrong at the New Orleans Boys Home for Colored Waifs. Tony Garnier is the younger brother of [[D'Jalma Garnier]] born 1954, the fiddler, composer, guitarist, and \"pedestrian scholar\" of Louisiana Creole fame. The two brothers, along with first cousin Stephen \"Stevo\" Th\u00e9ard, are the only descendants of Papa Garnier to become professional musicians in the legacy of this significant New Orleans musical family.
