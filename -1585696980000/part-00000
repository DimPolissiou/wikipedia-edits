However, a diverse family of [[fibrinogen]]-related proteins (FREPs) containing immunoglobulin-like domains has been discovered in ''Biomphalaria glabrata'' and may play a role in snail defence. Circulating haemocytes (macrophage-like defence cells) in the snail haemolymph are known to aggregate in response to trauma, phagocytose small particles (bacteria, and fungi) and encapsulate larger ones, such as parasites. Final killing is effected by hemocyte-mediated cytotoxicity mechanisms involving non-oxidative and oxidative pathways, including lysosomal enzymes and reactive oxygen/nitrogen intermediates. Certain [[allele]]s of cytosolic copper/zinc [[superoxide dismutase]] (SOD1) have been associated with resistance also suggesting these processes are important in the snail internal defence system.<ref name=\"Lockyer\"/>\n\n=== Predators ===\nThe freshwater snail ''[[Marisa cornuarietis]]'' is a predator of ''Biomphalaria glabrata'': it feeds on its eggs, juvenile and adult snails.<ref name=\"Ruiz-Tib\u00e9n\"/> It also acts as a competitor.<ref name=\"Ruiz-Tib\u00e9n\">{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Kobayashi | first1 = H. \n| title = An experimental study of epidermal keratin phosphorylation --epidermal keratin as a substrate protein of cAMP-dependent protein kinase \n| journal = Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi\n| volume = 61 \n| issue = 3 \n| pages = 453\u2013462 \n| year = 1986 \n| pmid = 2427426\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmc=2427426|year=1969|last1=Ruiz-Tib\u00e9n|first1=E|title=Biological control of Biomphalaria glabrata by Marisa cornuarietis in irrigation ponds in Puerto Rico|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=41|issue=2|pages=329\u2013333|last2=Palmer|first2=J.

Also, like all planorbids, this species has a sinistral [[gastropod shell|shell]], in other words, the coiling of the shell is left-handed. However, like all the snails in the subfamily Planobinae, this snail carries its coiled shell upside down, and thus the shell appears to be dextral in coiling. In other families of snails the spire is situated on top of the shell, here what shows on top of the shell is in fact the [[umbilicus (mollusc)|umbilicus]].\n\n''Biomphalaria glabrata'' was discovered and described under the name ''Planorbis glabratus'' by American naturalist [[Thomas Say]] in 1818.<ref name=\"Say\">{{cite journal |authorlink1=Thomas Say |last1=Say |first1=T. |date=June 1818 |title=Account of two new genera, and several new species, of fresh water and land shells |journal=[[Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia]] |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=276\u2013284 |url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofacademy01acaduoft#page/280/mode/1up }}</ref> Say's type description reads as follows:\n\n{{Cquote|1=Shell sinistral; whorls about five, glabrous or obsoletely rugose, polished, destitute of any appearance of carina; [[spire (mollusc)|spire]] perfectly regular, a little concave; [[umbilicus (mollusc)|umbilicus]] large, regularly and deeply concave, exhibiting all the volutions to the summit; [[aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] declining, remarkably oblique with respect to the transverse diameter.

However, a diverse family of [[fibrinogen]]-related proteins (FREPs) containing immunoglobulin-like domains has been discovered in ''Biomphalaria glabrata'' and may play a role in snail defence. Circulating haemocytes (macrophage-like defence cells) in the snail haemolymph are known to aggregate in response to trauma, phagocytose small particles (bacteria, and fungi) and encapsulate larger ones, such as parasites. Final killing is effected by hemocyte-mediated cytotoxicity mechanisms involving non-oxidative and oxidative pathways, including lysosomal enzymes and reactive oxygen/nitrogen intermediates.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]]. In England, 162 ancient churches and at least 24 hospitals were dedicated to him; though his only other surviving medieval dedication in Scotland is the parish church of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].<ref>Farmer 1978, p. 189.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 2.</ref> The church was first possessed by the monks of the [[Order of St Lazarus]], who ministered among lepers; if [[David I of Scotland|David I]] or [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] is the church's founder, the dedication may be connected to their sister [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]], who founded [[St Giles in the Fields]].<ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], St Giles' was the only parish church in Edinburgh and some contemporary writers, such as [[Jean Froissart]], refer simply to the \"church of Edinburgh\".<ref>Jean Froissart in Lees 1889, p. 5.</ref><ref name=GMW103>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 103.</ref>  From its elevation to collegiate status in 1467 until the Reformation, the church's full title was \"the Collegiate Church of St Giles of Edinburgh\".<ref>Lees 1889, p. 43.</ref> Even after the Reformation, the church is attested as \"the college kirk of Sanct Geill\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 155\">Lees 1889, p. 155.</ref> The charter of 1633 raising St Giles' to a cathedral records its common name as \"Saint Giles' Kirk\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 204\">Lees 1889, p. 204.</ref>\n\nSt Giles' held cathedral status between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1690 during periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland.<ref name=GMW103/> Since 1690, the Church of Scotland, as a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, has had no [[bishop]]s and, therefore, no [[cathedral]]s.

A 1625 order of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] refers to the Great Kirk congregation, which was then meeting in St Giles', as the \"High Kirk\".

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]].

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

On autopsy, most of these patients' hearts showed the thickened endocardial layer noted above. This was thought to be a disease affecting both the heart muscle and the endocardium and it was given various names such as: idiopathic hypertrophy of the heart, endocardial sclerosis, cardiac enlargement of unknown cause, etc. Some of these hearts also had overt congenital anomalies, especially aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta.\n\nThe term \"endocardial fibroelastosis\" was introduced by Weinberg and Himmelfarb in 1943.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinberg T, Himmelfarb AJ |year=1943 |title=Endocardial fibroelastosis |journal=Bull Johns Hopkins Hosp. |volume=72 |page=299}}</ref> In their pathology laboratory they noted that usually the endocardium was pearly white or opaque instead of normally thin and transparent and microscopically showed a systematic layering of collagenous and elastic fibers. They felt their new term was more adequately descriptive, and, indeed it was quickly and widely adopted. Clinicians began applying it to any infant with a dilated, failing heart, in spite of the fact that the only way to definitively establish the presence of EFE was to see it at autopsy. EFE had quickly become the name of a disease, and it continues to be used by many physicians in this way, though many patients with identical symptoms do not have the endocardial reaction of EFE.\n\nIn the latter decades of the twentieth century new discoveries and new thinking about heart muscle disease gave rise to the term \"cardiomyopathy\". Many of the cases of infantile cardiac failure were accordingly called \"primary cardiomyopathy\" as well as \"primary EFE\", while those with identifiable congenital anomalies stressing the heart were called \"secondary EFE\". In 1957 Black-Schaffer proposed a unitary explanation that stress on the ventricle, of any kind, may trigger the endocardial reaction, so that all EFE could be thought of as secondary.<ref>Black-Schaffer B. (1957) \"Infantile endocardial fibroelastosis: a suggested etiology\", ''AMA Archives of Pathology''''' 63:''':281-306.</ref> This prescient paper convinced few readers at the time.\n\nEvidence gradually accumulated as to the role of infection as one such type of stress. The studies of Fruhling and colleagues in 1962 were critical.<ref>Fruhling L, Korn R, LaVillaureix J, Surjus A, Fousserreau S. (1962)\"La myoendocardite chronique fibro\u00e9lastique du nouveau-n\u00e9 et du nourisson\" ''Ann d'Anat Pathol'' '''7''':227-303.</ref> They followed a series of epidemics of Coxsackie virus infection in their part of France. After each epidemic there were increased numbers of cases with EFE coming to autopsy. On closer study there were cases of pure acute myocarditis, cases of mixed myocarditis and EFE, and cases where myocarditis had healed, leaving just EFE. They were able to culture Coxsackie virus from the tissues of many of the cases at all stages  of this apparent progression. A similar progression from myocarditis to EFE was later observed at Johns Hopkins but no virology was done.<ref>Hutchins GM, Vie SA (1982) \"The progression of interstitial myocarditis to idiopathic endocardial fibroelastosis\"  ''Am J Pathol''  '''66''': 483-492.</ref>\n\nNoren and colleagues at University of Minnesota, acting on an idea floated at a pediatric meeting, were able to show a relation between exposure to maternal mumps in fetal life, EFE, and a positive skin test for mumps in infants.<ref>Noren GR, Adams P Jr., Anderson RC (1963) \"Positive skin reactivity to mumps virus antigen in endocardial fibroelastosis\"\nJ'' Pediat'' '''62:'''  604-606.</ref> This brought on a large ongoing controversy and finally prompted a virologist colleague of theirs to inject embryonated eggs with mumps virus.<ref>St. Geme JW Jr., Peralta H, Farias E, et al. (1971) \"Experimental gestational mumps virus infection and endocardial fibroelastosis\" ''Pediatrics'' '''48''': 821-828.</ref> The chicks at first showed the changes of myocarditis, about a year later, typical EFE, and transitional changes in between. Despite this, the controversy about the role of mumps continued as the actual incidence of EFE plummeted. The proponents of mumps as a cause pointed to this as the effect of the recent implementation of widespread mumps immunization.\n\nEvidence that [[virus|viral]] infection may play a role as a cause or trigger of EFE was greatly reinforced by the study  directed by Towbin in the virus laboratory of Texas Children's Hospital.<ref name=\"pmid8994428\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ni J, Bowles NE, Kim YH, etal |title=Viral infection of the myocardium in endocardial fibroelastosis.

It seems undeniable that transplacental mumps infection had been in the past the major cause of EFE, and that immunization was indeed the cause of EFE having become rare.\n\nNon-infectious causes of EFE have also been studied, spurred by the opening of new avenues of genetics research. Now there are specific named genes associated with certain cardiomyopathies, some of which show the characteristic reaction of EFE. A typical example is Barth syndrome and the responsible gene, tafazzin.<ref>Bione S, D'Adamo P, Maestrini E, Gedeon AK, Bolhuis PA, Toniolo D (1996) \"A novel x-linked gene, G4.5, is responsible for Barth Syndrome\" ''Nat Genet'' '''12:''' 385-389.</ref>\n\nDevelopments in echocardiography, both the technology of the machines and the skill of the operators, have made it no longer necessary to see the endocardium at autopsy. EFE can now be found non-invasively by the recording of increased endocardial echos.

Because of the logic of the diagnostic tree, where EFE applies to many branches of the tree and thus cannot occupy a branch, it is not listed by the Registry as a cause but rather, \"with EFE\" is a modifier that can be applied to any cause.<ref>Alvarez JA, Wilkinson JD, Lipshultz SE (2007) \"Outcome predictors for pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy: a systematic review\" ''Prog Pediatr Cardiol'' '''23:'''  25-32.</ref>\n\nThus, the past half century has seen EFE evolve from a mysterious but frequently observed disease to  a rare but much better understood reaction to many diseases and other stresses.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Papillary fibroelastoma]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 29236\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|I|42|4|i|30}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|425.3}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = 226000\n| OMIM_mult       = {{OMIM2|305300}}\n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = \n| Orphanet        = 2022\n}}\n{{Heart diseases}}\n{{Congenital malformations and deformations of circulatory system}}\n\n[[Category:Heart diseases]]\n[[Category:Congenital disorders]]\n[[Category:Autosomal recessive disorders]]\n[[Category:X-linked recessive disorders]]\n[[Category:Rare diseases]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Endocardial Fibroelastosis\n| synonyms        = \n| image           = \n| caption         = \n| pronounce       = \n| field           = \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Endocardial fibroelastosis''' ('''EFE''') is a rare [[heart]] disorder usually occurring in children two years old and younger.<ref name=\"isbn0-7216-0187-1\">{{cite book |author1=Cotran, Ramzi S. |author2=Kumar, Vinay |author3=Fausto, Nelson |author4=Nelso Fausto |author5=Robbins, Stanley L. |author6=Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |page=607 |isbn=978-0-7216-0187-8}}</ref> It may also be considered a reaction to stress, not necessarily a specific disease.<ref name=Lurie>{{cite journal |author=Lurie PR |last2=B\u00e9land |year=2010 |first2=MJ  |title=Changing concepts of endocardial fibroelastosis |journal=Cardiology in the Young |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=124\u2013132 |pmid=20405546 |doi=10.1017/s1047951110000181}}</ref>\n\nIt should not be confused with [[endomyocardial fibrosis]].\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nEFE is characterized by a thickening of the innermost lining of the heart chambers (the [[endocardium]]) due to an increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue and elastic fibres.

A last resort form of treatment is [[heart transplant]].<ref name=\"pmid15227396\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Netz H, Bauer JJ, Scheld HH, etal |title=Cardiac Transplantation in a Neonate with Endocardial Fibroelastosis |journal=Tex Heart Inst J |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=122\u2013125 |year=1990 |pmid=15227396 |pmc=326468 |format=Free full text}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAn infant with dilated, failing heart was no rarity on the pediatric wards of hospitals in the mid-twentieth century. On autopsy, most of these patients' hearts showed the thickened endocardial layer noted above. This was thought to be a disease affecting both the heart muscle and the endocardium and it was given various names such as: idiopathic hypertrophy of the heart, endocardial sclerosis, cardiac enlargement of unknown cause, etc. Some of these hearts also had overt congenital anomalies, especially aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta.\n\nThe term \"endocardial fibroelastosis\" was introduced by Weinberg and Himmelfarb in 1943.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinberg T, Himmelfarb AJ |year=1943 |title=Endocardial fibroelastosis |journal=Bull Johns Hopkins Hosp. |volume=72 |page=299}}</ref> In their pathology laboratory they noted that usually the endocardium was pearly white or opaque instead of normally thin and transparent and microscopically showed a systematic layering of collagenous and elastic fibers. They felt their new term was more adequately descriptive, and, indeed it was quickly and widely adopted. Clinicians began applying it to any infant with a dilated, failing heart, in spite of the fact that the only way to definitively establish the presence of EFE was to see it at autopsy. EFE had quickly become the name of a disease, and it continues to be used by many physicians in this way, though many patients with identical symptoms do not have the endocardial reaction of EFE.\n\nIn the latter decades of the twentieth century new discoveries and new thinking about heart muscle disease gave rise to the term \"cardiomyopathy\". Many of the cases of infantile cardiac failure were accordingly called \"primary cardiomyopathy\" as well as \"primary EFE\", while those with identifiable congenital anomalies stressing the heart were called \"secondary EFE\". In 1957 Black-Schaffer proposed a unitary explanation that stress on the ventricle, of any kind, may trigger the endocardial reaction, so that all EFE could be thought of as secondary.<ref>Black-Schaffer B. (1957) \"Infantile endocardial fibroelastosis: a suggested etiology\", ''AMA Archives of Pathology''''' 63:''':281-306.</ref> This prescient paper convinced few readers at the time.\n\nEvidence gradually accumulated as to the role of infection as one such type of stress. The studies of Fruhling and colleagues in 1962 were critical.<ref>Fruhling L, Korn R, LaVillaureix J, Surjus A, Fousserreau S. (1962)\"La myoendocardite chronique fibro\u00e9lastique du nouveau-n\u00e9 et du nourisson\" ''Ann d'Anat Pathol'' '''7''':227-303.</ref> They followed a series of epidemics of Coxsackie virus infection in their part of France. After each epidemic there were increased numbers of cases with EFE coming to autopsy. On closer study there were cases of pure acute myocarditis, cases of mixed myocarditis and EFE, and cases where myocarditis had healed, leaving just EFE. They were able to culture Coxsackie virus from the tissues of many of the cases at all stages  of this apparent progression. A similar progression from myocarditis to EFE was later observed at Johns Hopkins but no virology was done.<ref>Hutchins GM, Vie SA (1982) \"The progression of interstitial myocarditis to idiopathic endocardial fibroelastosis\"  ''Am J Pathol''  '''66''': 483-492.</ref>\n\nNoren and colleagues at University of Minnesota, acting on an idea floated at a pediatric meeting, were able to show a relation between exposure to maternal mumps in fetal life, EFE, and a positive skin test for mumps in infants.<ref>Noren GR, Adams P Jr., Anderson RC (1963) \"Positive skin reactivity to mumps virus antigen in endocardial fibroelastosis\"\nJ'' Pediat'' '''62:'''  604-606.</ref> This brought on a large ongoing controversy and finally prompted a virologist colleague of theirs to inject embryonated eggs with mumps virus.<ref>St. Geme JW Jr., Peralta H, Farias E, et al. (1971) \"Experimental gestational mumps virus infection and endocardial fibroelastosis\" ''Pediatrics'' '''48''': 821-828.</ref> The chicks at first showed the changes of myocarditis, about a year later, typical EFE, and transitional changes in between. Despite this, the controversy about the role of mumps continued as the actual incidence of EFE plummeted. The proponents of mumps as a cause pointed to this as the effect of the recent implementation of widespread mumps immunization.\n\nEvidence that [[virus|viral]] infection may play a role as a cause or trigger of EFE was greatly reinforced by the study  directed by Towbin in the virus laboratory of Texas Children's Hospital.<ref name=\"pmid8994428\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ni J, Bowles NE, Kim YH, etal |title=Viral infection of the myocardium in endocardial fibroelastosis.

It seems undeniable that transplacental mumps infection had been in the past the major cause of EFE, and that immunization was indeed the cause of EFE having become rare.\n\nNon-infectious causes of EFE have also been studied, spurred by the opening of new avenues of genetics research. Now there are specific named genes associated with certain cardiomyopathies, some of which show the characteristic reaction of EFE. A typical example is Barth syndrome and the responsible gene, tafazzin.<ref>Bione S, D'Adamo P, Maestrini E, Gedeon AK, Bolhuis PA, Toniolo D (1996) \"A novel x-linked gene, G4.5, is responsible for Barth Syndrome\" ''Nat Genet'' '''12:''' 385-389.</ref>\n\nDevelopments in echocardiography, both the technology of the machines and the skill of the operators, have made it no longer necessary to see the endocardium at autopsy. EFE can now be found non-invasively by the recording of increased endocardial echos.  Fetal echocardiography has shown that EFE can begin to accumulate as early as 14 weeks of gestation, and increase with incredible rapidity<ref>Rustico MA, Benettoni A, Bussani R, Maieron A, Mandruzzato G.

Because of the logic of the diagnostic tree, where EFE applies to many branches of the tree and thus cannot occupy a branch, it is not listed by the Registry as a cause but rather, \"with EFE\" is a modifier that can be applied to any cause.<ref>Alvarez JA, Wilkinson JD, Lipshultz SE (2007) \"Outcome predictors for pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy: a systematic review\" ''Prog Pediatr Cardiol'' '''23:'''  25-32.</ref>\n\nThus, the past half century has seen EFE evolve from a mysterious but frequently observed disease to  a rare but much better understood reaction to many diseases and other stresses.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Papillary fibroelastoma]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 29236 \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|I|42|4|i|30}} \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|425.3}} \n|  ICDO           =  \n|  OMIM           = 226000    \n|  OMIM_mult      = {{OMIM2|305300}} \n|  eMedicineSubj  =  \n|  eMedicineTopic =  \n|  MeshID         = \n}}\n{{Heart diseases}}\n{{Congenital malformations and deformations of circulatory system}}\n\n[[Category:Heart diseases]]\n[[Category:Congenital disorders]]\n[[Category:Autosomal recessive disorders]]\n[[Category:X-linked recessive disorders]]\n[[Category:Rare diseases]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocardial_fibroelastosis"}

It was the primary competitor of [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] until 1997, when Mattel bought [[Tyco Toys]], then-owner of Matchbox. \n\nMany [[automobile manufacturers]] have since licensed Hot Wheels to make [[scale model]]s of their cars, allowing the use of original design [[blueprint]]s and detailing. Although Hot Wheels were originally intended for children and young adults, they have become popular with adult collectors, for whom [[limited edition]] models are now made available.\n\n==History==\n===1968===\nThe original Hot Wheels were made by [[Elliot Handler]]. Hot Wheels were conceived to be more like \"hot rod\" (i.e.[[Custom car|customized]]/[[Hot rod|modified]] or even [[Caricature|caricaturized]] or [[fantasy]] cars,  often with [[Racing slick|big rear tires]], [[Supercharger|superchargers]], flame paint-jobs, outlandish proportions, etc.) cars, as compared to [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] cars which were generally small-scale models of production cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redlinederby.com/topic/speed-test-hot-wheels-vs-matchbox/7|title=Speed test, Hot Wheels vs. Matchbox|work=Redline Derby|date=April 26, 2014|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref> \"Sweet 16\" There were sixteen castings released on May 18, 1968, eleven of them designed by [[Harry Bentley Bradley]].<ref name=\"Coffee Break Design History\" /> The first one produced was a dark blue \"''Custom [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]]''\".<ref name=\"Fox\" /> Bradley was from the car industry and had designed the body for the (full-sized) [[Deora (custom car)|Dodge Deora]] concept car and the ''Custom Fleetside'', (based on his own customized 1968 [[Chevrolet C-10]] Fleetside).\n\nIn 1968, the first production line of Hot Wheels Cars is known as ''The Original Sweet 16'', which is the first of the Red Line Series, meaning the tires have a red [[Pinstriping|pin stripe]] on their sides.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Aaron|url=https://www.thrillist.com/cars/16-things-you-didn-t-know-about-hot-wheels-history-facts-and-trivia|title=16 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HOT WHEELS|publisher=[[Thrillist Media Group]]|date=January 8, 2016|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Racing track set===\nIn addition to the cars themselves, Mattel produced a racing track set (sold separately). Though it would be updated throughout the years, the original track consisted of a series of brightly colored orange road sections (pieced together to form an oblong, circular race track), with one (or sometimes two) \"super chargers\" (faux service stations through which cars passed on the tracks, featuring battery-powered spinning wheels, which would propel the cars along the tracks).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://onlineredlineguide.com/accessories/super_charger/super_charger.html|title=Super Charger|work=Online Redline Guide|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref>An important feature here was Hot Wheel's use of wide, hard-plastic tires that created much less friction and tracked more smoothly than the narrow metal or plastic wheels used on contemporary Matchboxes; Hot Wheels cars were designed to roll easily and at high speeds, which was a great innovation at the time. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toyhalloffame.org/toys/hot-wheels|title=Hot Wheels {{!}} National Toy Hall of Fame|website=www.toyhalloffame.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>\n\n===1969===\nAs it turned out, the Hot Wheels brand was a staggering success. The series completely [[Disruptive innovation|disrupted the whole industry]] for small [[Die-cast toy|die-cast car]] models from 1968 onwards, forcing the competition at [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] and elsewhere to completely rethink their concepts, and to scramble to try to recover lost ground. Harry Bentley Bradley did not think that would be the case and had quit Mattel to go back to the car industry. When the company asked him back, he recommended a good friend, Ira Gilford. Gilford, who had just left [[Chrysler]], quickly accepted the job of designing the next Hot Wheels models. Some of Hot Wheels' greatest cars, such as the '''Twin [[Internal combustion engine|Mill]]''' and '''Splittin' Image''', came from Ira Gilford's drawing board.<ref name=\"Coffee Break Design History\">{{cite web|last=Gerber|first=Alison|url=http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/coffee-break-history-of-the-hot-wheels-race-car-212651|title=Coffee Break Design History: Hot Wheels|publisher=[[Apartment Therapy]]|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the 1967 line was solidified and consolidated with the 1969 releases, with which Hot Wheels effectively established itself as the hottest brand of small toy car models in the USA. ''Splittin' Image'', ''Torero'', ''Turbofire'', and ''Twin Mill'' were part of the \"Show & Go\" series and are the very first original in-house designs by Hot Wheels.\n\nThe initial prototypes of the '''Beach'' ''Bomb''' were faithful to the shape of a real [[Volkswagen Type 2|VW Type 2 \"bus\"]], and had two [[Surfboard|surfboards]] sticking out the back window, in a nod to the VW's perceived association with the surfing community and the slang term for a person who spends much time surfing - a '[[Surf culture|beach bum]]'.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/historic-hot-wheels-cars-glimpse-back-die-cast-models-gallery-1.2266872|title=Historic Hot Wheels cars: A glimpse back at the first die-cast model|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref> During the fledgling Hot Wheels era, Mattel wanted to make sure that each of the cars could be used with any of the playsets and stunt track sets. Unfortunately, testing showed that this early version (now known among collectors as the '''Rear-Loader Beach Bomb''', or 'RLBB') was too narrow to roll effectively on Hot Wheels track or be powered by the Super Charger, and was too top-heavy to negotiate high-speed corners.\n\nHot Wheels designers Howard Rees and Larry Wood modified the casting, extending the side fenders to accommodate the track width, as well as providing a new place on the vehicle to store each of the plastic surfboards. The roof was also cut away and replaced by a full-length [[sunroof]], to lower the [[Center of mass|center of gravity]]. Nicknamed the '''Side-loader''' by collectors, this was the production version of the Beach Bomb.\n\nThe ''Rear-Loader Beach Bomb'' is widely considered the \"[[Holy Grail]]\", or ultimate pinnacle, of a serious Hot Wheels collection. An unknown number were made as test subjects and given to employees. A regular production ''Beach Bomb'' may be worth up to $600, depending on condition. Market prices on ''RLBBs'' however, have easily reached the five-figure plateau, ranging from $70,000 to $120,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=McTavish|first=Brian|url=http://cjonline.com/stories/111499/kan_hotwheels.shtml#.WGQJu1MrKUk|title=Overland Park man gets $72,000 for rare Hot Wheels van|newspaper=[[Kansas City Star]]|date=November 19, 1999|accessdate=December 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229032627/http://cjonline.com/stories/111499/kan_hotwheels.shtml#.WGQJu1MrKUk|archive-date=December 29, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The [[Petersen Automotive Museum]] in Los Angeles had a pink ''RLBB'' in its Hot Wheels exhibit, displayed alone on a rotating platform under glass. The Hot Wheels Collectors Club released a new, updated version of the ''Rear Loading Beach Bomb'' in 2002 as a [[Special edition|limited edition]].\n\n===1970s===\n1970 was a very successful year for Hot Wheels, so Mattel came up with a new [[advertising slogan]] for the cars: \"Go With the Winner\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Philip|url=http://www.battlegrip.com/go-with-the-winner-in-these-1970-hot-wheels-commercials/|title=\u201cGo with the winner!\u201d in these 1970 Hot Wheels Commercials|publisher=BattleGrip.com|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref> 43 new cars appeared this year. This was also the year that '''Sizzlers''' and '''Heavyweights''' lines appeared. Howard Rees, who worked with Ira Gilford, was tired of designing cars. He wanted to work on the [[Major Matt Mason]] [[action figure]] toy line-up. Rees had a good friend by the name of Larry Wood. They had worked together at [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] designing cars. When Wood found out about Hot Wheels at a party Rees was holding, Rees offered Wood the job of designing Hot Wheels models. Wood agreed, and by the end of the week, Wood was working at Mattel. His first design would be the '''Tri-Baby'''. After 36 years, Wood still works for Hot Wheels.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gay|first=Gerald|url=http://tucson.com/entertainment/outdoors/hot-wheels-royalty-to-serve-as-grand-marshal-at-rodders/article_dacf0e13-927c-536b-84c8-a7d0dcff9dfd.html|title=Hot Wheels royalty to serve as grand marshal at Rodders Days event|newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|date=May 8, 2014|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother designer, Paul Tam, joined Wood and Gilford. Tam's first design for Hot Wheels was the '''Whip Creamer'''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Von Bogart|first=Angelo|date=August 31, 2009|title=Hot Wheels Classic Redline Era: Hot Wheels - Birth of the Redline|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=1440221707}}</ref> Tam continued to work for Mattel until 1973. Among the many fantastic designs Tam thought up for Hot Wheels, some of the collector's favorites include '''Evil Weevil''' (a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] with two engines), '''Open Fire''' (an [[AMC Gremlin]] with six wheels), '''[[Revolver|Six Shooter]]''' (another six wheeled car), and the rare '''Double Header''' (co-designed with Larry Wood).\n\nThe year 1970 introduced \"[[Don Prudhomme|the Snake]] and [[Tom McEwen (drag racer)|the Mongoose]]\", a manufactured 'rivalry' between two professional [[Drag racing|drag racers]] calling themselves \"the Snake\" and \"the [[Mongoose]]\" for the purposes of publicity. This was notably drag racing's first major non-automotive [[Sponsor (commercial)|corporate sponsor]], and the beginning of the [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]]\u2019s booming popularity with large-budget teams and championships. 1970 also introduced the first 'Silver Series', which contained three silver-painted models: the '''Boss Hoss''', the '''Heavy'' ''[[Chevrolet|Chevy]]''', and the '''King '[[Plymouth Barracuda|Kuda]]''', which were only obtainable through a mail-in offer that included a membership to the Hot Wheels Club. These three cars featured \"[[Supercharger|supercharged]]\" engines (featuring large [[Roots-type supercharger|Roots blowers]]) without hoods, and open [[Exhaust manifold|exhaust headers]], after the style of drag racing cars of the era. Popular among children, these 'Silver Cars' were considered faster than the rest of the Hot Wheels lineup, because they were supposedly heavier than the other gravity models, but the accuracy of this claim has never been tested under scientific conditions.\n\nHowever, 1972 and 1973 were slow years. Only seven new models were made in 1972. Of the 24 models appearing for 1973, only three were new models. Also the cars changed from Mattel's in-house ''Spectraflame'' colors to mostly drab, solid [[Enamel paint|enamel]] colors, which mainstream Hot Wheels cars still use today. Due to low sales, and the fact that the majority of the [[Casting (metalworking)|castings]] were not re-used in later years, the 1972-3 models are known to be very collectible.\n\nIn 1974, Hot Wheels introduced its '[[Maritime flag|''Flying'' ''Colors'']]' line, and added flashy decals and [[Pad printing|\"tampo-printed\"]] paint designs which helped revitalize sales. As with the lower-friction wheels in 1968, this innovation was revolutionary in the industry, and\u2014although far less effective in terms of sales impact than in 1968\u2014was copied by the competition, who did not want to be outmaneuvered again by Mattel product strategists.\n\nIn 1977, the 'Redline Wheel' was phased out, with the red lines no longer being printed on the wheels. This cut costs, but also reflected that the prototypical \"red line tires\" popular on high-speed-rated automotive tires during the era of [[muscle car]]s and [[Polyglas]] tires were no longer popular.  During this period, there was a trend away from wild [[Hot rod|hot rods]] and fantastic cars, and a move to more realistic cars and trucks, like the competitor Matchbox.\n\n===1977\u20131988: The 'Blackwalls' era===\nIn 1981, '''Hot Ones''' wheels were introduced, which had gold-painted hubs, and claimed to have thinner axles for greater speed, along with additional suspension compliance that older production Hot Wheels lacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nchwa.com/1981.html|title=1981|work=North Carolina Hot Wheels Association|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref> '''Ultra Hot Wheels'''  were introduced in 1984, and looked something like the cast alloy wheels found on a 1980s-era high-trim [[Renault Fuego]] or a [[Mazda 626]], with three parallel dark lines cutting diagonally across the flat chrome face of the wheel, all three broken in the center to form six individual shorter lines. These new \"''Ultra Hots''\" claimed further speed improvements. Hot Wheels started offering models based on 1980s-era [[Sports car|sports]] and [[Economy car|economy cars]], like the [[Pontiac Fiero]] or [[Dodge Omni 024]], in addition to their typical '[[hot rod]]' and [[muscle car]] style offerings. In 1983, a new style of wheel called '''Real Riders''' were introduced, which featured real rubber tires.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ragan|first=Mac|title=Hot Wheels Cars|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|date=2001|isbn=076030839X}}</ref> Despite the fact that they were very popular, the Real Riders line was short-lived, because of high production costs. In the late 1980s, the so-called '''Blue'' ''Card''' [[blister pack]] color scheme was introduced, which would become the basis of Hot Wheels colors still used today (original blister packs were red and yellow.\n\nTwo other innovations were introduced briefly in Hot Wheels cars in the 1980s \u2013 ''Thermal Color Change'' paint, and rotating 'crash panel' vehicles (\"''Crack-Ups''\"). The former were able to change color on exposure to hot or cold water, and there were an initial release of 20 different cars, available as sets of three vehicles. The latter were vehicles with a panel that, on contact, would rotate to reveal a reverse side which appeared to be heavily dented. Variations in crash-panels included front, rear and side panels, the last of whose mechanism has proven to be the most durable.\n\nIn the 1980s, Hot Wheels had gotten into a controversy with [[General Motors]]' [[Chevrolet Motors Division]]. In 1982, the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] had ended the curvaceous \"[[Mako Shark (concept car)|Mako Shark]]\" body-style that had been in production for almost 15 years, and GM announced that the Corvette would be redesigned. In 1983, Chevrolet started to produce the all new [[Chevrolet Corvette (C4)|C4 Corvette]] but had assembly line problems which pushed production back 6 months causing GM's Marketing Department to label all 1983s as 1984s once they got production perfected so it would seem to the public that the all-new C4 Corvette came out early rather than late. But Hot Wheels saw what the new model of Corvette was going to look like before GM's official unveiling, and they designed a die cast version of the 1984 Corvette. GM was angered and almost pulled its licensing with Mattel, but this controversy helped Corvette buffs see what the new Corvette was going to look like. The 1984 Corvette production ran for 1.5 model years covering half of the remaining 1983 model year and ending on time for the 1985 model year.  \n\nIn conjunction with [[Epyx]] Software, Mattel released a [[PC game|computer game]] edition of Hot Wheels for various [[8-bit]] [[Computing platform|platforms]] in 1985, as part of the Computer Activity Toys series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retroist.com/2011/09/01/epyx-presents-hot-wheels-for-the-commodore-64/|title=Epyx Presents Hot Wheels for the Commodore 64 - The Retroist|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|access-date=13 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504072443/http://www.retroist.com/2011/09/01/epyx-presents-hot-wheels-for-the-commodore-64/|archive-date=4 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===1989\u20131994: The collector number era===\nIn 1989, Mattel released collector numbers. Each car had its own number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nchwa.com/numbers.html|title=Numbers|work=North Carolina Hot Wheels Association|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref> The cards were all blue, for all blister packs released from 1989\u20131994. Numbers included went as high as 274; however, these were skip numbered, and numbers such as 48, 61, and 173 were not used.{{Attribution needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== 1995\u20131999: The Treasure Hunt era ===\nThe year 1995 brought a major change to the Hot Wheels line, where the cars were split up into series. One was the 1995 Model Series, which included all of that year's new castings. In 1996, the Model Series was renamed to First Editions. 1995 also saw the introduction of the ''[[Treasure Hunt Series]]'' (see below). The rest of the series included four cars with paint schemes that followed a theme. For example, the ''[[Pearl Diver|Pearl Driver]]'' cars all had [[Iridescence|pearlescent]] paint. Sales for the series models soared with another program also introduced that year called the ''Bonus'' ''Car'' program, causing stores across the nation to have shortages. Purchasing the four car sets and sending in the packaging backs plus a handling fee gave you the opportunity to collect the bonus cars, 1 each released for each quarter of the year starting in 1996 through at least 2000. Several new wheel designs were also introduced in the 1990s.\n\nMattel bought Tyco Toys in 1997. Along with the purchase came old competitor Matchbox. Arguably the two dominant companies in matchbox-sized cars were now under one roof.\n\nIn 1998, Mattel celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Hot Wheels brand by replicating various cars and individual packaging from its 30-year history and packaging these replicated vehicles in special 30th Anniversary boxes. In 1999, Hot Wheels Interactive was launched.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nA new generation of Hot Wheels Designers came in. Eric Tscherne and Fraser Campbell along with former designer Paul Tam's son, Alec Tam, joined the design team. Many still work for Mattel today. Tscherne's ''Seared Tuner'' (formerly ''Sho-Stopper'') graced the mainline packaging from 2000 to 2003.  The ''Deora II'', one of only two Hot Wheels concept cars ever made into full-size, functional cars, was also released this year.\n\nIn 2001, Mattel issued 240 mainline releases consisting of 12 ''Treasure Hunts'', 36 ''First Editions'', 12 ''Segment Series'' with four cars each, and 144 open stock cars. Popular models that debuted include the '''Hyper'' ''Mite''' and '''Fright'' ''Bike'''.\n\nFor 2002, the mainline consisted of 12 ''Treasure Hunts'', 42 ''First Editions'', 15 ''Segment Series'' of 4 cars each, and 126 open stock cars. Popular new models included the `68 [[Mercury Cougar|Cougar]] and the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]]. Some cars from the first editions series are the ''[[Backdraft]]'', ''[[Overbore|Overbored]] [[Chevrolet big-block engine|454]]'', ''Vairy 8'', and ''[[Mazda RX-7|Super Tsunami]]''.\n\n=== 2003 ===\nHot Wheels celebrated its 35th anniversary with a full-length [[Computer animation|computer animated film]] called ''[[Hot Wheels Highway 35 World Race]]''. This movie tied into the ''Highway 35'' line of cars that featured 35 classic Hot Wheels cars with special graphics and co-molded wheels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/MAT/0x0x224660/a66ba51f-5829-4587-b88a-54a6846efd00/MAT_News_2003_2_13_Wheels_News.pdf|title=Hot Wheels\u00ae Drops The Green Flag On Its 35th Anniversary With The World Race(TM)|date=February 13, 2003|work=[[Mattel]]|format=PDF|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 2004 ===\nIn 2004, Hot Wheels unveiled its \"''Hot 100''\" line, comprising 100 new models. These new models included cartoonish vehicles such as the '''Tooned'' (vehicles based on the larger ''Hot'' ''Tunerz'' line of Hot Wheels created by Eric Tscherne{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}), ''[[Bling-bling|Blings]]'' (boxy bodies and big wheels), ''Hardnoze'' (enlarged fronts), ''Crooze'' (stretched out bodies), and ''Fatbax'' (super-wide back tires and short bodies). ''Fatbax'' models include [[Toyota]] Supra and a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)|Corvette C6]]. These vehicles did not sell as well as Mattel expected, and many could still be found in stores throughout 2005. Mattel also released 2004 ''First Editions'' cars with unpainted [[Zamac]] bodies. They were sold through [[Toys 'R' Us]] and were made in limited numbers.\n\n=== 2005 ===\nIn 2005, Hot Wheels continued with new \"extreme\" castings for the 2nd year, debuting 40 distorted cars, in addition to 20 \"''Realistix''\" models. The rest of the line included the standard 12 ''Treasure Hunts'', 10 ''Track Aces'', 50 ''Segment Series'' ''Cars'', and 50 ''Open Stock Models''. Four [[Volkswagen]] \"''Mystery'' ''Cars''\" were offered as a special mail-in promo. Each ''Mystery'' ''Car'' came with a special voucher. Upon collection of all 4 vouchers, one was able to send away for a special 13th ''Treasure'' ''Hunt'', a ''VW Drag Bus.''\n\nHot Wheels also unveiled its new \"Faster than Ever\" line of cars, which had special [[Nickel|nickel-plated]] [[axles]], along with bronze-colored ''Open-Hole 5 Spoke'' wheels. These adjustments supposedly reduce [[friction]] dramatically, resulting in cars that are called the \"''Faster than Ever''\" series. The first run of these cars were available for a limited time only, from the beginning of October towards the end of November 2005.\n\nAlso, a continuation of the movie ''Highway 35'' called ''[[Hot Wheels AcceleRacers]]'' was created, taking place two years after the events of ''Highway 35''. It is featured in four movies and many short segments where the drivers (old ones, gangs, like Teku, Metal Maniacs, the evil Racing Drones, and the stealthy Silencerz). All of the shorts and previews of the movies were placed on a temporary website that was deleted shortly after the last movie.\n\n=== 2007 and 2008 ===\nIn 2007, Mattel released 36 ''New Models'' (formerly ''First Editions''), 12 ''Treasure Hunts'' (with a hard-to-find regular version and even rarer \"''Super Treasure Hunt''\" version of each with rubber ''Real Rider'' tires and Spectraflame paint),<ref name=\"2007 Hot Wheels\">HotWheelsCollectors.com article: \"2007 Mainline Cars Headed Your Way!\"</ref> 12 'Teams' of 4 cars each (formerly ''Segment Series''), 24 ''Code'' ''Cars'' (codes imprinted inside packaging that can be used to unlock web content), 12 ''Track Stars'' (formerly ''Track Aces''), 24 ''Mystery Cars'' (packaged on a card with a opaque blister, so the buyer cannot see which car is inside without opening it), and 24 ''All Stars'' (formerly ''Open Stock''). In late 2006, a new package design for 2007 was released. Some 2006 cars and all 2007 cars are packaged on a blister card with the new design. Hot Wheels released a series called ''Modifighters'', which are similar to [[Transformers]] except for the fact that they were originally cars and were modified into robots. The ''Modifighters'' names are: Streetwyse, Skullface, Live Wire, Bedlam, Nightlife, Mr. Big, and Quick-Tyme.\n\nIn 2008, all the series and vehicles were relatively similar to 2007's cars. approximately 180 to 200 new vehicles were released.\n\n=== 2009 and 2010 ===\nIn 2009, Mattel released 42 ''New Models'', 12 ''Treasure Hunts'', 12 ''Track Stars'', 24 ''Mystery Cars'', 10 ''Segment Series'' of 10 cars, and introduced the [[Indy Car Series]] drivers.\n\nMattel released its first ever [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[Animation|animated]] episodic [[television series]] called ''[[Hot Wheels Battle Force 5]]''.  The US-version of the series was debut on [[Cartoon Network]] on August 29, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. \n\n=== 2011 ===\n2011 saw the release of 244 cars beginning with the 2011 New Car Series which includes the [[Lamborghini Gallardo|''Lamborghini Gallardo LP570-4 Superleggera'']], ''Custom [[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)|2011 Camar]]''[[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)|o]], and the ''[[DeLorean time machine]]'' from the [[Back to the Future series]]. This was followed by the 15-car ''Treasure Hunt'' series with [[1957 Chevrolet|1957 Chevy]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|1958 Chevy Impala]], 15 ''Track Stars'' including the 2010 ''Formula Street'' series, the ''10x10'' series, the ''Thrill Racers'' series, and 22 ''HW Video Game Heroes'' which were packaged with codes for an internet computer game. The new series \"Team Hot Wheels\" appear in the late 2011.\n\n=== 2012 ===\n2012 saw the release of 247 cars, beginning with the 2012 ''New Car Series'' which includes the [[Lamborghini Aventador]], [[Boss 302 Mustang|Ford Mustang Boss 302 Laguna Seca]], [[KITT]] from [[Knight Rider (franchise)|Knight Rider]], and the ever-popular [[Scooby-Doo|Scooby Doo]] ''Mystery Machine''. 2012 also released two vehicles from the ''[[Angry Birds]]'' video game consisting of the Red Bird and the green Minion Pig.\n\n=== 2013 ===\n2013 saw the release of 250 cars including ''Stunt'', ''Racing'', ''Imagination'', ''City'', and ''Showroom'', all of which contain sub-series. 2013 also saw a change in the look of the packaging cards which includes a quartet of helmeted [[motorcycle]] riders standing behind the flame logo and the ''Treasure Hunt'' series cards no longer marked with a [[Buried treasure|treasure chest]]. Some of those cars include: ''Rodzilla'', ''Fangula'', ''Twin Mill III'' (3), ''Bone'' ''Shaker'' and ''Baja'' ''Bone'' ''Shaker''.\n\nGeneral Motors also released a special [[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)#2013 Camaro Hot Wheels Special Edition|Chevrolet Camaro Hot Wheels Edition]], which was a blue [[convertible]] which offered various Hot-Wheels themed decorations throughout the car.\n\n=== 2014 ===\n2014 also saw 250 mainstream cars released with similar segments to 2013. Various [[Playset|playsets]] and other non-car merchandise was also released this year. The end of 2014 also the marks the end of the license agreement between Mattel and [[Ferrari]], meaning the 2014 release of ''Ferrari 5 Pack'' would be the last for Mattel, and the 2015 black ''[[Ferrari 599XX]]'' being the last Ferrari model appearing in mainstream, both regular model and its Treasure Hunt variant.\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n2016 lineup was similar to 2015 and 2014 in terms of segments, and the design of the card was overhauled. Some car names were TBD ([[To be announced|To Be Determined]])  or 2016 (Coming Soon). They're now divided into mini collections with their corresponding segments and their icons printed on the card. Some of them include: ''HW Showroom'', ''[[BMW]]'' (100th anniversary of BMW), ''HW Screen Time'' (Cars and characters seen on television, video games, and movies), and ''HW'' ''Snow'' ''Stormers''. New models include: ''Cruise'' ''Bruiser'', ''Side'' ''Ripper'', and ''Grass'' ''Chomper'', [[Honda NSX (second generation)|'''16 Acura NSX'']], while other models first see their release in the mainline series, such as the '''52'' ''[[Hudson Hornet]]''.\n\n=== 2017 ===\nThis year saw a major change in casting numbering. Since that moment, recolors are named with a different number than the original, thus causing the number limit of cars to expand to 365. The idea of numbering a casting with a number corresponding to their own series was also aborted. There were also some new mainline series introduced, such as ''Experimotors'' (cars with moving parts, or a secondary purpose), ''Holiday Racers'' (cars that have a holiday based theme), ''Factory Fresh'' (a series including newer, sometimes older castings with fabric painting) and ''Camaro Fifty'' (a series dedicated to the [[Chevrolet Camaro]], and its 50th anniversary).\n\n==The \"Sweet 16\"==\nThe '''Sweet 16''' is the first production line of Hot Wheels for the year 1968. The lineup consists of the following:\n*'''''[[Beatnik Bandit]]'''''\n*'''''[[Cadillac El Dorado|Custom El Dorado]]'''''\n*'''''[[Chevrolet Camaro|Custom Camaro]]'''''\n*'''''[[Chevrolet Corvette|Custom Corvette]]'''''\n*'''''[[Chevrolet C-10|Custom Fleetside]]'''''\n*'''''[[Deora (custom car)|Deora]]'''''\n*'''''[[Ford Mustang|Custom Mustang]]'''''\n*'''''[[Ford T-Bird|Custom T-Bird]]'''''\n*'''''[[Ford Model T|Hot Heap]]'''''\n*'''''[[Ford GT-40|Ford J-Car]]'''''\n*'''''[[Mercury Cougar|Custom Cougar]]'''''\n*'''''[[Pontiac Firebird|Custom Firebird]]'''''\n*'''''[[Plymouth Barracuda|Custom Barracuda]]'''''\n*'''''[https://kustomrama.com/wiki/Car_Craft_Dream_Rod Python] (also known as Cheetah)'''''\n*'''''Silhouette'''''\n*'''''[[Volkswagen Beetle|Custom Volkswagen]]'''''\n\n==Collectors==\n\n[[File:Sanfy's 2000s HotWheels collection.jpg|thumb|Few samples from a 2000s Hot Wheels toy collection.]]\n\nThrough the years, Hot Wheels cars have been collected mostly by children, but since the late 1990s, there has been an increase in the number of adult collectors. Mattel estimates that 41 million children grew up playing with the toys, the average collector has over 1,550 cars, and children between the ages of 5 and 15 have an average of 41 cars. Most believe the collecting craze started with the ''Treasure'' ''Hunts'' in 1995. Mike Strauss has been called the father of Hot Wheels collecting; he has organized two collectors' events each year in some form since 1986. The first event was the Annual Hot Wheels Collectors Convention, normally held each year in the fall. The convention occurred in various locations around the country until 2001, when the first Annual Hot Wheels Collectors Nationals was put together. Since then, the Conventions are held each year in southern California. The Hot Wheels Collectors Nationals rotate among cities outside of California during the spring. Strauss has also published the quarterly Hot Wheels Newsletter since 1986 and was one of the first to unite collectors all over the world. He also writes the ''Tomart's Price Guide To Hot Wheels'', a book listing history, car descriptions and values, which is used by almost every collector to learn more about the hobby and their collection. Strauss sold his collection in 2011 and retired from the Hot Wheels Newsletter.\n\nThere are hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of web pages dedicated to Hot Wheels collecting. Collectors are seeking everything related to Hot Wheels, from only new castings to only Red Lines and everything in between. For the most part it is a relatively inexpensive hobby, when compared with [[coin collecting]], [[stamp collecting]] or [[Barbie]] collecting, with mainline cars costing about $0.97-$1.08 (USD) at retail. The price has not changed much in almost 40 years, although in real terms the models have dropped significantly in price (a Hot Wheels car cost $0.98 in 1968 and costs $0.98 today, in spite of inflation). After the cars are no longer available at retail the cost can vary significantly. A common car may sell for less than retail, while some of the more difficult cars can sell for many hundred or even thousands of dollars. The highest price paid for a Hot Wheels car was close to $70,000 in 2000 for a pre-production version of a ''Volkswagen Rear Loader Beach Bomb'' (the asking price was $72,000). The Beach Bomb is a VW microbus with a pair of surfboards poking out the rear window. This design failed initial testing, proving to be top-heavy and not functional with the Power Booster track accessory. A widened version with the surfboards mounted in side slots was designed and released for the 1969 model year, making the \"rear loader\" version a rarity and very sought-after piece. As of 2018, there are about 50 \"rear loaders\" known to exist. <ref>{{cite journal | last =Mort | first =Norm   | title =Red Hot and Rolling at 40  | journal =[[Sports Car Market]]  | volume =20 | issue =5  | pages =44\u201345  |date=May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Dates on cars===\nThe date on the base of a Hot Wheels car is a design copyright date, not a manufacturing date. (Example: \u00a92008 Mattel).\n\nThe date is the copyright date for the casting of the car, not a production date or release year. The date is usually the year before the car was first released, but not always. Sometimes it is sometimes the same year, but there are a few cases where the copyright is several years before a car's first release. For example, a car in the 2001 First Editions series called Evil Twin, was released in 2001 but the year dated on the bottom of the car is 2000. The copyright date will usually not change through the lifetime of a casting. For example, the Twin Mill, first released in 1969, still has a 1969 copyright date on 2019 releases of the car. If the tooling for a car has a major change at some point in its life, the copyright date might be changed or amended to reflect the change. For example, Quick Bite, first released in 1984 as the Good Humor Truck, had a tooling update before 2018, so its date reads 1983, '17 on the base of the 2018 release. There are a few exceptions where the copyright date applies only to the base of a car instead of to the entire car. Those exceptions are mostly funny car castings where the same base was used with various different bodies over the years.\n\nSince the year 2008, Hot Wheels cars have a code stamped into the base. This is a \"base code\". This base code can be used to identify exactly when an individual car was produced in the Hot Wheels factory. \nThe code begins with a letter, followed by a two-digit number. The letter for the year 2018 was \"L\". The letter is then followed by two numbers, which represent the week of that particular year the car was manufactured. For example, a car with the date stamp of \"L42\" was produced on the forty-second week of 2018.\n\nSome cars have 4-digit date codes. These date codes are more specific than the 3-digit codes as they indicate the day a car was made instead of just the week. For the 4-digit codes, the first 3 digits indicate the day of the year and the last digit is the year. A date code of 1987 would indicate the car was made on the 198th day of 2017 (July 17). A code of 0250 would be the 25th day of 2010 (or 2020; depending on the car).\n\nMattel reuses many models of Hot Wheels cars, both as part of the regular line and as \"commemorative\" replicas. As a result, a car with the date 1968 on the base could have been made at any time between 1968 and the present, like the ''Custom Ford Mustang''. One of the easiest ways to tell the difference between a genuine 1968 car and a replica, is to check if it has a base code. (This only works if the car was produced after 2008. If it was produced before then, you would use more detailed ways to tell them apart).\n\n==Hot Wheels Classics==\n[[Image:hotwheels classics.JPG|thumb|right|300px|2005 Hot Wheels Classics Series 1 car, still in package]]\nThe ''Hot'' ''Wheels'' ''Classics'' line was an immediate hit with enthusiasts everywhere. The new line focused on [[muscle cars]], [[hot rods]], and other offbeat vehicles (such as a go-kart, a motor home and even an airplane), many from the company's first ten years (1968\u201378) of production. The series is also used to debut several different castings, such as the ''[[Chevrolet Malibu|1965 Chevy Malibu]]'' or the ''[[Ford Ranchero|1972 Ford Ranchero.]]''\n\nSeries 1 from 2005 consisted of 25 models, each with all-metal body and chassis, decked out with Spectraflame paint, in packages similar to those used from 1968 to 1972. Each car had a retail price of about three to four dollars ([[USD]]) and each of the 25 cars were released with 7 or 8 different colors. Models included the ''[[Chevrolet Bel Air|1957 Chevy Bel Air]]'' (pictured at the right), the ''[[Ford Thunderbird|1963 Ford T-Bird]]'', and the ''[[Pontiac GTO|1965 Pontiac GTO]]''.\n\nThere were also track sets in similar retro packaging, and [[1:18 scale]] ''Hot Wheels Classics''. The Classics version of the ''Purple'' ''Passion'' was released with ''Real Riders'' tires at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. Mattel also produced a ''Classics'' ''[[Oldsmobile 442|Olds 442]]'' in Spectraflame blue for the 2005 Toy Fair.\n\nIn late 2005, Series 2 now consisted of 30 models including the ''[[Chevrolet Camaro|1967 Camaro Convertible]]'', the ''[[Dodge Charger (B-body)|1969 Dodge Charger]]'', and a ''[[Ford Mustang (first generation)|1965 Mustang GT]]''. There was also supposed to be a separate ''[[Funny Car|Mustang Funny Car]]'' (as listed on the blisterpack rear checklist) but this was apparently changed to a ''[[Plymouth Barracuda|Plymouth Barracuda Funny Car]]'' during production.\n\nIn 2006, a Series 3 line of Classics was introduced, again containing 30 models with multiple colors of each vehicle. Models included the ''[[Pontiac Firebird|'69 Pontiac Firebird]]'', a ''[[Meyers Manx]]'' [[dune buggy]], and the [[Richard Petty]] ''[[Plymouth Superbird|'70 Plymouth \"Superbird\"]]''.\n\nIn 2007, Series 4 debuted with just fifteen models. However, in recognition of the 40th anniversary there were two packaging versions available - models came with a collectible metal badge (featuring a portrait of the involved vehicle) or were sold alone as in the previous three series. Models included a [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|''VW Karmann Ghia'']], a ''[[Mercury Cougar|'68 Mercury Cougar]]'', and the ''[[The Red Baron (custom car)|\"Red Baron\" hot rod]]''. For its 40th anniversary in 2008, Hot Wheels celebrated the making of its four billionth car with the production of a diamond-studded model worth US$140,000. It had 2,700 diamond chips, a total of almost 23 [[karat]]s, and was cast in [[white gold]], with [[ruby|rubies]] serving as taillights.<ref>Burgess, Phil, ''National Dragster'' editor.  \"Diamonds in the rough, gators on wheels, diamonds on cars, and how to move a billion dollars\", written 20 February 2008, at [https://www.nhra.com/news/2008/diamonds-rough-gators-wheels-diamonds-cars-and-how-move-billion-dollars   NHRA.com] (retrieved 16 September 2018)</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Series 5 has 30 models. For the first time, there are chase cars in the classics series. These cars feature ''Real'' ''Riders'' rubber tires. A few models included are ''Copper Stopper'', ''[[Pontiac GTO|1970 Pontiac GTO]]'', and ''Hammer'' ''Sled''.\n\n==Special model lines==\nHot Wheels has also released slightly larger, more detailed models, such as the original ''Gran'' ''Toros'' (1/43 scale) from 1970, and the ''Dropstars'' line (a model line of \"blinged\" cars). Also in this larger scale are the ''HIN'' ([[Hot Import Nights]]), ''G-Machines'' and ''Customs'' lines. These lines were introduced in 2004\u20132005.\n\nHot Wheels has produced many replica [[Scale model|scale models]] in the industry standard 1/43, 1/24 and 1/18 scales. In 2004, it released a 1/12 scale replica of the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)|C6 Corvette]].\n\nHot Wheels also in the early 1990s introduced a series known as the California Customs. A line of cars that had a California theme.\n\nOther lines from Hot Wheels include: ''R-R-Rumblers & Chopcycles'' (motorcycles introduced in 1971), ''Hotbirds'' (metal airplanes), ''Sizzlers'', ''XV Racers'', ''Hot Tunerz'' and ''Stockerz''.\n\nOver the years, Mattel has also teamed up with other retail organizations to produce special models available through those retailers. The list of retailers includes [[Avon Products|Avon]], [[Chuck E. Cheese's|Chuck E. Cheese]], Dinty Moore, [[FAO Schwarz]], Full Grid, [[General Mills]], [[Getty Oil|Getty]], HEB, Hills, [[Hormel]], Hughes Family Markets, [[J. C. Penney|JC Penney]], [[JC Whitney]], [[KB Toys|Kay-Bee Toys]], [[Kmart|K-Mart,]] [[Kellogg's]], [[Kool-Aid]], [[Kroger]], [[Lexmark]], Liberty Promotions (contracted the series of special models for [[Jiffy Lube]] and [[Penske]]), [[McKee Foods|Little Debbie Snacks]], [[MOM Brands|Malt-O-Meal]], [[McDonald's]], [[Mervyn's]], [[Otter Pops]], [[Roses (store)|Rose's Discount Stores]], [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Schwan's Company|Tony's Pizza]], [[Toys \"R\" Us|Toys-R-Us]], [[76 (gas station)|Union 76]], [[Ashland Inc.|Valvoline]], [[Pinnacle Foods|Van de Kamp's]], [[Walmart|WalMart]], and [[White's Guide to Collecting]], as well as several [[Major League Baseball]] franchises to name a few.\n\nIn 2016 Hot Wheels released a special collection for the 50th anniversary of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]\u2019 1966 song \u201c[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]].\u201d The collections includes five cars, a VW microbus and a yellow submarine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/06/08/beatles-yellow-submarine-50th-anniversary-hot-wheels/|title=Hot Wheels unveil Beatles' 'Yellow Submarine' 50th anniversary collection|date=2016-06-08|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-07-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Made by other companies===\nIn some cases, Hot Wheels dies have been sold or acquired by other companies once Mattel has finished using them.  One example were early dies that made their way to Argentina and were reproduced as [[Muky]]s, though not with spectra-flame paints or the same quality as seen in Mattel's products.\n\n===Hot Wheels Elite and Hot Wheels Mattel===\nHot Wheels have a series called ''Hot Wheels Elite'' and ''Hot Wheels Mattel''. The ''Elite'' Hot Wheels are 1:18, 1:43 and 1:50 highly detailed [[Die casting|diecast]]; the majority of them are based on [[Ferrari|Ferraris]]. They are more expensive than the ''[[Mattel]]'' models, which aren't as highly detailed and cheaper, as the ''Elite'' versions are licensed by [[Ferrari]], so for Hot Wheels ''Mattel'' models, they have to add cheap parts, like plastic to make them cheaper. The Hot Wheels ''Elite'' series have a \"mini\" series, which can be seen on the website. Two of the popular limited 1:18 Hot Wheels ''Elite'' series' are the '''Ferrari in Music''' and '''Cult Classics''' The music series features singers' and rappers' Ferraris, including [[Jamiroquai]]'s [[Jay Kay|Jay Kay']]s Black [[Enzo Ferrari (automobile)|Enzo Ferrari]].\n\n===Car Culture===\nIn 2016 Hot Wheels started a new line of Collector's models, in a line called ''Car Culture''. \nCar Culture is Hot Wheels' line of Premium 1:64 models with metal bodies and bases, two-piece wheels with rubber tires, and more detailed decorations. Intended for adult collectors primarily, these models retail for roughly 6-7 times the cost of a mainstream 1:64 Hot Wheels model. \n\nThis line was kicked off with the release of \"''Japan Historics''\", a set of five Japanese [[Sports car|sports cars]]. Every year at least four more sets are introduced.\nAll ''Car Culture'' sets have five cars, and often have new castings created for the sets. The number five spot in the set is usually reserved for the newest casting in the set.\n''Car Culture'' cars are typically based on real automobiles; however in 2018, Hot Wheels introduced a set called \"''Team'' ''Transport''\", which included some fantasy truck castings. (Although \"''Team'' ''Transport''\" is labeled under the ''Car Culture'' line, they are a separate category of ''Car Culture'' vehicles than the usual 5-car sets, possessing different [[Barcodes|barcodes]] and prices).\nThese cars retail for over three times the retail price of a \"basic\" car, and are produced in significantly fewer numbers.\n\nIn 2018, for Hot Wheels' 50th Anniversary, Car Culture card sizes were increased, along with the amount of decorations on the cars. A Hot Wheels \"50th anniversary\" logo was also placed beside the set's name on the packaging.\n\n==''Treasure Hunt'' series==\n''Treasure'' ''Hunt'' (sometimes '''T-Hunt''') is a line of Hot Wheels cars, introduced by [[Mattel]] in 1995. It consisted of 12 cars every year (15 beginning in 2011) with one or two released per month. The original production run was 10,000 of each car worldwide; that number has since risen due to the increasing demand for and popularity of Hot Wheels as a collector's item.\n\nTreasure Hunt vehicles are identifiable by a label on the package. The blister card said \"''Treasure'' ''Hunt''\" or \"''T-Hunt''\" on a green bar, sometimes with an illustration of a [[treasure chest]]. Since 2013, ''Treasure'' ''Hunts'' do not have the green stripe anymore; instead, the cars are recognizable with a \"flame in a circle logo\" on the vehicle and behind it on the card. The cars were decorated with flashy designs and special \"rubber\" wheels before 2007.\n\nIn 2007, Mattel introduced a two-tiered ''Treasure Hunt'' system.  A regular ''Treasure Hunt'' will feature normal enamel paint and normal wheels like other Hot Wheels cars. The production of these is rumored to be greater than previous T-Hunts. \n''\"Super\" Treasure Hunts'' are much harder to find. Like ''Treasure'' ''Hunts'' of the past, a ''Super Treasure Hunt'' features premium wheels and Spectraflame paint, as well as (starting in 2015), a golden-colored circle-flame logo printed on the card behind the car.\nMany Hot Wheels collectors have noticed in recent times that the US Basic mixes are more likely to have a ''Super Treasure Hunt'' in them compared to International Mixes. \n\nBefore 2013, all 12 ''Treasure Hunt'' cars of a year were released in both regular and super versions. In 2012, ''Super Treasure Hunts'' came with special paint and wheels, but with series designation on the card. However, the regular ''T-hunts'' retained a special ''T-Hunt'' series card. Mattel stopped using special cards for all ''Treasure'' ''Hunts'' in 2013. Some U.S. releases in 2014 had the phrase \"This symbol on the vehicle lets you know it is hard to find and highly collectible\".\nHowever, in 2016, this was changed to \"Congratulations! This symbol means you just found a collectable treasure-hunt car!\". This would be under a silver flame logo on the card for ''T-Hunts''. In 2015, Supers featured a gold logo on the card. Generally, Hot Wheels has targeted both kids and adults with the ''T-Hunt'' series, focusing more on the adult collecting market with Supers.\n\n==Live action film project==\nOn January 30, 2003, [[Columbia Pictures]] announced they had gained exclusive rights to developing a feature film based on the toy line ''Hot Wheels'' with [[McG]] attached to direct.<ref>{{cite web|author=KJB|title=McG to Direct ''Hot Wheels'' Movie|work=[[IGN]]|date=2003-01-30|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/384/384454p1.html|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> Although unwritten, the premise involved a young man \"trying to reconcile with his father.

(The ''X-V racers'' of the 1990s were similar.) They were introduced in 1970 and became immediately popular. ''Sizzlers'' run on the regular \"orange\" Hot Wheels track, and Mattel created special race sets with U-Turns, multi-level spirals and loops to take advantage of the cars' electric motor. Two lane race sets such as the California/8 race set were developed that allowed ''Sizzlers'' to race side-by side, until Mattel created the black ''Fat Track'' which is three lanes wide with steep banked curves and designed to allow ''Sizzlers'' to run free. In action, Sizzlers supposedly display a unique, competitive \"passing action\" when running on the ''Fat Track'', as if each car were piloted by an impatient driver trying to jockey ahead of the rest. The ''Fat Track'' sets included the \"Big O\", \"California 500\", and \"Super Circuit\" race sets, and accessories such as the \"Scramble Start\" (a four-car starting gate), \"Lap Computer\" four car lap counter, and \"Race-Timer\" stop watch.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sizzler Cal8 set.jpg|left|thumb|Early Sizzlers race set{{Pufc|1=Sizzler Cal8 set.jpg|log=2012 February 15}}]] -->\n\nSix cars were made in 1970, 12 cars were made in 1971, and 4 cars were made in 1972. The ''\"Fat Daddy\" Sizzlers'' (oversized bodies with huge tires) were introduced in 1973. Mattel put the Sizzlers on a hiatus after that year, and in 1976 they created ''Sizzlers II''. That next year, the ''Night Ridin' Sizzlers'' (which had headlights you could turn on or off) were created. Mattel permanently stopped ''Sizzlers'' production in 1978.They were replaced by another spin off named ''Scorchers''.The ''Scorchers'' were [[Wind-up toy|\"pull back\" cars]] which would a clock spring when pulled backwards a short distance, which then propelled them forward for several feet.\n\n''Sizzlers'' were (and are) charged with four or two [[D battery]] chargers called the ''Juice Machine'' and ''Goose Pump'' respectively. Later, the ''Power Pit'' was introduced\u2014which was an electric charger that plugged into any household [[Alternating current|AC]] outlet and resembled a race track garage or [[pit stop]]. A 90-second charge of the tiny internal [[Nickel\u2013cadmium battery|NiCad]] battery gives up to five minutes of useful run time. It was claimed by advertisers that the 90-second charge time was \"the longest minute and a half in a kid's life\" as they waited impatiently for the car to charge sufficiently to get back into the race.\n\nThe ''Sizzler'' electric technology spun off into the ''Hotline Trains'', which ran on track similar to regular Hot Wheels, and the ''Earthshakers'' [[Heavy equipment|construction vehicles]]. Both lines of vehicles were charged using the ''Sizzler Juice Machine'' or ''Power Pit''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Mattel's trademark on the \"Sizzlers\" name had lapsed and toy company [[Playing Mantis (company)|Playing Mantis]] released a line new Sizzlers line in [[NASCAR]] [[Stock car racing|stock car]] models and copied the ''Fat Track'' as the \"''Stocker 400''\" and \"''Mach 500''\" track sets to capitalize on the booming popularity of NASCAR in that decade. The ''Juice Machine'' was renamed the \"''Mega-Charger''\" and incorporated a more efficient \"[[Trickle charging|trickle charge]]\" rather than the \"dump charge\" of the original machines. Interest in the toys began to increase once again. They were taken off the market after Mattel filed a lawsuit against Playing Mantis.  However, ''Sizzlers'' returned again in 2006, when Mattel struck an exclusive deal with [[Target Corporation|Target]] stores to re-release ''Sizzlers'' cars, the \"''Big O''\" Fat track, Juice Machine and car carrying case\u2014all in the original packaging from the 1970s. As of January 2009, the Sizzlers line has been discontinued by Target.\n\nIn 2011, ''Sizzlers'' have been re-released as ''[[Cars 2]]'' characters, and were sold at Target stores. This line was called ''Charge Ups'' and released under the Mattel [[Brand|brand name]] but not as part of the Hot Wheels line.\n\n==Promotion and sponsorships==\nHot Wheels appeared in the 2016 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].\n\n===Motorsports===\n[[File:Kyle Petty PE2 Pontiac Phoenix 1997.jpg|thumb|The Hot Wheels-sponsored car of [[Kyle Petty]] in 1997]]\nStarting in 1970, professional drag racers [[Don Prudhomme]] (\"The Snake\") and [[Tom McEwen (drag racer)|Tom McEwen]] (\"The Mongoose\") were sponsored by Hot Wheels, and later on, Hot Wheels created the ''Snake and Mongoose Drag Set'' in 1970. Later somewhere in 1972, the second versions of both driver's self-titled [[Funny Car|funny cars]] were released, when McEwen had the ''Mongoose 2'', and Prudhomme had the ''Snake 2''. The drag set remained the same. Then, Hot Wheels made [[Dragster (car)|rail-type]] dragster versions of them, based on the actual funny cars and was featured in the ''Wild Wheelie Set''. Later in Hot Wheels' lifespan, the normal drag set with Snake and Mongoose were still being produced. The latest set with the Snake and Mongoose is in the ''Drag-Strip Demons'' lineup.\n\nIn 1992, Hot Wheels sponsored the [[Trans-Am]] car of [[Jack Baldwin (racing driver)|Jack Baldwin]] as he went on to win that year's championship. Hot Wheels signed a sponsorship deal in 1997 with [[NASCAR]] driver [[Kyle Petty]] and the No. 44 [[PE2 Motorsports]] car<ref name=\"Hot Wheels is back in the driver's seat\">{{cite web|url=http://news.mattel.com/news/hot-wheels-r-is-back-in-the-driver-s-seat-with-nascar|title=Hot Wheels(R) Is Back in the Driver's Seat With NASCAR|work=[[Mattel]]|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref> and thus began making replicas of NASCAR stock cars.

22, 2019}}</ref>\n|discontinued= \n}}\n'''Hot Wheels''' is a brand of [[die-cast toy]] [[cars]] introduced by American toy maker [[Mattel]] in 1968. It was the primary competitor of [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] until 1997, when Mattel bought [[Tyco Toys]], then-owner of Matchbox. \n\nMany [[automobile manufacturers]] have since licensed Hot Wheels to make [[scale model]]s of their cars, allowing the use of original design [[blueprint]]s and detailing. Although Hot Wheels were originally intended for children and young adults, they have become popular with adult collectors, for whom [[limited edition]] models are now made available.\n\n==History==\n===1968===\nThe original Hot Wheels were made by [[Elliot Handler]]. Hot Wheels were conceived to be more like \"hot rod\" (i.e.[[Custom car|customized]]/[[Hot rod|modified]] or even [[Caricature|caricaturized]] or [[fantasy]] cars,  often with [[Racing slick|big rear tires]], [[Supercharger|superchargers]], flame paint-jobs, outlandish proportions, etc.) cars, as compared to [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] cars which were generally small-scale models of production cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redlinederby.com/topic/speed-test-hot-wheels-vs-matchbox/7|title=Speed test, Hot Wheels vs. Matchbox|work=Redline Derby|date=April 26, 2014|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref> \"Sweet 16\" There were sixteen castings released on May 18, 1968, eleven of them designed by [[Harry Bentley Bradley]].<ref name=\"Coffee Break Design History\" /> The first one produced was a dark blue \"''Custom [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]]''\".<ref name=\"Fox\" /> Bradley was from the car industry and had designed the body for the (full-sized) [[Deora (custom car)|Dodge Deora]] concept car and the ''Custom Fleetside'', (based on his own customized 1968 [[Chevrolet C-10]] Fleetside).\n\nIn 1968, the first production line of Hot Wheels Cars is known as ''The Original Sweet 16'', which is the first of the Red Line Series, meaning the tires have a red [[Pinstriping|pin stripe]] on their sides.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Aaron|url=https://www.thrillist.com/cars/16-things-you-didn-t-know-about-hot-wheels-history-facts-and-trivia|title=16 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HOT WHEELS|publisher=[[Thrillist Media Group]]|date=January 8, 2016|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Racing track set===\nIn addition to the cars themselves, Mattel produced a racing track set (sold separately). Though it would be updated throughout the years, the original track consisted of a series of brightly colored orange road sections (pieced together to form an oblong, circular race track), with one (or sometimes two) \"super chargers\" (faux service stations through which cars passed on the tracks, featuring battery-powered spinning wheels, which would propel the cars along the tracks).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://onlineredlineguide.com/accessories/super_charger/super_charger.html|title=Super Charger|work=Online Redline Guide|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref>An important feature here was Hot Wheel's use of wide, hard-plastic tires that created much less friction and tracked more smoothly than the narrow metal or plastic wheels used on contemporary Matchboxes; Hot Wheels cars were designed to roll easily and at high speeds, which was a great innovation at the time. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toyhalloffame.org/toys/hot-wheels|title=Hot Wheels {{!}} National Toy Hall of Fame|website=www.toyhalloffame.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>\n\n===1969===\nAs it turned out, the Hot Wheels brand was a staggering success. The series completely [[Disruptive innovation|disrupted the whole industry]] for small [[Die-cast toy|die-cast car]] models from 1968 onwards, forcing the competition at [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] and elsewhere to completely rethink their concepts, and to scramble to try to recover lost ground. Harry Bentley Bradley did not think that would be the case and had quit Mattel to go back to the car industry. When the company asked him back, he recommended a good friend, Ira Gilford. Gilford, who had just left [[Chrysler]], quickly accepted the job of designing the next Hot Wheels models. Some of Hot Wheels' greatest cars, such as the '''Twin [[Internal combustion engine|Mill]]''' and '''Splittin' Image''', came from Ira Gilford's drawing board.<ref name=\"Coffee Break Design History\">{{cite web|last=Gerber|first=Alison|url=http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/coffee-break-history-of-the-hot-wheels-race-car-212651|title=Coffee Break Design History: Hot Wheels|publisher=[[Apartment Therapy]]|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the 1967 line was solidified and consolidated with the 1969 releases, with which Hot Wheels effectively established itself as the hottest brand of small toy car models in the USA. ''Splittin' Image'', ''Torero'', ''Turbofire'', and ''Twin Mill'' were part of the \"Show & Go\" series and are the very first original in-house designs by Hot Wheels.\n\nThe initial prototypes of the '''Beach'' ''Bomb''' were faithful to the shape of a real [[Volkswagen Type 2|VW Type 2 \"bus\"]], and had two [[Surfboard|surfboards]] sticking out the back window, in a nod to the VW's perceived association with the surfing community and the slang term for a person who spends much time surfing - a '[[Surf culture|beach bum]]'.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/historic-hot-wheels-cars-glimpse-back-die-cast-models-gallery-1.2266872|title=Historic Hot Wheels cars: A glimpse back at the first die-cast model|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref> During the fledgling Hot Wheels era, Mattel wanted to make sure that each of the cars could be used with any of the playsets and stunt track sets. Unfortunately, testing showed that this early version (now known among collectors as the '''Rear-Loader Beach Bomb''', or 'RLBB') was too narrow to roll effectively on Hot Wheels track or be powered by the Super Charger, and was too top-heavy to negotiate high-speed corners.\n\nHot Wheels designers Howard Rees and Larry Wood modified the casting, extending the side fenders to accommodate the track width, as well as providing a new place on the vehicle to store each of the plastic surfboards. The roof was also cut away and replaced by a full-length [[sunroof]], to lower the [[Center of mass|center of gravity]]. Nicknamed the '''Side-loader''' by collectors, this was the production version of the Beach Bomb.\n\nThe ''Rear-Loader Beach Bomb'' is widely considered the \"[[Holy Grail]]\", or ultimate pinnacle, of a serious Hot Wheels collection. An unknown number were made as test subjects and given to employees. A regular production ''Beach Bomb'' may be worth up to $600, depending on condition. Market prices on ''RLBBs'' however, have easily reached the five-figure plateau, ranging from $70,000 to $120,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=McTavish|first=Brian|url=http://cjonline.com/stories/111499/kan_hotwheels.shtml#.WGQJu1MrKUk|title=Overland Park man gets $72,000 for rare Hot Wheels van|newspaper=[[Kansas City Star]]|date=November 19, 1999|accessdate=December 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229032627/http://cjonline.com/stories/111499/kan_hotwheels.shtml#.WGQJu1MrKUk|archive-date=December 29, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The [[Petersen Automotive Museum]] in Los Angeles had a pink ''RLBB'' in its Hot Wheels exhibit, displayed alone on a rotating platform under glass. The Hot Wheels Collectors Club released a new, updated version of the ''Rear Loading Beach Bomb'' in 2002 as a [[Special edition|limited edition]].\n\n===1970s===\n1970 was a very successful year for Hot Wheels, so Mattel came up with a new [[advertising slogan]] for the cars: \"Go With the Winner\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Philip|url=http://www.battlegrip.com/go-with-the-winner-in-these-1970-hot-wheels-commercials/|title=\u201cGo with the winner!\u201d in these 1970 Hot Wheels Commercials|publisher=BattleGrip.com|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref> 43 new cars appeared this year. This was also the year that '''Sizzlers''' and '''Heavyweights''' lines appeared. Howard Rees, who worked with Ira Gilford, was tired of designing cars. He wanted to work on the [[Major Matt Mason]] [[action figure]] toy line-up. Rees had a good friend by the name of Larry Wood. They had worked together at [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] designing cars. When Wood found out about Hot Wheels at a party Rees was holding, Rees offered Wood the job of designing Hot Wheels models. Wood agreed, and by the end of the week, Wood was working at Mattel. His first design would be the '''Tri-Baby'''. After 36 years, Wood still works for Hot Wheels.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gay|first=Gerald|url=http://tucson.com/entertainment/outdoors/hot-wheels-royalty-to-serve-as-grand-marshal-at-rodders/article_dacf0e13-927c-536b-84c8-a7d0dcff9dfd.html|title=Hot Wheels royalty to serve as grand marshal at Rodders Days event|newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|date=May 8, 2014|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother designer, Paul Tam, joined Wood and Gilford. Tam's first design for Hot Wheels was the '''Whip Creamer'''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Von Bogart|first=Angelo|date=August 31, 2009|title=Hot Wheels Classic Redline Era: Hot Wheels - Birth of the Redline|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=1440221707}}</ref> Tam continued to work for Mattel until 1973. Among the many fantastic designs Tam thought up for Hot Wheels, some of the collector's favorites include '''Evil Weevil''' (a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] with two engines), '''Open Fire''' (an [[AMC Gremlin]] with six wheels), '''[[Revolver|Six Shooter]]''' (another six wheeled car), and the rare '''Double Header''' (co-designed with Larry Wood).\n\nThe year 1970 introduced \"[[Don Prudhomme|the Snake]] and [[Tom McEwen (drag racer)|the Mongoose]]\", a manufactured 'rivalry' between two professional [[Drag racing|drag racers]] calling themselves \"the Snake\" and \"the [[Mongoose]]\" for the purposes of publicity. This was notably drag racing's first major non-automotive [[Sponsor (commercial)|corporate sponsor]], and the beginning of the [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]]\u2019s booming popularity with large-budget teams and championships. 1970 also introduced the first 'Silver Series', which contained three silver-painted models: the '''Boss Hoss''', the '''Heavy'' ''[[Chevrolet|Chevy]]''', and the '''King '[[Plymouth Barracuda|Kuda]]''', which were only obtainable through a mail-in offer that included a membership to the Hot Wheels Club. These three cars featured \"[[Supercharger|supercharged]]\" engines (featuring large [[Roots-type supercharger|Roots blowers]]) without hoods, and open [[Exhaust manifold|exhaust headers]], after the style of drag racing cars of the era. Popular among children, these 'Silver Cars' were considered faster than the rest of the Hot Wheels lineup, because they were supposedly heavier than the other gravity models, but the accuracy of this claim has never been tested under scientific conditions.\n\nHowever, 1972 and 1973 were slow years. Only seven new models were made in 1972. Of the 24 models appearing for 1973, only three were new models. Also the cars changed from Mattel's in-house ''Spectraflame'' colors to mostly drab, solid [[Enamel paint|enamel]] colors, which mainstream Hot Wheels cars still use today. Due to low sales, and the fact that the majority of the [[Casting (metalworking)|castings]] were not re-used in later years, the 1972-3 models are known to be very collectible.\n\nIn 1974, Hot Wheels introduced its '[[Maritime flag|''Flying'' ''Colors'']]' line, and added flashy decals and [[Pad printing|\"tampo-printed\"]] paint designs which helped revitalize sales. As with the lower-friction wheels in 1968, this innovation was revolutionary in the industry, and\u2014although far less effective in terms of sales impact than in 1968\u2014was copied by the competition, who did not want to be outmaneuvered again by Mattel product strategists.\n\nIn 1977, the 'Redline Wheel' was phased out, with the red lines no longer being printed on the wheels. This cut costs, but also reflected that the prototypical \"red line tires\" popular on high-speed-rated automotive tires during the era of [[muscle car]]s and [[Polyglas]] tires were no longer popular.  During this period, there was a trend away from wild [[Hot rod|hot rods]] and fantastic cars, and a move to more realistic cars and trucks, like the competitor Matchbox.\n\n===1977\u20131988: The 'Blackwalls' era===\nIn 1981, '''Hot Ones''' wheels were introduced, which had gold-painted hubs, and claimed to have thinner axles for greater speed, along with additional suspension compliance that older production Hot Wheels lacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nchwa.com/1981.html|title=1981|work=North Carolina Hot Wheels Association|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref> '''Ultra Hot Wheels'''  were introduced in 1984, and looked something like the cast alloy wheels found on a 1980s-era high-trim [[Renault Fuego]] or a [[Mazda 626]], with three parallel dark lines cutting diagonally across the flat chrome face of the wheel, all three broken in the center to form six individual shorter lines. These new \"''Ultra Hots''\" claimed further speed improvements. Hot Wheels started offering models based on 1980s-era [[Sports car|sports]] and [[Economy car|economy cars]], like the [[Pontiac Fiero]] or [[Dodge Omni 024]], in addition to their typical '[[hot rod]]' and [[muscle car]] style offerings. In 1983, a new style of wheel called '''Real Riders''' were introduced, which featured real rubber tires.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ragan|first=Mac|title=Hot Wheels Cars|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|date=2001|isbn=076030839X}}</ref> Despite the fact that they were very popular, the Real Riders line was short-lived, because of high production costs. In the late 1980s, the so-called '''Blue'' ''Card''' [[blister pack]] color scheme was introduced, which would become the basis of Hot Wheels colors still used today (original blister packs were red and yellow.\n\nTwo other innovations were introduced briefly in Hot Wheels cars in the 1980s \u2013 ''Thermal Color Change'' paint, and rotating 'crash panel' vehicles (\"''Crack-Ups''\"). The former were able to change color on exposure to hot or cold water, and there were an initial release of 20 different cars, available as sets of three vehicles. The latter were vehicles with a panel that, on contact, would rotate to reveal a reverse side which appeared to be heavily dented. Variations in crash-panels included front, rear and side panels, the last of whose mechanism has proven to be the most durable.\n\nIn the 1980s, Hot Wheels had gotten into a controversy with [[General Motors]]' [[Chevrolet Motors Division]]. In 1982, the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] had ended the curvaceous \"[[Mako Shark (concept car)|Mako Shark]]\" body-style that had been in production for almost 15 years, and GM announced that the Corvette would be redesigned. In 1983, Chevrolet started to produce the all new [[Chevrolet Corvette (C4)|C4 Corvette]] but had assembly line problems which pushed production back 6 months causing GM's Marketing Department to label all 1983s as 1984s once they got production perfected so it would seem to the public that the all-new C4 Corvette came out early rather than late. But Hot Wheels saw what the new model of Corvette was going to look like before GM's official unveiling, and they designed a die cast version of the 1984 Corvette. GM was angered and almost pulled its licensing with Mattel, but this controversy helped Corvette buffs see what the new Corvette was going to look like. The 1984 Corvette production ran for 1.5 model years covering half of the remaining 1983 model year and ending on time for the 1985 model year.  \n\nIn conjunction with [[Epyx]] Software, Mattel released a [[PC game|computer game]] edition of Hot Wheels for various [[8-bit]] [[Computing platform|platforms]] in 1985, as part of the Computer Activity Toys series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retroist.com/2011/09/01/epyx-presents-hot-wheels-for-the-commodore-64/|title=Epyx Presents Hot Wheels for the Commodore 64 - The Retroist|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|access-date=13 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504072443/http://www.retroist.com/2011/09/01/epyx-presents-hot-wheels-for-the-commodore-64/|archive-date=4 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===1989\u20131994: The collector number era===\nIn 1989, Mattel released collector numbers. Each car had its own number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nchwa.com/numbers.html|title=Numbers|work=North Carolina Hot Wheels Association|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref> The cards were all blue, for all blister packs released from 1989\u20131994. Numbers included went as high as 274; however, these were skip numbered, and numbers such as 48, 61, and 173 were not used.{{Attribution needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== 1995\u20131999: The Treasure Hunt era ===\nThe year 1995 brought a major change to the Hot Wheels line, where the cars were split up into series. One was the 1995 Model Series, which included all of that year's new castings. In 1996, the Model Series was renamed to First Editions. 1995 also saw the introduction of the ''[[Treasure Hunt Series]]'' (see below). The rest of the series included four cars with paint schemes that followed a theme. For example, the ''[[Pearl Diver|Pearl Driver]]'' cars all had [[Iridescence|pearlescent]] paint. Sales for the series models soared with another program also introduced that year called the ''Bonus'' ''Car'' program, causing stores across the nation to have shortages. Purchasing the four car sets and sending in the packaging backs plus a handling fee gave you the opportunity to collect the bonus cars, 1 each released for each quarter of the year starting in 1996 through at least 2000. Several new wheel designs were also introduced in the 1990s.\n\nMattel bought Tyco Toys in 1997. Along with the purchase came old competitor Matchbox. Arguably the two dominant companies in matchbox-sized cars were now under one roof.\n\nIn 1998, Mattel celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Hot Wheels brand by replicating various cars and individual packaging from its 30-year history and packaging these replicated vehicles in special 30th Anniversary boxes. In 1999, Hot Wheels Interactive was launched.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nA new generation of Hot Wheels Designers came in. Eric Tscherne and Fraser Campbell along with former designer Paul Tam's son, Alec Tam, joined the design team. Many still work for Mattel today. Tscherne's ''Seared Tuner'' (formerly ''Sho-Stopper'') graced the mainline packaging from 2000 to 2003.  The ''Deora II'', one of only two Hot Wheels concept cars ever made into full-size, functional cars, was also released this year.\n\nIn 2001, Mattel issued 240 mainline releases consisting of 12 ''Treasure Hunts'', 36 ''First Editions'', 12 ''Segment Series'' with four cars each, and 144 open stock cars. Popular models that debuted include the '''Hyper'' ''Mite''' and '''Fright'' ''Bike'''.\n\nFor 2002, the mainline consisted of 12 ''Treasure Hunts'', 42 ''First Editions'', 15 ''Segment Series'' of 4 cars each, and 126 open stock cars. Popular new models included the `68 [[Mercury Cougar|Cougar]] and the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]]. Some cars from the first editions series are the ''[[Backdraft]]'', ''[[Overbore|Overbored]] [[Chevrolet big-block engine|454]]'', ''Vairy 8'', and ''[[Mazda RX-7|Super Tsunami]]''.\n\n=== 2003 ===\nHot Wheels celebrated its 35th anniversary with a full-length [[Computer animation|computer animated film]] called ''[[Hot Wheels Highway 35 World Race]]''. This movie tied into the ''Highway 35'' line of cars that featured 35 classic Hot Wheels cars with special graphics and co-molded wheels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/MAT/0x0x224660/a66ba51f-5829-4587-b88a-54a6846efd00/MAT_News_2003_2_13_Wheels_News.pdf|title=Hot Wheels\u00ae Drops The Green Flag On Its 35th Anniversary With The World Race(TM)|date=February 13, 2003|work=[[Mattel]]|format=PDF|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 2004 ===\nIn 2004, Hot Wheels unveiled its \"''Hot 100''\" line, comprising 100 new models. These new models included cartoonish vehicles such as the '''Tooned'' (vehicles based on the larger ''Hot'' ''Tunerz'' line of Hot Wheels created by Eric Tscherne{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}), ''[[Bling-bling|Blings]]'' (boxy bodies and big wheels), ''Hardnoze'' (enlarged fronts), ''Crooze'' (stretched out bodies), and ''Fatbax'' (super-wide back tires and short bodies). ''Fatbax'' models include [[Toyota]] Supra and a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)|Corvette C6]]. These vehicles did not sell as well as Mattel expected, and many could still be found in stores throughout 2005. Mattel also released 2004 ''First Editions'' cars with unpainted [[Zamac]] bodies. They were sold through [[Toys 'R' Us]] and were made in limited numbers.\n\n=== 2005 ===\nIn 2005, Hot Wheels continued with new \"extreme\" castings for the 2nd year, debuting 40 distorted cars, in addition to 20 \"''Realistix''\" models. The rest of the line included the standard 12 ''Treasure Hunts'', 10 ''Track Aces'', 50 ''Segment Series'' ''Cars'', and 50 ''Open Stock Models''. Four [[Volkswagen]] \"''Mystery'' ''Cars''\" were offered as a special mail-in promo. Each ''Mystery'' ''Car'' came with a special voucher. Upon collection of all 4 vouchers, one was able to send away for a special 13th ''Treasure'' ''Hunt'', a ''VW Drag Bus.''\n\nHot Wheels also unveiled its new \"Faster than Ever\" line of cars, which had special [[Nickel|nickel-plated]] [[axles]], along with bronze-colored ''Open-Hole 5 Spoke'' wheels. These adjustments supposedly reduce [[friction]] dramatically, resulting in cars that are called the \"''Faster than Ever''\" series. The first run of these cars were available for a limited time only, from the beginning of October towards the end of November 2005.\n\nAlso, a continuation of the movie ''Highway 35'' called ''[[Hot Wheels AcceleRacers]]'' was created, taking place two years after the events of ''Highway 35''. It is featured in four movies and many short segments where the drivers (old ones, gangs, like Teku, Metal Maniacs, the evil Racing Drones, and the stealthy Silencerz). All of the shorts and previews of the movies were placed on a temporary website that was deleted shortly after the last movie.\n\n=== 2007 and 2008 ===\nIn 2007, Mattel released 36 ''New Models'' (formerly ''First Editions''), 12 ''Treasure Hunts'' (with a hard-to-find regular version and even rarer \"''Super Treasure Hunt''\" version of each with rubber ''Real Rider'' tires and Spectraflame paint),<ref name=\"2007 Hot Wheels\">HotWheelsCollectors.com article: \"2007 Mainline Cars Headed Your Way!\"</ref> 12 'Teams' of 4 cars each (formerly ''Segment Series''), 24 ''Code'' ''Cars'' (codes imprinted inside packaging that can be used to unlock web content), 12 ''Track Stars'' (formerly ''Track Aces''), 24 ''Mystery Cars'' (packaged on a card with a opaque blister, so the buyer cannot see which car is inside without opening it), and 24 ''All Stars'' (formerly ''Open Stock''). In late 2006, a new package design for 2007 was released. Some 2006 cars and all 2007 cars are packaged on a blister card with the new design. Hot Wheels released a series called ''Modifighters'', which are similar to [[Transformers]] except for the fact that they were originally cars and were modified into robots. The ''Modifighters'' names are: Streetwyse, Skullface, Live Wire, Bedlam, Nightlife, Mr. Big, and Quick-Tyme.\n\nIn 2008, all the series and vehicles were relatively similar to 2007's cars. approximately 180 to 200 new vehicles were released.\n\n=== 2009 and 2010 ===\nIn 2009, Mattel released 42 ''New Models'', 12 ''Treasure Hunts'', 12 ''Track Stars'', 24 ''Mystery Cars'', 10 ''Segment Series'' of 10 cars, and introduced the [[Indy Car Series]] drivers.\n\nMattel released its first ever [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[Animation|animated]] episodic [[television series]] called ''[[Hot Wheels Battle Force 5]]''.  The US-version of the series was debut on [[Cartoon Network]] on August 29, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. \n\n=== 2011 ===\n2011 saw the release of 244 cars beginning with the 2011 New Car Series which includes the [[Lamborghini Gallardo|''Lamborghini Gallardo LP570-4 Superleggera'']], ''Custom [[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)|2011 Camar]]''[[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)|o]], and the ''[[DeLorean time machine]]'' from the [[Back to the Future series]]. This was followed by the 15-car ''Treasure Hunt'' series with [[1957 Chevrolet|1957 Chevy]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|1958 Chevy Impala]], 15 ''Track Stars'' including the 2010 ''Formula Street'' series, the ''10x10'' series, the ''Thrill Racers'' series, and 22 ''HW Video Game Heroes'' which were packaged with codes for an internet computer game. The new series \"Team Hot Wheels\" appear in the late 2011.\n\n=== 2012 ===\n2012 saw the release of 247 cars, beginning with the 2012 ''New Car Series'' which includes the [[Lamborghini Aventador]], [[Boss 302 Mustang|Ford Mustang Boss 302 Laguna Seca]], [[KITT]] from [[Knight Rider (franchise)|Knight Rider]], and the ever-popular [[Scooby-Doo|Scooby Doo]] ''Mystery Machine''. 2012 also released two vehicles from the ''[[Angry Birds]]'' video game consisting of the Red Bird and the green Minion Pig.\n\n=== 2013 ===\n2013 saw the release of 250 cars including ''Stunt'', ''Racing'', ''Imagination'', ''City'', and ''Showroom'', all of which contain sub-series. 2013 also saw a change in the look of the packaging cards which includes a quartet of helmeted [[motorcycle]] riders standing behind the flame logo and the ''Treasure Hunt'' series cards no longer marked with a [[Buried treasure|treasure chest]]. Some of those cars include: ''Rodzilla'', ''Fangula'', ''Twin Mill III'' (3), ''Bone'' ''Shaker'' and ''Baja'' ''Bone'' ''Shaker''.\n\nGeneral Motors also released a special [[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)#2013 Camaro Hot Wheels Special Edition|Chevrolet Camaro Hot Wheels Edition]], which was a blue [[convertible]] which offered various Hot-Wheels themed decorations throughout the car.\n\n=== 2014 ===\n2014 also saw 250 mainstream cars released with similar segments to 2013. Various [[Playset|playsets]] and other non-car merchandise was also released this year. The end of 2014 also the marks the end of the license agreement between Mattel and [[Ferrari]], meaning the 2014 release of ''Ferrari 5 Pack'' would be the last for Mattel, and the 2015 black ''[[Ferrari 599XX]]'' being the last Ferrari model appearing in mainstream, both regular model and its Treasure Hunt variant.\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n2016 lineup was similar to 2015 and 2014 in terms of segments, and the design of the card was overhauled. Some car names were TBD ([[To be announced|To Be Determined]])  or 2016 (Coming Soon). They're now divided into mini collections with their corresponding segments and their icons printed on the card. Some of them include: ''HW Showroom'', ''[[BMW]]'' (100th anniversary of BMW), ''HW Screen Time'' (Cars and characters seen on television, video games, and movies), and ''HW'' ''Snow'' ''Stormers''. New models include: ''Cruise'' ''Bruiser'', ''Side'' ''Ripper'', and ''Grass'' ''Chomper'', [[Honda NSX (second generation)|'''16 Acura NSX'']], while other models first see their release in the mainline series, such as the '''52'' ''[[Hudson Hornet]]''.\n\n=== 2017 ===\nThis year saw a major change in casting numbering. Since that moment, recolors are named with a different number than the original, thus causing the number limit of cars to expand to 365. The idea of numbering a casting with a number corresponding to their own series was also aborted. There were also some new mainline series introduced, such as ''Experimotors'' (cars with moving parts, or a secondary purpose), ''Holiday Racers'' (cars that have a holiday based theme), ''Factory Fresh'' (a series including newer, sometimes older castings with fabric painting) and ''Camaro Fifty'' (a series dedicated to the [[Chevrolet Camaro]], and its 50th anniversary).\n\n==The \"Sweet 16\"==\nThe '''Sweet 16''' is the first production line of Hot Wheels for the year 1968. The lineup consists of the following:\n*'''''[[Beatnik Bandit]]'''''\n*'''''[[Cadillac El Dorado|Custom El Dorado]]'''''\n*'''''[[Chevrolet Camaro|Custom Camaro]]'''''\n*'''''[[Chevrolet Corvette|Custom Corvette]]'''''\n*'''''[[Chevrolet C-10|Custom Fleetside]]'''''\n*'''''[[Deora (custom car)|Deora]]'''''\n*'''''[[Ford Mustang|Custom Mustang]]'''''\n*'''''[[Ford T-Bird|Custom T-Bird]]'''''\n*'''''[[Ford Model T|Hot Heap]]'''''\n*'''''[[Ford GT-40|Ford J-Car]]'''''\n*'''''[[Mercury Cougar|Custom Cougar]]'''''\n*'''''[[Pontiac Firebird|Custom Firebird]]'''''\n*'''''[[Plymouth Barracuda|Custom Barracuda]]'''''\n*'''''[https://kustomrama.com/wiki/Car_Craft_Dream_Rod Python] (also known as Cheetah)'''''\n*'''''Silhouette'''''\n*'''''[[Volkswagen Beetle|Custom Volkswagen]]'''''\n\n==Collectors==\n\n[[File:Sanfy's 2000s HotWheels collection.jpg|thumb|Few samples from a 2000s Hot Wheels toy collection.]]\n\nThrough the years, Hot Wheels cars have been collected mostly by children, but since the late 1990s, there has been an increase in the number of adult collectors. Mattel estimates that 41 million children grew up playing with the toys, the average collector has over 1,550 cars, and children between the ages of 5 and 15 have an average of 41 cars. Most believe the collecting craze started with the ''Treasure'' ''Hunts'' in 1995. Mike Strauss has been called the father of Hot Wheels collecting; he has organized two collectors' events each year in some form since 1986. The first event was the Annual Hot Wheels Collectors Convention, normally held each year in the fall. The convention occurred in various locations around the country until 2001, when the first Annual Hot Wheels Collectors Nationals was put together. Since then, the Conventions are held each year in southern California. The Hot Wheels Collectors Nationals rotate among cities outside of California during the spring. Strauss has also published the quarterly Hot Wheels Newsletter since 1986 and was one of the first to unite collectors all over the world. He also writes the ''Tomart's Price Guide To Hot Wheels'', a book listing history, car descriptions and values, which is used by almost every collector to learn more about the hobby and their collection. Strauss sold his collection in 2011 and retired from the Hot Wheels Newsletter.\n\nThere are hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of web pages dedicated to Hot Wheels collecting. Collectors are seeking everything related to Hot Wheels, from only new castings to only Red Lines and everything in between. For the most part it is a relatively inexpensive hobby, when compared with [[coin collecting]], [[stamp collecting]] or [[Barbie]] collecting, with mainline cars costing about $0.97-$1.08 (USD) at retail. The price has not changed much in almost 40 years, although in real terms the models have dropped significantly in price (a Hot Wheels car cost $0.98 in 1968 and costs $0.98 today, in spite of inflation). After the cars are no longer available at retail the cost can vary significantly. A common car may sell for less than retail, while some of the more difficult cars can sell for many hundred or even thousands of dollars. The highest price paid for a Hot Wheels car was close to $70,000 in 2000 for a pre-production version of a ''Volkswagen Rear Loader Beach Bomb'' (the asking price was $72,000). The Beach Bomb is a VW microbus with a pair of surfboards poking out the rear window. This design failed initial testing, proving to be top-heavy and not functional with the Power Booster track accessory. A widened version with the surfboards mounted in side slots was designed and released for the 1969 model year, making the \"rear loader\" version a rarity and very sought-after piece. As of 2018, there are about 50 \"rear loaders\" known to exist. <ref>{{cite journal | last =Mort | first =Norm   | title =Red Hot and Rolling at 40  | journal =[[Sports Car Market]]  | volume =20 | issue =5  | pages =44\u201345  |date=May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Dates on cars===\nThe date on the base of a Hot Wheels car is a design copyright date, not a manufacturing date. (Example: \u00a92008 Mattel).\n\nThe date is the copyright date for the casting of the car, not a production date. The date is usually the year before the car was first released, but not always. Sometimes it is sometimes the same year, but there are a few cases where the copyright is several years before a car's first release. For example, a car in the 2001 First Editions series called Evil Twin, was released in 2001 but the year dated on the bottom of the car is 2000. The copyright date will usually not change through the lifetime of a casting. For example, the Twin Mill, first released in 1969, still has a 1969 copyright date on 2019 releases of the car. If the tooling for a car has a major change at some point in its life, the copyright date might be changed or amended to reflect the change. For example, Quick Bite, first released in 1984 as the Good Humor Truck, had a tooling update before 2018, so its date reads 1983, '17 on the base of the 2018 release. There are a few exceptions where the copyright date applies only to the base of a car instead of to the entire car. Those exceptions are mostly funny car castings where the same base was used with various different bodies over the years.\n\nSince the year 2008, Hot Wheels cars have a code stamped into the base. This is a \"base code\". This base code can be used to identify exactly when an individual car was produced in the Hot Wheels factory. \nThe code begins with a letter, followed by a two-digit number. The letter for the year 2018 was \"L\". The letter is then followed by two numbers, which represent the week of that particular year the car was manufactured. For example, a car with the date stamp of \"L42\" was produced on the forty-second week of 2018.\n\nSome cars have 4-digit date codes. These date codes are more specific than the 3-digit codes as they indicate the day a car was made instead of just the week. For the 4-digit codes, the first 3 digits indicate the day of the year and the last digit is the year. A date code of 1987 would indicate the car was made on the 198th day of 2017 (July 17). A code of 0250 would be the 25th day of 2010 (or 2020; depending on the car).\n\nMattel reuses many models of Hot Wheels cars, both as part of the regular line and as \"commemorative\" replicas. As a result, a car with the date 1968 on the base could have been made at any time between 1968 and the present, like the ''Custom Ford Mustang''. One of the easiest ways to tell the difference between a genuine 1968 car and a replica, is to check if it has a base code. (This only works if the car was produced after 2008. If it was produced before then, you would use more detailed ways to tell them apart).\n\n==Hot Wheels Classics==\n[[Image:hotwheels classics.JPG|thumb|right|300px|2005 Hot Wheels Classics Series 1 car, still in package]]\nThe ''Hot'' ''Wheels'' ''Classics'' line was an immediate hit with enthusiasts everywhere. The new line focused on [[muscle cars]], [[hot rods]], and other offbeat vehicles (such as a go-kart, a motor home and even an airplane), many from the company's first ten years (1968\u201378) of production. The series is also used to debut several different castings, such as the ''[[Chevrolet Malibu|1965 Chevy Malibu]]'' or the ''[[Ford Ranchero|1972 Ford Ranchero.]]''\n\nSeries 1 from 2005 consisted of 25 models, each with all-metal body and chassis, decked out with Spectraflame paint, in packages similar to those used from 1968 to 1972. Each car had a retail price of about three to four dollars ([[USD]]) and each of the 25 cars were released with 7 or 8 different colors. Models included the ''[[Chevrolet Bel Air|1957 Chevy Bel Air]]'' (pictured at the right), the ''[[Ford Thunderbird|1963 Ford T-Bird]]'', and the ''[[Pontiac GTO|1965 Pontiac GTO]]''.\n\nThere were also track sets in similar retro packaging, and [[1:18 scale]] ''Hot Wheels Classics''. The Classics version of the ''Purple'' ''Passion'' was released with ''Real Riders'' tires at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. Mattel also produced a ''Classics'' ''[[Oldsmobile 442|Olds 442]]'' in Spectraflame blue for the 2005 Toy Fair.\n\nIn late 2005, Series 2 now consisted of 30 models including the ''[[Chevrolet Camaro|1967 Camaro Convertible]]'', the ''[[Dodge Charger (B-body)|1969 Dodge Charger]]'', and a ''[[Ford Mustang (first generation)|1965 Mustang GT]]''. There was also supposed to be a separate ''[[Funny Car|Mustang Funny Car]]'' (as listed on the blisterpack rear checklist) but this was apparently changed to a ''[[Plymouth Barracuda|Plymouth Barracuda Funny Car]]'' during production.\n\nIn 2006, a Series 3 line of Classics was introduced, again containing 30 models with multiple colors of each vehicle. Models included the ''[[Pontiac Firebird|'69 Pontiac Firebird]]'', a ''[[Meyers Manx]]'' [[dune buggy]], and the [[Richard Petty]] ''[[Plymouth Superbird|'70 Plymouth \"Superbird\"]]''.\n\nIn 2007, Series 4 debuted with just fifteen models. However, in recognition of the 40th anniversary there were two packaging versions available - models came with a collectible metal badge (featuring a portrait of the involved vehicle) or were sold alone as in the previous three series. Models included a [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|''VW Karmann Ghia'']], a ''[[Mercury Cougar|'68 Mercury Cougar]]'', and the ''[[The Red Baron (custom car)|\"Red Baron\" hot rod]]''. For its 40th anniversary in 2008, Hot Wheels celebrated the making of its four billionth car with the production of a diamond-studded model worth US$140,000. It had 2,700 diamond chips, a total of almost 23 [[karat]]s, and was cast in [[white gold]], with [[ruby|rubies]] serving as taillights.<ref>Burgess, Phil, ''National Dragster'' editor.  \"Diamonds in the rough, gators on wheels, diamonds on cars, and how to move a billion dollars\", written 20 February 2008, at [https://www.nhra.com/news/2008/diamonds-rough-gators-wheels-diamonds-cars-and-how-move-billion-dollars   NHRA.com] (retrieved 16 September 2018)</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Series 5 has 30 models. For the first time, there are chase cars in the classics series. These cars feature ''Real'' ''Riders'' rubber tires. A few models included are ''Copper Stopper'', ''[[Pontiac GTO|1970 Pontiac GTO]]'', and ''Hammer'' ''Sled''.\n\n==Special model lines==\nHot Wheels has also released slightly larger, more detailed models, such as the original ''Gran'' ''Toros'' (1/43 scale) from 1970, and the ''Dropstars'' line (a model line of \"blinged\" cars). Also in this larger scale are the ''HIN'' ([[Hot Import Nights]]), ''G-Machines'' and ''Customs'' lines. These lines were introduced in 2004\u20132005.\n\nHot Wheels has produced many replica [[Scale model|scale models]] in the industry standard 1/43, 1/24 and 1/18 scales. In 2004, it released a 1/12 scale replica of the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)|C6 Corvette]].\n\nHot Wheels also in the early 1990s introduced a series known as the California Customs. A line of cars that had a California theme.\n\nOther lines from Hot Wheels include: ''R-R-Rumblers & Chopcycles'' (motorcycles introduced in 1971), ''Hotbirds'' (metal airplanes), ''Sizzlers'', ''XV Racers'', ''Hot Tunerz'' and ''Stockerz''.\n\nOver the years, Mattel has also teamed up with other retail organizations to produce special models available through those retailers. The list of retailers includes [[Avon Products|Avon]], [[Chuck E. Cheese's|Chuck E. Cheese]], Dinty Moore, [[FAO Schwarz]], Full Grid, [[General Mills]], [[Getty Oil|Getty]], HEB, Hills, [[Hormel]], Hughes Family Markets, [[J. C. Penney|JC Penney]], [[JC Whitney]], [[KB Toys|Kay-Bee Toys]], [[Kmart|K-Mart,]] [[Kellogg's]], [[Kool-Aid]], [[Kroger]], [[Lexmark]], Liberty Promotions (contracted the series of special models for [[Jiffy Lube]] and [[Penske]]), [[McKee Foods|Little Debbie Snacks]], [[MOM Brands|Malt-O-Meal]], [[McDonald's]], [[Mervyn's]], [[Otter Pops]], [[Roses (store)|Rose's Discount Stores]], [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Schwan's Company|Tony's Pizza]], [[Toys \"R\" Us|Toys-R-Us]], [[76 (gas station)|Union 76]], [[Ashland Inc.|Valvoline]], [[Pinnacle Foods|Van de Kamp's]], [[Walmart|WalMart]], and [[White's Guide to Collecting]], as well as several [[Major League Baseball]] franchises to name a few.\n\nIn 2016 Hot Wheels released a special collection for the 50th anniversary of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]\u2019 1966 song \u201c[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]].\u201d The collections includes five cars, a VW microbus and a yellow submarine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/06/08/beatles-yellow-submarine-50th-anniversary-hot-wheels/|title=Hot Wheels unveil Beatles' 'Yellow Submarine' 50th anniversary collection|date=2016-06-08|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-07-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Made by other companies===\nIn some cases, Hot Wheels dies have been sold or acquired by other companies once Mattel has finished using them.  One example were early dies that made their way to Argentina and were reproduced as [[Muky]]s, though not with spectra-flame paints or the same quality as seen in Mattel's products.\n\n===Hot Wheels Elite and Hot Wheels Mattel===\nHot Wheels have a series called ''Hot Wheels Elite'' and ''Hot Wheels Mattel''. The ''Elite'' Hot Wheels are 1:18, 1:43 and 1:50 highly detailed [[Die casting|diecast]]; the majority of them are based on [[Ferrari|Ferraris]]. They are more expensive than the ''[[Mattel]]'' models, which aren't as highly detailed and cheaper, as the ''Elite'' versions are licensed by [[Ferrari]], so for Hot Wheels ''Mattel'' models, they have to add cheap parts, like plastic to make them cheaper. The Hot Wheels ''Elite'' series have a \"mini\" series, which can be seen on the website. Two of the popular limited 1:18 Hot Wheels ''Elite'' series' are the '''Ferrari in Music''' and '''Cult Classics''' The music series features singers' and rappers' Ferraris, including [[Jamiroquai]]'s [[Jay Kay|Jay Kay']]s Black [[Enzo Ferrari (automobile)|Enzo Ferrari]].\n\n===Car Culture===\nIn 2016 Hot Wheels started a new line of Collector's models, in a line called ''Car Culture''. \nCar Culture is Hot Wheels' line of Premium 1:64 models with metal bodies and bases, two-piece wheels with rubber tires, and more detailed decorations. Intended for adult collectors primarily, these models retail for roughly 6-7 times the cost of a mainstream 1:64 Hot Wheels model. \n\nThis line was kicked off with the release of \"''Japan Historics''\", a set of five Japanese [[Sports car|sports cars]]. Every year at least four more sets are introduced.\nAll ''Car Culture'' sets have five cars, and often have new castings created for the sets. The number five spot in the set is usually reserved for the newest casting in the set.\n''Car Culture'' cars are typically based on real automobiles; however in 2018, Hot Wheels introduced a set called \"''Team'' ''Transport''\", which included some fantasy truck castings. (Although \"''Team'' ''Transport''\" is labeled under the ''Car Culture'' line, they are a separate category of ''Car Culture'' vehicles than the usual 5-car sets, possessing different [[Barcodes|barcodes]] and prices).\nThese cars retail for over three times the retail price of a \"basic\" car, and are produced in significantly fewer numbers.\n\nIn 2018, for Hot Wheels' 50th Anniversary, Car Culture card sizes were increased, along with the amount of decorations on the cars. A Hot Wheels \"50th anniversary\" logo was also placed beside the set's name on the packaging.\n\n==''Treasure Hunt'' series==\n''Treasure'' ''Hunt'' (sometimes '''T-Hunt''') is a line of Hot Wheels cars, introduced by [[Mattel]] in 1995. It consisted of 12 cars every year (15 beginning in 2011) with one or two released per month. The original production run was 10,000 of each car worldwide; that number has since risen due to the increasing demand for and popularity of Hot Wheels as a collector's item.\n\nTreasure Hunt vehicles are identifiable by a label on the package. The blister card said \"''Treasure'' ''Hunt''\" or \"''T-Hunt''\" on a green bar, sometimes with an illustration of a [[treasure chest]]. Since 2013, ''Treasure'' ''Hunts'' do not have the green stripe anymore; instead, the cars are recognizable with a \"flame in a circle logo\" on the vehicle and behind it on the card. The cars were decorated with flashy designs and special \"rubber\" wheels before 2007.\n\nIn 2007, Mattel introduced a two-tiered ''Treasure Hunt'' system.  A regular ''Treasure Hunt'' will feature normal enamel paint and normal wheels like other Hot Wheels cars. The production of these is rumored to be greater than previous T-Hunts. \n''\"Super\" Treasure Hunts'' are much harder to find. Like ''Treasure'' ''Hunts'' of the past, a ''Super Treasure Hunt'' features premium wheels and Spectraflame paint, as well as (starting in 2015), a golden-colored circle-flame logo printed on the card behind the car.\nMany Hot Wheels collectors have noticed in recent times that the US Basic mixes are more likely to have a ''Super Treasure Hunt'' in them compared to International Mixes. \n\nBefore 2013, all 12 ''Treasure Hunt'' cars of a year were released in both regular and super versions. In 2012, ''Super Treasure Hunts'' came with special paint and wheels, but with series designation on the card. However, the regular ''T-hunts'' retained a special ''T-Hunt'' series card. Mattel stopped using special cards for all ''Treasure'' ''Hunts'' in 2013. Some U.S. releases in 2014 had the phrase \"This symbol on the vehicle lets you know it is hard to find and highly collectible\".\nHowever, in 2016, this was changed to \"Congratulations!

Pictures agreed to partner on a Hot Wheels film.<ref name=\"vty\"/>\n\n==Sizzlers==\nThe ''Sizzlers'' were a 1970s Hot Wheels spin off with a built-in motor and a tiny rechargeable battery. (The ''X-V racers'' of the 1990s were similar.) They were introduced in 1970 and became immediately popular. ''Sizzlers'' run on the regular \"orange\" Hot Wheels track, and Mattel created special race sets with U-Turns, multi-level spirals and loops to take advantage of the cars' electric motor. Two lane race sets such as the California/8 race set were developed that allowed ''Sizzlers'' to race side-by side, until Mattel created the black ''Fat Track'' which is three lanes wide with steep banked curves and designed to allow ''Sizzlers'' to run free. In action, Sizzlers supposedly display a unique, competitive \"passing action\" when running on the ''Fat Track'', as if each car were piloted by an impatient driver trying to jockey ahead of the rest. The ''Fat Track'' sets included the \"Big O\", \"California 500\", and \"Super Circuit\" race sets, and accessories such as the \"Scramble Start\" (a four-car starting gate), \"Lap Computer\" four car lap counter, and \"Race-Timer\" stop watch.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sizzler Cal8 set.jpg|left|thumb|Early Sizzlers race set{{Pufc|1=Sizzler Cal8 set.jpg|log=2012 February 15}}]] -->\n\nSix cars were made in 1970, 12 cars were made in 1971, and 4 cars were made in 1972. The ''\"Fat Daddy\" Sizzlers'' (oversized bodies with huge tires) were introduced in 1973. Mattel put the Sizzlers on a hiatus after that year, and in 1976 they created ''Sizzlers II''. That next year, the ''Night Ridin' Sizzlers'' (which had headlights you could turn on or off) were created. Mattel permanently stopped ''Sizzlers'' production in 1978.They were replaced by another spin off named ''Scorchers''.The ''Scorchers'' were [[Wind-up toy|\"pull back\" cars]] which would a clock spring when pulled backwards a short distance, which then propelled them forward for several feet.\n\n''Sizzlers'' were (and are) charged with four or two [[D battery]] chargers called the ''Juice Machine'' and ''Goose Pump'' respectively. Later, the ''Power Pit'' was introduced\u2014which was an electric charger that plugged into any household [[Alternating current|AC]] outlet and resembled a race track garage or [[pit stop]]. A 90-second charge of the tiny internal [[Nickel\u2013cadmium battery|NiCad]] battery gives up to five minutes of useful run time. It was claimed by advertisers that the 90-second charge time was \"the longest minute and a half in a kid's life\" as they waited impatiently for the car to charge sufficiently to get back into the race.\n\nThe ''Sizzler'' electric technology spun off into the ''Hotline Trains'', which ran on track similar to regular Hot Wheels, and the ''Earthshakers'' [[Heavy equipment|construction vehicles]]. Both lines of vehicles were charged using the ''Sizzler Juice Machine'' or ''Power Pit''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Mattel's trademark on the \"Sizzlers\" name had lapsed and toy company [[Playing Mantis (company)|Playing Mantis]] released a line new Sizzlers line in [[NASCAR]] [[Stock car racing|stock car]] models and copied the ''Fat Track'' as the \"''Stocker 400''\" and \"''Mach 500''\" track sets to capitalize on the booming popularity of NASCAR in that decade. The ''Juice Machine'' was renamed the \"''Mega-Charger''\" and incorporated a more efficient \"[[Trickle charging|trickle charge]]\" rather than the \"dump charge\" of the original machines. Interest in the toys began to increase once again. They were taken off the market after Mattel filed a lawsuit against Playing Mantis.  However, ''Sizzlers'' returned again in 2006, when Mattel struck an exclusive deal with [[Target Corporation|Target]] stores to re-release ''Sizzlers'' cars, the \"''Big O''\" Fat track, Juice Machine and car carrying case\u2014all in the original packaging from the 1970s. As of January 2009, the Sizzlers line has been discontinued by Target.\n\nIn 2011, ''Sizzlers'' have been re-released as ''[[Cars 2]]'' characters, and were sold at Target stores. This line was called ''Charge Ups'' and released under the Mattel [[Brand|brand name]] but not as part of the Hot Wheels line.\n\n==Promotion and sponsorships==\nHot Wheels appeared in the 2016 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].\n\n===Motorsports===\n[[File:Kyle Petty PE2 Pontiac Phoenix 1997.jpg|thumb|The Hot Wheels-sponsored car of [[Kyle Petty]] in 1997]]\nStarting in 1970, professional drag racers [[Don Prudhomme]] (\"The Snake\") and [[Tom McEwen (drag racer)|Tom McEwen]] (\"The Mongoose\") were sponsored by Hot Wheels, and later on, Hot Wheels created the ''Snake and Mongoose Drag Set'' in 1970. Later somewhere in 1972, the second versions of both driver's self-titled [[Funny Car|funny cars]] were released, when McEwen had the ''Mongoose 2'', and Prudhomme had the ''Snake 2''. The drag set remained the same. Then, Hot Wheels made [[Dragster (car)|rail-type]] dragster versions of them, based on the actual funny cars and was featured in the ''Wild Wheelie Set''. Later in Hot Wheels' lifespan, the normal drag set with Snake and Mongoose were still being produced. The latest set with the Snake and Mongoose is in the ''Drag-Strip Demons'' lineup.\n\nIn 1992, Hot Wheels sponsored the [[Trans-Am]] car of [[Jack Baldwin (racing driver)|Jack Baldwin]] as he went on to win that year's championship. Hot Wheels signed a sponsorship deal in 1997 with [[NASCAR]] driver [[Kyle Petty]] and the No. 44 [[PE2 Motorsports]] car<ref name=\"Hot Wheels is back in the driver's seat\">{{cite web|url=http://news.mattel.com/news/hot-wheels-r-is-back-in-the-driver-s-seat-with-nascar|title=Hot Wheels(R) Is Back in the Driver's Seat With NASCAR|work=[[Mattel]]|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref> and thus began making replicas of NASCAR stock cars.

{"title_page": "Local government in England", "text_new": "{{short description|System of state administration on a local level in England}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Politics of England}}\n\nThe pattern of '''local government in England''' is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to the local arrangements.\n\nLegislation concerning local government in [[England]] is decided by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and [[Government of the United Kingdom]], because England does not have a [[devolved English parliament|devolved parliament]] or [[regional assembly (England)|regional assemblies]], outside Greater London.\n\n== Structure ==\n{{main|Subdivisions of England}}\n\n=== Regional authorities and Combined authorities ===\nEngland has, since 1994, been subdivided into nine [[regions of England|regions]]. One of these, [[Greater London|London]], has an elected [[London Assembly|Assembly]] and [[Mayor of London|Mayor]]. The other regions no longer have any statutory bodies to execute any responsibilities.\n\n[[Combined authority|Combined authorities]] were introduced in [[England]] outside Greater London by the [[Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009]] to cover areas larger than the existing local authorities but smaller than the regions. Combined authorities are created voluntarily and allow a group of local authorities to pool appropriate responsibility and receive certain delegated functions from central government in order to deliver transport and economic policy more effectively over a wider area.  There are currently 10 such authorities, with the [[Greater Manchester Combined Authority]] established on 1 April 2011, [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]] and three others in April 2014, two in 2016, two in 2017 and one in 2018.\n\n=== Principal councils ===\n[[File:English administrative divisions by type 2009.svg|thumb|300px|{{legend|#f07568| [[Metropolitan borough]] |outline=black }}\n{{legend|#f8a20c| [[London borough]] |outline=black }}\n{{legend|#3ce67b| [[Unitary authorities of England|Unitary authority]] |outline=black }}\n{{legend|#ffd0d0| Two-tier [[non-metropolitan county]] |outline=black }}\n]]\nBelow the region level and excluding London, England has two different patterns of local government in use. In some areas there is a [[county council]] responsible for services such as education, waste management and strategic planning within a [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|county]], with several [[non-metropolitan district]] councils responsible for services such as housing, waste collection and local planning. Both are [[principal council]]s and are elected in separate elections.\n\nSome areas have only one level of local government. These are [[unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]], which are also principal councils. Most of Greater London is governed by [[London boroughs|London borough]] councils. The [[City of London]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]] are ''[[wikt:sui generis|sui generis]]'' authorities, pre-dating recent reforms of local government.\n\nThere are 126 'single tier' authorities, which all function as billing authorities for [[Council Tax]] and [[local education authority|local education authorities]]:\n*56 [[unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]]\n*36 [[metropolitan borough]]s\n*32 [[London boroughs]]\n*The [[Common Council of the City of London]]\n*The [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]]\n\nThere are 31 'upper tier' authorities. The [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]] function as local education authorities:\n*25 non-metropolitan counties\n*6 [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] (councils abolished in 1986)\n\nThere are 188 'lower tier' authorities, which all have the function of billing authority for Council Tax:\n*188 [[non-metropolitan district]]s\n\nThere are in total 343 principal councils,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-government-structure-and-elections |title=Local government structure and elections |date=6 April 2018 |publisher=Gov.uk |accessdate=7 April 2019}}</ref> including the Corporation of London and the Council of the Isles of Scilly, but not the [[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]], the last two of which are also local authorities for some purposes.\n\n=== Parishes ===\n{{main|Civil parishes in England|Parish councils in England}}\n\nBelow the district level, a district may be divided into several civil parishes. Typical activities undertaken by a parish council include [[allotment (gardening)|allotments]], parks, public clocks, and entering [[Britain in Bloom]]. They also have a consultative role in planning. Councils such as districts, counties and unitaries are known as [[:wikt:principal|principal]] local authorities in order to differentiate them in their legal status from parish and town councils, which are not uniform in their existence. Local councils tend not to exist in metropolitan areas but there is nothing to stop their establishment. For example, [[Birmingham]] has a parish, [[New Frankley]]. Parishes have not existed in [[Greater London]] since 1965, but from 2007 they could legally be created. In some districts, the rural area is parished and the urban is not \u2013 such as the Borough of [[Hinckley and Bosworth]], where the town of [[Hinckley]] is unparished and has no local councils, while the countryside around the town is parished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/pp/service/directory.asp?id=4938&Tree=4884&DetailID=1529 |title=Local Councils (Town, Parish) |date=21 April 2009 |publisher=Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council |accessdate=18 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006005906/http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/pp/service/directory.asp?id=4938&Tree=4884&DetailID=1529 |archivedate=6 October 2007 }}</ref> In others, there is a more complex mixture, as in the case of the [[Borough of Kettering]], where the small towns of [[Burton Latimer]], [[Desborough]] and [[Rothwell, Northamptonshire|Rothwell]] are parished, while [[Kettering]] town itself is not. In addition, among the rural parishes, two share a joint parish council and two have no council but are governed by an annual [[parish meeting]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kettering.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=67 |title=Town and Parish Councils |date=18 November 2009 |publisher=Kettering Borough Council |accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of local government in England}}\n\nThe current arrangement of local government in England is the result of a range of incremental measures which have their origins in the municipal reform of the 19th century. During the 20th century, the structure of local government was reformed and rationalised, with local government areas becoming fewer and larger, and the functions of local councils amended. The way local authorities are funded has also been subject to periodic and significant reform.\n\n== People ==\n\n=== Councillors and mayors ===\n{{further|Executive arrangements|Directly elected mayors in England and Wales}}\n\nCouncils have historically had no split between [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature]]. Functions are vested in the council itself, and then exercised usually by committees or subcommittees of the council.\n\nThe chairman of the council itself has authority to conduct the business of meetings of the full council, including the selection of the agenda, but otherwise the chairmanship is considered an honorary position with no real power outside the council meeting. The chairman of a [[borough]] has the title '[[Mayors in England|Mayor]]'. In certain cities the mayor is known as the [[Lord Mayor]]; this is an honour which must be granted by [[Letters patent|Letters Patent]] from the Crown. The chairman of a town council too is styled the 'town mayor'. Boroughs are in many cases descendants of municipal boroughs set up hundreds of years ago, and so have a number of traditions and ceremonial functions attached to the mayor's office.<ref>Millward, Paul ''Civic ceremonial; a handbook, history and guide for mayors, councillors and officers'' (Shaw & Sons, 1998) {{ISBN|0 7219 0163 8}}</ref> Where a council would have both civic mayor, namely the chairman of the council, and an [[Elected mayors in the United Kingdom|executive mayor]], it has become usual for the chairman to take the simple title 'Chairman' or 'Chair'.<ref>[https://www.middlesbrough.gov.uk/mayor-council-and-councillors/civic-and-ceremonial/chair-council Chair of the Council]: Middlesbrough Council</ref>\n\nThe post of Leader of the Council has been recognised.  Leaders typically chair several important committees, and receive a higher allowance to reflect their additional responsibilities, but they have no special, legal authority.\n\nUnder section 15 the [[Local Government and Housing Act 1989]], committees must roughly reflect the [[political party]] makeup of the council; before it was permitted for a party with control of the council to 'pack' committees with their own members. This pattern was based on that established for [[municipal borough]]s by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and then later adopted for [[county council]]s and [[rural district]]s.\n\nIn 2000, Parliament passed the [[Local Government Act 2000]] requiring councils to move to an executive-based system, either with the [[Cabinet-style council|council leader and a cabinet]] acting as an executive authority, or with a [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales|directly elected mayor]] \u2013 with either having a cabinet drawn from the councillors \u2013 or a mayor and [[council\u2013manager government|council manager]]. There was a small exception to this whereby smaller district councils (population of less than 85,000) can adopt a modified committee system. Most councils used the council leader and cabinet option, while 52 smaller councils were allowed to propose alternative arrangements based on the older system (Section 31 of the Act), and [[Brighton and Hove]] invoked a similar provision (Section 27(2)(b)) when a referendum to move to a directly elected mayor was defeated. In 2012, principal councils began returning to Committee systems, under the [[Localism Act 2011]].\n\nThere are now 16 directly elected mayors, in districts where a [[referendums in the United Kingdom|referendum]] was in favour of them. Several of the mayors originally elected were independents (notably in [[Directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] and [[Middlesbrough (borough)|Middlesbrough]], which in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] elections are usually [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] strongholds). Since May 2002, only a handful of referendums have been held, and they have mostly been negative, with only a few exceptions. The decision to have directly elected mayors in [[Mayor of Hartlepool|Hartlepool]] and [[Directly elected mayor of Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke-on-Trent]] were subsequently reversed when further referendums were held.\n\nThe executive where it exists, in whichever form, is held to account by the remainder of the councillors acting as the \"[[Overview and Scrutiny]] function\" \u2013 calling the Executive to account for their actions and to justify their future plans. In a related development, the [[Health and Social Care Act 2001]], [[Police and Justice Act 2006]], and 2006 local government [[white paper]] set out a role for local government Overview and Scrutiny in creating greater local accountability for a range of public-sector organisations. Committee system councils have no direct 'scrutiny' role, with the decisions being scrutinised as they are taken by the committee, and potentially referred to full council for review.\n\nCouncils may make people honorary [[freedom of the City|freemen]] or honorary [[alderman|aldermen]]. A mayor's term of office lasts for the [[municipal year]].\n\n=== Elections ===\nThe area which a council covers is divided into one or more [[electoral district|electoral divisions]] \u2013 known in district and parish councils as \"[[ward (country subdivision)|wards]]\", and in county councils as \"electoral divisions\". Each ward can return one or more members; multi-member wards are quite common. There is no requirement for the size of wards to be the same within a district, so one ward can return one member and another ward can return two. Metropolitan borough wards must return a multiple of three councillors, while until the [[Local Government Act 2003]] multiple-member county electoral divisions were forbidden.\n\nIn the election, the candidates to receive the most votes win, in a system known as the [[plurality-at-large voting|multi-member plurality system]]. There is no element of [[proportional representation]], so if four candidates from the Mauve Party poll 2,000 votes each, and four candidates from the Taupe Party poll 1,750 votes each, all four Mauve candidates will be returned, and no Taupe candidates will. This has been said by some to be undemocratic.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/08/localgovernment.localgovernment |title=This vogue for localism has not solved voter antipathy |author=[[Polly Toynbee]] |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe term of a councillor is usually four years. Councils may be elected wholly, every four years, or 'by thirds', where a third of the councillors get elected each year, with one year with no elections. Recently, the 'by halves' system, whereby half of the council is elected every two years, has been allowed. Sometimes wholesale boundary revisions will mean the entire council will be re-elected, before returning to the previous elections by thirds or by halves over the coming years. Recent legislation allows a council to move from elections by thirds to all-up elections.\n\nOften, local government elections are watched closely to detect the mood of the electorate before upcoming parliamentary elections.\n\n=== Officers ===\nCouncillors cannot do the work of the council themselves, and so are responsible for appointment and oversight of officers, who are delegated to perform most tasks. Local authorities nowadays may appoint a 'Chief Executive Officer', with overall responsibility for council employees, and who operates in conjunction with department heads. The Chief Executive Officer position is weak compared to the [[council\u2013manager government|council manager]] system seen in other counties. In some areas, much of the work previously undertaken directly (in [[direct service organisation]]s) by council employees has been [[privatization|privatised]].\n\n== Functions and powers ==\n{{main|Duties of local government in the United Kingdom}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Arrangement\n! scope=\"col\" | Upper tier authority\n! scope=\"col\" | Lower tier authority\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Non-metropolitan counties/Non-metropolitan districts\n| waste management, education, libraries, social services, transport, strategic planning, consumer protection, police, fire\n| housing, waste collection, council tax collection, local planning, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Unitary<br />authorities\n| colspan=\"2\" | housing, waste management, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, transport, planning, consumer protection, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria\u2020, police and fire come under shire councils\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Metropolitan boroughs\n| colspan=\"2\" | housing, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, transport, planning, consumer protection, licensing, police, fire, cemeteries and crematoria\u2020\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Greater London/London boroughs\n| transport, strategic planning, regional development, police, fire\n| housing, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, local planning, consumer protection, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria\u2020\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | [[Combined authorities]]/constituent authorities\n| transport, economic development, regeneration & various (depends on devolution deal)\n| Dependent on type and combined authority arrangement\n|}\n\n\u2020 = ''in practice, some functions take place at a strategic level through joint boards and arrangements''\n\nUnder the [[Local Government Act 2000]], councils have a general power to \"promote economic, social and environmental well-being\" of their area. However, like all public bodies, they were limited by the doctrine of ''[[ultra vires]]'', and could only do things that common law or an [[Act of Parliament]] specifically or generally allowed for. Councils could promote [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Local Acts]] in Parliament to grant them special powers. For example, [[Kingston upon Hull]] had for many years a municipally owned telephone company, [[Kingston Communications]].\n\nThe Localism Act 2011 introduced a new \"[[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|general power of competence]]\" for local authorities, extending the \"well-being\" power with the power to \"do anything that individuals generally may do\". This means, in effect, that nothing otherwise lawful that a local authority may wish to do can be ultra vires. As of 2013 this general power of competence is available to all principal local authorities and some parish councils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/section/1/data.htm|title=Localism Act 2011|first=Expert|last=Participation|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/notes/division/5/1/1/1|title=Explanatory Notes to Localism Act 2011|author=Department for Communities and Local Government}}</ref> However, it has not been extensively used.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional/2013/apr/17/jury-out-general-power-competence-localism|title=The jury is still out on the general power of competence|last=Jeraj|first=Samir|date=17 April 2013|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n\"Local welfare\" that gives emergency help to the poorest families in England risks collapse according to poverty campaigners. [[Church Action on Poverty]] surveyed over 150 local authority run schemes and found just under a quarter had closed since 2013 and another quarter cut spending by 85% or more. It is expected more will fold within months. 153 local authorities reduced local welfare spending by 72% on average from 2013-14 to 2017\u201318. They spent \u00a346m on local welfare in the year to 2018, contrasted with \u00a3172m in 2013\u201314. Ending local welfare would make tens of thousands of vulnerable people increasingly at risk of hunger, debt and destitution according to Church Action on Poverty. Local welfare was devised to help poor people manage unexpected hardship, like lack of money due to benefit payment problems, or issues like broken boilers, house fires and flooding. Church Action on Poverty said that large council budget cuts meant the system was struggling to survive. Provision is subject to a [[postcode lottery]] so thousands of people cannot get emergency state funding. There are calls for local authority funding to help the poorest people in crisis to be ring fenced. [[David Walker (bishop of Manchester)|Bishop David Walker]] said, \"Local authority welfare schemes are increasingly threadbare, leaving families in many areas with nowhere to turn for help. It cannot be right for central and local government to abdicate responsibility for people in crisis when they need our help most\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/14/local-welfare-schemes-in-england-on-brink-of-collapse-survey-finds|title='Local welfare' schemes in England on brink of collapse, says report|last=Butler|first=Patrick|date=14 October 2018|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n== Funding ==\nLocal councils are funded by a combination of [[central government]] grants, [[Council Tax]] (a locally set [[tax]] based on house value), [[Business rates in England and Wales|Business Rates]], and fees and charges from certain services including [[decriminalised parking enforcement]]. Up to 15 English councils risk insolvency, the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] maintains, and councils increasingly offer, \"bare minimum\" service.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/09/northamptonshire-council-backs-bare-minimum-service-plan|title=Northamptonshire council backs 'bare minimum' service plan|last=Butler|first=Patrick|date=9 August 2018|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The [[New Local Government Network]] maintains most local authorities will only be able to provide the bare minimum of services five years from 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgn.org.uk/public/2018/18304/|title=Most local authorities will only deliver the bare minimum in five years' time|website=www.nlgn.org.uk|accessdate=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nMany of these funding sources are hypothecated (''ring-fenced'') - meaning that they can only be spent in a very specific manner - in essence, they merely pass through a council's accounts on their way from the funding source to their intended destination. These include:\n*[[Dedicated Schools Grant]] - funds any schools that are still managed by the local authority, rather than being autonomously run (principally [[academy school|academies]], which are funded directly by central government); less than half of state-funded secondary schools are still reliant on this funding source. The Dedicated Schools Grant is often relatively large - and can typically be about 1/3 of all council funding. Hypothecation for this has been in place since 2006.\n*Housing Benefit Grant - funds [[housing benefit]] claims made in the council area, and related administration. Housing Benefit is being gradually replaced by an element within [[Universal Credit]], and [[Pension Credit]]; these replacements will be administered centrally, and provided directly to claimants from central government.\n*Health & Wellbeing grant. This is intended to be used for measures to improve public ''wellbeing''; the term has deliberately been left undefined, but is not intended to fund measures targeted at specific individuals (such as healthcare or social care), which are funded by other mechanisms. For example, this could be used to plant additional trees on streets, or to tidy the appearance of buildings.\n*Rents from tenants of council-owned housing. By law, these must in fact be paid into a distinct [[Housing Revenue Account]], which can only be used for maintenance, management, and addition, of the council-owned housing stock, and cannot be used for funding any other council expenditure.\n*Fines and charges related to vehicle parking, and local road restrictions. By law, these can only be used to fund parking services, road repairs, enforcement of road restrictions, etc.\n\nThe other main central government grant - the [[Revenue Support Grant]] - is not hypothecated, and can be spent as the council wishes. For many decades, Business Rates were gathered locally, pooled together nationally, and then redistributed according to a complicated formula; these would be combined with the Revenue Support Grant to form a single ''Formula Grant'' to the council. Since 2013, a varyingly sized chunk of Business Rates is retained locally, and only the remainder is pooled and redistributed; the redistribution is according to a very basic formula, based mainly on the size of the 2013 Formula Grant to the relevant council, and is now provided to the council independently of the Revenue Support Grant.\n\n=== Council Tax ===\n{{main|Council Tax}}\n\n==== Setting the rate ====\nWhen determining their budget arrangements, councils make a distinction between hypothecated funding and non-hypothecated funding. Consideration of all funding in general is referred to as ''gross revenue streams'', while ''net revenue streams'' refers to funding from only non-hypothecated sources.\n\nHistorically, central government retained the right to ''cap'' an increase in Council Tax, if it deemed the council to be increasing it too severely.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3668679.stm |title=Raynsford reveals capped councils |date=14 May 2004 |work=[[BBC News Online]] }}</ref> Under the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Cameron-Clegg coalition]], this was changed. Councils can raise the level of council tax as they wish, but must hold a local referendum on the matter, if they wish to raise it above a certain threshold set by central government, currently<!-- as at 2019 --> 3%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/final-local-government-finance-settlement-2019-to-2020-written-statement|title=Final local government finance settlement 2019 to 2020: written statement|website=GOV.UK}}</ref>\n\n==== Billing authorities ====\nCouncil Tax is collected by the principal council that has the functions of a district-level authority. It is identified in legislation as a billing authority, and was known as a rating authority. There are 314 billing authorities in England that collect council tax and business rates:<ref name=\"audit\">{{cite web | url=http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Council-tax-briefing-final-version-18-June.pdf | title=Council tax collection | publisher=Audit Commission }}</ref><ref name=\"local precept\"/><ref>Council Tax Handbook, Geoff Parsons, Tim Rowcliffe Smith, Tim Smith, (2006), Taylor & Francis</ref>\n\n*188 non-metropolitan district councils\n*56 unitary authority councils\n*36 metropolitan borough councils\n*32 London borough councils\n*City of London Corporation\n*Council of the Isles of Scilly\n\n==== Precepting authorities ====\n{{see also|Precepting authority}}\nPrecepting authorities do not collect Council Tax directly, but instruct a billing authority to do it on their behalf by setting a [[precept]]. Major precepting authorities such as the [[Greater London Authority]] and county councils cover areas that are larger than billing authorities. Local precepting authorities such as parish councils cover areas that are smaller than billing authorities.<ref name=\"local precept\">{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260449/Parishes_and_other_precepting_authorities_2013-14_England__revised_.pdf | title=Parishes and other local precepting authorities: 2013-14 England\n}}</ref>\n\nThe precept shows up as an independent element on official information sent to council tax payers, but the council bill will cover the combined amount (the precepts plus the core council tax). The billing authority collects the whole amount, and then detaches the precept and funnels it to the relevant precepting authority.\n\n==== Levying bodies ====\nLevying bodies are similar to precepting authorities, but instead of imposing a charge on billing authorities, the amount to be deducted is decided by negotiation. The [[Lee Valley Regional Park Authority]] is an example of a levying body. Voluntary joint arrangements, such as waste authorities are also in this category.\n\n=== Aggregate External Finance ===\nAggregate External Finance (AEF) refers to the total amount of money given by central government to local government. It consists of the '''[[Revenue Support Grant]]''' (RSG), ringfenced and other specific grants, and redistributed business rates. A portion of the RSG money paid to each authority is diverted to fund organisations that provide improvement and research services to local government (this is referred to as the RSG top-slice), for example the [[Local Government Association]].<ref>http://www.local.gov.uk/documents/10180/12129/L14-99+LGA+business+plan+2014-15_A5_v13/4391618f-454e-406c-ba8c-6d5dadf5da56</ref>\n\n== Boundaries and names ==\nSizes of council areas vary widely. The most populous district in England is [[Birmingham]] (a [[metropolitan borough]]) with 1,073,045 people (2011 census), and the least populous non-metropolitan unitary area is [[Rutland]] with 37,369.<ref name=\"E&Wdistricts2011\">{{cite web|title=2011 Census: KS101EW Usual resident population, local authorities in England and Wales|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks101ew.xls|publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref> However, these are outliers, and most English unitary authorities have a population in the range of 150,000 to 300,000. The smallest non-unitary district in England is [[West Somerset]] at 34,675 people, and the largest [[Northampton]] at 212,069.<ref name=\"E&Wdistricts2011\" /> However, all but 9 non-unitary English districts have fewer than 150,000 people.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Responsibility for minor revisions to local government areas falls to the [[Local Government Boundary Commission for England]]. Revisions are usually undertaken to avoid borders straddling new development, to bring them back into line with a diverted [[watercourse]], or to align them with roads or other features.\n\nWhere a district is coterminous with a town, the name is an easy choice to make. In some cases, a district is named after its main town, despite there being other towns in the district. Confusingly, such districts sometimes have [[List of cities in the United Kingdom|city status]], and so, for example, the [[City of Canterbury]] contains several towns apart from [[Canterbury]], which have distinct identities. Similarly, the [[City of Winchester]] contains a number of large villages and extensive countryside, which is quite distinct from the main settlement of [[Winchester]]. They can be named after historic subdivisions ([[Borough of Broxtowe|Broxtowe]], [[Borough of Spelthorne|Spelthorne]]), rivers ([[Eden District|Eden]], [[Arun District|Arun]]), a modified or alternative version of their main town's name ([[Harborough District|Harborough]], [[Wycombe District|Wycombe]]), a combination of main town and geographical feature ([[Newark and Sherwood]]) or after a geographical feature in the district ([[Cotswold District|Cotswold]], [[Cannock Chase District|Cannock Chase]]). A number of districts are named after former religious houses ([[Kirklees]], [[Vale Royal]], [[Borough of Waverley|Waverley]]). Purely geographical names can also be used ([[South Bucks]], [[Suffolk Coastal]], [[North West Leicestershire]]).  In a handful of cases entirely new names have been devised, examples being [[Castle Point]], [[Thamesdown]] (subsequently renamed as [[Borough of Swindon|Swindon]]) and [[Wychavon]]. Councils have a general power to change the name of the district, and consequently their own name, under section 74 of the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Such a resolution must have two-thirds of the votes at a meeting convened for the purpose.\n\nCouncils of counties are called \"The X County Council\", whereas district councils can be 'district council', 'borough council', or 'city council' depending upon the status of the district. Unitary authorities may be called 'county council',{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} 'borough council', 'city council', 'district council', or sometimes just 'council'. These names do not change the role or authority of the council.\n\nGreater London is further divided into 32 [[London borough]]s, each governed by a London borough council, and the [[City of London]], which is governed by the [[City of London Corporation]]. In the London boroughs the legal entity is not the council as elsewhere but the inhabitants incorporated as a legal entity by [[royal charter]] (a process abolished elsewhere in England and Wales under the Local Government Act 1972). Thus, a London authority's official legal title is \"The Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of X\" (or \"The Lord Mayor and Citizens of the City of Westminster\"). In common speech, however, \"The London Borough of X\" is used.\n\nMetropolitan counties no longer have county councils, as these were abolished in 1986. They are divided into metropolitan districts whose councils have either the status of city council or metropolitan borough council.\n\nSome districts are [[royal borough]]s, but this does not affect the name of the council.\n\n== Special arrangements ==\n\n=== Joint arrangements ===\n[[File:England Police Forces (West Mercia).svg|thumb|Jurisdiction of the [[West Mercia Police]] shown within England]]\n\nLocal authorities sometimes provide services on a joint basis with other authorities, through bodies known as joint boards. Joint boards are not directly elected but are made up of councillors appointed from the authorities which are covered by the service. Typically, joint boards are created to avoid splitting up certain services when [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] are created, or a county or regional council is abolished. In other cases, if several authorities are considered too small (in terms of either geographic size or population) to run a service effectively by themselves, joint boards are established. Typical services run by joint boards include [[police|policing]], [[fire department|fire services]], [[public transport]] and sometimes [[waste management|waste disposal]] authorities.\n\nIn several areas a joint police force is used which covers several counties: for example, the [[Thames Valley Police]] (in [[Berkshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Oxfordshire]]) and the [[West Mercia Police]] (in [[Shropshire]], [[Telford and Wrekin]], [[Herefordshire]] and [[Worcestershire]]). In the six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]], the [[metropolitan borough]] councils also appoint members to joint county-wide [[passenger transport executive|passenger transport authorities]] to oversee [[public transport]], and joint waste disposal authorities, which were created after the county councils were abolished.\n\nJoint boards were used extensively in [[Greater London]] when the [[Greater London Council]] was abolished, to avoid splitting up some London-wide services. These functions have now been taken over by the [[Greater London Authority]]. Similar arrangements exist in [[Berkshire]], where the county council has been abolished. If a joint body is legally required to exist, it is known as a ''joint board''. However, local authorities sometimes create joint bodies voluntarily and these are known as ''joint committees''.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] |url=http://www.jrf.org.uk/knowledge/findings/government/G37.asp |title=The working of joint arrangements |work=Local and Central Government Relations Research 37 |year=1995 |access-date=12 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926020320/http://www.jrf.org.uk/knowledge/findings/government/G37.asp |archive-date=26 September 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== City of London Corporation ===\nThe [[City of London]] covers a square mile (2.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) in the heart of [[London]]. It is governed by the [[City of London Corporation]], which has a unique structure. The Corporation has been broadly untouched by local government reforms and democratisation. It has its own ancient system of [[wards of the City of London|25 wards]], as well as its own [[City of London Police|police service]]. The [[business vote]] was abolished for other parts of the country in 1969, but due to the low resident population of the City this was thought impractical. In fact, the business vote was recently{{when|date=September 2019}} extended in the City to cover more companies.\n\n== Further reforms to local government ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Shropshire]] -->\n\n===Reforms 2006 to 2010===\n{{further|2009 structural changes to local government in England}}\n\nThe Labour Government released a Local Government White Paper on 26 October 2006, ''Strong and Prosperous Communities'', which dealt with the structure of local government.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6084998.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Councils to get fresh law powers |date=26 October 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |date=26 October 2006 |url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1503999 |publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government |title=Strong and Prosperous Communities, Cm 6939}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hansard |house=House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061026/debtext/61026-0004.htm#06102646001546|title= Local Government White Paper|date=26 October 2006 |column_start=1657 |column_end=1659}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.citymayors.com/politics/uk_whitepaper06.html |publisher=CityMayors |title=White Paper proposes stronger mayors and more power to English communities |date=30 October 2006}}</ref> The White Paper did not deal with the issues of local government funding or of reform or replacement of the [[Council Tax]], which was awaiting the final report of the [[Lyons Review]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3910451.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Council tax system to be reformed |date=2 July 2004}}</ref> A Local Government Bill was introduced in the 2006\u201307 session of Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/localgovt/story/0,,1932757,00.html |title=Kelly offers councils more freedom under tougher leaders |date=27 October 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> The White Paper emphasised the concept of \"double devolution\", with more powers being granted to councils, and powers being devolved from town halls to community levels.

It has however created the [[Greater Manchester Combined Authority]] and signalled intent, under the 'City Deals' process promoted under the Localism Act, to create further [[combined authorities]] for the North East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire as nascent [[city regions]]. Another aspect of the Localism Act is increased opportunities for [[Neighbourhood Forum]]s.\n\nThe [[Regional assembly (England)|Regional Assemblies]] and [[Regional development agency|Regional Development Agencies]] were abolished in 2010 and 2012 respectively.

One of these, [[Greater London|London]], has an elected [[London Assembly|Assembly]] and [[Mayor of London|Mayor]]. The other regions no longer have any statutory bodies to execute any responsibilities.\n\n[[Combined authority|Combined authorities]] were introduced in [[England]] outside Greater London by the [[Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009]] to cover areas larger than the existing local authorities but smaller than the regions. Combined authorities are created voluntarily and allow a group of local authorities to pool appropriate responsibility and receive certain delegated functions from central government in order to deliver transport and economic policy more effectively over a wider area.  There are currently 10 such authorities, with the [[Greater Manchester Combined Authority]] established on 1 April 2011, [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]] and three others in April 2014, two in 2016, two in 2017 and one in 2018.\n\n=== Principal councils ===\n[[File:English administrative divisions by type 2009.svg|thumb|300px|{{legend|#f07568| [[Metropolitan borough]] |outline=black }}\n{{legend|#f8a20c| [[London borough]] |outline=black }}\n{{legend|#3ce67b| [[Unitary authorities of England|Unitary authority]] |outline=black }}\n{{legend|#ffd0d0| Two-tier [[non-metropolitan county]] |outline=black }}\n]]\nBelow the region level and excluding London, England has two different patterns of local government in use. In some areas there is a [[county council]] responsible for services such as education, waste management and strategic planning within a [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|county]], with several [[non-metropolitan district]] councils responsible for services such as housing, waste collection and local planning. Both are [[principal council]]s and are elected in separate elections.\n\nSome areas have only one level of local government. These are [[unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]], which are also principal councils. Most of Greater London is governed by [[London boroughs|London borough]] councils. The [[City of London]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]] are ''[[wikt:sui generis|sui generis]]'' authorities, pre-dating recent reforms of local government.\n\nThere are 126 'single tier' authorities, which all function as billing authorities for [[Council Tax]] and [[local education authority|local education authorities]]:\n*56 [[unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]]\n*36 [[metropolitan borough]]s\n*32 [[London boroughs]]\n*The [[Common Council of the City of London]]\n*The [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]]\n\nThere are 31 'upper tier' authorities. The [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]] function as local education authorities:\n*25 non-metropolitan counties\n*6 [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] (councils abolished in 1986)\n\nThere are 188 'lower tier' authorities, which all have the function of billing authority for Council Tax:\n*188 [[non-metropolitan district]]s\n\nThere are in total 343 principal councils,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-government-structure-and-elections |title=Local government structure and elections |date=6 April 2018 |publisher=Gov.uk |accessdate=7 April 2019}}</ref> including the Corporation of London and the Council of the Isles of Scilly, but not the [[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]], the last two of which are also local authorities for some purposes.\n\n=== Parishes ===\n{{main|Civil parishes in England|Parish councils in England}}\n\nBelow the district level, a district may be divided into several civil parishes. Typical activities undertaken by a parish council include [[allotment (gardening)|allotments]], parks, public clocks, and entering [[Britain in Bloom]]. They also have a consultative role in planning. Councils such as districts, counties and unitaries are known as [[:wikt:principal|principal]] local authorities in order to differentiate them in their legal status from parish and town councils, which are not uniform in their existence. Local councils tend not to exist in metropolitan areas but there is nothing to stop their establishment. For example, [[Birmingham]] has a parish, [[New Frankley]]. Parishes have not existed in [[Greater London]] since 1965, but from 2007 they could legally be created. In some districts, the rural area is parished and the urban is not \u2013 such as the Borough of [[Hinckley and Bosworth]], where the town of [[Hinckley]] is unparished and has no local councils, while the countryside around the town is parished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/pp/service/directory.asp?id=4938&Tree=4884&DetailID=1529 |title=Local Councils (Town, Parish) |date=21 April 2009 |publisher=Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council |accessdate=18 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006005906/http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/pp/service/directory.asp?id=4938&Tree=4884&DetailID=1529 |archivedate=6 October 2007 }}</ref> In others, there is a more complex mixture, as in the case of the [[Borough of Kettering]], where the small towns of [[Burton Latimer]], [[Desborough]] and [[Rothwell, Northamptonshire|Rothwell]] are parished, while [[Kettering]] town itself is not. In addition, among the rural parishes, two share a joint parish council and two have no council but are governed by an annual [[parish meeting]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kettering.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=67 |title=Town and Parish Councils |date=18 November 2009 |publisher=Kettering Borough Council |accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of local government in England}}\n\nThe current arrangement of local government in England is the result of a range of incremental measures which have their origins in the municipal reform of the 19th century. During the 20th century, the structure of local government was reformed and rationalised, with local government areas becoming fewer and larger, and the functions of local councils amended. The way local authorities are funded has also been subject to periodic and significant reform.\n\n== People ==\n\n=== Councillors and mayors ===\n{{further|Executive arrangements|Directly elected mayors in England and Wales}}\n\nCouncils have historically had no split between [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature]]. Functions are vested in the council itself, and then exercised usually by committees or subcommittees of the council.\n\nThe chairman of the council itself has authority to conduct the business of meetings of the full council, including the selection of the agenda, but otherwise the chairmanship is considered an honorary position with no real power outside the council meeting. The chairman of a [[borough]] has the title '[[Mayors in England|Mayor]]'. In certain cities the mayor is known as the [[Lord Mayor]]; this is an honour which must be granted by [[Letters patent|Letters Patent]] from the Crown. The chairman of a town council too is styled the 'town mayor'. Boroughs are in many cases descendants of municipal boroughs set up hundreds of years ago, and so have a number of traditions and ceremonial functions attached to the mayor's office.<ref>Millward, Paul ''Civic ceremonial; a handbook, history and guide for mayors, councillors and officers'' (Shaw & Sons, 1998) {{ISBN|0 7219 0163 8}}</ref> Where a council would have both civic mayor, namely the chairman of the council, and an [[Elected mayors in the United Kingdom|executive mayor]], it has become usual for the chairman to take the simple title 'Chairman' or 'Chair'.<ref>[https://www.middlesbrough.gov.uk/mayor-council-and-councillors/civic-and-ceremonial/chair-council Chair of the Council]: Middlesbrough Council</ref>\n\nThe post of Leader of the Council has been recognised.  Leaders typically chair several important committees, and receive a higher allowance to reflect their additional responsibilities, but they have no special, legal authority.\n\nUnder section 15 the [[Local Government and Housing Act 1989]], committees must roughly reflect the [[political party]] makeup of the council; before it was permitted for a party with control of the council to 'pack' committees with their own members. This pattern was based on that established for [[municipal borough]]s by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and then later adopted for [[county council]]s and [[rural district]]s.\n\nIn 2000, Parliament passed the [[Local Government Act 2000]] requiring councils to move to an executive-based system, either with the [[Cabinet-style council|council leader and a cabinet]] acting as an executive authority, or with a [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales|directly elected mayor]] \u2013 with either having a cabinet drawn from the councillors \u2013 or a mayor and [[council\u2013manager government|council manager]]. There was a small exception to this whereby smaller district councils (population of less than 85,000) can adopt a modified committee system. Most councils used the council leader and cabinet option, while 52 smaller councils were allowed to propose alternative arrangements based on the older system (Section 31 of the Act), and [[Brighton and Hove]] invoked a similar provision (Section 27(2)(b)) when a referendum to move to a directly elected mayor was defeated. In 2012, principal councils began returning to Committee systems, under the [[Localism Act 2011]].\n\nThere are now 16 directly elected mayors, in districts where a [[referendums in the United Kingdom|referendum]] was in favour of them. Several of the mayors originally elected were independents (notably in [[Directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] and [[Middlesbrough (borough)|Middlesbrough]], which in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] elections are usually [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] strongholds). Since May 2002, only a handful of referendums have been held, and they have mostly been negative, with only a few exceptions. The decision to have directly elected mayors in [[Mayor of Hartlepool|Hartlepool]] and [[Directly elected mayor of Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke-on-Trent]] were subsequently reversed when further referendums were held.\n\nThe executive where it exists, in whichever form, is held to account by the remainder of the councillors acting as the \"[[Overview and Scrutiny]] function\" \u2013 calling the Executive to account for their actions and to justify their future plans. In a related development, the [[Health and Social Care Act 2001]], [[Police and Justice Act 2006]], and 2006 local government [[white paper]] set out a role for local government Overview and Scrutiny in creating greater local accountability for a range of public-sector organisations. Committee system councils have no direct 'scrutiny' role, with the decisions being scrutinised as they are taken by the committee, and potentially referred to full council for review.\n\nCouncils may make people honorary [[freedom of the City|freemen]] or honorary [[alderman|aldermen]]. A mayor's term of office lasts for the [[municipal year]].\n\n=== Elections ===\nThe area which a council covers is divided into one or more [[electoral district|electoral divisions]] \u2013 known in district and parish councils as \"[[ward (country subdivision)|wards]]\", and in county councils as \"electoral divisions\". Each ward can return one or more members; multi-member wards are quite common. There is no requirement for the size of wards to be the same within a district, so one ward can return one member and another ward can return two. Metropolitan borough wards must return a multiple of three councillors, while until the [[Local Government Act 2003]] multiple-member county electoral divisions were forbidden.\n\nIn the election, the candidates to receive the most votes win, in a system known as the [[plurality-at-large voting|multi-member plurality system]]. There is no element of [[proportional representation]], so if four candidates from the Mauve Party poll 2,000 votes each, and four candidates from the Taupe Party poll 1,750 votes each, all four Mauve candidates will be returned, and no Taupe candidates will. This has been said by some to be undemocratic.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/08/localgovernment.localgovernment |title=This vogue for localism has not solved voter antipathy |author=[[Polly Toynbee]] |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe term of a councillor is usually four years. Councils may be elected wholly, every four years, or 'by thirds', where a third of the councillors get elected each year, with one year with no elections. Recently, the 'by halves' system, whereby half of the council is elected every two years, has been allowed. Sometimes wholesale boundary revisions will mean the entire council will be re-elected, before returning to the previous elections by thirds or by halves over the coming years. Recent legislation allows a council to move from elections by thirds to all-up elections.\n\nOften, local government elections are watched closely to detect the mood of the electorate before upcoming parliamentary elections.\n\n=== Officers ===\nCouncillors cannot do the work of the council themselves, and so are responsible for appointment and oversight of officers, who are delegated to perform most tasks. Local authorities nowadays may appoint a 'Chief Executive Officer', with overall responsibility for council employees, and who operates in conjunction with department heads. The Chief Executive Officer position is weak compared to the [[council\u2013manager government|council manager]] system seen in other counties. In some areas, much of the work previously undertaken directly (in [[direct service organisation]]s) by council employees has been [[privatization|privatised]].\n\n== Functions and powers ==\n{{main|Duties of local government in the United Kingdom}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Arrangement\n! scope=\"col\" | Upper tier authority\n! scope=\"col\" | Lower tier authority\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Non-metropolitan counties/Non-metropolitan districts\n| waste management, education, libraries, social services, transport, strategic planning, consumer protection, police, fire\n| housing, waste collection, council tax collection, local planning, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Unitary<br />authorities\n| colspan=\"2\" | housing, waste management, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, transport, planning, consumer protection, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria\u2020, police and fire come under shire councils\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Metropolitan boroughs\n| colspan=\"2\" | housing, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, transport, planning, consumer protection, licensing, police, fire, cemeteries and crematoria\u2020\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Greater London/London boroughs\n| transport, strategic planning, regional development, police, fire\n| housing, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, local planning, consumer protection, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria\u2020\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | [[Combined authorities]]/constituent authorities\n| transport, economic development, regeneration & various (depends on devolution deal)\n| Dependent on type and combined authority arrangement\n|}\n\n\u2020 = ''in practice, some functions take place at a strategic level through joint boards and arrangements''\n\nUnder the [[Local Government Act 2000]], councils have a general power to \"promote economic, social and environmental well-being\" of their area. However, like all public bodies, they were limited by the doctrine of ''[[ultra vires]]'', and could only do things that common law or an [[Act of Parliament]] specifically or generally allowed for. Councils could promote [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Local Acts]] in Parliament to grant them special powers. For example, [[Kingston upon Hull]] had for many years a municipally owned telephone company, [[Kingston Communications]].\n\nThe Localism Act 2011 introduced a new \"[[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|general power of competence]]\" for local authorities, extending the \"well-being\" power with the power to \"do anything that individuals generally may do\". This means, in effect, that nothing otherwise lawful that a local authority may wish to do can be ultra vires. As of 2013 this general power of competence is available to all principal local authorities and some parish councils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/section/1/data.htm|title=Localism Act 2011|first=Expert|last=Participation|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/notes/division/5/1/1/1|title=Explanatory Notes to Localism Act 2011|author=Department for Communities and Local Government}}</ref> However, it has not been extensively used.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional/2013/apr/17/jury-out-general-power-competence-localism|title=The jury is still out on the general power of competence|last=Jeraj|first=Samir|date=17 April 2013|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n\"Local welfare\" that gives emergency help to the poorest families in England risks collapse according to poverty campaigners. [[Church Action on Poverty]] surveyed over 150 local authority run schemes and found just under a quarter had closed since 2013 and another quarter cut spending by 85% or more. It is expected more will fold within months. 153 local authorities reduced local welfare spending by 72% on average from 2013-14 to 2017\u201318. They spent \u00a346m on local welfare in the year to 2018, contrasted with \u00a3172m in 2013\u201314. Ending local welfare would make tens of thousands of vulnerable people increasingly at risk of hunger, debt and destitution according to Church Action on Poverty. Local welfare was devised to help poor people manage unexpected hardship, like lack of money due to benefit payment problems, or issues like broken boilers, house fires and flooding. Church Action on Poverty said that large council budget cuts meant the system was struggling to survive. Provision is subject to a [[postcode lottery]] so thousands of people cannot get emergency state funding. There are calls for local authority funding to help the poorest people in crisis to be ring fenced. [[David Walker (bishop of Manchester)|Bishop David Walker]] said, \"Local authority welfare schemes are increasingly threadbare, leaving families in many areas with nowhere to turn for help. It cannot be right for central and local government to abdicate responsibility for people in crisis when they need our help most\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/14/local-welfare-schemes-in-england-on-brink-of-collapse-survey-finds|title='Local welfare' schemes in England on brink of collapse, says report|last=Butler|first=Patrick|date=14 October 2018|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n== Funding ==\nLocal councils are funded by a combination of [[central government]] grants, [[Council Tax]] (a locally set [[tax]] based on house value), [[Business rates in England and Wales|Business Rates]], and fees and charges from certain services including [[decriminalised parking enforcement]]. Up to 15 English councils risk insolvency, the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] maintains, and councils increasingly offer, \"bare minimum\" service.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/09/northamptonshire-council-backs-bare-minimum-service-plan|title=Northamptonshire council backs 'bare minimum' service plan|last=Butler|first=Patrick|date=9 August 2018|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The [[New Local Government Network]] maintains most local authorities will only be able to provide the bare minimum of services five years from 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgn.org.uk/public/2018/18304/|title=Most local authorities will only deliver the bare minimum in five years' time|website=www.nlgn.org.uk|accessdate=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nMany of these funding sources are hypothecated (''ring-fenced'') - meaning that they can only be spent in a very specific manner - in essence, they merely pass through a council's accounts on their way from the funding source to their intended destination. These include:\n*[[Dedicated Schools Grant]] - funds any schools that are still managed by the local authority, rather than being autonomously run (principally [[academy school|academies]], which are funded directly by central government); less than half of state-funded secondary schools are still reliant on this funding source. The Dedicated Schools Grant is often relatively large - and can typically be about 1/3 of all council funding. Hypothecation for this has been in place since 2006.\n*Housing Benefit Grant - funds [[housing benefit]] claims made in the council area, and related administration. Housing Benefit is being gradually replaced by an element within [[Universal Credit]], and [[Pension Credit]]; these replacements will be administered centrally, and provided directly to claimants from central government.\n*Health & Wellbeing grant. This is intended to be used for measures to improve public ''wellbeing''; the term has deliberately been left undefined, but is not intended to fund measures targeted at specific individuals (such as healthcare or social care), which are funded by other mechanisms. For example, this could be used to plant additional trees on streets, or to tidy the appearance of buildings.\n*Rents from tenants of council-owned housing. By law, these must in fact be paid into a distinct [[Housing Revenue Account]], which can only be used for maintenance, management, and addition, of the council-owned housing stock, and cannot be used for funding any other council expenditure.\n*Fines and charges related to vehicle parking, and local road restrictions. By law, these can only be used to fund parking services, road repairs, enforcement of road restrictions, etc.\n\nThe other main central government grant - the [[Revenue Support Grant]] - is not hypothecated, and can be spent as the council wishes. For many decades, Business Rates were gathered locally, pooled together nationally, and then redistributed according to a complicated formula; these would be combined with the Revenue Support Grant to form a single ''Formula Grant'' to the council. Since 2013, a varyingly sized chunk of Business Rates is retained locally, and only the remainder is pooled and redistributed; the redistribution is according to a very basic formula, based mainly on the size of the 2013 Formula Grant to the relevant council, and is now provided to the council independently of the Revenue Support Grant.\n\n=== Council Tax ===\n{{main|Council Tax}}\n\n==== Setting the rate ====\nWhen determining their budget arrangements, councils make a distinction between hypothecated funding and non-hypothecated funding. Consideration of all funding in general is referred to as ''gross revenue streams'', while ''net revenue streams'' refers to funding from only non-hypothecated sources.\n\nHistorically, central government retained the right to ''cap'' an increase in Council Tax, if it deemed the council to be increasing it too severely.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3668679.stm |title=Raynsford reveals capped councils |date=14 May 2004 |work=[[BBC News Online]] }}</ref> Under the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Cameron-Clegg coalition]], this was changed. Councils can raise the level of council tax as they wish, but must hold a local referendum on the matter, if they wish to raise it above a certain threshold set by central government, currently<!-- as at 2019 --> 3%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/final-local-government-finance-settlement-2019-to-2020-written-statement|title=Final local government finance settlement 2019 to 2020: written statement|website=GOV.UK}}</ref>\n\n==== Billing authorities ====\nCouncil Tax is collected by the principal council that has the functions of a district-level authority. It is identified in legislation as a billing authority, and was known as a rating authority. There are 326 billing authorities in England that collect council tax and business rates:<ref name=\"audit\">{{cite web | url=http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Council-tax-briefing-final-version-18-June.pdf | title=Council tax collection | publisher=Audit Commission }}</ref><ref name=\"local precept\"/><ref>Council Tax Handbook, Geoff Parsons, Tim Rowcliffe Smith, Tim Smith, (2006), Taylor & Francis</ref>\n\n*188 non-metropolitan district councils\n*56 unitary authority councils\n*36 metropolitan borough councils\n*32 London borough councils\n*City of London Corporation\n*Council of the Isles of Scilly\n\n==== Precepting authorities ====\n{{see also|Precepting authority}}\nPrecepting authorities do not collect Council Tax directly, but instruct a billing authority to do it on their behalf by setting a [[precept]]. Major precepting authorities such as the [[Greater London Authority]] and county councils cover areas that are larger than billing authorities. Local precepting authorities such as parish councils cover areas that are smaller than billing authorities.<ref name=\"local precept\">{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260449/Parishes_and_other_precepting_authorities_2013-14_England__revised_.pdf | title=Parishes and other local precepting authorities: 2013-14 England\n}}</ref>\n\nThe precept shows up as an independent element on official information sent to council tax payers, but the council bill will cover the combined amount (the precepts plus the core council tax). The billing authority collects the whole amount, and then detaches the precept and funnels it to the relevant precepting authority.\n\n==== Levying bodies ====\nLevying bodies are similar to precepting authorities, but instead of imposing a charge on billing authorities, the amount to be deducted is decided by negotiation. The [[Lee Valley Regional Park Authority]] is an example of a levying body. Voluntary joint arrangements, such as waste authorities are also in this category.\n\n=== Aggregate External Finance ===\nAggregate External Finance (AEF) refers to the total amount of money given by central government to local government. It consists of the '''[[Revenue Support Grant]]''' (RSG), ringfenced and other specific grants, and redistributed business rates. A portion of the RSG money paid to each authority is diverted to fund organisations that provide improvement and research services to local government (this is referred to as the RSG top-slice), for example the [[Local Government Association]].<ref>http://www.local.gov.uk/documents/10180/12129/L14-99+LGA+business+plan+2014-15_A5_v13/4391618f-454e-406c-ba8c-6d5dadf5da56</ref>\n\n== Boundaries and names ==\nSizes of council areas vary widely. The most populous district in England is [[Birmingham]] (a [[metropolitan borough]]) with 1,073,045 people (2011 census), and the least populous non-metropolitan unitary area is [[Rutland]] with 37,369.<ref name=\"E&Wdistricts2011\">{{cite web|title=2011 Census: KS101EW Usual resident population, local authorities in England and Wales|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks101ew.xls|publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref> However, these are outliers, and most English unitary authorities have a population in the range of 150,000 to 300,000. The smallest non-unitary district in England is [[West Somerset]] at 34,675 people, and the largest [[Northampton]] at 212,069.<ref name=\"E&Wdistricts2011\" /> However, all but 9 non-unitary English districts have fewer than 150,000 people.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Responsibility for minor revisions to local government areas falls to the [[Local Government Boundary Commission for England]]. Revisions are usually undertaken to avoid borders straddling new development, to bring them back into line with a diverted [[watercourse]], or to align them with roads or other features.\n\nWhere a district is coterminous with a town, the name is an easy choice to make. In some cases, a district is named after its main town, despite there being other towns in the district. Confusingly, such districts sometimes have [[List of cities in the United Kingdom|city status]], and so, for example, the [[City of Canterbury]] contains several towns apart from [[Canterbury]], which have distinct identities. Similarly, the [[City of Winchester]] contains a number of large villages and extensive countryside, which is quite distinct from the main settlement of [[Winchester]]. They can be named after historic subdivisions ([[Borough of Broxtowe|Broxtowe]], [[Borough of Spelthorne|Spelthorne]]), rivers ([[Eden District|Eden]], [[Arun District|Arun]]), a modified or alternative version of their main town's name ([[Harborough District|Harborough]], [[Wycombe District|Wycombe]]), a combination of main town and geographical feature ([[Newark and Sherwood]]) or after a geographical feature in the district ([[Cotswold District|Cotswold]], [[Cannock Chase District|Cannock Chase]]). A number of districts are named after former religious houses ([[Kirklees]], [[Vale Royal]], [[Borough of Waverley|Waverley]]). Purely geographical names can also be used ([[South Bucks]], [[Suffolk Coastal]], [[North West Leicestershire]]).  In a handful of cases entirely new names have been devised, examples being [[Castle Point]], [[Thamesdown]] (subsequently renamed as [[Borough of Swindon|Swindon]]) and [[Wychavon]]. Councils have a general power to change the name of the district, and consequently their own name, under section 74 of the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Such a resolution must have two-thirds of the votes at a meeting convened for the purpose.\n\nCouncils of counties are called \"The X County Council\", whereas district councils can be 'district council', 'borough council', or 'city council' depending upon the status of the district. Unitary authorities may be called 'county council',{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} 'borough council', 'city council', 'district council', or sometimes just 'council'. These names do not change the role or authority of the council.\n\nGreater London is further divided into 32 [[London borough]]s, each governed by a London borough council, and the [[City of London]], which is governed by the [[City of London Corporation]]. In the London boroughs the legal entity is not the council as elsewhere but the inhabitants incorporated as a legal entity by [[royal charter]] (a process abolished elsewhere in England and Wales under the Local Government Act 1972). Thus, a London authority's official legal title is \"The Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of X\" (or \"The Lord Mayor and Citizens of the City of Westminster\"). In common speech, however, \"The London Borough of X\" is used.\n\nMetropolitan counties no longer have county councils, as these were abolished in 1986. They are divided into metropolitan districts whose councils have either the status of city council or metropolitan borough council.\n\nSome districts are [[royal borough]]s, but this does not affect the name of the council.\n\n== Special arrangements ==\n\n=== Joint arrangements ===\n[[File:England Police Forces (West Mercia).svg|thumb|Jurisdiction of the [[West Mercia Police]] shown within England]]\n\nLocal authorities sometimes provide services on a joint basis with other authorities, through bodies known as joint boards. Joint boards are not directly elected but are made up of councillors appointed from the authorities which are covered by the service. Typically, joint boards are created to avoid splitting up certain services when [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] are created, or a county or regional council is abolished. In other cases, if several authorities are considered too small (in terms of either geographic size or population) to run a service effectively by themselves, joint boards are established. Typical services run by joint boards include [[police|policing]], [[fire department|fire services]], [[public transport]] and sometimes [[waste management|waste disposal]] authorities.\n\nIn several areas a joint police force is used which covers several counties: for example, the [[Thames Valley Police]] (in [[Berkshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Oxfordshire]]) and the [[West Mercia Police]] (in [[Shropshire]], [[Telford and Wrekin]], [[Herefordshire]] and [[Worcestershire]]). In the six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]], the [[metropolitan borough]] councils also appoint members to joint county-wide [[passenger transport executive|passenger transport authorities]] to oversee [[public transport]], and joint waste disposal authorities, which were created after the county councils were abolished.\n\nJoint boards were used extensively in [[Greater London]] when the [[Greater London Council]] was abolished, to avoid splitting up some London-wide services. These functions have now been taken over by the [[Greater London Authority]]. Similar arrangements exist in [[Berkshire]], where the county council has been abolished. If a joint body is legally required to exist, it is known as a ''joint board''. However, local authorities sometimes create joint bodies voluntarily and these are known as ''joint committees''.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] |url=http://www.jrf.org.uk/knowledge/findings/government/G37.asp |title=The working of joint arrangements |work=Local and Central Government Relations Research 37 |year=1995 |access-date=12 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926020320/http://www.jrf.org.uk/knowledge/findings/government/G37.asp |archive-date=26 September 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== City of London Corporation ===\nThe [[City of London]] covers a square mile (2.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) in the heart of [[London]]. It is governed by the [[City of London Corporation]], which has a unique structure. The Corporation has been broadly untouched by local government reforms and democratisation. It has its own ancient system of [[wards of the City of London|25 wards]], as well as its own [[City of London Police|police service]]. The [[business vote]] was abolished for other parts of the country in 1969, but due to the low resident population of the City this was thought impractical. In fact, the business vote was recently{{when|date=September 2019}} extended in the City to cover more companies.\n\n== Further reforms to local government ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Shropshire]] -->\n\n===Reforms 2006 to 2010===\n{{further|2009 structural changes to local government in England}}\n\nThe Labour Government released a Local Government White Paper on 26 October 2006, ''Strong and Prosperous Communities'', which dealt with the structure of local government.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6084998.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Councils to get fresh law powers |date=26 October 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |date=26 October 2006 |url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1503999 |publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government |title=Strong and Prosperous Communities, Cm 6939}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hansard |house=House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061026/debtext/61026-0004.htm#06102646001546|title= Local Government White Paper|date=26 October 2006 |column_start=1657 |column_end=1659}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.citymayors.com/politics/uk_whitepaper06.html |publisher=CityMayors |title=White Paper proposes stronger mayors and more power to English communities |date=30 October 2006}}</ref> The White Paper did not deal with the issues of local government funding or of reform or replacement of the [[Council Tax]], which was awaiting the final report of the [[Lyons Review]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3910451.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Council tax system to be reformed |date=2 July 2004}}</ref> A Local Government Bill was introduced in the 2006\u201307 session of Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/localgovt/story/0,,1932757,00.html |title=Kelly offers councils more freedom under tougher leaders |date=27 October 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> The White Paper emphasised the concept of \"double devolution\", with more powers being granted to councils, and powers being devolved from town halls to community levels. It proposed to reduce the level of central government oversight over local authorities by removing centrally set performance targets, and statutory controls of the Secretary of State over parish councils, by-laws, and electoral arrangements.\n\nThe white paper proposed that the existing prohibition on [[civil parishes in England|parish councils]] in [[Greater London]] would be abolished, and making new parishes easier to set up. Parish councils can currently be styled parish councils, town councils or city councils: the White Paper proposes that \"community council\", \"neighbourhood council\" and \"village council\" may be used as well. The reforms strengthen the council executives, and provided an option between a directly elected mayor, a directly elected executive, or an indirectly elected leader&nbsp;\u2013 all with a fixed four-year term.  These proposals were enacted under the [[Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007]].\n\nA report released by the [[Institute for Public Policy Research|IPPR]]'s Centre for Cities in February 2006, ''City Leadership: giving city regions the power to grow'', proposed the creation of two large city-regions based on [[Manchester]] and [[Birmingham]]: the Birmingham one would cover the existing [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] metropolitan county, along with [[Bromsgrove District|Bromsgrove]], [[Cannock Chase District|Cannock Chase]], [[Lichfield District|Lichfield]], [[North Warwickshire]], [[Redditch]] and [[Borough of Tamworth|Tamworth]], while the Manchester one would cover the existing [[Greater Manchester]] along with the [[Macclesfield (borough)|borough of Macclesfield]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ippr.org.uk/ecomm/files/city_leadership_execsum.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Institute for Public Policy Research |title=City Leadership: executive summary |date=February 2006 }}</ref> No firm proposals of this sort appear in the White Paper.

It has however created the [[Greater Manchester Combined Authority]] and signalled intent, under the 'City Deals' process promoted under the Localism Act, to create further [[combined authorities]] for the North East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire as nascent [[city regions]]. Another aspect of the Localism Act is increased opportunities for [[Neighbourhood Forum]]s.\n\nThe [[Regional assembly (England)|Regional Assemblies]] and [[Regional development agency|Regional Development Agencies]] were abolished in 2010 and 2012 respectively. The [[Local authority leaders' board]]s also had their funding cut in 2011, though continue as unelected consultative forums and as regional groupings for the [[Local Government Association]].\n\n===Reforms 2015 to present===\n{{See also|2019/2020 structural changes to local government in England}}\n\nFurther consolidation of local government through the formation of unitary authorities in existing two-tier areas have been proposed under the premiership of Theresa May.\n\n====Dorset====\nIn 2017, it was proposed that two unitary authorities be formed to cover the ceremonial county of [[Dorset]]. One of the authorities would consist of the existing unitary authorities of [[Borough of Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], [[Borough of Poole|Poole]] and the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], the other would be composed of the remainder of the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk|accessdate=10 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531065217/https://futuredorset.co.uk/|archive-date=31 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> In November 2017, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, [[Sajid Javid]] stated that he was \"minded to approve the proposals\" and a final decision to implement the two unitary authority model was confirmed in February 2018.

The [[Stadio San Nicola]] in [[Bari]] and [[Turin]]'s [[Stadio delle Alpi]] were completely new venues opened for the World Cup. Of the twelve stadiums in used, only two (San Siro and Luigi Ferraris) had been used for the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nThe remaining ten venues all underwent extensive programmes of improvements in preparation for the tournament, forcing many of the club tenants of the stadia to move to temporary homes. Additional seating and roofs were added to most stadia, with further redevelopments seeing running tracks removed and new pitches laid. Due to structural constraints, several of the existing stadia had to be virtually rebuilt to implement the changes required.\n\nLike Espana '82, the group stage of this tournament was organized in such a way where specific groups only played in two cities close in proximity to each other. Group A only played in Rome and Florence (Hosts Italy played all their competitive matches in Rome, except for their semi-final and third place matches, which were played in Naples and Bari, respectively), Group B played their matches in Naples and Bari (except for Argentina vs. Cameroon, which was the opening match of the tournament, played in Milan), Group C played their matches in Turin and Genoa, Group D played all their matches in Milan and Bologna, Group E played only in Udine and Verona, and Group F played on the island cities of Cagliari and Palermo. The cities that hosted the most World Cup matches were the two biggest cities in Italy: Rome and Milan, each hosting six matches, and Bari, Naples and Turin each hosted five matches. Cagliari, Udine and Palermo were the only cities of the 12 selected that did not host any knockout round matches.\n\nThe England national team, at the British government's request, were forced to play all their matches in Cagliari on the island of Sardinia. Hooliganism, [[Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom#1980s|rife in English football in the 1980s]] had spilled over onto the European continent when 39 mostly Italian Juventus supporters [[Heysel disaster|were killed]] and 600 were injured at the 1985 European Cup Final in [[Brussels]] while trying to flee from an attack by Liverpool supporters. This hooliganism had followed the national team while they played friendlies on the European continent \u2013 the distrust of English fans was so high that the English FA's reputation and even diplomatic relations between the UK and Italy were seen to be at risk if England played any group stage matches on the Italian mainland. Thanks largely to British Sports Minister Colin Moynihan's negative remarks about English fans weeks before the match, security around Cagliari during England's three matches there was extremely heavy \u2013 in addition to 7,000 local police and Carabineri, highly trained Italian military special forces were also there patrolling the premises. The Italian authorities' heavy presence proved to be justified as there were several riots during the time England were playing their matches in Cagliari, leading to a number of injuries, arrests and even deportations.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/17/sports/world-cup-90-fan-violence-at-world-cup-finals.html \u201cWORLD CUP '90; Fan Violence at World Cup Finals\u201d].

Six of the final eight in 1986 had qualified for the 1990 tournament, the missing nations being Mexico (quarter-final in 1986) and France (third place). Italy \u2013 who were seeded first as hosts \u2013 had not reached the final eight in 1986 and this left FIFA needing to exclude one of the three (qualified) nations who were eliminated in the 1986 quarter-finals: Brazil, England or Spain.\n\nOwing to their performance in 1982 but also to their overall World Cup record, Brazil were seeded third and not considered to drop out of the seedings. FIFA opted to seed England ahead of Spain. Spain had only been eliminated in 1986 on penalties, albeit by fourth-placed Belgium, while England had been defeated in 90 minutes by eventual winners Argentina; both countries had also reached the second stage in the 1982 event, playing in the same group in the second group stage with England ending up ahead of Spain, but Spain had also appeared in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 event]], while England had failed to qualify. FIFA President [[Jo\u00e3o Havelange]] had reportedly earlier stated that Spain would be seeded.\n\nSpanish officials believed the seeding was contrived to ensure England would be placed in Group F, the group to be held off the Italian mainland, in a bid to contain England's hooliganism problems. Their coach [[Luis Su\u00e1rez Miramontes|Luis Su\u00e1rez]] said, \"We feel we've been cheated...they wanted to seed England and to send it to Cagliari at all costs. So they invented this formula\".<ref name=\"Seedings\" /> FIFA countered that \"the formula was based on the teams' respective showings during the previous two World Cups. England merited the sixth position. This is in no way a concession to English hooliganism\".<ref name=\"Seedings\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the Netherlands also had an argument that on grounds of recent footballing form, they should be seeded, as the winners of the [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988 European Championship]], in which both Spain and England had been eliminated in the group stages, while Belgium (fourth in the 1986 World Cup after beating Spain, and thus seeded in 1990) had failed to even qualify: but this argument was countered by the fact that the Netherlands had themselves failed to qualify for both the 1982 and 1986 World Cups, which was considered the most important factor in the decision not to seed them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/30/sports/cup-seedings-revealed.html|title=Cup seedings revealed|work=The New York Times|date=30 November 1989|accessdate=11 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAs it happened, the two teams considered the most unlucky not to be seeded, namely Spain and the Netherlands, were both drawn in groups against the two teams considered the weakest of the seeded nations, namely Belgium and England: and the arguments over the seeding positions fizzled out.  England could be said to have justified their seeded position by narrowly winning their group ahead of the Netherlands: while Spain seemed to have made their own point about being worth a seeded position, by defeating Belgium to top their own group, in doing so gaining a measure of revenge for the fact that it was Belgium who had eliminated them in 1986.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n|-\n!width=20%|Seeds\n!width=20%|Pot 1<ref name=\"Pots\">{{Cite news |title=The Times guide to the draw for the World Cup finals |page=51 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=9 December 1989 }}</ref>\n!width=20%|Pot 2<ref name=\"Pots\"/>\n!width=20%|Pot 3<ref name=\"Pots\"/>\n|-\n|\n{{fb|ITA}} (1st)<br />\n{{fb|ARG}} (2nd)<br />\n{{fb|BRA|1968}} (3rd)<br />\n{{fb|FRG}} (4th)<br />\n{{fb|BEL}} (5th)<br />\n{{fb|ENG}} (6th)\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{{fb|CMR}}<br />\n{{fb|CRC}}<br />\n{{fb|EGY}}<br />\n{{fb|KOR|1984}}<br />\n{{fb|UAE}}<br />\n{{fb|USA}}\n|\n{{fb|COL}}<br />\n{{fb|TCH}}<br />\n{{fb|IRL}}<br />\n{{fb|ROU}}<br />\n{{fb|SWE}}<br />\n{{fb|URU}}\n|\n{{fb|AUT}}<br />\n{{fb|NED}}<br />\n{{fb|SCO}}<br />\n{{fb|ESP}}<br />\n{{fb|URS}}<br />\n{{fb|YUG}}\n|}\n\n===Final draw===\n[[File:Mascotte di italia 90.JPG|thumb|right|''Ciao'', a [[stick figure]] in the colours of the [[flag of Italy|Italy ''Tricolore'']], was the [[FIFA World Cup mascots|mascot]] for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.]]\nOn 9 December 1989 the draw was conducted at the [[Palazzetto dello Sport]] in Rome, where the teams were drawn out from the three pots to be placed with the seeded teams in their predetermined groups.

The format of the 1990 competition remained the same as in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]: 24 qualified teams were divided into six groups of four. The top two teams and four best third-place finishers from the six groups advanced to the knockout stage, which eliminated the teams until a winner emerged. In total, 52 games were played.\n\n===Negative tactics===\nThe tournament generated a record low goals-per-game average and a then-record of 16 red cards were handed out.<ref name=\"Record\"/> In the knockout stage, many teams played defensively for 120 minutes, with the intention of trying their luck in the penalty shoot-out, rather than risk going forward. Two exceptions were the eventual champions West Germany and hosts Italy, the only teams to win three of their four knockout matches in normal time. There were four penalty shoot-outs, a record subsequently equalled in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] tournaments. Eight matches went to extra time, a record equalled in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 tournament]].\n\nIreland and Argentina were prime examples of this trend of cautious defensive play; the Irish team fell behind in two of their three group matches and only equalised late in both games. Losing finalists Argentina, meanwhile, scored only five goals in the entire tournament (a record low for a finalist). Argentina also became the first team to advance twice on penalty shoot-outs and the first team to fail to score and have a player sent off in a World Cup final.<ref name=\"Italy 1990\"/>\n\nLargely as a result of this trend FIFA introduced the [[back-pass rule]] in time for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 tournament]] to make it harder for teams to time-waste by repeatedly passing the ball back for their goalkeepers to pick up. [[Three points for a win|Three, rather than two points]] would be awarded for victories at future tournaments to help further encourage attacking play.\n\n===Emergence of Cameroon===\n[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] reached the quarter-finals, where they were narrowly defeated by England.<ref name=\"Italy 1990\"/> They opened the tournament with a shock victory over reigning champions Argentina, before topping the group ahead of them, [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and [[UEFA Euro 1988|European Championship]] runners-up the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]]. Their success was fired by the goals of [[Roger Milla]], a 38-year-old forward who came out of international retirement to join the national squad at the last moment after a personal request from Cameroonian President [[Paul Biya]]. Milla's four goals and flamboyant goal celebrations made him one of the tournament's biggest stars as well as taking Cameroon to the last eight.<ref name=\"Italy 1990\"/> Most of Cameroon's squad was made up of players who played in France's premier football league, [[Ligue 1]]- French is one of the officially spoken languages in Cameroon, it being a former French territory. In reaching this stage, they had gone further than any African nation had ever managed in a World Cup before; a feat only equalled twice since (by [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]). Their success was African football's biggest yet on the world stage and FIFA subsequently decided to allocate the [[Confederation of African Football|CAF qualifying zone]] an additional place for the next World Cup tournament.\n\n===All-champion final four===\nDespite the performances of nations such as Cameroon, Colombia, Ireland, Romania and Costa Rica, the semi-finalists consisted of Argentina, England, Italy and West Germany, all previous World Cup winners, with eight previous titles between them. After the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 tournament]], this is only the second time in the history of the World Cup this has occurred. The teams which finished first, second and third had also contested both the two previous World Cup Finals between themselves.\n\n==Group stage==\n''All times are [[Central European Summer Time]] ([[UTC+02:00|UTC+2]])''[[File:1990 world cup.png|right|thumb|600px|{{col-start}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#2b42a3|Champion}} {{legend|#34c0be|Runner-up}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#269c5a|Third place}} {{legend|#81c846|Fourth place}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#e4e454|Quarter-finals}} {{legend|#f4d4ac|Round of 16}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#b94954|Group stage}} {{col-end}}]] <!-- Note: background colour style shown here for later use, when colour codes used in map determined: <span style=\"background-color:yellow\">text here</span>--->\n\nIn the following tables:\n*'''Pld''' = total games played\n*'''W''' = total games won\n*'''D''' = total games drawn (tied)\n*'''L''' = total games lost\n*'''GF''' = total goals scored (goals for)\n*'''GA''' = total goals conceded (goals against)\n*'''GD''' = goal difference (GF\u2212GA)\n*'''Pts''' = total points accumulated\n\nThe Group stage saw the twenty-four teams divided into six groups of four teams. Each group was a [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] of six games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams were awarded two points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The teams coming first and second in each group qualified for the Round of 16. The four best third-placed teams would also advance to the next stage.\n\nTypical of a World Cup staged in Europe, the matches all started at either 5:00 or 9:00 in the evening; this allowed for the games to avoid being played in the heat of an Italian summer, which would soar past 86F (30C) all over Italy.\n\nIf teams were level on points, they were ranked on the following criteria in order:\n{{Clear}}\n{{quotation|\n# Greatest total goal difference in the three group matches\n# Greatest number of goals scored in the three group matches\n# Most points earned in matches against other teams in the tie\n# Greatest goal difference in matches against other teams in the tie\n# Greatest number of goals scored in matches against other teams in the tie\n# Drawing of lots\n}}\n\n====Group A====\n\n{{Main|1990 FIFA World Cup Group A}}\nHosts [[Italy national football team|Italy]] won Group A with a 100 percent record.

In their second game the introduction of [[Roger Milla]] was the catalyst for a 2\u20131 win over [[Romania national football team|Romania]], Milla scoring twice from the bench (making him the oldest goalscorer in the tournament). With progression assured, Cameroon slumped to a 4\u20130 defeat in their final group game to the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] (in what would be their last World Cup due to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]), who were striving to stay in the tournament on goal difference after successive 2\u20130 defeats.  Argentina lost their veteran goalkeeper, Nery Pumpido, to a broken leg during their victory over the USSR: his replacement, Sergio Goycochea, proved to be one of the stars of their tournament.  In the final match, a 1\u20131 draw between Romania and Argentina sent both through, equal on points and on goal difference but Romania having the advantage on goals scored: Romania were thus second, Argentina qualified as one of the best third-placed teams.\n{{1990 FIFA World Cup group tables|Group B}}\n{| style=\"width:100%\" cellspacing=\"1\"\n|-\n!width=25%|\n!width=10%|\n!\n|-\n|8 June 1990\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|ARG}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Argentina vs Cameroon|0\u20131]]||{{fb|CMR}}||[[San Siro]], [[Milan]]\n|-\n|9 June 1990\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|URS}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Soviet Union vs Romania|0\u20132]]||{{fb|ROU}}||[[Stadio San Nicola]], [[Bari]]\n|-\n|13 June 1990\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|ARG}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Argentina vs Soviet Union|2\u20130]]||{{fb|URS}}||[[Stadio San Paolo]], [[Naples]]\n|-\n|14 June 1990\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|CMR}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Cameroon vs Romania|2\u20131]]||{{fb|ROU}}||[[Stadio San Nicola]], [[Bari]]\n|-\n|18 June 1990\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|ARG}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Argentina vs Romania|1\u20131]]||{{fb|ROU}}||[[Stadio San Paolo]], [[Naples]]\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|CMR}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Cameroon vs Soviet Union|0\u20134]]||{{fb|URS}}||[[Stadio San Nicola]], [[Bari]]\n|}\n\n====Group C====\n\n{{Main|1990 FIFA World Cup Group C}}\n[[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] beat [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] 1\u20130 in their first match, lost 1\u20130 to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in their second, then saw off [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] 2\u20131 to claim a place in the second round.

In the six group games, no team managed to score more than once in a match. England beat Egypt 1\u20130, the only match with a decisive result, and that was enough to win the group. The group containing England, Ireland and the Netherlands was remarkably similar to the group stage of the 1988 European Championship, which had eventually been won by the Netherlands, with England crashing out with three losses (to Ireland, the Netherlands and the USSR) and Ireland also narrowly failing to progress after losing to the Netherlands and drawing with the USSR. The results of the 1990 group, however, were different: England took the lead with an early goal for Lineker against Ireland, but Sheedy's late equalizer gave them a share of the spoils. The Netherlands failed to replicate their form of two years earlier, only drawing against Egypt: they had taken a 1-0 lead, but without impressing, and Egypt were well worth their equalizer courtesy of a penalty by Abdelghani. England then had much the better of their goalless draw with the Netherlands: indeed they had the ball in the net once, from a free-kick by Pearce, but it was disallowed. For the second World Cup in succession, however, England lost their captain Bryan Robson to an injury which put him out of the tournament, just over halfway through their second match. Ireland and Egypt barely registered a shot on goal between them in the other 0-0 draw: after the first four matches all four teams had equal records with 2 draws, 1 goal for and 1 goal against. England's victory over Egypt, thanks to a 58th-minute goal from [[Mark Wright (footballer, born 1963)|Mark Wright]], put them top of the group: in the other match, Gullit gave the Netherlands the lead against Ireland, but Niall Quinn scored a second-half equalizer and the two teams finished in second and third, still with identical records.

There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were: round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, final. There was also a play-off to decide third/fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by 30 minutes of [[Overtime (association football)|extra time]]; if scores were still level there would be a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] (five penalties each, if neither team already had a decisive advantage, and more if necessary) to determine who progressed to the next round.

It would later come to light that [[Branco (footballer)|Branco]] had been offered water spiked with tranquillisers by Maradona and [[Ricardo Giusti]] during half time, to slow him down in the second half. Initially discredited by the press, Branco would be publicly proven right years later, when Maradona confessed the episode on a TV show in Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://click.uol.com.br/?rf=home2011-topo-rotativo-foto1&u=http://copadomundo.uol.com.br/infograficos/2014/como-maradona-envenenou-branco-em-90/|title=Como Maradona \"envenenou\" Branco na Copa de 90|publisher=UOL|accessdate=6 May 2014}}{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As for Italy, a strong second half showing saw the hosts beat Uruguay 2\u20130, thanks to another goal from Schillaci and one from [[Aldo Serena]].\n\nThe match between West Germany and the Netherlands was held in Milan, and both sides featured several notable players from the two Milanese clubs (Germans [[Andreas Brehme]], [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]] and [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] for [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], and Dutchmen [[Marco van Basten]], [[Ruud Gullit]] and [[Frank Rijkaard]] for [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]). After 22 minutes [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] and Rijkaard were both dismissed after a number of incidents between the two players (including Rijkaard spitting on V\u00f6ller) left the Argentine referee with no option but to send them both off. As the players walked off the pitch together, Rijkaard spat on V\u00f6ller a second time. Early in the second half, [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] put the West Germans ahead and [[Andreas Brehme]] added a second with eight minutes left. A [[Ronald Koeman]] penalty for the Netherlands in the 89th minute narrowed the score to 2\u20131 but the Germans saw the game out to gain some revenge for their [[UEFA Euro 1988#Semi-finals|exit to the Dutch in the previous European Championship]].\n\nMeanwhile, the heroics of Cameroon and Roger Milla continued in their game with Colombia. Milla was introduced as a second-half substitute with the game goalless, eventually breaking the deadlock midway in extra time. Three minutes later he netted a second after Colombian goalkeeper, [[Ren\u00e9 Higuita]] was dispossessed by Milla while well out of his goal, leaving the striker free to slot the ball into the empty net. Though the deficit was soon reduced to 2\u20131, Cameroon held on to become the first African team ever to reach the World Cup quarter-finals. Costa Rica were comfortably beaten 4\u20131 by Czechoslovakia, for whom [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Skuhrav\u00fd]] scored the tournament's second and final [[hat-trick]].\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's match with Romania remained goalless after extra time and the Irish side won 5\u20134 on penalties. [[David O'Leary]] converted the penalty that clinched Ireland's place in the quarter-finals. Ireland thus became the first team since Sweden in [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] to reach the last eight in a World Cup finals tournament without winning a match outright. Yugoslavia beat Spain 2\u20131 after extra time, with [[Dragan Stojkovi\u0107]] scoring both the Yugoslavs' goals. England were the final qualifier against Belgium, as midfielder [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]'s swivelling volley broke the stalemate with the game moments away from a penalty shoot-out.\n\n{{football box\n|date=23 June 1990\n|time=17:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|Cameroon}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Cameroon vs Colombia|2\u20131]]\n|aet=yes\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=323/match=102/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|Colombia}}\n|goals1=[[Roger Milla|Milla]] {{goal|106||108}}\n|goals2=[[Bernardo Red\u00edn|Red\u00edn]] {{goal|115}}\n|stadium=[[Stadio San Paolo]], [[Naples]]\n|attendance=50,026\n|referee=[[Tullio Lanese]] ([[Italian Football Federation|Italy]])}}\n----\n{{football box\n|date=23 June 1990\n|time=21:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|TCH}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Czechoslovakia vs Costa Rica|4\u20131]]\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup//matches/round=323/match=129/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|CRC}}\n|goals1=[[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Skuhrav\u00fd|Skuhrav\u00fd]] {{goal|12||63||82}}<br/>[[Lubo\u0161 Kub\u00edk|Kub\u00edk]] {{goal|75}}\n|goals2=[[R\u00f3nald Gonz\u00e1lez Brenes|Gonz\u00e1lez]] {{goal|54}}\n|stadium=[[Stadio San Nicola]], [[Bari]]\n|attendance=47,673\n|referee=[[Siegfried Kirschen]] ([[German Football Association|East Germany]])}}\n----\n{{football box\n|date=24 June 1990\n|time=17:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|BRA|1968}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Brazil vs Argentina|0\u20131]]\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/worldcup/italy1990/matches/round=323/match=25/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|ARG}}\n|goals2=[[Claudio Caniggia|Caniggia]] {{goal|80}}\n|stadium=[[Stadio delle Alpi]], [[Turin]]\n|attendance=61,381\n|referee=[[Jo\u00ebl Quiniou]] ([[French Football Federation|France]])}}\n----\n{{football box\n|date=24 June 1990\n|time=21:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|FRG}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#West Germany vs Netherlands|2\u20131]]\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=323/match=196/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|NED}}\n|goals1=[[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann|Klinsmann]] {{goal|51}}<br/>[[Andreas Brehme|Brehme]] {{goal|82}}\n|goals2=[[Ronald Koeman|R.

In the second half, the game was turned on its head during a five-minute stretch: first Cameroon were awarded a penalty from which [[Emmanuel Kunde]] scored the equaliser; then in the 65th minute [[Eugene Ekeke]] put Cameroon ahead. Cameroon came within eight minutes of reaching the semi-finals before they conceded a penalty, which Gary Lineker converted.

There were no more goals in the 90 minutes or in extra time despite Maradona (who played for Naples in Serie A at the time) showing glimpses of magic, but there was a sending-off: [[Ricardo Giusti]] of Argentina was shown the red card in the 13th minute of extra time. Argentina went through on penalties, winning the shoot-out 4\u20133 after more heroics from Goycochea.\n\nThe semi-final between West Germany and England at [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]'s home stadium in Turin was goalless at half-time.

Monzon was the first player ever to be sent off in a World Cup Final.\n\nArgentina, weakened by suspension and injury, offered little attacking threat throughout a contest dominated by the West Germans, who struggled to create many clear goalscoring opportunities. The only goal of the contest arrived in the 85th minute when Mexican referee [[Edgardo Codesal]] awarded a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] to West Germany, after a foul on [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] by [[Roberto Sensini]] leading to Argentinian protests.<ref name=\"Germany finally awarded penatyy\">{{cite book |title=The Story of the World Cup |publisher=Faber and Faber |last=Glanville |first=Brian |year=2018 |pages=326 |isbn=978-0-571-32556-6 |quote=After half-time, the game grew harsher, when Klaus Augenthaler was blantanly tripped in the box by Goycoecha, Germany had far stronger claims for a penalty than that which won the match.

In the closing moments, Argentina were reduced to nine after [[Gustavo Dezotti]], who had already been yellow carded earlier in the match, received a red card when he hauled [[J\u00fcrgen Kohler]] to the ground during a stoppage in play. The 1\u20130 scoreline provided another first: Argentina were the first team to fail to score in a World Cup Final.\n\nWith its third title (and three second-place finishes) West Germany \u2013 in its final tournament before [[German reunification|national reunification]] \u2013 became the most successful World Cup nation at the time. West German manager [[Franz Beckenbauer]] became the first man to both captain (in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]]) and manage a World Cup winning team, and only the second man (after [[M\u00e1rio Zagallo]] of Brazil) to win the World Cup as a player and as team manager.

names|quadrennial]] international [[Association football|football]] tournament. It was held from 8 June to 8 July 1990 in Italy, the second country to host the event twice (the first being Mexico in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]). Teams representing 116 national football associations entered and [[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]] began in April 1988. 22 teams qualified from this process, along with host nation [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and defending champions [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].\n\nThe tournament was won by [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], their third World Cup title. They [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final|beat Argentina 1\u20130]] at the [[Stadio Olimpico]] in [[Rome]], a rematch of [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|the previous final]] four years earlier. Italy finished third and [[England national football team|England]] fourth, after both lost their semi-finals in [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootouts]]. This was the last tournament to feature a team from West Germany, with the country being [[German reunification|reunified with East Germany]] a few months later in October, as well as teams from the [[Eastern Bloc]] prior to the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991, as the [[Soviet national football team|Soviet Union]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] teams made appearances. [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] and [[United Arab Emirates national football team|the UAE]] made their first appearances in the finals. As of 2018, this was the last time the UAE qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals. The official match ball was the [[Adidas Etrusco Unico]].\n\nThe 1990 World Cup is widely regarded as one of the poorest World Cups in terms of the games.<ref name=\"Italy 1990\">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632223.stm |title=Italy 1990 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=17 April 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"World Cup 1990\">{{Cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/story?id=696774 |title=World Cup 1990 |work=ESPN Soccernet |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=11 August 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Glanville |first=Brian |title=The Story of the World Cup |publisher=Faber |year=2005 |isbn=0-571-22944-1 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Freddi |first=Cris |title=Complete Book of the World Cup |publisher=HarperSport |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-00-722916-1 }}</ref> It generated an average 2.2 goals per game \u2013 a record low that still stands<ref name=\"Record\">{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/tournaments/worldcup/organisation/index.html |title=FIFA World Cup\u2122 Record \u2013 Organisation |accessdate=14 June 2012 }}</ref> \u2013 and a then-record 16 red cards, including the first ever dismissal in a final.

Thus, the remaining 22 finals places were divided among the continental confederations, with 114 initially entering the qualification competition. Due to rejected entries and withdrawals, 103 teams eventually participated in the qualifying stages.\n\nThirteen places were contested by [[UEFA]] teams (Europe), two by [[CONMEBOL]] teams (South America), two by [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] teams (Africa), two by [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] teams (Asia), and two by [[CONCACAF]] teams (North and Central America and Caribbean). The remaining place was decided by a play-off between a CONMEBOL team and a team from the [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] (Oceania).\n\nBoth [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and [[Chile national football team|Chile]] were disqualified during the qualification process; the former for [[Cachirules|fielding an overage player]] in a prior youth tournament,<ref>{{cite news |title=Mexico given ban in soccer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/01/sports/mexico-given-ban-in-soccer.html |work=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |date=1 July 1988 |accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> the latter after goalkeeper [[Roberto Rojas]] faked injury from a firework thrown from the stands, which caused the match to be abandoned.

Austria, Cameroon, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia also returned after missing the 1986 tournament.\n\nAmong the teams who failed to qualify were 1986 semi-finalists France (missing out their first World Cup since 1974), Denmark, Poland (for the first time since 1970), Portugal and Hungary.\n\n===List of qualified teams===\n\nThe following 24 teams qualified for the final tournament.\n{{col begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n;[[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC]] (2)\n* {{fb|KOR|1984}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|UAE}}&nbsp;\n;[[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|CAF]] (2)\n* {{fb|EGY}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|CMR}}&nbsp;\n;[[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification (OFC)|OFC]] (0)\n* ''None qualified''\n{{col-4}}\n;[[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|CONCACAF]] (2)\n* {{fb|CRC}}&nbsp; \n* {{fb|USA}}&nbsp; \n;[[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|CONMEBOL]] (4)\n* {{fb|ARG}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|BRA|1968}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|COL}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|URU}}&nbsp;\n{{col-4}}\n;[[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|UEFA]] (14)\n* {{fb|AUT}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|BEL}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|TCH}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|ENG}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|ITA|1946}}&nbsp;(hosts)\n* {{fb|NED}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|IRL}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|ROU}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|SCO}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|SOV}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|ESP}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|SWE}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|West Germany}}&nbsp;\n* {{fb|YUG}}&nbsp;\n{{col-4}}\n[[Image:1990 world cup qualification.png|thumb|upright=1.5|{{legend|#000cff|Countries qualified for World Cup}} {{legend|#ffb400|Country did not qualify}} {{legend|black|Countries that did not enter the World Cup or were expelled from the tournament by FIFA prior to playing a match}} {{legend|#ababab|Country not a FIFA member}}]]\n{{col end}}\n\n==Venues==\nTwelve stadiums in twelve cities were selected to host matches at the 1990 World Cup. The [[Stadio San Nicola]] in [[Bari]] and [[Turin]]'s [[Stadio delle Alpi]] were completely new venues opened for the World Cup. Of the twelve stadiums in used, only two (San Siro and Luigi Ferraris) had been used for the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nThe remaining ten venues all underwent extensive programmes of improvements in preparation for the tournament, forcing many of the club tenants of the stadia to move to temporary homes. Additional seating and roofs were added to most stadia, with further redevelopments seeing running tracks removed and new pitches laid. Due to structural constraints, several of the existing stadia had to be virtually rebuilt to implement the changes required.\n\nLike Espana '82, the group stage of this tournament was organized in such a way where specific groups only played in two cities close in proximity to each other. Group A only played in Rome and Florence (Hosts Italy played all their competitive matches in Rome, except for their semi-final and third place matches, which were played in Naples and Bari, respectively), Group B played their matches in Naples and Bari (except for Argentina vs. Cameroon, which was the opening match of the tournament, played in Milan), Group C played their matches in Turin and Genoa, Group D played all their matches in Milan and Bologna, Group E played only in Udine and Verona, and Group F played on the island cities of Cagliari and Palermo. The cities that hosted the most World Cup matches were the two biggest cities in Italy: Rome and Milan, each hosting six matches, and Bari, Naples and Turin each hosted five matches. Cagliari, Udine and Palermo were the only cities of the 12 selected that did not host any knockout round matches.\n\nThe England national team, at the British government's request, were forced to play all their matches in Cagliari on the island of Sardinia. Hooliganism, [[Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom#1980s|rife in English football in the 1980s]] had spilled over onto the European continent when 39 mostly Italian Juventus supporters [[Heysel disaster|were killed]] and 600 were injured at the 1985 European Cup Final in [[Brussels]] while trying to flee from an attack by Liverpool supporters. This hooliganism had followed the national team while they played friendlies on the European continent \u2013 the distrust of English fans was so high that the English FA's reputation and even diplomatic relations between the UK and Italy were seen to be at risk if England played any group stage matches on the Italian mainland. Thanks largely to British Sports Minister Colin Moynihan's negative remarks about English fans weeks before the match, security around Cagliari during England's three matches there was extremely heavy \u2013 in addition to 7,000 local police and Carabineri, highly trained Italian military special forces were also there patrolling the premises. The Italian authorities' heavy presence proved to be justified as there were several riots during the time England were playing their matches in Cagliari, leading to a number of injuries, arrests and even deportations.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/17/sports/world-cup-90-fan-violence-at-world-cup-finals.html \u201cWORLD CUP '90; Fan Violence at World Cup Finals\u201d].

Six of the final eight in 1986 had qualified for the 1990 tournament, the missing nations being Mexico (quarter-final in 1986) and France (third place). Italy \u2013 who were seeded first as hosts \u2013 had not reached the final eight in 1986 and this left FIFA needing to exclude one of the three (qualified) nations who were eliminated in the 1986 quarter-finals: Brazil, England or Spain.\n\nOwing to their performance in 1982 but also to their overall World Cup record, Brazil were seeded third and not considered to drop out of the seedings. FIFA opted to seed England ahead of Spain. Spain had only been eliminated in 1986 on penalties, albeit by fourth-placed Belgium, while England had been defeated in 90 minutes by eventual winners Argentina; both countries had also reached the second stage in the 1982 event, playing in the same group in the second group stage with England ending up ahead of Spain, but Spain had also appeared in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 event]], while England had failed to qualify. FIFA President [[Jo\u00e3o Havelange]] had reportedly earlier stated that Spain would be seeded.\n\nSpanish officials believed the seeding was contrived to ensure England would be placed in Group F, the group to be held off the Italian mainland, in a bid to contain England's hooliganism problems. Their coach [[Luis Su\u00e1rez Miramontes|Luis Su\u00e1rez]] said, \"We feel we've been cheated...they wanted to seed England and to send it to Cagliari at all costs. So they invented this formula\".<ref name=\"Seedings\" /> FIFA countered that \"the formula was based on the teams' respective showings during the previous two World Cups. England merited the sixth position. This is in no way a concession to English hooliganism\".<ref name=\"Seedings\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the Netherlands also had an argument that on grounds of recent footballing form, they should be seeded, as the winners of the [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988 European Championship]], in which both Spain and England had been eliminated in the group stages, while Belgium (fourth in the 1986 World Cup after beating Spain, and thus seeded in 1990) had failed to even qualify: but this argument was countered by the fact that the Netherlands had themselves failed to qualify for both the 1982 and 1986 World Cups, which was considered the most important factor in the decision not to seed them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/30/sports/cup-seedings-revealed.html|title=Cup seedings revealed|work=The New York Times|date=30 November 1989|accessdate=11 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAs it happened, the two teams considered the most unlucky not to be seeded, namely Spain and the Netherlands, were both drawn in groups against the two teams considered the weakest of the seeded nations, namely Belgium and England: and the arguments over the seeding positions fizzled out.  England could be said to have justified their seeded position by narrowly winning their group ahead of the Netherlands: while Spain seemed to have made their own point about being worth a seeded position, by defeating Belgium to top their own group, in doing so gaining a measure of revenge for the fact that it was Belgium who had eliminated them in 1986.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n|-\n!width=20%|Seeds\n!width=20%|Pot 1<ref name=\"Pots\">{{Cite news |title=The Times guide to the draw for the World Cup finals |page=51 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=9 December 1989 }}</ref>\n!width=20%|Pot 2<ref name=\"Pots\"/>\n!width=20%|Pot 3<ref name=\"Pots\"/>\n|-\n|\n{{fb|ITA}} (1st)<br />\n{{fb|ARG}} (2nd)<br />\n{{fb|BRA|1968}} (3rd)<br />\n{{fb|FRG}} (4th)<br />\n{{fb|BEL}} (5th)<br />\n{{fb|ENG}} (6th)\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{{fb|CMR}}<br />\n{{fb|CRC}}<br />\n{{fb|EGY}}<br />\n{{fb|KOR|1984}}<br />\n{{fb|UAE}}<br />\n{{fb|USA}}\n|\n{{fb|COL}}<br />\n{{fb|TCH}}<br />\n{{fb|IRL}}<br />\n{{fb|ROU}}<br />\n{{fb|SWE}}<br />\n{{fb|URU}}\n|\n{{fb|AUT}}<br />\n{{fb|NED}}<br />\n{{fb|SCO}}<br />\n{{fb|ESP}}<br />\n{{fb|URS}}<br />\n{{fb|YUG}}\n|}\n\n===Final draw===\n[[File:Mascotte di italia 90.JPG|thumb|right|''Ciao'', a [[stick figure]] in the colours of the [[flag of Italy|Italy ''Tricolore'']], was the [[FIFA World Cup mascots|mascot]] for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.]]\nOn 9 December 1989 the draw was conducted at the [[Palazzetto dello Sport]] in Rome, where the teams were drawn out from the three pots to be placed with the seeded teams in their predetermined groups. The only stipulation of the draw was that no group could feature two South American teams.<ref name=\"Pots\"/> The ceremony was hosted by Italian television presenter [[Pippo Baudo]], with Italian actress [[Sophia Loren]] and opera singer [[Luciano Pavarotti]] conducting the draw alongside FIFA general secretary [[Sepp Blatter]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/10/sports/soccer-us-must-face-italy-in-cup.html|title=U.S. must face Italy in cup|work=The New York Times|date=10 December 1989|first=Paul|last=Gardner|accessdate=11 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe draw show was FIFA's most ambitious yet with [[Pel\u00e9]], [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] appearing, as well as a performance of the Italian version of the [[FIFA World Cup official songs|tournament's official song]] \"To Be Number One\" by Giorgio Moroder, performed as \"[[Un'estate italiana]]\" by [[Edoardo Bennato]] and [[Gianna Nannini]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The FIFA World Cup Final Draw history |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mencompwc/51/97/68/fs-201_10e_fwc-draw-history.pdf |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=11 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe event also featured the [[FIFA World Cup mascots|official mascot]] of this World Cup, ''Ciao'', a [[stick figure]] player with a football head and an [[flag of Italy|Italian tricolor body]] that formed the word \"ITALIA\" when deconstructed and reconstructed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mascots |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/marketing/brand/mascots.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}</ref> Its name is a greeting in Italian.\n\n===Tournament review===\nThe finals tournament began in Italy on 8 June and concluded on 8 July. The format of the 1990 competition remained the same as in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]: 24 qualified teams were divided into six groups of four. The top two teams and four best third-place finishers from the six groups advanced to the knockout stage, which eliminated the teams until a winner emerged. In total, 52 games were played.\n\n===Negative tactics===\nThe tournament generated a record low goals-per-game average and a then-record of 16 red cards were handed out.<ref name=\"Record\"/> In the knockout stage, many teams played defensively for 120 minutes, with the intention of trying their luck in the penalty shoot-out, rather than risk going forward. Two exceptions were the eventual champions West Germany and hosts Italy, the only teams to win three of their four knockout matches in normal time. There were four penalty shoot-outs, a record subsequently equalled in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] tournaments. Eight matches went to extra time, a record equalled in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 tournament]].\n\nIreland and Argentina were prime examples of this trend of cautious defensive play; the Irish team fell behind in two of their three group matches and only equalised late in both games. Losing finalists Argentina, meanwhile, scored only five goals in the entire tournament (a record low for a finalist). Argentina also became the first team to advance twice on penalty shoot-outs and the first team to fail to score and have a player sent off in a World Cup final.<ref name=\"Italy 1990\"/>\n\nLargely as a result of this trend FIFA introduced the [[back-pass rule]] in time for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 tournament]] to make it harder for teams to time-waste by repeatedly passing the ball back for their goalkeepers to pick up. [[Three points for a win|Three, rather than two points]] would be awarded for victories at future tournaments to help further encourage attacking play.\n\n===Emergence of Cameroon===\n[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] reached the quarter-finals, where they were narrowly defeated by England.<ref name=\"Italy 1990\"/> They opened the tournament with a shock victory over reigning champions Argentina, before topping the group ahead of them, [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and [[UEFA Euro 1988|European Championship]] runners-up the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]]. Their success was fired by the goals of [[Roger Milla]], a 38-year-old forward who came out of international retirement to join the national squad at the last moment after a personal request from Cameroonian President [[Paul Biya]]. Milla's four goals and flamboyant goal celebrations made him one of the tournament's biggest stars as well as taking Cameroon to the last eight.<ref name=\"Italy 1990\"/> Most of Cameroon's squad was made up of players who played in France's premier football league, [[Ligue 1]]- French is one of the officially spoken languages in Cameroon, it being a former French territory. In reaching this stage, they had gone further than any African nation had ever managed in a World Cup before; a feat only equalled twice since (by [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]). Their success was African football's biggest yet on the world stage and FIFA subsequently decided to allocate the [[Confederation of African Football|CAF qualifying zone]] an additional place for the next World Cup tournament.\n\n===All-champion final four===\nDespite the performances of nations such as Cameroon, Colombia, Ireland, Romania and Costa Rica, the semi-finalists consisted of Argentina, England, Italy and West Germany, all previous World Cup winners, with eight previous titles between them. After the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 tournament]], this is only the second time in the history of the World Cup this has occurred. The teams which finished first, second and third had also contested both the two previous World Cup Finals between themselves.\n\n==Group stage==\n''All times are [[Central European Summer Time]] ([[UTC+02:00|UTC+2]])''[[File:1990 world cup.png|right|thumb|600px|{{col-start}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#2b42a3|Champion}} {{legend|#34c0be|Runner-up}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#269c5a|Third place}} {{legend|#81c846|Fourth place}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#e4e454|Quarter-finals}} {{legend|#f4d4ac|Round of 16}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#b94954|Group stage}} {{col-end}}]] <!-- Note: background colour style shown here for later use, when colour codes used in map determined: <span style=\"background-color:yellow\">text here</span>--->\n\nIn the following tables:\n*'''Pld''' = total games played\n*'''W''' = total games won\n*'''D''' = total games drawn (tied)\n*'''L''' = total games lost\n*'''GF''' = total goals scored (goals for)\n*'''GA''' = total goals conceded (goals against)\n*'''GD''' = goal difference (GF\u2212GA)\n*'''Pts''' = total points accumulated\n\nThe Group stage saw the twenty-four teams divided into six groups of four teams. Each group was a [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] of six games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams were awarded two points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The teams coming first and second in each group qualified for the Round of 16. The four best third-placed teams would also advance to the next stage.\n\nTypical of a World Cup staged in Europe, the matches all started at either 5:00 or 9:00 in the evening; this allowed for the games to avoid being played in the heat of an Italian summer, which would soar past 86F (30C) all over Italy.\n\nIf teams were level on points, they were ranked on the following criteria in order:\n{{Clear}}\n{{quotation|\n# Greatest total goal difference in the three group matches\n# Greatest number of goals scored in the three group matches\n# Most points earned in matches against other teams in the tie\n# Greatest goal difference in matches against other teams in the tie\n# Greatest number of goals scored in matches against other teams in the tie\n# Drawing of lots\n}}\n\n====Group A====\n\n{{Main|1990 FIFA World Cup Group A}}\nHosts [[Italy national football team|Italy]] won Group A with a 100 percent record.

In their second game the introduction of [[Roger Milla]] was the catalyst for a 2\u20131 win over [[Romania national football team|Romania]], Milla scoring twice from the bench (making him the oldest goalscorer in the tournament). With progression assured, Cameroon slumped to a 4\u20130 defeat in their final group game to the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] (in what would be their last World Cup due to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]), who were striving to stay in the tournament on goal difference after successive 2\u20130 defeats.  Argentina lost their veteran goalkeeper, Nery Pumpido, to a broken leg during their victory over the USSR: his replacement, Sergio Goycochea, proved to be one of the stars of their tournament.  In the final match, a 1\u20131 draw between Romania and Argentina sent both through, equal on points and on goal difference but Romania having the advantage on goals scored: Romania were thus second, Argentina qualified as one of the best third-placed teams.\n{{1990 FIFA World Cup group tables|Group B}}\n{| style=\"width:100%\" cellspacing=\"1\"\n|-\n!width=25%|\n!width=10%|\n!\n|-\n|8 June 1990\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|ARG}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Argentina vs Cameroon|0\u20131]]||{{fb|CMR}}||[[San Siro]], [[Milan]]\n|-\n|9 June 1990\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|URS}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Soviet Union vs Romania|0\u20132]]||{{fb|ROU}}||[[Stadio San Nicola]], [[Bari]]\n|-\n|13 June 1990\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|ARG}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Argentina vs Soviet Union|2\u20130]]||{{fb|URS}}||[[Stadio San Paolo]], [[Naples]]\n|-\n|14 June 1990\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|CMR}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Cameroon vs Romania|2\u20131]]||{{fb|ROU}}||[[Stadio San Nicola]], [[Bari]]\n|-\n|18 June 1990\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|ARG}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Argentina vs Romania|1\u20131]]||{{fb|ROU}}||[[Stadio San Paolo]], [[Naples]]\n|- style=font-size:90%\n|align=right|{{fb-rt|CMR}}||align=center|[[1990 FIFA World Cup Group B#Cameroon vs Soviet Union|0\u20134]]||{{fb|URS}}||[[Stadio San Nicola]], [[Bari]]\n|}\n\n====Group C====\n\n{{Main|1990 FIFA World Cup Group C}}\n[[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] beat [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] 1\u20130 in their first match, lost 1\u20130 to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in their second, then saw off [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] 2\u20131 to claim a place in the second round.

In the six group games, no team managed to score more than once in a match. England beat Egypt 1\u20130, the only match with a decisive result, and that was enough to win the group. The group containing England, Ireland and the Netherlands was remarkably similar to the group stage of the 1988 European Championship, which had eventually been won by the Netherlands, with England crashing out with three losses (to Ireland, the Netherlands and the USSR) and Ireland also narrowly failing to progress after losing to the Netherlands and drawing with the USSR. The results of the 1990 group, however, were different: England took the lead with an early goal for Lineker against Ireland, but Sheedy's late equalizer gave them a share of the spoils. The Netherlands failed to replicate their form of two years earlier, only drawing against Egypt: they had taken a 1-0 lead, but without impressing, and Egypt were well worth their equalizer courtesy of a penalty by Abdelghani. England then had much the better of their goalless draw with the Netherlands: indeed they had the ball in the net once, from a free-kick by Pearce, but it was disallowed. For the second World Cup in succession, however, England lost their captain Bryan Robson to an injury which put him out of the tournament, just over halfway through their second match. Ireland and Egypt barely registered a shot on goal between them in the other 0-0 draw: after the first four matches all four teams had equal records with 2 draws, 1 goal for and 1 goal against. England's victory over Egypt, thanks to a 58th-minute goal from [[Mark Wright (footballer, born 1963)|Mark Wright]], put them top of the group: in the other match, Gullit gave the Netherlands the lead against Ireland, but Niall Quinn scored a second-half equalizer and the two teams finished in second and third, still with identical records. Both teams qualified but they had to draw lots to place the teams in second and third place.\n\n{{1990 FIFA World Cup group tables|Group F}}\nThe Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands finished with identical records.

There was also a play-off to decide third/fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by 30 minutes of [[Overtime (association football)|extra time]]; if scores were still level there would be a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] (five penalties each, if neither team already had a decisive advantage, and more if necessary) to determine who progressed to the next round.

Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], and Dutchmen [[Marco van Basten]], [[Ruud Gullit]] and [[Frank Rijkaard]] for [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]). After 22 minutes [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] and Rijkaard were both dismissed after a number of incidents between the two players (including Rijkaard spitting on V\u00f6ller) left the Argentine referee with no option but to send them both off. As the players walked off the pitch together, Rijkaard spat on V\u00f6ller a second time. Early in the second half, [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] put the West Germans ahead and [[Andreas Brehme]] added a second with eight minutes left. A [[Ronald Koeman]] penalty for the Netherlands in the 89th minute narrowed the score to 2\u20131 but the Germans saw the game out to gain some revenge for their [[UEFA Euro 1988#Semi-finals|exit to the Dutch in the previous European Championship]].\n\nMeanwhile, the heroics of Cameroon and Roger Milla continued in their game with Colombia. Milla was introduced as a second-half substitute with the game goalless, eventually breaking the deadlock midway in extra time. Three minutes later he netted a second after Colombian goalkeeper, [[Ren\u00e9 Higuita]] was dispossessed by Milla while well out of his goal, leaving the striker free to slot the ball into the empty net. Though the deficit was soon reduced to 2\u20131, Cameroon held on to become the first African team ever to reach the World Cup quarter-finals. Costa Rica were comfortably beaten 4\u20131 by Czechoslovakia, for whom [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Skuhrav\u00fd]] scored the tournament's second and final [[hat-trick]].\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's match with Romania remained goalless after extra time and the Irish side won 5\u20134 on penalties. [[David O'Leary]] converted the penalty that clinched Ireland's place in the quarter-finals. Ireland thus became the first team since Sweden in [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] to reach the last eight in a World Cup finals tournament without winning a match outright. Yugoslavia beat Spain 2\u20131 after extra time, with [[Dragan Stojkovi\u0107]] scoring both the Yugoslavs' goals. England were the final qualifier against Belgium, as midfielder [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]'s swivelling volley broke the stalemate with the game moments away from a penalty shoot-out.\n\n{{football box\n|date=23 June 1990\n|time=17:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|Cameroon}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Cameroon vs Colombia|2\u20131]]\n|aet=yes\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=323/match=102/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|Colombia}}\n|goals1=[[Roger Milla|Milla]] {{goal|106||108}}\n|goals2=[[Bernardo Red\u00edn|Red\u00edn]] {{goal|115}}\n|stadium=[[Stadio San Paolo]], [[Naples]]\n|attendance=50,026\n|referee=[[Tullio Lanese]] ([[Italian Football Federation|Italy]])}}\n----\n{{football box\n|date=23 June 1990\n|time=21:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|TCH}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Czechoslovakia vs Costa Rica|4\u20131]]\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup//matches/round=323/match=129/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|CRC}}\n|goals1=[[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Skuhrav\u00fd|Skuhrav\u00fd]] {{goal|12||63||82}}<br/>[[Lubo\u0161 Kub\u00edk|Kub\u00edk]] {{goal|75}}\n|goals2=[[R\u00f3nald Gonz\u00e1lez Brenes|Gonz\u00e1lez]] {{goal|54}}\n|stadium=[[Stadio San Nicola]], [[Bari]]\n|attendance=47,673\n|referee=[[Siegfried Kirschen]] ([[German Football Association|East Germany]])}}\n----\n{{football box\n|date=24 June 1990\n|time=17:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|BRA|1968}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Brazil vs Argentina|0\u20131]]\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/worldcup/italy1990/matches/round=323/match=25/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|ARG}}\n|goals2=[[Claudio Caniggia|Caniggia]] {{goal|80}}\n|stadium=[[Stadio delle Alpi]], [[Turin]]\n|attendance=61,381\n|referee=[[Jo\u00ebl Quiniou]] ([[French Football Federation|France]])}}\n----\n{{football box\n|date=24 June 1990\n|time=21:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|FRG}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#West Germany vs Netherlands|2\u20131]]\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=323/match=196/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|NED}}\n|goals1=[[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann|Klinsmann]] {{goal|51}}<br/>[[Andreas Brehme|Brehme]] {{goal|82}}\n|goals2=[[Ronald Koeman|R.

In the second half, the game was turned on its head during a five-minute stretch: first Cameroon were awarded a penalty from which [[Emmanuel Kunde]] scored the equaliser; then in the 65th minute [[Eugene Ekeke]] put Cameroon ahead. Cameroon came within eight minutes of reaching the semi-finals before they conceded a penalty, which Gary Lineker converted. Midway through extra time, England were awarded another penalty and Lineker again scored from the spot. England were through to the semi-finals for the first time since the days of [[Bobby Moore]] 24 years prior.\n\n{{football box\n|date=30 June 1990\n|time=17:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|ARG}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Argentina vs Yugoslavia|0\u20130]]\n|aet=yes\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=751/match=31/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|YUG}}\n|stadium=[[Stadio Artemio Franchi|Stadio Comunale]], [[Florence]]\n|attendance=38,971\n|referee=[[Kurt R\u00f6thlisberger]] ([[Swiss Football Association|Switzerland]])\n|penaltyscore=3\u20132\n|penalties1=[[Jos\u00e9 Serrizuela|Serrizuela]] {{pengoal}} <br />[[Jorge Burruchaga|Burruchaga]] {{pengoal}} <br />[[Diego Maradona|Maradona]] {{penmiss}}<br />[[Pedro Troglio|Troglio]] {{penmiss}}<br />[[Gustavo Dezotti|Dezotti]] {{pengoal}}\t\n|penalties2={{penmiss}} [[Dragan Stojkovi\u0107|Stojkovi\u0107]]<br />{{pengoal}} [[Robert Prosine\u010dki|Prosine\u010dki]]<br />{{pengoal}} [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107|Savi\u0107evi\u0107]]<br />{{penmiss}} [[Dragoljub Brnovi\u0107|Brnovi\u0107]]<br />{{penmiss}} [[Faruk Had\u017eibegi\u0107|Had\u017eibegi\u0107]]\t\n}}\t\n----\n{{football box\n|date=30 June 1990\n|time=21:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|IRL}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Republic of Ireland vs Italy|0\u20131]]\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=751/match=243/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|ITA}}\n|goals2=[[Salvatore Schillaci|Schillaci]] {{goal|38}}\n|stadium=[[Stadio Olimpico]], [[Rome]]\n|attendance=73,303\n|referee=[[Carlos Silva Valente]] ([[Portuguese Football Federation|Portugal]])}}\n----\n{{football box\n|date=1 July 1990\n|time=17:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|TCH}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Czechoslovakia vs West Germany|0\u20131]]\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=751/match=197/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|FRG}}\n|goals2=[[Lothar Matth\u00e4us|Matth\u00e4us]] {{goal|25|pen.}}\n|stadium=[[San Siro]], [[Milan]]\n|attendance=73,347\n|referee=[[Helmut Kohl (referee)|Helmut Kohl]] ([[Austrian Football Association|Austria]])}}\n----\n\n{{football box\n|date=1 July 1990\n|time=21:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|CMR}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Cameroon vs England|2\u20133]]\n|aet=yes\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=751/match=103/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|ENG}}\n|goals1=[[Emmanuel Kund\u00e9|Kund\u00e9]] {{goal|61|pen.}}<br/>[[Eug\u00e8ne Ek\u00e9k\u00e9|Ek\u00e9k\u00e9]] {{goal|65}}\n|goals2=[[David Platt (footballer)|Platt]] {{goal|25}}<br/>[[Gary Lineker|Lineker]] {{goal|83|pen.|105|pen.}}\n|stadium=[[Stadio San Paolo]], [[Naples]]\n|attendance=55,205\n|referee=[[Edgardo Codesal]] ([[Mexican Football Federation|Mexico]])}}\n\n====Semi-finals====\n\nThe first semi-final featured the host nation, Italy, and the world champions, Argentina in Naples. 'Toto' Schillaci scored yet again to put Italy ahead in the 17th minute, but Claudio Caniggia equalised midway through the second half, breaking [[Walter Zenga]]'s clean sheet streak throughout the tournament. There were no more goals in the 90 minutes or in extra time despite Maradona (who played for Naples in Serie A at the time) showing glimpses of magic, but there was a sending-off: [[Ricardo Giusti]] of Argentina was shown the red card in the 13th minute of extra time. Argentina went through on penalties, winning the shoot-out 4\u20133 after more heroics from Goycochea.\n\nThe semi-final between West Germany and England at [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]'s home stadium in Turin was goalless at half-time. Then, in the 60th minute, a shot from Andreas Brehme was deflected by [[Paul Parker (footballer)|Paul Parker]] into his own net. England equalised with ten minutes left; Gary Lineker was the scorer. The game ended 1\u20131. Extra time yielded more chances. Klinsmann was guilty of two glaring misses and both sides struck a post. England had another Platt goal disallowed for offside. The match went to penalties, and West Germany went on to win the shoot-out 4\u20133.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/retro-mbm-england-v-west-germany-sort-of-live|title=England v West Germany at Italia '90 \u2013 as it happened|date=27 March 2014|work=Guardian |accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref>\t\n\n{{football box\n|date=3 July 1990\n|time=20:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|ARG}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Argentina vs Italy|1\u20131]]\n|aet=yes\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=3464/match=28/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|ITA}}\n|goals1=[[Claudio Caniggia|Caniggia]] {{goal|67}}\n|goals2=[[Salvatore Schillaci|Schillaci]] {{goal|17}}\n|stadium=[[Stadio San Paolo]], [[Naples]]\n|attendance=59,978\n|referee=[[Michel Vautrot]] ([[French Football Federation|France]])\n|penaltyscore=4\u20133\n|penalties1=[[Jos\u00e9 Serrizuela|Serrizuela]] {{pengoal}}<br />[[Jorge Burruchaga|Burruchaga]] {{pengoal}}<br />[[Julio Olarticoechea|Olarticoechea]] {{pengoal}}<br />[[Diego Maradona|Maradona]] {{pengoal}}\n|penalties2={{pengoal}} [[Franco Baresi|Baresi]]<br />{{pengoal}} [[Roberto Baggio|Baggio]]<br />{{pengoal}} [[Luigi De Agostini|De Agostini]]<br />{{penmiss}} [[Roberto Donadoni|Donadoni]]<br />{{penmiss}} [[Aldo Serena|Serena]]\n}}\n----\n{{football box\n|date=4 July 1990\n|time=20:00\n|team1={{fb-rt|FRG}}\n|score=[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#West Germany vs England|1\u20131]]\n|aet=yes\n|report=[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=3464/match=159/index.html Report]\n|team2={{fb|ENG}}\n|goals1=[[Andreas Brehme|Brehme]] {{goal|60}}\n|goals2=[[Gary Lineker|Lineker]] {{goal|80}}\n|stadium=[[Stadio delle Alpi]], [[Turin]]\n|attendance=62,628\n|referee=[[Jos\u00e9 Roberto Wright]] ([[Brazilian Football Confederation|Brazil]])\n|penalties1=[[Andreas Brehme|Brehme]] {{pengoal}}<br/>[[Lothar Matth\u00e4us|Matth\u00e4us]] {{pengoal}}<br/>[[Karl-Heinz Riedle|Riedle]] {{pengoal}}<br/>[[Olaf Thon|Thon]] {{pengoal}}\n|penaltyscore=4\u20133\n|penalties2={{pengoal}} [[Gary Lineker|Lineker]]<br/>{{pengoal}} [[Peter Beardsley|Beardsley]]<br/>{{pengoal}} [[David Platt (footballer)|Platt]]<br/>{{penmiss}} [[Stuart Pearce|Pearce]]<br/>{{penmiss}} [[Chris Waddle|Waddle]]\n}}\n\n====Third-place play-off====\n\nThe game saw three goals in a 15-minute spell.

A header by [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] levelled the game 10 minutes later but [[Salvatore Schillaci|Schillaci]] was fouled in the penalty area five minutes later, leading to a penalty. Schillaci himself got up to convert the kick to win him the tournament's [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] for his six-goal tally. [[Nicola Berti]] had a goal ruled out minutes later, but the hosts claimed third place.

Monzon was the first player ever to be sent off in a World Cup Final.\n\nArgentina, weakened by suspension and injury, offered little attacking threat throughout a contest dominated by the West Germans, who struggled to create many clear goalscoring opportunities. The only goal of the contest arrived in the 85th minute when Mexican referee [[Edgardo Codesal]] awarded a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] to West Germany, after a foul on [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] by [[Roberto Sensini]] leading to Argentinian protests.<ref name=\"Germany finally awarded penatyy\">{{cite book |title=The Story of the World Cup |publisher=Faber and Faber |last=Glanville |first=Brian |year=2018 |pages=326 |isbn=978-0-571-32556-6 |quote=After half-time, the game grew harsher, when Klaus Augenthaler was blantanly tripped in the box by Goycoecha, Germany had far stronger claims for a penalty than that which won the match.

In the closing moments, Argentina were reduced to nine after [[Gustavo Dezotti]], who had already been yellow carded earlier in the match, received a red card when he hauled [[J\u00fcrgen Kohler]] to the ground during a stoppage in play. The 1\u20130 scoreline provided another first: Argentina were the first team to fail to score in a World Cup Final.\n\nWith its third title (and three second-place finishes) West Germany \u2013 in its final tournament before [[German reunification|national reunification]] \u2013 became the most successful World Cup nation at the time. West German manager [[Franz Beckenbauer]] became the first man to both captain (in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]]) and manage a World Cup winning team, and only the second man (after [[M\u00e1rio Zagallo]] of Brazil) to win the World Cup as a player and as team manager.

He was also a jazz [[composer]] and [[arranger]]. He worked as a musical arranger for ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' hosted by [[Judy Garland]], succeeding [[Mel Torm\u00e9]]. He conducted the orchestra for her 1967 \"Palace\" concerts and album and was the conductor and musical director on her last tour.\n\n==Biography==\nBobby Cole was born as Robert Kane Sarnicole in [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria, New York]] on September 8, 1932, and grew up in the [[Ravenswood, Queens|Ravenswood]] section of [[Queens]]. After service in the U.S. Army, he returned to [[New York City|New York]] to begin his career. Bobby worked originally with a group called the Bobby Cole Band composed of members of those musicians he knew from Astoria. Bobby worked for years with professional jazz drummer [[Tony Lupo]].\n\nBobby usually worked as part of a trio; providing lead vocals and piano while working with a bassist and a drummer as well. The Bobby Cole Trio premiered in New York at [[The Living Room]] in New York in 1960. His friend, [[Frank Sinatra]] was under contract with [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] at the time and through him, Cole was offered a deal at Capitol. Cole did not want to conform to the playlist demands of big record labels, or the compromises that producers wanted.\n\nIn 1960, Cole agreed to a record deal with [[Columbia Records]] on less restraining terms and the same year produced an album. The album was called ''NEW NEW NEW'' and featured a traditional jazz trio setup and traditional jazz arrangements, but it was Cole's youthful voice that had a smoky burr that made it extraordinary. One of Cole's trademark tunes, \"The Lady's In Love With You\", was on this album as well.\n\nIn early 1964, Bill Colleran, the executive producer for ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'', fired [[Mel Torm\u00e9]] and Cole was appointed as the musical arranger for the show. [[Judy Garland]] had recently met him in New York and allegedly a relationship had started between them. Later on, Garland called upon Cole to conduct the orchestra for her 1967 ''\"Palace\"'' concerts and the album that accompanied these concerts.\n\nCole eventually made a solo album in 1966. ''A Point of View'' was released through Concentric Records which was started by Cole's friend Jack Lonshein. Lonshein was working for [[Mainstream Records]] and was a friend of Cole's. Lonshein tried to get [[Bob Shad]], the founder of [[Mainstream Records|Mainstream]] to release an album of Cole\u2019s original material, but Shad failed to show interest. Frustrated by this setback, Lonshein started his own record label, Concentric Records, in 1966. When Cole\u2019s ''A Point of View'' album was finally released on Concentric in 1967, it sold quite well in the New York City area, where he had earned a following mainly through his performances at Jilly's. The album was a remarkable disc of original songs that was an underground sensation for its brash, jazzy up-tunes and some dark ballads including the somber closer, \"I'm Growing Old\".\n\nAt about this time, after hearing author Jerry Jeff Walker play a yet-to-be recorded composition called \"Mr. Bojangles\", in a light, folk style at a Greenwich Village club, Cole decided to cover it as a contemplative ballad. A recording of the song was later released on Concentric in 1968. This would be the label\u2019s only 7-inch release. Lonshein licensed the master to Date records as well for better distribution and it began to take off. Unfortunately, the single came out at exactly the same time as [[Jerry Jeff Walker]]\u2019s version. Cole's single \"Mr. Bojangles\" was released in the summer of 1968 on [[Columbia Records]].  Cole and Walker's versions battled to a draw inside the Top 100. But it would be Cole's arrangement later used by everyone from [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] to [[George Burns]].\n\nAs both versions were slowly creeping up the charts in the summer of 1968, a frustrated [[Bob Shad]], thinking he had missed out on an opportunity for a long-awaited hit, hypocritically chastised Lonshein for not releasing the single on [[Mainstream Records|Mainstream]].

He was also a jazz [[composer]] and [[arranger]]. He worked as a musical arranger for ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' hosted by [[Judy Garland]], succeeding [[Mel Torm\u00e9]]. He conducted the orchestra for her 1967 \"Palace\" concerts and album and was the conductor and musical director on her last tour.\n\n==Biography==\nBobby Cole was born as Robert Kane Sarnicole in [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria, New York]] on September 8, 1932, and grew up in the [[Ravenswood, Queens|Ravenswood]] section of [[Queens]]. After service in the U.S. Army, he returned to [[New York City|New York]] to begin his career. Bobby worked originally with a group called the Bobby Cole Band composed of members of those musicians he knew from Astoria. Bobby worked for years with professional jazz drummer [[Tony Lupo]].\n\nBobby usually worked as part of a trio; providing lead vocals and piano while working with a bassist and a drummer as well. The Bobby Cole Trio premiered in New York at [[The Living Room]] in New York in 1960. His friend, [[Frank Sinatra]] was under contract with [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] at the time and through him, Cole was offered a deal at Capitol. Cole did not want to conform to the playlist demands of big record labels, or the compromises that producers wanted.\n\nIn 1960, Cole agreed to a record deal with [[Columbia Records]] on less restraining terms and the same year produced an album. The album was called ''NEW NEW NEW'' and featured a traditional jazz trio setup and traditional jazz arrangements, but it was Cole's youthful voice that had a smoky burr that made it extraordinary. One of Cole's trademark tunes, \"The Lady's In Love With You\", was on this album as well.\n\nIn early 1964, Bill Colleran, the executive producer for ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'', fired [[Mel Torm\u00e9]] and Cole was appointed as the musical arranger for the show. [[Judy Garland]] had recently met him in New York and allegedly a relationship had started between them. Later on, Garland called upon Cole to conduct the orchestra for her 1967 ''\"Palace\"'' concerts and the album that accompanied these concerts.\n\nCole eventually made a solo album in 1966. ''A Point of View'' was released through Concentric Records which was started by Cole's friend Jack Lonshein. Lonshein was working for [[Mainstream Records]] and was a friend of Cole's. Lonshein tried to get [[Bob Shad]], the founder of [[Mainstream Records|Mainstream]] to release an album of Cole\u2019s original material, but Shad failed to show interest. Frustrated by this setback, Lonshein started his own record label, Concentric Records, in 1966. When Cole\u2019s ''A Point of View'' album was finally released on Concentric in 1967, it sold quite well in the New York City area, where he had earned a following mainly through his performances at Jilly's. The album was a remarkable disc of original songs that was an underground sensation for its brash, jazzy up-tunes and some dark ballads including the somber closer, \"I'm Growing Old\".\n\nAt about this time, after hearing author Jerry Jeff Walker play a yet-to-be recorded composition called \"Mr. Bojangles\", in a light, folk style at a Greenwich Village club, Cole decided to cover it as a contemplative ballad. A recording of the song was later released on Concentric in 1968. This would be the label\u2019s only 7-inch release. Lonshein licensed the master to Date records as well for better distribution and it began to take off. Unfortunately, the single came out at exactly the same time as [[Jerry Jeff Walker]]\u2019s version. Cole's single \"Mr. Bojangles\" was released in the summer of 1968 on [[Columbia Records]].  Cole and Walker's versions battled to a draw inside the Top 100. But it would be Cole's arrangement later used by everyone from [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] to [[George Burns]].\n\nAs both versions were slowly creeping up the charts in the summer of 1968, a frustrated [[Bob Shad]], thinking he had missed out on an opportunity for a long-awaited hit, hypocritically chastised Lonshein for not releasing the single on [[Mainstream Records|Mainstream]]. Lonshein left [[Mainstream Records|Mainstream]] as a result of this incident and took a job at an all-night record store, awaking early each morning to produce tapes with Cole. Lonshein brought the tapes to the attention of his old friend Phil Picone who at the time was working for [[MGM]].

The blessing took place in the quiet nearby village of [[Schipluiden]]. Vermeer's new mother-in-law [[Maria Thins]] was significantly wealthier than he, and it was probably she who insisted that Vermeer convert to Catholicism before the marriage on 5 April.<ref group=\"Note\">Catholicism was not a forbidden religion, but tolerated in the [[Dutch Republic]]. They were not allowed to build new churches, so services were held in hidden churches (so-called [[Schuilkerk]]). Catholics were restrained in their careers, unable to get high-rank  jobs in city administration or civic guard. It was impossible to be elected as a member of the city council; therefore, the Catholics were not represented in the provincial and national assembly.</ref> According to art historian [[Walter Liedtke]], Vermeer's conversion seems to have been made with conviction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Liedtke|first1=Walter|last2=Plomp|first2=Michiel C.|last3=R\u00fcger|first3=Axel|authorlink1=Walter Liedtke|title=Vermeer and the Delft school: [catalogue ... in conjunction with the exhibition \"Vermeer and the Delft School\" held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, from 8 March to 27 May 2001, and at The National Gallery, London, from 20 June to 16 September 2001]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0870999737|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC/page/n373 359]}}</ref> His painting ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/32.100.18 |title=Johannes Vermeer: Allegory of the Catholic Faith (32.100.18) &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> made between 1670 and 1672, placed less emphasis on the artists' usual naturalistic concerns and more on symbolic religious applications, including the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]].

Art historians have found no hard evidence to support this.<ref name=p104 group=Montias/> Local authority [[Leonaert Bramer]] acted as a friend, but their style of painting is rather different.<ref name=Gallery/> Liedtke suggests that Vermeer taught himself, using information from one of his father's connections.<ref name=p866 group=Liedtke/> Some scholars think that Vermeer was trained under Catholic painter [[Abraham Bloemaert]]. Vermeer's style is similar to that of some of the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]], whose works are depicted as paintings-within-paintings in the backgrounds of several of his compositions.<ref group=\"Note\">Identifiable works include compositions by Utrecht painters [[Dirck van Baburen|Baburen]] and [[Caesar van Everdingen|Everdingen]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Delftsedonderslag.jpg|thumb|left|''A View of Delft after the Explosion of 1654'', by [[Egbert van der Poel]]]]\nOn 29 December 1653, Vermeer became a member of the [[Guild of Saint Luke#Dutch Republic|Guild of Saint Luke]], a trade association for painters. The guild's records make clear that Vermeer did not pay the usual admission fee. It was a year of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], [[First Anglo-Dutch War|war]], and economic crisis; Vermeer was not alone in experiencing difficult financial circumstances. In 1654, the city suffered the terrible explosion known as the [[Delft Explosion|Delft Thunderclap]], which destroyed a large section of the city.<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/maps/delft/delft_in_vermeer's_time.html \"Delft in Johannes Vermeer's Time\"], Essential Vermeer. Retrieved 29 September 2009</ref> In 1657, he might have found a patron in local art collector [[Pieter van Ruijven]], who lent him some money. It seems that Vermeer turned for inspiration to the art of the [[fijnschilder]]s from Leiden. Vermeer was responding to the market of [[Gerard Dou]]'s paintings, who sold his paintings for exorbitant prices. Dou may have influenced [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Gabriel Metsu]], too. Vermeer also charged higher than average prices for his work, most of which were purchased by an unknown collector.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The age of Rembrandt and Vermeer: Dutch painting in the seventeenth century|last=Nash|first=J.M.|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1972|isbn=9780030918704|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40 40]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vermeer-view-of-delft.jpg|thumb|''[[View of Delft]]'' (1660\u201361): \"He took a turbulent reality, and made it look like Heaven on earth.\"<ref>[[Andrew Graham-Dixon]], ''The Madness of Vermeer'', BBC Four.</ref>]]\n\nThe influence of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: the light from the left, the marble floor.<ref>Adriaan E.

Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with [[Nicolaes Maes]], who produced [[genre works]] in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. [[Balthasar de Monconys]] visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to [[Hendrick van Buyten]], a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.\n\nIn 1671, [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh]] organised the auction of [[Gerrit Reynst]]'s collection and offered 13 paintings and some sculptures to [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]].

During the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], an English fleet and two allied German bishops attacked the country from the east, causing more destruction. Many people panicked; courts, theaters, shops and schools were closed. Five years passed before circumstances improved. In 1674, Vermeer was listed as a member of the [[schutterij|civic guards]].<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/delft/delft_today/schutterij.html#.VC-ZUBY09EI \"Vermeer's Delft Today: Schutterij and the Doelen\"], Essential Vermeer.</ref> In the summer of 1675, Vermeer borrowed 1,000 guilders in Amsterdam from [[Hendrick Sorgh|Jacob Romboutsz]], an Amsterdam silk trader, using his mother-in-law's property as a [[surety]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Michael Montias|title=Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev1xavyduGYC&pg=PA337|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00289-4|page=337}}</ref><ref>[https://cmkschilderwerken.nl/vermeer-en-milieu/ \"A Postscript on Vermeer and His Milieu\"], Auteur: John Michael Montias, Uitgever: Uitgeverij Atlas Contact B.V.</ref>\n\nIn December 1675, Vermeer died after a short illness.

The collapse of the art market damaged Vermeer's business as both a painter and an art dealer.

These paintings were sold in Amsterdam the following year in a much-studied auction, published by [[Gerard Hoet]].</ref> Several factors contributed to his limited body of work. Vermeer never had any pupils, though one scholar has suggested that Vermeer taught his eldest daughter Maria to paint.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Binstock, Benjamin.|title=Vermeer's family secrets : genius, discovery, and the unknown apprentice|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|others=Vermeer, Johannes, 1632-1675.|isbn=978-0-415-96664-1|location=New York|oclc=191024081}}</ref> Additionally, his family obligations with so many children may have taken up much of his time, as would acting as both an art-dealer and inn-keeper in running the family businesses. His time spent serving as head of the guild and his extraordinary precision as a painter may have also limited his output.\n\n==Style==\nVermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (\"[[grisaille]]\") or a limited palette of browns and greys (\"dead coloring\"), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.\n\nThere is no other 17th-century artist who employed the exorbitantly expensive pigment [[lapis lazuli]] (natural [[ultramarine]]) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours [[umber]] and [[ochre]] should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed.<ref name=p867 group=Liedtke/> This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer's understanding of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo's]] observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object.<ref name=wadum95/> This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.\n\nA comparable but even more remarkable, yet effectual, use of natural ultramarine is in ''The Girl with the Wine Glass''. The shadows of the red satin dress are [[underpainting|underpainted]] in natural ultramarine,<ref>Gaskell, I., M. Jonker & National Gallery of Art (US) (1998), ''Vermeer Studies''. Washington: National Gallery of Art, p. 157. {{ISBN|0300075219}}</ref> and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and [[vermilion]] mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance that is most powerful.\n\nEven after Vermeer's supposed financial breakdown following the so-called [[rampjaar]] (year of disaster) in 1672, he continued to employ natural ultramarine generously, such as in ''Lady Seated at a Virginal''. This could suggest that Vermeer was supplied with materials by a collector, and would coincide with [[John Michael Montias]]\u2019 theory that [[Pieter van Ruijven]] was Vermeer's patron.\n\nVermeer's works are largely [[Genre works|genre pieces]] and portraits, with the exception of two cityscapes and two [[allegory|allegories]]. His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their roomy houses. Besides these subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and scientific comments can also be found in his work.\n\n===Painting materials===\nOne aspect of his meticulous painting technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments.<ref>Kuhn, H. \"A Study of the Pigments and Grounds Used by Jan Vermeer\". ''Reports and Studies in the History of Art'', 1968, 154\u2013202</ref> He is best known for his frequent use of the very expensive [[ultramarine]] (''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''), and also [[lead-tin-yellow]] (''[[A Lady Writing a Letter]]''), [[madder lake]] ([[Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Vermeer)|''Christ in the House of Martha and Mary'']]), and [[vermilion]]. He also painted with [[ochres]], [[bone black]] and [[azurite]].<ref>Illustrated pigment analyses of Vermeer's paintings: [http://colourlex.com/paintings/paintings-painter/dutch-painters/ Dutch Painters], Colourlex</ref> The claim that he utilized Indian yellow in ''[[Woman Holding a Balance]]''<ref>Kuhn, 1968, pp. 191\u2013192</ref> has been disproven by later pigment analysis.<ref>Gifford, E.M., \"Painting Light: Recent Observations on Vermeer\u2019s Technique\", in Gaskell, I. and Jonker, M., ed., ''Vermeer Studies, in Studies in the History of Art'', 55, National Gallery of Art, Washington 1998, pp. 185\u2013199</ref>\n\nIn Vermeer's oeuvre, only about 20 pigments have been detected. Of these 20 pigments, seven principal pigments which Vermeer commonly employed include lead white, yellow ochre, vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or bone black.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Janson|first1=Jonathan|title=Vermeer's Palette|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/palette/palette_vermeer'_palette.html#.WM7coBIrJE5|website=Essential Vermeer|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Camera obscura===\n\nVermeer's painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost [[photorealistic]] attention to detail, despite Vermeer's having had no formal training, and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.{{CN|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2001, British artist [[David Hockney]] published the book ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', in which he argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance and Baroque artists including [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of [[curved mirror]]s, [[camera obscura]], and [[camera lucida]]. This became known as the [[Hockney\u2013Falco thesis]], named after Hockney and [[Charles M. Falco]], another proponent of the theory.\n\nProfessor Philip Steadman published the book ''Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces'' in 2001 which specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings. Steadman noted that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same room, and he found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall.<ref name=BBC_Steadman/>\n\nSupporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer's paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer's paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halation]]. It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the \"exaggerated\" perspective seen in ''[[The Music Lesson]]'' (London, [[Royal Collection]]).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor [[Tim Jenison]] developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a \"comparator mirror\", which is similar in concept to a [[camera lucida]] but much simpler and makes it easy to match color values. He later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror. He spent the next five years testing his theory by attempting to re-create ''The Music Lesson'' himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film ''[[Tim's Vermeer]]''.<ref name=Vanity/>\n\nSeveral points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique: first was Vermeer's hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall. Neurobiologist [[Colin Blakemore]], in an interview with Jenison, notes that human vision cannot process information about the absolute brightness of a scene.<ref name=Tims/> Another was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of [[chromatic aberration]], particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the harpsichord. This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror.\n\nThis theory remains disputed. There is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics, aside from the accurately observed mirror reflection above the lady at the virginals in ''[[The Music Lesson]]''. The detailed inventory of the artist's belongings drawn up after his death does not include a camera obscura or any similar device.<ref name=Obscura/> However, Vermeer was in close connection with pioneer lens maker [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and Leeuwenhoek was his executor after death.<ref name=bryson/>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of paintings by Johannes Vermeer|Category:Johannes Vermeer }}\nVermeer produced a total of fewer than 50 paintings, of which 34 have survived.<ref name=\"veconomist\">{{cite news|title=Vermeer was brilliant, but he was not without influences|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21730134-blockbuster-show-punctures-myth-solitary-genius-vermeer-was-brilliant-he|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> Only three Vermeer paintings were dated by the artist: ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656; Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden); ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'' (1668; Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris); and ''[[The Geographer]]'' (1669; St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt).\n\nVermeer's mother-in-law Maria Thins owned [[Dirck van Baburen]]'s 1622 oil-on-canvas ''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' (or a copy of it), which appears in the background of two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]'', Dresden, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie). Vermeer's two [[townscape]]s have also been attributed to this period: ''[[View of Delft]]'' (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and ''[[The Little Street (Vermeer)|''A street in Delft'']]'' (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).\n\nA few of his paintings show a certain hardening of manner and are generally thought to represent his late works. From this period come ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'' (c. 1670; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and ''[[The Love Letter (Vermeer)|The Love Letter]]'' (c. 1670; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Th\u00e9ophile_Thor\u00e9_by_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger]]]]\nOriginally, Vermeer's works were largely overlooked by art historians for two centuries after his death.

Until the 19th century, the only sources of information were some registers, a few official documents, and comments by other artists; for this reason, Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger named him \"The Sphinx of Delft\".<ref name=Delft /> [[John Michael Montias]] added details on the family from the city archives of Delft in his ''Artists and Artisans in Delft: A Socio-Economic Study of the Seventeenth Century'' (1982).\n\n===Youth and heritage===\n\nJohannes Vermeer was [[Baptism|baptized]] within the [[Calvinism|Reformed Church]] on 31 October 1632.<ref name=Name/><ref name=Tree/><ref group=Note>In the 17th century, Johannes was a popular name, and spelling was not consistent. The name could be spelled in the Dutch (Johan or Johannes), French (Joan), Italian (Giovanni), Greek (Johannis), or other style depending on background, education, or family tradition.</ref> His father, named Reijnier Janszoon, was a middle-class worker of [[silk]] or caffa (a mixture of silk and cotton or wool).<ref group=\"Note\">His name was Reijnier or Reynier Janszoon, always written in Dutch as Jansz. or Jansz; this was his [[patronym]]. As there was another Reijnier Jansz at that time in Delft, it seemed necessary to use the [[pseudonym]] \"Vos\", meaning Fox. From 1640 onward, he had changed his alias to Vermeer.</ref> As an apprentice in Amsterdam, Reijnier lived on fashionable [[Sint Antoniesbreestraat]], a street with many resident painters at the time. In 1615, Reijnier married Digna Baltus.<!--and to facilitate their marriage, he brought a testimonial from Delft.<ref>[http://www.xs4all.nl/~kalden/dart/d-a-vermeer1.htm Vermeer's father Reynier Jansz (c. 1591 \u2013 1652)] His parents were tailor Jan Reyersz and Cornelia, alias Neeltge Goris</ref>--> The couple moved to Delft and had a daughter named Gertruy who was baptized in 1620.<ref group=Note>In 1647 Geertruy, Vermeer's only sister, married a frame maker.

In 1631, he leased an inn, which he called \"The Flying Fox\". In 1635, he lived on Voldersgracht 25 or 26. In 1641, he bought a larger inn on the market square, named after the Flemish town \"[[Mechelen]]\". The acquisition of the inn constituted a considerable financial burden.<ref name=p42 group=Huerta/> When Reijnier died in October 1652, Vermeer took over the operation of the family's art business.\n\n===Marriage and family===\n\nIn April 1653, Johannes Reijniersz Vermeer married a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] woman, Catharina Bolenes (Bolnes). The blessing took place in the quiet nearby village of [[Schipluiden]]. Vermeer's new mother-in-law [[Maria Thins]] was significantly wealthier than he, and it was probably she who insisted that Vermeer convert to Catholicism before the marriage on 5 April.<ref group=\"Note\">Catholicism was not a forbidden religion, but tolerated in the [[Dutch Republic]]. They were not allowed to build new churches, so services were held in hidden churches (so-called [[Schuilkerk]]). Catholics were restrained in their careers, unable to get high-rank  jobs in city administration or civic guard. It was impossible to be elected as a member of the city council; therefore, the Catholics were not represented in the provincial and national assembly.</ref> According to art historian [[Walter Liedtke]], Vermeer's conversion seems to have been made with conviction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Liedtke|first1=Walter|last2=Plomp|first2=Michiel C.|last3=R\u00fcger|first3=Axel|authorlink1=Walter Liedtke|title=Vermeer and the Delft school: [catalogue ... in conjunction with the exhibition \"Vermeer and the Delft School\" held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, from 8 March to 27 May 2001, and at The National Gallery, London, from 20 June to 16 September 2001]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0870999737|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC/page/n373 359]}}</ref> His painting ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/32.100.18 |title=Johannes Vermeer: Allegory of the Catholic Faith (32.100.18) &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> made between 1670 and 1672, placed less emphasis on the artists' usual naturalistic concerns and more on symbolic religious applications, including the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]].

One child died after this document was written.</ref>\n\n===Career===\n[[File:2010-05-15-delft-by-RalfR-13.jpg|thumb|Replica of the St. Luke Guildhouse on Voldersgracht in Delft]]\nIt is unclear where and with whom Vermeer apprenticed as a painter. There is some speculation that [[Carel Fabritius]] may have been his teacher, based upon a controversial interpretation of a text written in 1668 by printer Arnold Bon. Art historians have found no hard evidence to support this.<ref name=p104 group=Montias/> Local authority [[Leonaert Bramer]] acted as a friend, but their style of painting is rather different.<ref name=Gallery/> Liedtke suggests that Vermeer taught himself, using information from one of his father's connections.<ref name=p866 group=Liedtke/> Some scholars think that Vermeer was trained under Catholic painter [[Abraham Bloemaert]]. Vermeer's style is similar to that of some of the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]], whose works are depicted as paintings-within-paintings in the backgrounds of several of his compositions.<ref group=\"Note\">Identifiable works include compositions by Utrecht painters [[Dirck van Baburen|Baburen]] and [[Caesar van Everdingen|Everdingen]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Delftsedonderslag.jpg|thumb|left|''A View of Delft after the Explosion of 1654'', by [[Egbert van der Poel]]]]\nOn 29 December 1653, Vermeer became a member of the [[Guild of Saint Luke#Dutch Republic|Guild of Saint Luke]], a trade association for painters. The guild's records make clear that Vermeer did not pay the usual admission fee. It was a year of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], [[First Anglo-Dutch War|war]], and economic crisis; Vermeer was not alone in experiencing difficult financial circumstances. In 1654, the city suffered the terrible explosion known as the [[Delft Explosion|Delft Thunderclap]], which destroyed a large section of the city.<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/maps/delft/delft_in_vermeer's_time.html \"Delft in Johannes Vermeer's Time\"], Essential Vermeer. Retrieved 29 September 2009</ref> In 1657, he might have found a patron in local art collector [[Pieter van Ruijven]], who lent him some money. It seems that Vermeer turned for inspiration to the art of the [[fijnschilder]]s from Leiden. Vermeer was responding to the market of [[Gerard Dou]]'s paintings, who sold his paintings for exorbitant prices. Dou may have influenced [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Gabriel Metsu]], too. Vermeer also charged higher than average prices for his work, most of which were purchased by an unknown collector.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The age of Rembrandt and Vermeer: Dutch painting in the seventeenth century|last=Nash|first=J.M.|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1972|isbn=9780030918704|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40 40]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vermeer-view-of-delft.jpg|thumb|''[[View of Delft]]'' (1660\u201361): \"He took a turbulent reality, and made it look like Heaven on earth.\"<ref>[[Andrew Graham-Dixon]], ''The Madness of Vermeer'', BBC Four.</ref>]]\n\nThe influence of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: the light from the left, the marble floor.<ref>Adriaan E.

Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with [[Nicolaes Maes]], who produced [[genre works]] in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. [[Balthasar de Monconys]] visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to [[Hendrick van Buyten]], a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.\n\nIn 1671, [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh]] organised the auction of [[Gerrit Reynst]]'s collection and offered 13 paintings and some sculptures to [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]].

During the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], an English fleet and two allied German bishops attacked the country from the east, causing more destruction. Many people panicked; courts, theaters, shops and schools were closed. Five years passed before circumstances improved. In 1674, Vermeer was listed as a member of the [[schutterij|civic guards]].<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/delft/delft_today/schutterij.html#.VC-ZUBY09EI \"Vermeer's Delft Today: Schutterij and the Doelen\"], Essential Vermeer.</ref> In the summer of 1675, Vermeer borrowed 1,000 guilders in Amsterdam from [[Hendrick Sorgh|Jacob Romboutsz]], an Amsterdam silk trader, using his mother-in-law's property as a [[surety]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Michael Montias|title=Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev1xavyduGYC&pg=PA337|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00289-4|page=337}}</ref><ref>[https://cmkschilderwerken.nl/vermeer-en-milieu/ \"A Postscript on Vermeer and His Milieu\"], Auteur: John Michael Montias, Uitgever: Uitgeverij Atlas Contact B.V.</ref>\n\nIn December 1675, Vermeer died after a short illness.

The collapse of the art market damaged Vermeer's business as both a painter and an art dealer.

These paintings were sold in Amsterdam the following year in a much-studied auction, published by [[Gerard Hoet]].</ref> Several factors contributed to his limited body of work. Vermeer never had any pupils, though one scholar has suggested that Vermeer taught his eldest daughter Maria to paint.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Binstock, Benjamin.|title=Vermeer's family secrets : genius, discovery, and the unknown apprentice|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|others=Vermeer, Johannes, 1632-1675.|isbn=978-0-415-96664-1|location=New York|oclc=191024081}}</ref> Additionally, his family obligations with so many children may have taken up much of his time, as would acting as both an art-dealer and inn-keeper in running the family businesses. His time spent serving as head of the guild and his extraordinary precision as a painter may have also limited his output.\n\n==Style==\nVermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (\"[[grisaille]]\") or a limited palette of browns and greys (\"dead coloring\"), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.\n\nThere is no other 17th-century artist who employed the exorbitantly expensive pigment [[lapis lazuli]] (natural [[ultramarine]]) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours [[umber]] and [[ochre]] should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed.<ref name=p867 group=Liedtke/> This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer's understanding of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo's]] observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object.<ref name=wadum95/> This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.\n\nA comparable but even more remarkable, yet effectual, use of natural ultramarine is in ''The Girl with the Wine Glass''. The shadows of the red satin dress are [[underpainting|underpainted]] in natural ultramarine,<ref>Gaskell, I., M. Jonker & National Gallery of Art (US) (1998), ''Vermeer Studies''. Washington: National Gallery of Art, p. 157. {{ISBN|0300075219}}</ref> and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and [[vermilion]] mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance that is most powerful.\n\nEven after Vermeer's supposed financial breakdown following the so-called [[rampjaar]] (year of disaster) in 1672, he continued to employ natural ultramarine generously, such as in ''Lady Seated at a Virginal''. This could suggest that Vermeer was supplied with materials by a collector, and would coincide with [[John Michael Montias]]\u2019 theory that [[Pieter van Ruijven]] was Vermeer's patron.\n\nVermeer's works are largely [[Genre works|genre pieces]] and portraits, with the exception of two cityscapes and two [[allegory|allegories]]. His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their roomy houses. Besides these subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and scientific comments can also be found in his work.\n\n===Painting materials===\nOne aspect of his meticulous painting technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments.<ref>Kuhn, H. \"A Study of the Pigments and Grounds Used by Jan Vermeer\". ''Reports and Studies in the History of Art'', 1968, 154\u2013202</ref> He is best known for his frequent use of the very expensive [[ultramarine]] (''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''), and also [[lead-tin-yellow]] (''[[A Lady Writing a Letter]]''), [[madder lake]] ([[Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Vermeer)|''Christ in the House of Martha and Mary'']]), and [[vermilion]]. He also painted with [[ochres]], [[bone black]] and [[azurite]].<ref>Illustrated pigment analyses of Vermeer's paintings: [http://colourlex.com/paintings/paintings-painter/dutch-painters/ Dutch Painters], Colourlex</ref> The claim that he utilized Indian yellow in ''[[Woman Holding a Balance]]''<ref>Kuhn, 1968, pp. 191\u2013192</ref> has been disproven by later pigment analysis.<ref>Gifford, E.M., \"Painting Light: Recent Observations on Vermeer\u2019s Technique\", in Gaskell, I. and Jonker, M., ed., ''Vermeer Studies, in Studies in the History of Art'', 55, National Gallery of Art, Washington 1998, pp. 185\u2013199</ref>\n\nIn Vermeer's oeuvre, only about 20 pigments have been detected. Of these 20 pigments, seven principal pigments which Vermeer commonly employed include lead white, yellow ochre, vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or bone black.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Janson|first1=Jonathan|title=Vermeer's Palette|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/palette/palette_vermeer'_palette.html#.WM7coBIrJE5|website=Essential Vermeer|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Camera obscura===\n\nVermeer's painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost [[photorealistic]] attention to detail, despite Vermeer's having had no formal training, and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.{{CN|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2001, British artist [[David Hockney]] published the book ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', in which he argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance and Baroque artists including [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of [[curved mirror]]s, [[camera obscura]], and [[camera lucida]]. This became known as the [[Hockney\u2013Falco thesis]], named after Hockney and [[Charles M. Falco]], another proponent of the theory.\n\nProfessor Philip Steadman published the book ''Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces'' in 2001 which specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings. Steadman noted that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same room, and he found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall.<ref name=BBC_Steadman/>\n\nSupporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer's paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer's paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halation]]. It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the \"exaggerated\" perspective seen in ''[[The Music Lesson]]'' (London, [[Royal Collection]]).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor [[Tim Jenison]] developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a \"comparator mirror\", which is similar in concept to a [[camera lucida]] but much simpler and makes it easy to match color values. He later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror. He spent the next five years testing his theory by attempting to re-create ''The Music Lesson'' himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film ''[[Tim's Vermeer]]''.<ref name=Vanity/>\n\nSeveral points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique: first was Vermeer's hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall. Neurobiologist [[Colin Blakemore]], in an interview with Jenison, notes that human vision cannot process information about the absolute brightness of a scene.<ref name=Tims/> Another was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of [[chromatic aberration]], particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the harpsichord. This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror.\n\nThis theory remains disputed. There is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics, aside from the accurately observed mirror reflection above the lady at the virginals in ''[[The Music Lesson]]''. The detailed inventory of the artist's belongings drawn up after his death does not include a camera obscura or any similar device.<ref name=Obscura/> However, Vermeer was in close connection with pioneer lens maker [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and Leeuwenhoek was his executor after death.<ref name=bryson/>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of paintings by Johannes Vermeer|Category:Johannes Vermeer }}\nVermeer produced a total of fewer than 50 paintings, of which 34 have survived.<ref name=\"veconomist\">{{cite news|title=Vermeer was brilliant, but he was not without influences|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21730134-blockbuster-show-punctures-myth-solitary-genius-vermeer-was-brilliant-he|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> Only three Vermeer paintings were dated by the artist: ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656; Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden); ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'' (1668; Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris); and ''[[The Geographer]]'' (1669; St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt).\n\nVermeer's mother-in-law Maria Thins owned [[Dirck van Baburen]]'s 1622 oil-on-canvas ''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' (or a copy of it), which appears in the background of two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]'', Dresden, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie). Vermeer's two [[townscape]]s have also been attributed to this period: ''[[View of Delft]]'' (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and ''[[The Little Street (Vermeer)|''A street in Delft'']]'' (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).\n\nA few of his paintings show a certain hardening of manner and are generally thought to represent his late works. From this period come ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'' (c. 1670; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and ''[[The Love Letter (Vermeer)|The Love Letter]]'' (c. 1670; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Th\u00e9ophile_Thor\u00e9_by_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger]]]]\nOriginally, Vermeer's works were largely overlooked by art historians for two centuries after his death.
