Most games have been played at [[Sheikh Zayed Stadium]] in [[Abu Dhabi]] with [[Abu Dhabi]]'s [[Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium|Al Jazira Stadium]] and [[Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium]] in [[Al Ain]] as other venues.  \n\nIt has made one [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] appearance, in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] in [[Italy]], but lost all three of its games to [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. Two years later, the United Arab Emirates took fourth place in the [[1992 AFC Asian Cup|1992 Asian Cup]], and runner-up in [[1996 AFC Asian Cup|1996]] as hosts of the tournament. In both tournaments, their final match was lost on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty kicks]]. They also won the [[Arabian Gulf Cup]] on two occasions; in [[18th Arabian Gulf Cup|2007]] when they won the title for the first time in their history, and the second time was in [[21st Arabian Gulf Cup|2013]]. They finished third in the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] and hosted [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 edition]] which they were eliminated in the semi-finals.\n\n==History==\nThe first match of the national football team was played on 17 March 1972, four months after the union of the United Arab Emirates, against [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] at [[Riyadh]]'s [[Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium]] and won with the only goal scored by Ahmed Chowbi. Then, the team faced three other Arabian countries, losing 4\u20130 and 7\u20130 to [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]] respectively and beating [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]] 3 to nothing.\n\nAfter participating in four [[Arabian Gulf Cup|Gulf Cup]] tournaments since 1972, the United Arab Emirates hosted the [[6th Arabian Gulf Cup|1982 edition]]. They again finished third, as did in the two previous tournaments.\n\n===First Asian Cup appearances===\nIn [[1980 AFC Asian Cup|1980]], the United Arab Emirates first-time qualified for the [[AFC Asian Cup]], which was held in [[Kuwait]]. They were drawn with eventual winners, [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]], runner-up [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysia]] and [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] in Group B. They drew 1\u20131 with Kuwait but lost the three other matches and finished in fifth place in the group and ninth (out of ten teams) overall.\n\nThey also qualified for next two tournaments, [[1984 AFC Asian Cup|1984]] in [[Singapore]] and [[1988 AFC Asian Cup|1988]] in [[Qatar]] and were again eliminated in the group stages in both. Their first victory of the tournament occurred against [[India national football team|India]] on 7 December 1984 under manager [[Heshmat Mohajerani]].\n\n===1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy===\nIn 1984, Mohajerani resigned as UAE head coach and was replaced with former [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] manager [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]]. Parreira led the country at the [[1988 AFC Asian Cup]] and left his position after the tournament. He was succeeded by Brazilian [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] winning coach [[M\u00e1rio Zagallo]]. Zagallo led the country to the qualification for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Italy]]. However, Zagallo resigned before the tournament and Parreira returned as head coach to lead the United Arab Emirates at the tournament.\n{{main|1990 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n!width=165|Qualifying\n!width=25|{{Abbr| Pld | Played}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| W | Wins}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| D | Drawn}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| L | Lost}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| GF | Goals for}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| GA | Goals against}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| GD | Goal difference}}\n!width=25|{{Tooltip | Pts | Points}}\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|KOR}}\n|5||3||2||0||5||1||+4||8\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|UAE}}\n|'''5'''||'''1'''||'''4'''||'''0'''||'''4'''||'''3'''||'''+1'''||'''6'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|QAT}}\n|5||1||3||1||4||5||\u22121||5\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|CHN}}\n|5||2||0||3||5||6||\u22121||4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|KSA}}\n|5||1||2||2||4||5||\u22121||4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|PRK}}\n|5||1||1||3||2||4||\u22122||3\n|}\n\nThey were drawn at Group D along with eventual winner [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. They lost 2\u20130 to Colombia, 5\u20131 to West Germany and 4\u20131 to Yugoslavia. They finished fourth with no points, scoring two goals and conceding eleven goals. UAE's first goal at the tournament was scored by [[Khalid Isma\u00efl]] against West Germany. The tournament was later put into a 2016 documentary titled 'Lights of Rome'.<ref name=Doc90>{{cite web|url=https://gulfnews.com/sport/uae-sport/uaes-1990-world-cup-journey-now-a-documentary-1.1937574|title=UAE\u2019s 1990 World Cup journey now a documentary|publisher=Gulf News|date=30 November 2016|accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref> After the tournament, Parreira was sacked. Two years later, at the [[1992 AFC Asian Cup]], the United Arab Emirates finished in fourth place, their best finish up to that date.\n\n{{Main|1990 FIFA World Cup Group D}}\n{{1990 FIFA World Cup group tables|Group D}}\n\n===1996 AFC Asian Cup===\nThe United Arab Emirates hosted the [[1996 AFC Asian Cup]]. They hired Croatian coach [[Tomislav Ivi\u0107]] one year before the tournament and were drawn in Group A along with [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]], [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]]. They drew with South Korea then defeated Kuwait and Indonesia to advance as group winners. In the quarter-finals, they beat [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]] 1\u20130 with a [[golden goal]] scored by [[Abdulrahman Ibrahim]] in the 103rd minute in [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]]. They again faced Kuwait, this time at the semi-finals and won 1\u20130 to qualify to the final for the first time. After a goalless draw, they lost to [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] 2\u20134 in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] and finished the tournament as runner-up, which is still their best in the [[AFC Asian Cup]].\n\nThe United Arab Emirates also appeared in the [[1997 FIFA Confederations Cup]] after being awarded a spot because Asian winners Saudi Arabia was hosting the games. They lost the first match 2\u20130 to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. Then, they defeated [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] 1\u20130. In their final match, they were defeated 6\u20131 by [[Czech Republic]] and missed their chance to qualify for the next round finishing third in their group.\n\n[[File:Fahad Khamees 2011.JPG|thumb|[[Fahad Khamees]] captained UAE in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]]]\n\n===2000\u20132011 (dark years)===\nThe United Arab Emirates missed the [[2000 AFC Asian Cup qualification#Group 3|qualification]] for the [[2000 AFC Asian Cup]] in [[Lebanon]]. They also finished in last place at the [[15th Arabian Gulf Cup|2002 Gulf Cup]] in [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nThey were eliminated in the next three [[AFC Asian Cup]] tournaments at the group stage. Their worst performance was in [[2011 AFC Asian Cup|2011]] when they finished the tournament goalless. At this time, many notable coaches managed the Emirates, including [[Carlos Queiroz]], [[Roy Hodgson]] and [[Dick Advocaat]]. In 2006, the UAE appointed [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]]'s [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] head coach, [[Bruno Metsu]] as their new manager. He led the Emirates to the [[18th Arabian Gulf Cup|2007 Gulf Cup]] title, the country's first major achievement.\n\n===2012\u20132015 (return to success)===\nAfter hiring many European coaches, in 2012, United Arab Emirates appointed the [[United Arab Emirates national under-23 football team|Olympic team]] coach [[Mahdi Ali]] as the new manager of the national team. Ali began creating a young squad for the United Arab Emirates, inviting many players that he had worked with at youth level. He led the Emirates to their second [[Arabian Gulf Cup|Gulf Cup]] title in [[21st Arabian Gulf Cup|2013]].\n\nUnited Arab Emirates's form at the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] was a surprise to some. Drawn in Group C, they defeated Qatar 4\u20131 and Bahrain 2\u20131 and lost to Iran only by a controversial goal that appeared to be offside. As group runner-up, they faced the defending champions [[Japan national football team|Japan]] in the quarter-final and earned a victory on penalties to advance to the last four. They lost 2\u20130 to the host [[Australia national football team|Australia]] in the semi-finals. In the third place play-off, they beat [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]] 3\u20132.\n\n===2018 FIFA World Cup Qualification===\nThe United Arab Emirates qualified for the Second Round of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC qualification]], where they finished second in [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC Second Round#Group A|Group A]] behind [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and qualified for the Third Round.

Most games have been played at [[Sheikh Zayed Stadium]] in [[Abu Dhabi]] with [[Abu Dhabi]]'s [[Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium|Al Jazira Stadium]] and [[Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium]] in [[Al Ain]] as other venues.  \n\nIt has made one [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] appearance, in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] in [[Italy]], but lost all three of its games to [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. Two years later, the United Arab Emirates took fourth place in the [[1992 AFC Asian Cup|1992 Asian Cup]], and runner-up in [[1996 AFC Asian Cup|1996]] as hosts of the tournament. In both tournaments, their final match was lost on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty kicks]]. They also won the [[Arabian Gulf Cup]] on two occasions; in [[18th Arabian Gulf Cup|2007]] when they won the title for the first time in their history, and the second time was in [[21st Arabian Gulf Cup|2013]]. They finished third in the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] and hosted [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 edition]] which they were eliminated in the semi-finals.\n\n==History==\nThe first match of the national football team was played on 17 March 1972, four months after the union of the United Arab Emirates, against [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] at [[Riyadh]]'s [[Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium]] and won with the only goal scored by Ahmed Chowbi. Then, the team faced three other Arabian countries, losing 4\u20130 and 7\u20130 to [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]] respectively and beating [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]] 3 to nothing.\n\nAfter participating in four [[Arabian Gulf Cup|Gulf Cup]] tournaments since 1972, the United Arab Emirates hosted the [[6th Arabian Gulf Cup|1982 edition]]. They again finished third, as did in the two previous tournaments.\n\n===First Asian Cup appearances===\nIn [[1980 AFC Asian Cup|1980]], the United Arab Emirates first-time qualified for the [[AFC Asian Cup]], which was held in [[Kuwait]]. They were drawn with eventual winners, [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]], runner-up [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysia]] and [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] in Group B. They drew 1\u20131 with Kuwait but lost the three other matches and finished in fifth place in the group and ninth (out of ten teams) overall.\n\nThey also qualified for next two tournaments, [[1984 AFC Asian Cup|1984]] in [[Singapore]] and [[1988 AFC Asian Cup|1988]] in [[Qatar]] and were again eliminated in the group stages in both. Their first victory of the tournament occurred against [[India national football team|India]] on 7 December 1984 under manager [[Heshmat Mohajerani]].\n\n===1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy===\nIn 1984, Mohajerani resigned as UAE head coach and was replaced with former [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] manager [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]].

Stalin launched what would later be referred to as a \"revolution from above\" to improve the Soviet Union's domestic policy. The policies were centered around [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialization]] and the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization of agriculture]]. Stalin desired to remove and replace any policies created under the [[New Economic Policy]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kotkin |first1=Stephen |title=Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941 |date=2017 |publisher=Penguin Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1594203800 |chapter=Chapter 1: Triumph of the Will}}</ref>{{efn|The text of the report ''\"The Results of the First Five-Year Plan\"'' by J.

While the vision was grand, its planning was ineffective and unrealistic given the short amount of time given to meet the desired goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/coll.html|title=Collectivization and Industrialization|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holland |first1=Hunter |title=The Overambitious First Soviet Five-Year Plan |journal=Slavic Review |date=1973 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=237\u2013257 |doi=10.2307/2495959 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2495959 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929, Stalin edited the plan to include the creation of \"[[kolkhoz]]\" [[collective farming]] systems that stretched over thousands of acres of land and had hundreds of thousands of peasants working on them. The creation of collective farms essentially destroyed the [[kulak]]s as a class ([[dekulakization]]). Another consequence of this is that peasants resisted by killing their farm animals rather than turning them over to the State when their farms were collectivized.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1929-2/|title=1929|date=2015-06-17|work=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}</ref> The resistance to Stalin's collectivization policies led to the intentional genocidal [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan]] as well as areas of the [[Northern Caucasus]]. Public [[machine and tractor station]]s were set up throughout the USSR, and peasants were allowed to use these public tractors to farm the land, increasing the food output per peasant. Peasants were allowed to sell any surplus food from the land. However, the government planners failed to take notice of local situations. In 1932, grain production was 32% below average;<ref name='conquest'>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 1971</ref> to add to this problem, procurement of food increased by 44%. Agricultural production was so disrupted that famine broke out in several districts.<ref>[[R. W. Davies]], ''Soviet History in the Gorbachev Revolution'' (Macmillan, London, 1989)</ref>\n\nBecause of the plan's reliance on rapid industrialization, major cultural changes had to occur in tandem.  As this new social structure arose, conflicts occurred among some of the majority of the populations.

The fear of invasion from the West left the Soviets feeling a need for rapid [[industrialization]] to increase Soviet war-making potential, and to compete with the Western powers. At the same time as the War Scare of 1927, dissatisfaction grew among the peasantry of the Soviet Union. This dissatisfaction arose from the [[Soviet famine of 1921|famine of the early 1920s]], as well as from increasing mistreatment of the [[Russian peasants|peasants]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Hugh|date=2012|title=The 1927 Soviet War Scare: The Foreign Affairs-Domestic Policy Nexus Revisited|journal=The Soviet and Post-Soviet Review|volume=39|issue=2|page=1|doi=10.1163/18763324-03902002}}</ref>{{qn|date=June 2017}} Also during this time the secret police (the [[Joint State Political Directorate|OGPU]]) had begun rounding up political dissenters in the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Russian Revolution|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Sheila|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|location=Oxford|page=121}}</ref>{{qn|date=June 2017}} All these tensions had the potential to destroy the young Soviet Union and forced [[Joseph Stalin]] to introduce rapid industrialization of heavy industry so that the Soviet Union could address external and internal threats if needed.\n\n==Rapid growth of heavy industry==\n\nThe central aspect of the first Soviet five-year plan was the rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union from October 1928 to December 1932, which was thought to be the most crucial time for Russian industrialization.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Economic Transformation of The Soviet Union, 1913-1945|last=Davies|first=Robert|year=1994|isbn=978-0521451529|location=|pages=}}</ref> [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] himself before the time of his death, knew the importance of building a transitional state to communism and was quoted saying \"Modern industry is the key to this transformation, the time has come to construct our fatherland anew with the hands of machines.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Sheila|year=1999|isbn=978-0195050004|location=|pages=}}</ref> Rapid Growth was facilitated starting in 1928 and continued to accelerate because of the building of heavy industry, which in turn raised living standards for peasants escaping the countryside.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Farm to Factor: A Reinterpretation of the Soviet Industrial Revolution|last=Allen|first=Robert|year=1947|isbn=978-0691006963|location=|pages=}}</ref> The [[Bolsheviks]]' need for rapid industrialization was once again out of the fear of impending war from the West. If war were to break out between the Soviet Union and the West, the Soviets would be fighting against some of the most industrialized nations in the world. The rapid industrialization would inhibit fears of being left unprotected if War between the Soviets and the West were to occur. To meet the needs of a possible war, the Soviet leaders set unrealistic quotas for production.<ref name=\"Library of Congress\">{{cite web|title=Collectivization And Industrialization|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/coll.html|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>   To meet those unrealistic needs, the facilities had to be constructed quickly to facilitate material production before goods could be produced. During this period 1928\u20131932, massive industrial centers emerged in areas that were highly isolated before. These factories were not only for war production, but to produce tractors to meet the needs of mechanized agriculture. The [[Volgograd Tractor Plant|Stalingrad Tractor Plant]] was built with the help of western allies and was meant to play a major factor in the rapid industrialization of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. These isolated areas included [[Magnitogorsk]], [[Dnieper]], and [[Nizhny Novgorod]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Shelia|title=The Russian Revolution|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=133}}</ref>  Magnitogorsk, the largest of the rapid industrialized areas of Russia, was founded in 1743, but became more prevalent in the early 1930s by Stalin. His plan was to make it a one-industry town. The city would become the largest steel producer in Russia and was meant to rival production that was being seen in the U.S. at the same time. During this era of Soviet history, heavy industry was supposed to experience a 350% increase in output.<ref name=\"Library of Congress\"/>  The Soviet Union's achievements were tremendous during the first five-year plan, which yielded a fifty-percent increase in industrial output.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keefe|first=Joshua|date=2009|title=Stalin and the Drive to Industrialize the Soviet Union|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1684/stalin-and-the-drive-to-industrialize-the-soviet-union|journal=Inquires|volume=1| issue = 10|pages=1|via=}}</ref> To achieve this massive economic growth, the Soviet Union had to reroute essential resources to meet the needs of heavy industry. 80% of the total investment of the first five-year plan, was focused heavily on the industrial sector. Programs not necessary to heavy industry were cut from the Soviet budget; and because of the redistribution of industrial funding, basic goods, such as food, became scarce.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=Stephen|title=Time and Revolution: Marxism and the Design of Soviet Institutions|date=1997|publisher=University Of North Carolina Press|page=95|title-link=Marxism}}</ref>  The fact that the [[Great Depression]] was driving down the price of grain and other raw materials, which is most likely a result of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Collectivization]].

One reason for the collectivization of Soviet agriculture was to increase the number of industrial workers for the new factories.<ref name=\"Library of Congress\"/>  Soviet officials also believed that collectivization would increase crop yields and help fund other programs.<ref name=\"Library of Congress\"/>  The Soviets enacted a land decree in 1917 that eliminated private ownership of land.  Vladimir Lenin tried to establish removal of grain from wealthier peasants after the initial failure of state farms but this was also unsuccessful.  Peasants were mainly concerned for their own well being and felt that the state had nothing of necessity to offer for the grain.  This stockpiling of grain by the peasantry left millions of people in the city hungry, leading Lenin to establish his New Economic Policy to keep the economy from crashing.

The creation of collective farms essentially destroyed the [[kulak]]s as a class ([[dekulakization]]). Another consequence of this is that peasants resisted by killing their farm animals rather than turning them over to the State when their farms were collectivized.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1929-2/|title=1929|date=2015-06-17|work=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}</ref> The resistance to Stalin's collectivization policies led to the intentional genocidal [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan]] as well as areas of the [[Northern Caucasus]]. Public [[machine and tractor station]]s were set up throughout the USSR, and peasants were allowed to use these public tractors to farm the land, increasing the food output per peasant. Peasants were allowed to sell any surplus food from the land. However, the government planners failed to take notice of local situations. In 1932, grain production was 32% below average;<ref name='conquest'>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 1971</ref> to add to this problem, procurement of food increased by 44%.

During this period 1928\u20131932, massive industrial centers emerged in areas that were highly isolated before. These factories were not only for war production, but to produce tractors to meet the needs of mechanized agriculture. The [[Volgograd Tractor Plant|Stalingrad Tractor Plant]] was built with the help of western allies and was meant to play a major factor in the rapid industrialization of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

One reason for the collectivization of Soviet agriculture was to increase the number of industrial workers for the new factories.<ref name=\"Library of Congress\"/>  Soviet officials also believed that collectivization would increase crop yields and help fund other programs.<ref name=\"Library of Congress\"/>  The Soviets enacted a land decree in 1917 that eliminated private ownership of land.  Vladimir Lenin tried to establish removal of grain from wealthier peasants after the initial failure of state farms but this was also unsuccessful.  Peasants were mainly concerned for their own well being and felt that the state had nothing of necessity to offer for the grain.  This stockpiling of grain by the peasantry left millions of people in the city hungry, leading Lenin to establish his New Economic Policy to keep the economy from crashing.  NEP was based more on capitalism and not socialism, which is the direction the government wanted to head toward.  By 1928, with the rapid [[industrialization]], and mass urbanization that followed, consumption was to increase rapidly as well.  Need for urban dwellers to be fed, the FYP increased collectivization, leading to its recognition be largely associated with [[Stalin]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2938412|jstor=2938412|title=On the Human Costs of Collectivization in the Soviet Union|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=19|issue=4|pages=743\u2013766|year=1993|last1=Livi-Bacci|first1=Massimo}}</ref>  Beginning in 1929 under the FYP, mass collectivization was communal farms being assigned an amount of agricultural output with government coercion.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2494513|jstor=2494513|title=Mass Collectivization and the Contribution of Soviet Agriculture to the First Five-Year Plan: A Review Article|journal=Slavic Review|volume=33|issue=4|pages=750\u2013766|year=1974|last1=Millar|first1=James R.}}</ref>  Villages had to agree to collectivization: some collectivization planners would hold endless meetings that would not end until villages joined; another tactic was through intimidation and coercion.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/187633110X494670|title=The Question of Social Support for Collectivization|journal=Russian History|volume=37|issue=2|pages=153\u2013177|year=2010|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Sheila}}</ref>  Mass agricultural collectivization was largely supported by the middle and poor peasantry <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/187633110X494670|title=The Question of Social Support for Collectivization|journal=Russian History|volume=37|issue=2|pages=153\u2013177|year=2010|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Sheila}}</ref> As the peasant class itself was divided into three groups: kulaks, wealthy; serednyak, middle; bednyak, poor.

With the serednyak and bednyak joining collectivization they were also joining a kohloz. The kulaks did not support mass collectivization, as their land was being taken from them as well as their animals.
