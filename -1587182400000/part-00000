It is home to three universities, [[Missouri State University]], [[Drury University]], and [[Evangel University]].\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the city's name is unclear, but the most common view is that it was named for [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]] by migrants from that area. One account holds that James Wilson, who lived in the then unnamed city, offered free [[whiskey]] to anyone who would vote for the name Springfield, after his hometown in Massachusetts.<ref>Dark, Phyllis & Harris. ''Springfield of the Ozarks: An Illustrated History.'' Windsor Publications, 1981. {{ISBN|0-89781-028-7}}.</ref>\n\nThe editor of the ''Springfield Express,'' J. G. Newbill, said in the November 11, 1881 issue:<blockquote>\"It has been stated that this city ''got'' its name from the fact of a spring and field being near by just west of town. But such is not a correct version. When the authorized persons met and adopted the title of the \"Future Great\" of the Southwest, several of the earliest settlers had handed in their favorite names, among whom was Kindred Rose, who presented the winning name, \"Springfield,\" in honor of his former home town, [[Springfield, Tennessee|Springfield]], [[Tennessee]].\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/lochist/history/holcombe/grch29pt1.html |title=History of Greene County, Missouri |website=Thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-28}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1883, historian R. I. Holcombe wrote: \n<blockquote>\"The town took its name from the circumstance of there being a ''spring'' under the hill, on the creek, while on top of the hill, where the principal portion of the town lay, there was a ''field''.\"<ref name=\":0\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Early settlement ===\nThe presence of the Native Americans in the area slowed the European-American settlement of the land.<ref name=\":1\" /> Long before the 1830s, the native [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] and [[Osage Nation|Osage]], and the [[Lenape]] (Delaware) from the mid-Atlantic coast had settled in this general area. The Osage had been the dominant tribe for more than a century in the larger region.\n\nOn the southeastern side of the city in 1812, about 500 [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] Native Americans built a small village of about 100 [[wigwams]]. They abandoned the site in 1828. Ten miles south of the site of Springfield, the Lenape had built a substantial dwelling of houses that borrowed elements of Anglo colonial style from the mid-Atlantic, where their people had migrated from.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first European-American settlers to the area were John Polk Campbell and his brother, who moved to the area in 1829 from Tennessee. Campbell chose the area because of the presence of a natural well that flowed into a small stream. He staked his claim by carving his initials in a tree.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell was joined by settlers Thomas Finney, Samuel Weaver, and Joseph Miller. They proceeded to clear the land of trees to develop it for farms. A small general store was soon opened.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1833, the southern part of the state was named Greene County after Revolutionary War hero [[Nathanael Greene|General Nathanael Greene]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gcmohs/2nd_level/brief_history.html|title=A brief history of Greene County, Missouri|website=www.rootsweb.ancestry.com|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref> The legislature deeded 50 acres of land to John Campbell for the creation of a county seat in 1835.

During the 1838 relocation of [[Cherokee]] natives, the [[Trail of Tears]] passed through Springfield to the west, along the [[Old Wire Road]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ozarkgreenways.org/explore/greenway-trails/trail-of-tears/|title=Greenway Trails {{!}} Ozark Greenways|last=Creative|first=Demi|website=ozarkgreenways.org|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.springfieldmo.org/springfield-history|title=Springfield History - Springfield Missouri Travel & Tourism - Ozarks/Midwest Vacations|website=www.springfieldmo.org|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Civil War ===\nBy 1861, Springfield's population had grown to approximately 2,000, and it had become an important commercial hub. In the late 1850s, telegraph lines, previously only to St. Louis, reached Springfield. News from point further west was brought to Springfield overland and then sent by telegraph to what was then called the New York Associated Press. At the start of the [[American Civil War]], Springfield was divided in its loyalty, as it had been settled by people from both the North and South, as well as by German immigrants in the mid-19th century who tended to support the Union.\n\nThe Union and Confederate armies both recognized the city's strategic importance and sought to control it. They fought the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] on August 10, 1861, a few miles southwest of town.<ref name=\":0\" /> The battle was a Confederate victory, and [[Nathaniel Lyon]] became the first Union General killed in Civil War. Union troops retreated to [[Lebanon, Missouri|Lebanon]] to regroup. When they returned, they found that most of the Confederate army had withdrawn.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn October 25, 1861, Union Major [[Charles Zagonyi]] led an attack against the remaining Confederates in the area, in a battle known as the [[Battle of Springfield I|First Battle of Springfield]], or Zagonyi's Charge. Zagonyi's men removed the Confederate flag from Springfield's public square and returned to camp. It was the only Union victory in southwestern Missouri in 1861.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thelibrary.org/lochist/historicalsites/17.cfm|title=Zagonyi's Charge|website=thelibrary.org|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref> The increased military activity in the area set the stage for the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in northern Arkansas in March 1862.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn January 8, 1863, Confederate forces under General [[John S. Marmaduke]] advanced to take control of Springfield and an urban fight ensued. But that evening, the Confederates withdrew. This became known as the [[Battle of Springfield II|Second Battle of Springfield]]. Marmaduke sent a message to the Union forces asking that the Confederate casualties have a proper burial. The city remained under Union control for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\":2\" /> The US army used Springfield as a supply base and central point of operation for military activities in the area.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===\"Wild\" Bill Hickok===\nPromptly after the Civil War ended on July 21, 1865 [[Wild Bill Hickok]] shot and killed [[Davis Tutt]] in a [[Wild Bill Hickok \u2013 Davis Tutt shootout|shootout]] over a disagreement about a debt Tutt claimed Hickok owed him. During a poker game at the former Lyon House Hotel, in response to the disagreement over the amount, Tutt had taken Hickok's watch, which Hickok demanded he return immediately. Hickok warned that Tutt had better not be seen wearing that watch, then spotted him wearing it in Park Central Square, prompting the gunfight.\n\nOn January 25, 1866, Hickok was still in Springfield when he witnessed a Springfield police officer, John Orr, shoot and kill James Coleman after Coleman interfered with the arrest of Coleman's friend Bingham, who was drunk and disorderly. Hickok provided testimony in the case. Orr was arrested, released on bail, and immediately fled the country. He was never brought to trial or heard from again.<ref>https://thelibrary.org/lochist/history/holcombe/grch30pt1.html</ref>\n\n===Lynchings===\nThe period after [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] and into the early 20th century continued to be socially volatile, with whites attacking blacks in the South. Some cities and counties in Missouri, particularly in former slaveholding areas, also had lynchings of [[freedmen]] and their descendants.\n\nOn April 14, 1906, a white mob broke into the Springfield county jail, and [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] two black men, Horace Duncan and Fred Coker, for allegedly sexually assaulting Mina Edwards, a white woman. Later they returned to the jail, where other African-American prisoners were being held, and pulled out Will Allen, who had been accused of murdering a white man. All three suspects were hanged from the Gottfried Tower, which held a replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]], and burned in the courthouse square by a mob of more than 2,000 whites. Judge Azariah W. Lincoln called for a grand jury, but no one was prosecuted. The proceedings were covered by national newspapers, the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name=\"aamuseum\"/>\n\nDuncan's and Coker's employer testified that they were at his business at the time of the crime against Edwards, and other evidence suggested that they and Allen were all innocent.<ref name=\"aamuseum\"/><ref name=\"harper\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=QRR-xMoF0BIC&dq=William+Allen,+Springfield,+April+15,+1906&source=gbs_navlinks_s  Kimberly Harper, ''White Man's Heaven: The Lynching and Expulsion of Blacks in the Southern Ozarks, 1894-1909''], University of Arkansas Press, 2012, pp. 144-145</ref> These three are the only recorded lynchings in Greene County.<ref name=\"lynching\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America''/ ''Supplement: Lynchings by County, 3rd edition''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063004/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |date=2017-10-23 }}, Montgomery, Alabama: Equal Justice Initiative, 2015, p. 7</ref> But the extrajudicial murders were part of a pattern of discrimination, repeated violence and intimidation of African Americans in this city and southwest Missouri from 1894 to 1909, in an attempt to expel them from the region.<ref name=\"harper1\"/> Whites in [[Lawrence County, Missouri|Lawrence County]] also lynched three African-American men in this period.<ref name=\"lynching\"/> After the mass lynching in Springfield, many African Americans left the area in a large exodus.<ref name=\"harper1\">Harper (2012), ''White Man's Heaven</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, the African American population has experienced steady [[minority group|minority]] growth in Springfield and throughout the Ozarks.

[[Missouri Route 13|Route 13]] (Kansas Expressway) carries traffic north towards [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].  [[U.S. Route 60 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 60]], [[U.S. Route 65 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 65]], and [[U.S. Route 160 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 160]] pass through the city. The average commuting time was 17.7 minutes from 2013 to 2017.<ref> https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/springfieldcitymissouri/IPE120218</ref>\n\nMajor streets include Glenstone Avenue, Sunshine Street ([[Missouri Route 413]]), National Avenue, Division Street, Campbell Avenue, Kansas Expressway, Battlefield Road, Republic Road, West Bypass, Chestnut Expressway and Kearney Street.\n[[File:US-65 at I-44.jpg|thumb|Highway 65 leading to I-44]]\nSpringfield is also the site of the first [[diverging diamond interchange]] within the United States, at the intersection of [[Interstate 44|I-44]] and [[Missouri Route 13|MO-13 (Kansas Expressway)]] (at {{Coord|37.2503|-93.3107|name=Springfield, Missouri diverging diamond interchange|display=inline|scale:3000}}).\n\n[[U.S. Route 66 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 66]] and [[U.S. Route 166 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 166]] formerly passed through Springfield, and sections of historic US 66 can still be seen in the city. US 166's eastern terminus was once in the northeast section of the city, and US 60 (westbound) originally ended in downtown Springfield. US 60 now goes through town on [[James River Freeway]]. In mid-November 2013, the city began discussing plans to upgrade sections of Schoolcraft Freeway (Highway 65) and James River Freeway (Highway 60) through the city to Interstate 44. The main reason is to minimize confusion should there be an incident on I-44 as a detour route.\n\n===Airport===\n[[Springfield-Branson National Airport]] (SGF) serves the city with direct flights to 13 cities. It is the principal air gateway to the Springfield region. The [[Downtown Airport (Missouri)|Downtown Airport]] is also a public-use airport located near downtown. In May 2009, the Springfield-Branson airport opened a new passenger terminal. Financing included $97 million in revenue bonds issued by the airport and $20 million of discretionary federal aviation funds, with no city taxes used. The building includes {{convert|275000|sqft|m2}}, 10 gates (expandable to 60) and 1,826 parking spaces. Direct connections from Springfield are available to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas]], [[Denver International Airport|Denver]], [[Destin\u2013Fort Walton Beach Airport|Destin/Fort Walton Beach]], [[Punta Gorda Airport (Florida)|Punta Gorda/Fort Myers]], [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Houston]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Orlando Sanford International Airport|Orlando]], [[Phoenix\u2013Mesa Gateway Airport|Phoenix]] and [[St. Pete\u2013Clearwater International Airport|Tampa]]. No international flights have regular service into Springfield-Branson, but it does serve international charters.\n\n===Trains===\nBassenger trains have not served Springfield since 1967, but more than 65 freight trains travel to, from, and through the city each day. Springfield was once home to the headquarters and main shops of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad [[St. Louis-San Francisco Railway|(Frisco)]]. Into the 1960s, the Kansas City-Florida Special ran from Kansas City to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and the Sunnyland ran between Kansas City and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[New Orleans]]. The railroad also operated two daily trains to [[St. Louis]] through Springfield: the [[Meteor (train)|Meteor]] and the Will Rogers''.'' Both continued southwest to Oklahoma City via Tulsa. The Meteor continued on to [[Lawton, Oklahoma]].\n\nThe Frisco was absorbed by the [[Burlington Northern]] (BN) in 1980, and in 1994 the BN merged with the Santa Fe, creating the current [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] (BNSF) Railway. BNSF has three switch yards (two small) in Springfield. Mainlines to and from Kansas City, St. Louis, Memphis and Tulsa converge at the railroad's yard facility in northern Springfield. In October 2006, BNSF announced plans to upgrade its Tulsa and Memphis mainlines into Springfield to handle an additional four to six daily [[intermodal freight train]]s between the West Coast and the Southeast. The [[Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad]] also operates several miles of (former [[Missouri Pacific]]) industrial track in the city.\n\n==Healthcare==\n[[File:USMCEntrancewayMissouri.jpg|thumb|The entrance to the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]]]]\nSpringfield is a regional medical hub with the healthcare field employing a large number of people in the city.

It is home to three universities, [[Missouri State University]], [[Drury University]], and [[Evangel University]].\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the city's name is unclear, but the most common view is that it was named for [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]] by migrants from that area. One account holds that James Wilson, who lived in the then unnamed city, offered free [[whiskey]] to anyone who would vote for the name Springfield, after his hometown in Massachusetts.<ref>Dark, Phyllis & Harris. ''Springfield of the Ozarks: An Illustrated History.'' Windsor Publications, 1981. {{ISBN|0-89781-028-7}}.</ref>\n\nThe editor of the ''Springfield Express,'' J. G. Newbill, said in the November 11, 1881 issue:<blockquote>\"It has been stated that this city ''got'' its name from the fact of a spring and field being near by just west of town. But such is not a correct version. When the authorized persons met and adopted the title of the \"Future Great\" of the Southwest, several of the earliest settlers had handed in their favorite names, among whom was Kindred Rose, who presented the winning name, \"Springfield,\" in honor of his former home town, [[Springfield, Tennessee|Springfield]], [[Tennessee]].\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/lochist/history/holcombe/grch29pt1.html |title=History of Greene County, Missouri |website=Thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-28}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1883, historian R. I. Holcombe wrote: \n<blockquote>\"The town took its name from the circumstance of there being a ''spring'' under the hill, on the creek, while on top of the hill, where the principal portion of the town lay, there was a ''field''.\"<ref name=\":0\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Early settlement ===\nThe presence of the Native Americans in the area slowed the European-American settlement of the land.<ref name=\":1\" /> Long before the 1830s, the native [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] and [[Osage Nation|Osage]], and the [[Lenape]] (Delaware) from the mid-Atlantic coast had settled in this general area. The Osage had been the dominant tribe for more than a century in the larger region.\n\nOn the southeastern side of the city in 1812, about 500 [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] Native Americans built a small village of about 100 [[wigwams]]. They abandoned the site in 1828. Ten miles south of the site of Springfield, the Lenape had built a substantial dwelling of houses that borrowed elements of Anglo colonial style from the mid-Atlantic, where their people had migrated from.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first European-American settlers to the area were John Polk Campbell and his brother, who moved to the area in 1829 from Tennessee. Campbell chose the area because of the presence of a natural well that flowed into a small stream. He staked his claim by carving his initials in a tree.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell was joined by settlers Thomas Finney, Samuel Weaver, and Joseph Miller. They proceeded to clear the land of trees to develop it for farms. A small general store was soon opened.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1833, the southern part of the state was named Greene County after Revolutionary War hero [[Nathanael Greene|General Nathanael Greene]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gcmohs/2nd_level/brief_history.html|title=A brief history of Greene County, Missouri|website=www.rootsweb.ancestry.com|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref> The legislature deeded 50 acres of land to John Campbell for the creation of a county seat in 1835.

During the 1838 relocation of [[Cherokee]] natives, the [[Trail of Tears]] passed through Springfield to the west, along the [[Old Wire Road]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ozarkgreenways.org/explore/greenway-trails/trail-of-tears/|title=Greenway Trails {{!}} Ozark Greenways|last=Creative|first=Demi|website=ozarkgreenways.org|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.springfieldmo.org/springfield-history|title=Springfield History - Springfield Missouri Travel & Tourism - Ozarks/Midwest Vacations|website=www.springfieldmo.org|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Civil War ===\nBy 1861, Springfield's population had grown to approximately 2,000, and it had become an important commercial hub. In the late 1850s, telegraph lines, previously only to St. Louis, reached Springfield. News from point further west was brought to Springfield overland and then sent by telegraph to what was then called the New York Associated Press. At the start of the [[American Civil War]], Springfield was divided in its loyalty, as it had been settled by people from both the North and South, as well as by German immigrants in the mid-19th century who tended to support the Union.\n\nThe Union and Confederate armies both recognized the city's strategic importance and sought to control it. They fought the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] on August 10, 1861, a few miles southwest of town.<ref name=\":0\" /> The battle was a Confederate victory, and [[Nathaniel Lyon]] became the first Union General killed in Civil War. Union troops retreated to [[Lebanon, Missouri|Lebanon]] to regroup. When they returned, they found that most of the Confederate army had withdrawn.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn October 25, 1861, Union Major [[Charles Zagonyi]] led an attack against the remaining Confederates in the area, in a battle known as the [[Battle of Springfield I|First Battle of Springfield]], or Zagonyi's Charge. Zagonyi's men removed the Confederate flag from Springfield's public square and returned to camp. It was the only Union victory in southwestern Missouri in 1861.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thelibrary.org/lochist/historicalsites/17.cfm|title=Zagonyi's Charge|website=thelibrary.org|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref> The increased military activity in the area set the stage for the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in northern Arkansas in March 1862.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn January 8, 1863, Confederate forces under General [[John S. Marmaduke]] advanced to take control of Springfield and an urban fight ensued. But that evening, the Confederates withdrew. This became known as the [[Battle of Springfield II|Second Battle of Springfield]]. Marmaduke sent a message to the Union forces asking that the Confederate casualties have a proper burial. The city remained under Union control for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\":2\" /> The US army used Springfield as a supply base and central point of operation for military activities in the area.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===\"Wild\" Bill Hickok===\nPromptly after the Civil War ended on July 21, 1865 [[Wild Bill Hickok]] shot and killed [[Davis Tutt]] in a [[Wild Bill Hickok \u2013 Davis Tutt shootout|shootout]] over a disagreement about a debt Tutt claimed Hickok owed him. During a poker game at the former Lyon House Hotel, in response to the disagreement over the amount, Tutt had taken Hickok's watch, which Hickok demanded he return immediately. Hickok warned that Tutt had better not be seen wearing that watch, then spotted him wearing it in Park Central Square, prompting the gunfight.\n\nOn January 25, 1866, Hickok was still in Springfield when he witnessed a Springfield police officer, John Orr, shoot and kill James Coleman after Coleman interfered with the arrest of Coleman's friend Bingham, who was drunk and disorderly. Hickok provided testimony in the case. Orr was arrested, released on bail, and immediately fled the country. He was never brought to trial or heard from again.<ref>https://thelibrary.org/lochist/history/holcombe/grch30pt1.html</ref>\n\n===Lynchings===\nThe period after [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] and into the early 20th century continued to be socially volatile, with whites attacking blacks in the South. Some cities and counties in Missouri, particularly in former slaveholding areas, also had lynchings of [[freedmen]] and their descendants.\n\nOn April 14, 1906, a white mob broke into the Springfield county jail, and [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] two black men, Horace Duncan and Fred Coker, for allegedly sexually assaulting Mina Edwards, a white woman. Later they returned to the jail, where other African-American prisoners were being held, and pulled out Will Allen, who had been accused of murdering a white man. All three suspects were hanged from the Gottfried Tower, which held a replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]], and burned in the courthouse square by a mob of more than 2,000 whites. Judge Azariah W. Lincoln called for a grand jury, but no one was prosecuted. The proceedings were covered by national newspapers, the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name=\"aamuseum\"/>\n\nDuncan's and Coker's employer testified that they were at his business at the time of the crime against Edwards, and other evidence suggested that they and Allen were all innocent.<ref name=\"aamuseum\"/><ref name=\"harper\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=QRR-xMoF0BIC&dq=William+Allen,+Springfield,+April+15,+1906&source=gbs_navlinks_s  Kimberly Harper, ''White Man's Heaven: The Lynching and Expulsion of Blacks in the Southern Ozarks, 1894-1909''], University of Arkansas Press, 2012, pp. 144-145</ref> These three are the only recorded lynchings in Greene County.<ref name=\"lynching\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America''/ ''Supplement: Lynchings by County, 3rd edition''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063004/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |date=2017-10-23 }}, Montgomery, Alabama: Equal Justice Initiative, 2015, p. 7</ref> But the extrajudicial murders were part of a pattern of discrimination, repeated violence and intimidation of African Americans in this city and southwest Missouri from 1894 to 1909, in an attempt to expel them from the region.<ref name=\"harper1\"/> Whites in [[Lawrence County, Missouri|Lawrence County]] also lynched three African-American men in this period.<ref name=\"lynching\"/> After the mass lynching in Springfield, many African Americans left the area in a large exodus.<ref name=\"harper1\">Harper (2012), ''White Man's Heaven</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, the African American population has experienced steady [[minority group|minority]] growth in Springfield and throughout the Ozarks.

Four nationally broadcast [[television series]] originated from the city between 1955 and 1961: ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' and its spin-off, ''[[Five Star Jubilee]]''; ''[[Talent Varieties]]''; and ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show]]''. All were carried live by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] except for ''Five Star Jubilee'' on [[NBC]] and were produced by Springfield's Crossroads TV Productions, owned by [[Ralph D. Foster]]. Many of the biggest names in [[country music]] frequently visited or lived in Springfield at the time. City officials estimated the programs meant about 2,000 weekly visitors and \"over $1,000,000 in fresh income.\"<ref>Dessauer, Phil \"Springfield, Mo.-Radio City of Country Music\" (April, 1957), ''[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]]'', p. 152</ref>\n\nStaged at the Jewell Theatre (demolished in 1961), ''Ozark Jubilee'' was the first national country music TV show to feature top stars and attract a significant viewership. ''Five Star Jubilee'', produced from the [[Landers Theatre]], was the first network [[color television]] series to originate outside of New York City or Hollywood.<ref>\"'Jubilee' Turning to Color TV\" (April 30, 1961), ''[[Springfield News-Leader|Springfield Leader-Press]]''</ref> Ironically, Springfield's NBC affiliate, [[KYTV-TV]] (which helped produce the program), was not equipped to broadcast in color and aired the show in [[black-and-white]].\n\nThe [[Citadel Media#ABC Radio|ABC]], [[NBC Red Network|NBC]] and [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] [[radio network]]s also all carried country music shows nationally from Springfield during the decade, including KWTO'S ''Korn's-A-Krackin{{'}}'' (Mutual).\n\n===The Ozark Hillbilly Medallion===\nThe Springfield Chamber of Commerce once presented visiting dignitaries with an \"Ozark [[Hillbilly]] Medallion\" and a certificate proclaiming the honoree a \"hillbilly of the Ozarks.\" On June 7, 1953, U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] [http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/index.php?pid=2414&st=&st1= received the medallion after a breakfast speech] at the Shrine Mosque for a reunion of the [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th Division]].

Many of the older buildings have been, and are continuing to be, renovated into mixed-use buildings such as lofts, office space, restaurants, coffee shops, bars, boutiques, and music venues. The Downtown Springfield CID ([[Business Improvement District|Community Improvement District]]) has historic theaters that have been restored to their original state, including the [[Gillioz Theatre]] and the [[Landers Theatre]].\n\nIn 2001, Phase I of Jordan Valley Park opened along with the Mediacom Ice Park. Phase II of Jordan Valley Park was completed in 2012. 2001 also saw the opening of The Creamery Arts Center, a city-owned building inside Jordan Valley Park. It is home to the Springfield Regional Arts Council, Springfield Regional Opera, Springfield Ballet, and the Springfield Symphony Orchestra and provides office and meeting space for other arts organizations which serve the community. The center has been renovated to include two art galleries with monthly exhibitions, an Arts Library, rehearsal studios, and classrooms offering art workshops and hands-on activities. The facilities also include an outdoor classroom.\n\nA March 2009 ''New York Times'' article<ref>Edge, John T., ''Missouri Chinese: Two Cultures Claim This Chicken'', March 10, 2009, https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/dining/11cashew.html</ref> described the history and ascendancy of [[cashew chicken]] in Springfield, where local variations of the popular Chinese dish are ubiquitous.\n\n=== Cultural organizations ===\n[[File:Landers Theater Elevation 311 E Walnut.JPG|thumb|The [[Landers Theatre]]]]\nThe Springfield Opera has operated in the city for nearly 40 years.

[[Missouri Route 13|Route 13]] (Kansas Expressway) carries traffic north towards [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].  [[U.S. Route 60 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 60]], [[U.S. Route 65 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 65]], and [[U.S. Route 160 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 160]] pass through the city. The average commuting time was 17.7 minutes from 2013 to 2017.<ref> https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/springfieldcitymissouri/IPE120218</ref>\n\nMajor streets include Glenstone Avenue, Sunshine Street ([[Missouri Route 413]]), National Avenue, Division Street, Campbell Avenue, Kansas Expressway, Battlefield Road, Republic Road, West Bypass, Chestnut Expressway and Kearney Street.\n[[File:US-65 at I-44.jpg|thumb|Highway 65 leading to I-44]]\nSpringfield is also the site of the first [[diverging diamond interchange]] within the United States, at the intersection of [[Interstate 44|I-44]] and [[Missouri Route 13|MO-13 (Kansas Expressway)]] (at {{Coord|37.2503|-93.3107|name=Springfield, Missouri diverging diamond interchange|display=inline|scale:3000}}).\n\n[[U.S. Route 66 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 66]] and [[U.S. Route 166 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 166]] formerly passed through Springfield, and sections of historic US 66 can still be seen in the city. US 166's eastern terminus was once in the northeast section of the city, and US 60 (westbound) originally ended in downtown Springfield. US 60 now goes through town on [[James River Freeway]]. In mid-November 2013, the city began discussing plans to upgrade sections of Schoolcraft Freeway (Highway 65) and James River Freeway (Highway 60) through the city to Interstate 44. The main reason is to minimize confusion should there be an incident on I-44 as a detour route.\n\n===Airport===\n[[Springfield-Branson National Airport]] (SGF) serves the city with direct flights to 13 cities. It is the principal air gateway to the Springfield region. The [[Downtown Airport (Missouri)|Downtown Airport]] is also a public-use airport located near downtown. In May 2009, the Springfield-Branson airport opened a new passenger terminal. Financing included $97 million in revenue bonds issued by the airport and $20 million of discretionary federal aviation funds, with no city taxes used. The building includes {{convert|275000|sqft|m2}}, 10 gates (expandable to 60) and 1,826 parking spaces. Direct connections from Springfield are available to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas]], [[Denver International Airport|Denver]], [[Destin\u2013Fort Walton Beach Airport|Destin/Fort Walton Beach]], [[Punta Gorda Airport (Florida)|Punta Gorda/Fort Myers]], [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Houston]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Orlando Sanford International Airport|Orlando]], [[Phoenix\u2013Mesa Gateway Airport|Phoenix]] and [[St. Pete\u2013Clearwater International Airport|Tampa]]. No international flights have regular service into Springfield-Branson, but it does serve international charters.\n\n===Trains===\nPassenger trains have not served Springfield since 1967, but more than 65 freight trains travel to, from, and through the city each day. Springfield was once home to the headquarters and main shops of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad [[St. Louis-San Francisco Railway|(Frisco)]]. Into the 1960s, the Kansas City-Florida Special ran from Kansas City to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and the Sunnyland ran between Kansas City and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[New Orleans]]. The railroad also operated two daily trains to [[St. Louis]] through Springfield: the [[Meteor (train)|Meteor]] and the Will Rogers''.'' Both continued southwest to Oklahoma City via Tulsa. The Meteor continued on to [[Lawton, Oklahoma]].\n\nThe Frisco was absorbed by the [[Burlington Northern]] (BN) in 1980, and in 1994 the BN merged with the Santa Fe, creating the current [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] (BNSF) Railway. BNSF has three switch yards (two small) in Springfield. Mainlines to and from Kansas City, St. Louis, Memphis and Tulsa converge at the railroad's yard facility in northern Springfield. In October 2006, BNSF announced plans to upgrade its Tulsa and Memphis mainlines into Springfield to handle an additional four to six daily [[intermodal freight train]]s between the West Coast and the Southeast. The [[Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad]] also operates several miles of (former [[Missouri Pacific]]) industrial track in the city.\n\n==Healthcare==\n[[File:USMCEntrancewayMissouri.jpg|thumb|The entrance to the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]]]]\nSpringfield is a regional medical hub with the healthcare field employing a large number of people in the city.
