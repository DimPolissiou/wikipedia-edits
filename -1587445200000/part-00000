It took place on January 22, 1995, in the [[USF Sun Dome]] located in [[Tampa, Florida]].\n\nThe event featured five matches based on scripted storylines, and the results were predetermined by the WWF. The main event was the [[Royal Rumble match|1995 Royal Rumble match]], which [[Shawn Michaels]] won after entering first and outlasting the 29 other wrestlers for the first time in WWF history. The event also featured a match for the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]], when [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] defended the title against [[Bret Hart]]. The match was stopped when several other wrestlers interfered and the referee lost control of the match. Two other title matches took place; [[Jeff Jarrett]] won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] from [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]], and [[Sean Waltman|The 1\u20132\u20133 Kid]] and [[Bob Holly]] won the final match in a tournament that determined the new [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champions]].\n\nSeveral storylines from Royal Rumble 1995 were carried over to [[WrestleMania XI]], the WWF's next pay-per-view. [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] attacked [[National Football League]] Hall of Famer [[Lawrence Taylor]], who was sitting in the crowd; this set up a match between the two at WrestleMania. [[Pamela Anderson]] was at ringside and was supposed to accompany the winner of the Royal Rumble match to his WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. Although Shawn Michaels won the match, Anderson came to the ring at WrestleMania with Diesel. [[The Undertaker]]'s feud with [[Ted DiBiase]]'s [[Million Dollar Corporation]] also escalated, as DiBiase's men stole the urn that was said to give The Undertaker his power. Jarrett and Ramon continued to feud for several months, and Bret Hart targeted [[Bob Backlund]] because of Backlund's interference in the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe [[Royal Rumble]] is an annual [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] pay-per-view, produced every January by the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]], later dubbed the \"Big Four\".<ref>Ian Hamilton. ''Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition'' (p. 160)</ref> It is named after the [[Royal Rumble match]], a modified [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world championship]] match at that year's WrestleMania. For 1995, the winner earned a match for the [[WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[WrestleMania XI]]. 1995 was the eighth event in the Royal Rumble chronology.<ref name=wwematch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/royalrumble|title=Specialty Matches: Royal Rumble|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref><ref name=stats>{{cite web|last=Waldman|title=Statistical survival \u2013 breaking down the Royal Rumble|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/01/917194.html|first=Jon|publisher=SLAM!

The matches resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]], [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], or [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Tweener|less distinguishable characters]] to build tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Ramon used his strength to dominate the opening of the match. Jarrett gained the momentum with a series of [[dropkick]]s and then choked Ramon with a [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|sleeper hold]]. Ramon ran at Jarrett but was thrown over the top rope. He hit his knee when he landed, and The Roadie then hit Ramon from behind in the knee. Ramon was unable to return to the ring, so Jarrett was awarded the match via [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]]. Because the championship cannot change hands on a countout, Jarrett challenged Ramon to continue the match. Ramon agreed and nearly pinned Jarrett twice. Jarrett applied the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure four leglock]] to apply pressure to Ramon's injured knee. Ramon escaped the hold and attempted to perform the [[Powerbomb#Crucifix powerbomb|Razor's Edge]]. He collapsed under Jarrett's weight, however, and Jarrett pinned him to win the title.<ref name=oo>{{cite web|title=Royal Rumble 1995 Re-Revued|work=Online Onslaught|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20040818.shtml|date=2004-08-18|accessdate=2008-09-22|last=Gutschmidt|first=Adam|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215054058/http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20040818.shtml|archivedate=2010-02-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gianfriddo|first=Lou|title=Double J Takes Razor's Gold|journal=World Wrestling Federation Magazine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=38\u201339|publisher=Titan Sports|date=April 1995}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Irwin R Schyster in 1994.jpg|thumb|left|180 px|[[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R.

The Undertaker gained the advantage at the beginning and held it until Ted DiBiase called his druids to the ring. When The Undertaker attempted to attack Schyster from the top rope, the druids shook the ropes and caused him to fall. Schyster performed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]] to knock The Undertaker out of the ring, where he and the druids attacked The Undertaker. When the match returned to the ring, Schyster was in control. Both men got knocked down, however, and a druid snuck into the ring and rolled Schyster on top of The Undertaker for a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] attempt. The Undertaker kicked out and attempted to perform the [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]]. A druid interfered to prevent the move, but The Undertaker  performed a [[chokeslam]] on Schyster to gain the pinfall victory. After the match, Ted DiBiase called out Corporation member [[King Kong Bundy]] to help Schyster attack The Undertaker and steal the urn, which was said to be the source of The Undertaker's power.<ref name=oo/><ref name=irs>{{cite journal|last=Gianfriddo|first=Lou|title=The Undertaker vs. IRS|journal=World Wrestling Federation Magazine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=41|publisher=Titan Sports|date=April 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WrestleMania XI \u2013 Undertaker vs. King Kong Bundy|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/undertaker/wrestlemanialegacy/wrestlemaniaxi/matchrecap/|accessdate=2008-10-30|publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\nThe WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was next, in which Diesel defended the title against Bret Hart. Diesel began the match by clotheslining Hart, but Hart gained the advantage by focusing on injuring Diesel's knee. He performed the figure four leglock twice before attacking Diesel outside the ring. Diesel regained the advantage by using his size and strength to throw Hart and perform power moves to wear him down. Hart tied Diesel's legs to the ring post with a piece of tape and kicked him repeatedly. Diesel recovered and performed the [[Powerbomb#Release powerbomb|Jackknife]] power bomb on Hart. Before the referee could count the pinfall, Shawn Michaels ran to the ring and attacked Diesel. The referee ordered the match to continue, and the match went back and forth until Hart used the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] submission hold to place pressure on Diesel's injured leg. Owen Hart interfered by attacking Bret, but the match was ordered to continue. Bret Hart and Diesel brawled until Bret rolled Diesel up for a pinfall. The referee was knocked unconscious, and Michaels, Jarrett, and The Roadie came to the ring to attack Diesel. Meanwhile, Owen Hart and Bob Backlund attacked Bret Hart. Because the referee could not control the match, it was declared a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] and Diesel retained his championship.<ref name=oo/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gianfriddo|first=Lou|title=Diesel vs. Bret \"Hit Man\" Hart|journal=World Wrestling Federation Magazine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=36\u201337|publisher=Titan Sports|date=April 1995}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bam Bam Bigelow in 1995.jpg|thumb|right|180 px|[[Bam Bam Bigelow]] attacked football star [[Lawrence Taylor]] after losing his match.]]\nBob Holly and the 1\u20132\u20133 Kid faced Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka next in the final match of the WWF Tag Team Championship tournament. Tatanka began the match by using his strength against Holly, but Holly soon turned the match around by performing a [[Professional wrestling throws#Hurricanrana|hurricanrana]] throw. Bigelow used his strength against his opponents, but the 1\u20132\u20133 Kid performed a hurricanrana on him as well. Bigelow regained the advantage by kicking the Kid in the back of the head and controlled the match until the Kid threw him out of the ring. Bigelow and Tatanka turned the match around again, using power moves to wear down their opponents. At one point, Bigelow held the Kid for Tatanka to attack, but Tatanka accidentally hit Bigelow instead. The match ended in a similar manner, as Tatanka knocked Bigelow off the top rope when Bigelow attempted to perform a [[moonsault]]. The 1\u20132\u20133 Kid pinned Bigelow to win the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship. After the match, the crowd heckled Bigelow. He responded by pushing retired [[National Football League|NFL]] player [[Lawrence Taylor]], who was at ring side, laughing about Bigelow's loss.<ref name=oo/><ref name=kidholly>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/304454132116|title=History of the World Tag Team Championship: The 1\u20132\u20133 Kid and Bob Holly's first reign|work=WWE|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gianfriddo|first=Lou|title=Holly and The Kid Win Big!|journal=World Wrestling Federation Magazine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=40|publisher=TitanSports, Inc.|date=April 1995}}</ref>\n\nIn the main event, Shawn Michaels was the first entrant in the Royal Rumble match, while Davey Boy Smith was the second participant. Every 60 seconds, another wrestler entered the match. As Owen Hart made his way to the ring, he was attacked by his brother Bret. As a result of the attack, Owen was quickly eliminated from the match when Smith, his brother-in-law, threw him out of the ring. [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Mabel]], the two biggest competitors in the match, fought until Mabel eliminated Bundy. [[Lex Luger]] then entered the match and eliminated Mabel. Bret Hart returned later and attacked Bob Backlund as Backlund was about to enter the match. This enabled Luger to eliminate Backlund quickly, after which Backlund and Bret continued to fight. The final four participants remaining in the ring were Michaels, Smith, Luger, and [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]]. Luger attacked Crush but was eliminated by Michaels. Crush then convinced Michaels to work with him but then turned on Michaels by attacking him. Michaels scratched Crush's eyes, which enabled Smith to eliminate Crush. Michaels and Smith, the first two entrants, were the last two wrestlers remaining. Smith threw Michaels over the top rope and began to celebrate. Michaels, who had only touched the floor with one foot, was not eliminated from the match, however. He attacked Smith from behind and threw him out of the ring to become the first wrestler to win the Royal Rumble after entering first. Michaels celebrated in the ring with Pamela Anderson.<ref name=oo/><ref name=takes>{{cite journal|last=Gianfriddo|first=Lou|title=Shawn Takes the Rumble!|journal=World Wrestling Federation Magazine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=42\u201344|publisher=Titan Sports|date=April 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The No. 1 Showstopper|publisher=WWE|last=McAvennie|first=Mike|date=2007-01-24|accessdate=2008-10-30|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/listthis/toprumbleperformances/rumblemoment5}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe event was attended by 10,000 fans,<ref name=pwh>{{cite web|title=Royal Rumble|work=Pro Wrestling History|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble.html|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> which is approximately the maximum capacity of the USF Sun Dome.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sun Dome Seating Diagram|url=https://www.nmnathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&ATCLID=222782|accessdate=2008-09-25|date=2006-01-01|work=University of South Florida Bulls}}</ref> This attendance figure was down from the previous year's attendance of 14,500, but higher than the following year, when 9,600 people attended [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble 1996]].<ref name=pwh/> From the ticket sales, the WWF gained $140,000; again, this was lower than in 1994 but higher than in 1996.<ref name=pwh/> The pay-per-view buyrate of 1.0, however, was higher than 1994's 0.9 figure but lower than 1996's buyrate of 1.1.<ref name=pwh/>\n\nFormer WWE wrestler [[Cody Rhodes]] has stated that Michaels's win, in which he was the first wrestler to enter the ring in the #1 position and win the match,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/shawnmichaels/overcomingtheodds/rumblematchrecap/|title=The 1995 Royal Rumble Match|work=WWE|accessdate=2008-09-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329073304/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/shawnmichaels/overcomingtheodds/rumblematchrecap/|archivedate=March 29, 2008}}</ref> is his favorite ending to a Royal Rumble match.<ref>{{cite web|title=Favorite Rumble Finishes|publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/2008/rumblefinishes/|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> Reviewing the event for ''Online Onslaught'', columnist Adam Gutschmidt evaluated the event as acceptable but not exceptional.

It took place on January 22, 1995, in the [[USF Sun Dome]] located in [[Tampa, Florida]].\n\nThe event featured five matches based on scripted storylines, and the results were predetermined by the WWF. The main event was the [[Royal Rumble match|1995 Royal Rumble match]], which [[Shawn Michaels]] won after entering first and outlasting the 29 other wrestlers for the first time in WWF history. The event also featured a match for the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]], when [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] defended the title against [[Bret Hart]]. The match was stopped when several other wrestlers interfered and the referee lost control of the match. Two other title matches took place; [[Jeff Jarrett]] won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] from [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]], and [[Sean Waltman|The 1\u20132\u20133 Kid]] and [[Bob Holly]] won the final match in a tournament that determined the new [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champions]].\n\nSeveral storylines from Royal Rumble 1995 were carried over to [[WrestleMania XI]], the WWF's next pay-per-view. [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] attacked [[National Football League]] Hall of Famer [[Lawrence Taylor]], who was sitting in the crowd; this set up a match between the two at WrestleMania. [[Pamela Anderson]] was at ringside and was supposed to accompany the winner of the Royal Rumble match to his WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. Although Shawn Michaels won the match, Anderson came to the ring at WrestleMania with Diesel. [[The Undertaker]]'s feud with [[Ted DiBiase]]'s [[Million Dollar Corporation]] also escalated, as DiBiase's men stole the urn that was said to give The Undertaker his power. Jarrett and Ramon continued to feud for several months, and Bret Hart targeted [[Bob Backlund]] because of Backlund's interference in the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe [[Royal Rumble]] is an annual [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] pay-per-view, produced every January by the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]], later dubbed the \"Big Four\".<ref>Ian Hamilton. ''Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition'' (p. 160)</ref> It is named after the [[Royal Rumble match]], a modified [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world championship]] match at that year's WrestleMania. For 1995, the winner earned a match for the [[WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[WrestleMania XI]]. 1995 was the eighth event in the Royal Rumble chronology.<ref name=wwematch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/royalrumble|title=Specialty Matches: Royal Rumble|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref><ref name=stats>{{cite web|last=Waldman|title=Statistical survival \u2013 breaking down the Royal Rumble|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/01/917194.html|first=Jon|publisher=SLAM!

Ramon used his strength to dominate the opening of the match. Jarrett gained the momentum with a series of [[dropkick]]s and then choked Ramon with a [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|sleeper hold]]. Ramon ran at Jarrett but was thrown over the top rope. He hit his knee when he landed, and The Roadie then hit Ramon from behind in the knee. Ramon was unable to return to the ring, so Jarrett was awarded the match via [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]]. Because the championship cannot change hands on a countout, Jarrett challenged Ramon to continue the match. Ramon agreed and nearly pinned Jarrett twice. Jarrett applied the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure four leglock]] to apply pressure to Ramon's injured knee. Ramon escaped the hold and attempted to perform the [[Powerbomb#Crucifix powerbomb|Razor's Edge]]. He collapsed under Jarrett's weight, however, and Jarrett pinned him to win the title.<ref name=oo>{{cite web|title=Royal Rumble 1995 Re-Revued|work=Online Onslaught|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20040818.shtml|date=2004-08-18|accessdate=2008-09-22|last=Gutschmidt|first=Adam|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215054058/http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20040818.shtml|archivedate=2010-02-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gianfriddo|first=Lou|title=Double J Takes Razor's Gold|journal=World Wrestling Federation Magazine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=38\u201339|publisher=Titan Sports|date=April 1995}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Irwin R Schyster in 1994.jpg|thumb|left|180 px|[[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R.

The Undertaker gained the advantage at the beginning and held it until Ted DiBiase called his druids to the ring. When The Undertaker attempted to attack Schyster from the top rope, the druids shook the ropes and caused him to fall. Schyster performed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]] to knock The Undertaker out of the ring, where he and the druids attacked The Undertaker. When the match returned to the ring, Schyster was in control. Both men got knocked down, however, and a druid snuck into the ring and rolled Schyster on top of The Undertaker for a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] attempt. The Undertaker kicked out and attempted to perform the [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]]. A druid interfered to prevent the move, but The Undertaker  performed a [[chokeslam]] on Schyster to gain the pinfall victory. After the match, Ted DiBiase called out Corporation member [[King Kong Bundy]] to help Schyster attack The Undertaker and steal the urn, which was said to be the source of The Undertaker's power.<ref name=oo/><ref name=irs>{{cite journal|last=Gianfriddo|first=Lou|title=The Undertaker vs. IRS|journal=World Wrestling Federation Magazine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=41|publisher=Titan Sports|date=April 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WrestleMania XI \u2013 Undertaker vs. King Kong Bundy|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/undertaker/wrestlemanialegacy/wrestlemaniaxi/matchrecap/|accessdate=2008-10-30|publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\nThe WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was next, in which Diesel defended the title against Bret Hart. Diesel began the match by clotheslining Hart, but Hart gained the advantage by focusing on injuring Diesel's knee. He performed the figure four leglock twice before attacking Diesel outside the ring. Diesel regained the advantage by using his size and strength to throw Hart and perform power moves to wear him down. Hart tied Diesel's legs to the ring post with a piece of tape and kicked him repeatedly. Diesel recovered and performed the [[Powerbomb#Release powerbomb|Jackknife]] power bomb on Hart. Before the referee could count the pinfall, Shawn Michaels ran to the ring and attacked Diesel. The referee ordered the match to continue, and the match went back and forth until Hart used the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] submission hold to place pressure on Diesel's injured leg. Owen Hart interfered by attacking Bret, but the match was ordered to continue. Bret Hart and Diesel brawled until Bret rolled Diesel up for a pinfall. The referee was knocked unconscious, and Michaels, Jarrett, and The Roadie came to the ring to attack Diesel. Meanwhile, Owen Hart and Bob Backlund attacked Bret Hart. Because the referee could not control the match, it was declared a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] and Diesel retained his championship.<ref name=oo/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gianfriddo|first=Lou|title=Diesel vs. Bret \"Hit Man\" Hart|journal=World Wrestling Federation Magazine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=36\u201337|publisher=Titan Sports|date=April 1995}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bam Bam Bigelow in 1995.jpg|thumb|right|180 px|[[Bam Bam Bigelow]] attacked football star [[Lawrence Taylor]] after losing his match.]]\nBob Holly and the 1\u20132\u20133 Kid faced Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka next in the final match of the WWF Tag Team Championship tournament. Tatanka began the match by using his strength against Holly, but Holly soon turned the match around by performing a [[Professional wrestling throws#Hurricanrana|hurricanrana]] throw. Bigelow used his strength against his opponents, but the 1\u20132\u20133 Kid performed a hurricanrana on him as well. Bigelow regained the advantage by kicking the Kid in the back of the head and controlled the match until the Kid threw him out of the ring. Bigelow and Tatanka turned the match around again, using power moves to wear down their opponents. At one point, Bigelow held the Kid for Tatanka to attack, but Tatanka accidentally hit Bigelow instead. The match ended in a similar manner, as Tatanka knocked Bigelow off the top rope when Bigelow attempted to perform a [[moonsault]]. The 1\u20132\u20133 Kid pinned Bigelow to win the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship. After the match, the crowd heckled Bigelow. He responded by pushing retired [[National Football League|NFL]] player [[Lawrence Taylor]], who was at ring side, laughing about Bigelow's loss.<ref name=oo/><ref name=kidholly>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/304454132116|title=History of the World Tag Team Championship: The 1\u20132\u20133 Kid and Bob Holly's first reign|work=WWE|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gianfriddo|first=Lou|title=Holly and The Kid Win Big!|journal=World Wrestling Federation Magazine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=40|publisher=TitanSports, Inc.|date=April 1995}}</ref>\n\nIn the main event, Shawn Michaels was the first entrant in the Royal Rumble match, while Davey Boy Smith was the second participant. Every 60 seconds, another wrestler entered the match. As Owen Hart made his way to the ring, he was attacked by his brother Bret. As a result of the attack, Owen was quickly eliminated from the match when Smith, his brother-in-law, threw him out of the ring. [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Mabel]], the two biggest competitors in the match, fought until Mabel eliminated Bundy. [[Lex Luger]] then entered the match and eliminated Mabel. Bret Hart returned later and attacked Bob Backlund as Backlund was about to enter the match. This enabled Luger to eliminate Backlund quickly, after which Backlund and Bret continued to fight. The final four participants remaining in the ring were Michaels, Smith, Luger, and [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]]. Luger attacked Crush but was eliminated by Michaels. Crush then convinced Michaels to work with him but then turned on Michaels by attacking him. Michaels scratched Crush's eyes, which enabled Smith to eliminate Crush. Michaels and Smith, the first two entrants, were the last two wrestlers remaining. Smith threw Michaels over the top rope and began to celebrate. Michaels, who had only touched the floor with one foot, was not eliminated from the match, however. He attacked Smith from behind and threw him out of the ring to become the first wrestler to win the Royal Rumble after entering first.
