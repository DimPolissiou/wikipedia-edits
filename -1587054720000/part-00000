Subsequently, a guerrilla [[liberation war]] was fought against the [[Axis powers|Axis]] occupying forces and their locally established puppet regimes, including the fascist [[Independent State of Croatia]] and the [[Government of National Salvation]] in the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied territory of Serbia]], by the [[KPJ|Communist]]-led republican [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. Simultaneously, a multi-side [[civil war]] was waged between the Yugoslav communist Partisans, the Serbian royalist [[Chetniks]], the Croatian fascist [[Ustashe]] and [[Croatian Home Guard (World War II)|Home Guard]], [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] and [[Serbian State Guard|State Guard]], as well as [[Slovene Home Guard]] troops.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pages=145\u2013155}}\n\nBoth the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chetnik movement initially resisted the occupation. However, after 1941, Chetniks extensively and systematically collaborated with the [[Military history of Italy during World War II|Italian occupation forces]] until the [[Italian capitulation]], and thereon also with [[Wehrmacht|German]] and Ustashe forces.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=145-155}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=246}} The Axis mounted a [[Seven anti-Partisan offensives|series of offensives]] intended to destroy the Partisans, coming close to doing so in the [[Battle of Neretva]] and [[Battle of Sutjeska]] in the spring and summer of 1943.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the Partisans remained a credible fighting force, with [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|their organisation]] gaining recognition from the Western Allies at the [[Tehran Conference#Results|Tehran Conference]] and laying the foundations for the [[SFRY|post-war Yugoslav state]]. With support in logistics and air power from the Western Allies, and [[Red Army|Soviet ground troops]] in the [[Belgrade Offensive]], the Partisans eventually gained control of the entire country and of the border regions of [[Trieste#World War II and aftermath|Trieste]] and [[Carinthia (state)#From 1920 to the Present|Carinthia]].\n\nThe [[World War II casualties|human cost of the war]] was enormous. The number of war victims is still in dispute, but is generally agreed to have been at least one million. Non-combat victims included the majority of the country's [[Jewish]] population, many of whom perished in [[concentration camp|concentration]] and [[extermination camp]]s (e.g. [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], [[Banjica concentration camp|Banjica]]) run by the client regimes.\n\nThe Ustashe regime (mostly [[Croats]], but also [[Bosniaks|Muslims]] and others) committed [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide against Serbs]], Jews, [[Romani people|Roma]] and anti-Fascist [[Croats]].

In the same time, the country was destabilized by internal tensions, as Croatian leaders demanded a greater level of autonomy. Stojadinovi\u0107 was sacked by the regent [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]] in 1939 and replaced by [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]], who negotiated a compromise with Croatian leader [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]] in 1939, resulting in the formation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]].\n\nHowever, rather than reducing tensions, the agreement only reinforced the crisis in the country's governance.{{sfn|Trbovich|pages=131\u2013132}} Groups from both sides of the political spectrum were not satisfied: the pro-fascist [[Usta\u0161e]] sought an independent Croatia allied with the [[Axis powers|Axis]], Serbian public and military circles preferred alliance with the Western European empires, while the then-banned [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] saw the [[Soviet Union]] as a natural ally.\n\nAfter the [[fall of France]] to [[Nazi Germany]] in May 1940, the UK was the only empire in conflict with the Axis powers, and [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]] and the government saw no way of saving [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] except through adopting policies of accommodation with the Axis powers. Although [[Hitler]] was not particularly interested in creating another front in the [[Balkans]], and Yugoslavia itself remained at peace during the first year of the war, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy had [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded Albania]] in April 1939 and launched the rather unsuccessful [[Italo-Greek War]] in October 1940. These events resulted in Yugoslavia's geographical isolation from potential [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] support. The government tried to negotiate with the Axis on cooperation with as few concessions as possible, while attempting secret negotiations with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Soviet Union]], but those moves would fail to keep the country out of the war.{{sfn|Lampe|page=198}} A secret mission to the US, led by the influential Serbian-Jewish Captain [[David Albala]] with the purpose of obtaining funding to buy arms for the expected invasion went nowhere, while [[Stalin]] expelled Yugoslav Ambassador Gavrilovic just one month after agreeing a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"Gorodetsky2002\">{{cite book|author=Gabriel Gorodetsky|title=Stafford Cripps' Mission to Moscow, 1940-42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wd0hGHrq7d4C&pg=PA130|date=8 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52220-5|pages=130\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==1941==\nHaving steadily fallen within the orbit of the Axis during 1940 after events such as the [[Second Vienna Award]], Yugoslavia followed [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and formally joined the Axis powers by signing the [[Tripartite Pact]] on 25 March 1941. Air force officers opposed to the move [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|staged a coup d'\u00e9tat]] and took over in the following days. These events were viewed with great apprehension in Berlin, and as it was preparing to help its Italian ally in its war against Greece anyway, the plans were [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|modified to include Yugoslavia]] as well.\n\n===Invasion===\n{{Main|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1941-43.png|thumbnail|left|Occupation and partition of Yugoslavia 1941.]]\nOn 6 April 1941 the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] from all sides by the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and [[Hungary during World War II|their ally Hungary]].\nDuring the invasion, [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|Belgrade was bombed]] by the German air force (''[[Luftwaffe]]''). The [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] lasted little more than ten days, ending with the unconditional surrender of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] on 17 April. Besides being hopelessly ill-equipped when compared to the German Army (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]''), the Yugoslav army attempted to defend all borders but only managed to thinly spread the limited resources available. Also, large numbers of the population refused to fight, instead welcoming the Germans as liberators from government oppression. However, as this meant each individual ethnic group would turn to movements opposed to the unity promoted by the South Slavic state, two different concepts of resistance emerged, the royalist [[Chetniks]], and the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|page=26}}\n\nTwo of the principal constituent national groups, Slovenes and Croats, were not prepared to fight in defense of a Yugoslav state with a continued [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty|Serb monarchy]]. The only effective opposition to the invasion was from units wholly from Serbia itself.{{sfn|Shaw|1973|page=92}} The Serbian General Staff was united on the question of Yugoslavia as a \"Greater Serbia\" ruled, in one way or another, by Serbia. On the eve of the invasion, there were 165 generals on the Yugoslav active list. Of these, all but four were Serbs.{{sfn|Shaw|1973|page=89}}\n\nThe terms of the capitulation were extremely severe, as the Axis proceeded to dismember Yugoslavia. Germany annexed northern [[Slovenia]], while retaining [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|direct occupation over a rump Serbian state]], and considerable influence over its newly created [[puppet state]], the [[Independent State of Croatia]], which extended over much of today's [[Croatia]] and contained all of modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Mussolini's Italy gained the remainder of Slovenia, [[Kosovo]], coastal and inland areas of the [[Croatian Littoral]] and large chunks of the coastal [[Dalmatia]] region (along with nearly all of the [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]] islands and the [[Bay of Kotor]]). It also gained control over the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]], and was granted the kingship in the Independent State of Croatia, though wielding little real power within it; although it did (alongside Germany) maintain a de facto zone of influence within the borders of the [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]].

The resistance of the Chetniks had lasted only until the autumn of 1941, their leaders then going over to the enemy or returning to passivity.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Introduction}}}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0723, Marburg-Drau, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Maribor]], Yugoslavia in 1941. He later ordered his officials \"to make these lands German again\".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=85}}]]\nFrom the start, the Yugoslav resistance forces consisted of two factions: the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], a communist-led movement propagating pan-Yugoslav tolerance (\"[[brotherhood and unity]]\") and incorporating republican, left-wing and liberal elements of Yugoslav politics, on one hand, and the [[Chetniks]], a conservative royalist and nationalist force, enjoying support almost exclusively from the [[Serbs|Serbian]] population in occupied Yugoslavia, on the other hand. Initially the Chetniks received recognition from the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], while the Partisans were supported by the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nAt the very beginning, the Partisan forces were relatively small, poorly armed, and without any infrastructure. But they had two major advantages over other military and [[paramilitary]] formations in former Yugoslavia:  the first and most immediate advantage was a small but valuable cadre of [[Spanish Civil War]] veterans. Unlike some of the other military and paramilitary formations, these veterans had experience with a modern war fought in circumstances quite similar to those found in World War II Yugoslavia. In Slovenia, the Partisans likewise drew on the experienced [[TIGR]] members to train troops.\n\nTheir other major advantage, which became more apparent in later stages of War, was in the Partisans being founded on a communist ideology rather than [[ethnicity]]. Therefore, they won support that crossed national lines, meaning they could expect at least some levels of support in almost any corner of the country, unlike other paramilitary formations limited to territories with Croat or Serb majority. This allowed their units to be more mobile and fill their ranks with a larger pool of potential recruits.\n\nAlthough the activity of the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] Partisans were part of the Yugoslav People's Liberation War, the specific conditions in Macedonia and Slovenia, due to the strong [[Autonomism (political doctrine)|autonomist]] tendencies of the local communists, led to the creation of separate sub-armies called the [[People's Liberation Army of Macedonia]], and [[Slovene Partisans]] led by [[Liberation Front of the Slovene People]], respectively.\n\nThe most numerous local force, besides the four second-line German Wehrmacht infantry divisions assigned to occupation duties was the [[Croatian Home Guard (World War II)|Croatian Home Guard]] (''Hrvatsko domobranstvo''), founded in April 1941, a few days after the founding of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) itself. It was done with the authorisation of German occupation authorities. The task of the new Croatian armed forces was to defend the new state against both foreign and domestic enemies.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=419}}\n\nThe Croatian Home Guard was originally limited to 16 infantry [[battalion]]s and 2 cavalry [[Squadron (army)|squadrons]] \u2013 16,000 men in total. The original 16 battalions were soon enlarged to 15 infantry regiments of two battalions each between May and June 1941, organised into five divisional commands, some 55,000 enlisted men.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=12}} Support units included 35 light tanks supplied by Italy,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=420}} 10 artillery battalions (equipped with captured Royal Yugoslav Army weapons of Czech origin), a cavalry regiment in [[Zagreb]] and an independent cavalry battalion at [[Sarajevo]]. Two independent motorized infantry battalions were based at Zagreb and Sarajevo respectively.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=13}} Several regiments of Usta\u0161e militia were also formed at this time, which operated under a separate command structure to, and independently from, the Croatian Home Guard, until late 1944.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}} The Home Guard crushed the [[June 1941 uprising in eastern Herzegovina|Serb revolt in Eastern Herzegovina]] in June 1941, and in July they fought in Eastern and Western Bosnia. They fought in Eastern Herzegovina again, when Croatian-Dalmatian and Slavonian battalions reinforced local units.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=13}}\n\nThe Italian High Command assigned 24 divisions and three coastal brigades to occupation duties in Yugoslavia from 1941. These units were located from Slovenia, Croatia and Dalmatia through to Montenegro and Kosovo.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=10}}\n\nFrom 1931\u201339, the Soviet Union had prepared communists for a guerrilla war in Yugoslavia. On the eve of the war, hundreds of future prominent Yugoslav communist leaders completed special \"partisan courses\" organised by the Soviet military intelligence in the Soviet Union and Spain.{{sfn|Timofejev|2011}} [[Operation Barbarossa]], the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Higgins|1966|pages=11\u201359, 98\u2013151}} On the same day, Yugoslav Partisans formed the [[First Sisak Partisan Detachment|1st Sisak Partisan Detachment]], was the first armed anti-fascist resistance unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied Yugoslavia during World War II.{{sfn|Pavli\u010devi\u0107|2007|pages=441\u2013442}} Founded in the [[Brezovica Forest]] near [[Sisak]], Croatia, its creation marked the beginning of anti-Axis resistance in occupied Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Pavli\u010devi\u0107|2007|pages=441\u2013442}}\n\nAfter the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] formally decided to launch an armed uprising on 4 July 1941, a date which was later marked as Fighter's Day \u2013 a public holiday in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. In the village of [[Bela Crkva (Krupanj)|Bela Crkva]], Spanish veteran [[\u017dikica Jovanovi\u0107 \u0160panac]] shot the first bullet of the campaign on 7 July 1941, a date that later became known as the \"Day of Uprising of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]]\". On 10 August 1941 in Stanulovi\u0107, a mountain village, the Partisans formed the Kopaonik Partisan Detachment Headquarters. Their liberated area, consisting of nearby villages and called the \"Miners Republic\", was the first in Yugoslavia, and lasted 42 days. The resistance fighters formally joined the ranks of the Partisans later on.\n\nThe [[Chetnik movement]] was organised after the surrender of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] by some of the remaining Yugoslav soldiers. This force was organised in the [[Ravna Gora (Suvobor)|Ravna Gora]] district of western Serbia under Colonel [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]. However, unlike the Partisans, Mihailovi\u0107's forces were almost entirely ethnic Serbs. He directed his units to arm themselves and await his orders for the final push. Mihailovi\u0107 avoided direct action against the Axis, which he judged were of low strategic importance.\n\nThe royalist [[Chetniks]] (officially the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, JVUO), under the command of General Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107, drew primarily from the scattered remnants of the Royal Yugoslav Army, relying overwhelmingly on the ethnic Serbian population for support. They were formed soon after the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the surrender of the government on 17 April 1941. The Chetniks were initially the only [[resistance movement]] recognized by the [[Yugoslav government-in-exile]] and the Western Allies. The Partisans and Chetniks attempted to cooperate early during the conflict, but this quickly fell apart.\n\n[[File:Ustanak u Jugoslaviji 1941.png|thumb|Uprising in Yugoslavia, September 1941.]]\nIn September 1941, Partisans organised [[sabotage at the General Post Office in Zagreb]].\nAs the levels of resistance to its occupation grew, the Axis Powers responded with numerous minor offensives. There were also [[Seven anti-partisan offensives|seven major Axis operations]] specifically aimed at eliminating all or most Yugoslav Partisan resistance. These major offensives were typically combined efforts by the German [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italy]], Chetniks, the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbian collaborationist government, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungary]].\n\nThe [[Operation Uzice|First Anti-Partisan Offensive]] was the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the \"[[Republic of U\u017eice]]\", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility.\n\nAfter fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailovi\u0107, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs.<ref>Bailey, 1980, P. 80</ref> This however, did not stop the activities of the Partisan resistance, and Chetnik units attacked the Partisans in November 1941, while increasingly receiving supplies and cooperating with the Germans and Italians in this. The British liaison to Mihailovi\u0107 advised London to stop supplying the Chetniks after the U\u017eice attack (see [[First Anti-Partisan Offensive]]), but Britain continued to do so.<ref name=\"lcweb2.loc.gov\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+yu0031) LCWeb2.loc.gov]</ref>\n\nOn 22 December 1941 the Partisans formed the [[1st Proletarian Assault Brigade (Yugoslav Partisans)|1st Proletarian Assault Brigade]] (''1. Proleterska Udarna Brigada'') \u2013 the first regular Partisan military unit capable of operating outside its local area. 22 December became the \"Day of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]]\".\n\n==1942==\n{{one source|section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-602-B1242-25A, Balkan, italienische Sp\u00e4hpanzer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Italian armored cars in the Balkans.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-173-1103-25, Balkan, Beutepanzer H39.jpg|right|thumb|200px|German forces with French-made H39 tanks fording a river.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-161-0256-10, Balkan, Sp\u00e4hpanzer, bulgarische Soldaten.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Yugoslav POWs supervised by Bulgarian soldiers and German armored car.]]\nOn 15 January 1942, the Bulgarian 1st Army, with 3 infantry divisions, transferred to south-eastern Serbia. Headquartered at [[Ni\u0161]], it replaced German divisions needed in Croatia and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=32}}\n\nThe Chetniks initially enjoyed the support of the Western Allies (up to the [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943). In 1942, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' featured an article which praised the \"success\" of Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks and heralded him as the sole defender of freedom in Nazi-occupied Europe.\n\nTito's Partisans fought the Germans more actively during this time. Tito and Mihailovi\u0107 had a bounty of 100,000 [[Reichsmark]]s offered by Germans for their heads. While \"officially\" remaining mortal enemies of the Germans and the [[Usta\u0161e]], the Chetniks were known for making clandestine deals with the Italians. The [[Second Enemy Offensive]] was a coordinated Axis attack conducted in January 1942 against Partisan forces in eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. The Partisan troops once again avoided encirclement and were forced to retreat over the [[Igman]] mountain near [[Sarajevo]].\n\nThe [[Operation Trio|Third Enemy Offensive]], an offensive against Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia, [[Montenegro]], [[Sand\u017eak]] and [[Hercegovina]] which took place in the spring of 1942. It was known as ''Operation TRIO'' by the Germans, and again ended with a timely Partisan escape. This attack is mistakenly identified by some sources as the [[Battle of Kozara]]{{Which|date=June 2019}}, which took place in the summer of 1942.\n\nThe Partisans fought an increasingly successful [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla campaign]] against the Axis occupiers and their [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II#Yugoslavia|local collaborators]], including the Chetniks (which they also considered collaborators). They enjoyed gradually increased levels of success and support of the general populace, and succeeded in controlling large chunks of Yugoslav territory. [[People's committees]] were organised to act as civilian governments in areas of the country liberated by the Partisans. In places, even limited arms industries were set up.\n\nTo gather [[military intelligence|intelligence]], agents of the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were infiltrated into both the Partisans and the Chetniks. The intelligence gathered by liaisons to the resistance groups was crucial to the success of supply missions and was the primary influence on Allied strategy in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The search for intelligence ultimately resulted in the decline of the Chetniks and their eclipse by Tito's Partisans. In 1942, though supplies were limited, token support was sent equally to each. In November 1942, Partisan detachments were officially merged into the People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (''NOV i POJ'').\n[[File:Stahl, Ustase officer and Radic.jpg|thumb|German ''[[General (Germany)|Generalmajor]]'' (Brigadier) Friedrich Stahl stands alongside an [[Usta\u0161e militia|Usta\u0161a]] officer and [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] commander Rade Radi\u0107 in central Bosnia in mid\u20131942.]]\n\n==1943==\n\n===Critical Axis offensives===\nIn the first half of 1943 two Axis offensives came close to defeating the Partisans.  They are known by their German code names [[Case White|Fall Weiss]] ''(Case White)'' and [[Case Black|Fall Schwarz]] ''(Case Black)'', as the Battle of Neretva and the Battle of Sutjeska after the rivers in the areas they were fought, or the Fourth and Fifth Enemy Offensive, respectively, according to former Yugoslav communist historiography.\n\nOn 7 January 1943, the Bulgarian 1st Army also occupied south-west Serbia. Savage pacification measures reduced Partisan activity appreciably. Bulgarian infantry divisions participated in the [[Fifth anti-Partisan Offensive]] as a blocking force of the Partisan escape-route from [[Montenegro]] into [[Serbia]] and in the [[Sixth anti-Partisan Offensive]] in Eastern Bosnia.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=32}}\n\n[[German\u2013Yugoslav Partisan negotiations|Negotiations between Germans and Partisans]] started on 11 March 1943 in [[Gornji Vakuf]], Bosnia. Tito's key officers [[Vladimir Velebit]], [[Ko\u010da Popovi\u0107]] and [[Milovan \u0110ilas]] brought three proposals, first about an exchange of prisoners, second about the implementation of international law on treatment of prisoners and third about political questions.{{sfn|Lekovic|1985|page=83}}  The delegation expressed concerns about the Italian involvement in supplying the Chetnik army and stated that the National Liberation Movement is an independent movement, with no aid from the Soviet Union or the UK.{{sfn|Lekovic|1985|page=86,87}} Somewhat later, \u0110ilas and Velebit were brought to Zagreb to continue the negotiations.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|page=245}}\n\nIn the [[Case White|Fourth Enemy Offensive]], also known as the Battle of the Neretva or ''Fall Weiss'' (Case White), Axis forces pushed Partisan troops to retreat from [[Biha\u0107 Republic|western Bosnia]] to northern [[Herzegovina]], culminating in the Partisan retreat over the [[Neretva]] river. It took place from January to April, 1943.\n\n[[File:Jugoslavija i Evropa maj 1943.jpg|thumb|Partisan liberated territory in Yugoslavia, May 1943.]]\n\nThe [[Case Black|Fifth Enemy Offensive]], also known as the Battle of the Sutjeska or ''Fall Schwarz'' (Case Black), immediately followed the Fourth Offensive and included a complete encirclement of Partisan forces in southeastern Bosnia and northern Montenegro in May and June 1943.\n\n{{quote|In that August of my arrival [1943] there were over 30 enemy divisions on the territory of Jugoslavia, as well as a large number of satellite and police formations of Ustashe and Domobrani (military formations of the puppet Croat State), German Sicherheitsdienst, chetniks, Neditch militia, Ljotitch militia, and others. The partisan movement may have counted up to 150,000 fighting men and women (perhaps five per cent women) in close and inextricable co-operation with several million peasants, the people of the country. Partisan numbers were liable to increase rapidly.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Contact}}}}\n\nThe Croatian Home Guard reached its maximum size at the end of 1943, when it had 130,000 men. It also included an air force, the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] (''Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr\u017eave Hrvatske'', or ZNDH), the backbone of which was provided by 500 former [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers and 1,600 NCOs with 125 aircraft.<ref>Savic, et al., 2002, p. 60</ref> By 1943 the ZNDH was 9,775 strong and equipped with 295 aircraft.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}}\n\n===Italian capitulation and Allied support for the Partisans===\n[[File:Ustanak u Jugoslaviji 1943.png|thumb|Uprising in occupied Yugoslavia after [[capitulation of Italy]], September 1943.]]\n\nOn 8 September 1943, the Italians concluded [[armistice of Cassibile|an armistice with the Allies]], leaving 17 divisions stranded in Yugoslavia. All divisional commanders refused to join the Germans. Two Italian infantry divisions joined the Montenegrin Partisans as complete units, while another joined the Albanian Partisans. Other units surrendered to the Germans to face imprisonment in Germany or summary execution. Others surrendered themselves, arms, ammunition and equipment to Croatian forces or to the Partisans, simply disintegrated, or reached Italy on foot via Trieste or by ship across the Adriatic.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=12}} The Italian [[Governorship of Dalmatia]] was disestablished and the country's possessions were subsequently divided between Germany, which established its [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]], and the Independent State of Croatia, which established the new district of Sidraga-Ravni Kotari. The former Italian kingdoms [[Albania under Nazi Germany|of Albania]] and [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|of Montenegro]] were placed under German occupation.\n\nThe events, which occurred in 1943 would bring about change in the attitude of the Allies. The Germans were executing [[Case Black|Operation Schwarz]] (Battle of Sutjeska, the Fifth anti-Partisan offensive), one of a series of offensives aimed at the resistance fighters, when [[William Deakin|F.W.D. Deakin]] was sent by the British to gather information. His reports contained two important observations. The first was that the Partisans were courageous and aggressive in battling the German [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain]] and 104th Light Division, had suffered significant casualties, and required support. The second observation was that the entire German 1st Mountain Division had transited from the Soviet Union on rail lines through [[Chetniks|Chetnik]]-controlled territory. British intercepts (ULTRA) of German message traffic confirmed Chetnik timidity. Even though today many circumstances, facts, and motivations remain unclear, intelligence reports resulted in increased Allied interest in Yugoslavia air operations and shifted policy.\n\nThe [[Operation Kugelblitz|Sixth Enemy Offensive]] was a series of operations undertaken by the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Usta\u0161e]] after the [[capitulation of Italy]] in an attempt to secure the [[Adriatic]] coast. It took place in the autumn and winter of 1943/1944.\n\nAt this point the Partisans were able to win the moral, as well as limited material support of the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], who until then had supported General [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]'s Chetnik Forces, but were finally convinced of their collaboration by many intelligence-gathering missions dispatched to both sides during the course of the war.\n\nIn September 1943, at Churchill's request, Brigadier General [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]] was parachuted to Tito's headquarters near [[Drvar]] to serve as a permanent, formal liaison to the Partisans. While the Chetniks were still occasionally supplied, the Partisans received the bulk of all future support.<ref>Martin, 1946, p.34</ref>\n\nWhen the [[AVNOJ]] (the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] wartime council in Yugoslavia) was eventually recognized by the Allies, by late 1943, the official recognition of the Partisan [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] soon followed. The [[National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia]] was recognized by the major Allied powers at the [[Tehran Conference]], when United States agreed to the position of other Allied.<ref>Renduli\u0107, Zlatko.

The resolution of a fundamental question, whether the new state remained a monarchy or was to be a republic, was postponed until the end of the war, as was the status of King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]].\n\nSubsequent to switching their support to the Partisans, the Allies set-up the [[RAF Balkan Air Force]] (under the suggestion of Brigadier-General Fitzroy Maclean) with the aim to provide increased supplies and tactical air support for Marshal Tito's Partisan forces.\n\n==1944==\n\n===Last Axis offensive===\nIn January 1944, Tito's forces unsuccessfully attacked [[Banja Luka]].

Up until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will, as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during ''R\u00f6sselsprung'' as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse for the first time, establishing full [[Air supremacy|aerial superiority]]. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.<ref>Ciglic, et al., 2007, p. 113</ref>\n\nThe Yugoslav Partisan movement grew to become the largest resistance force in occupied Europe, with 800,000 men organised in 4 [[field army|field armies]].

This agreement was an attempt to form a new Yugoslav government which would include both the communists and the [[Monarchism|royalists]]. It called for a merge of the Partisan [[Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] (''Antifa\u0161isti\u010dko V(ij)e\u0107e Narodnog Oslobo\u0111enja Jugoslavije'', AVNOJ) and the Government in exile. The Tito-\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 agreement also called on all Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs to join the Partisans. The Partisans were recognized by the Royal Government as Yugoslavia's regular army. Mihajlovi\u0107 and many Chetniks refused to answer the call. The Chetniks were, however, praised for [[Operation Halyard|saving 500 downed Allied pilots]] in 1944; United States President Harry S.

Romanian forces, fighting against Germany, participated in the [[Prague Offensive]]. [[Bulgaria]] quit as well and, on 10 September, declared war on Germany and its remaining allies. The weak divisions sent by the [[Axis powers]] to invade Bulgaria were easily driven back. In Macedonia, the Bulgarian troops, surrounded by German forces and betrayed by high-ranking military commanders, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. In late September 1944 three Bulgarian armies, some 455,000 strong in total led by General Georgi Marinov Mandjev from the village of Goliamo Sharkovo \u2013 Elhovo, entered Yugoslavia with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. Southern and eastern Serbia and Macedonia were liberated within two months and the 130,000-strong [[Bulgarian First Army]] continued to Hungary.\n\nOn 10 September 1944, Bulgaria changed sides and declared war on Germany as an Allied Power. The Germans swiftly disarmed the 1st Occupation Corps of 5 divisions and the 5th Army, despite short-lived resistance by the latter. Survivors retreated to the old borders of Bulgaria. After the occupation of Bulgaria by the Soviet army negotiations between Tito and the Bulgarian Communist leaders were organised, resulting in a military alliance between them. The new Bulgarian People's Army and the Red Army 3rd Ukrainian Front troops were concentrated at the old Bulgarian-Yugoslav border. On 8 October, they entered Yugoslavia. The First and Fourth Bulgarian Armies invaded [[Vardar Macedonia]], and the Second Army south-eastern Serbia. The First Army then swung north with the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front, through eastern Yugoslavia and south-western Hungary, before linking up with the British 8th Army in Austria in May 1945.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=33}}\n\n===Liberation of Belgrade and eastern Yugoslavia===\n[[File:1944 Yugoslavia liberated territories.jpg|thumb|right|Territories under Partisan control, September 1944]]\nConcurrently, with Allied air support and assistance from the Red Army, the Partisans turned their attention to [[Central Serbia]]. The chief objective was to disrupt railroad communications in the valleys of the Vardar and Morava rivers, and prevent Germans from withdrawing their 300,000+ forces from Greece.\n\nThe Allied air forces sent 1,973 aircraft (mostly from the US 15th Air Force) over Yugoslavia, which discharged over 3,000 tons of bombs. On 17 August 1944 Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] offered an amnesty to all collaborators. On 12 September, King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] broadcast a message from London, calling upon all Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to \"join the National Liberation Army under the leadership of Marshal Tito\".  The message had a devastating effect on the morale of the Chetniks. Many of them switched sides to the Partisans.\n\nIn September, the Red Army and the Partisans launched the [[Belgrade Offensive]], and took the city on 20 October. At the onset of winter, the Partisans effectively controlled the entire eastern half of Yugoslavia\u2014Serbia, [[Vardar Macedonia|Macedonia]], Montenegro\u2014as well as most of the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. The Wehrmacht and the forces of the Usta\u0161e-controlled [[Independent State of Croatia]] fortified a [[Syrmian Front|front in Syrmia]] that held through the winter of 1944\u201345 in order to aid the evacuation of German [[Army Group E]] from the Balkans. To raise the number of Partisan troops Tito  again offered the amnesty on 21 November 1944. In November 1944, the units of the Usta\u0161e militia and the Croatian Home Guard were reorganised and combined to form the Army of the Independent State of Croatia.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}}\n\n==1945==\n{{quote|Every German unit which could safely evacuate from Yugoslavia might count itself lucky.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Rules and Reasons}}}}\nThe Germans continued their retreat. Having lost the easier withdrawal route through Serbia, they fought to hold the Syrmian front in order to secure the more difficult passage through Kosovo, Sandzak and Bosnia. They even scored a series of temporary successes against the People's Liberation Army. They left Mostar on 22 February 1945. They did not leave Sarajevo until 15 April. Sarajevo had assumed a last-moment strategic position as the only remaining withdrawal route and was held at substantial cost. In early March the Germans moved troops from southern Bosnia to support an unsuccessful counter-offensive in Hungary, which enabled the NOV to score some successes by attacking the Germans' weakened positions. Although strengthened by Allied aid, a secure rear and mass conscription in areas under their control, the one-time partisans found it difficult to switch to conventional warfare, particularly in the open country west of Belgrade, where the Germans held their own until mid-April in spite of all of the raw and untrained conscripts the NOV hurled in a bloody war of attrition against the Syrmian Front.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|page=258}}\n\nOn 8 March 1945, a coalition Yugoslav government was formed in Belgrade with Tito as Premier and [[Ivan \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107]] as Foreign Minister.\n\n===Partisan general offensive===\nOn 20 March 1945, the Partisans launched a general offensive in the [[Mostar]]-[[Vi\u0161egrad]]-[[Drina River|Drina]] sector. With large swaths of Bosnian, Croatian and Slovenian countryside already under Partisan guerrilla control, the final operations consisted in connecting these territories and capturing major cities and roads. For the general offensive Marshal Josip Broz Tito commanded a Partisan force of about 800,000 men organised into four [[field army|armies]]: the \n* [[1st Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|1st Army]] commanded by [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]], \n* [[2nd Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|2nd Army]] commanded by [[Ko\u010da Popovi\u0107]], \n* [[3rd Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|3rd Army]] commanded by [[Kosta Na\u0111]],  \n* [[4th Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|4th Army]] commanded by [[Petar Drap\u0161in]]. \nIn addition, the Yugoslav Partisans had eight independent army corps (the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and the 10th).\n\nSet against the Yugoslav Partisans was German General [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]] of [[Army Group E]] (''[[Army Group E|Heeresgruppe E]]''). This Army Group had seven army corps : \n* [[XV Mountain Corps (Germany)|XV Mountain Corps]], \n* [[XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps|XV Cossack Corps]], \n* [[XXI Mountain Corps (Germany)|XXI Mountain Corps]], \n* [[XXXIV Corps (Germany)|XXXIV Infantry Corps]], \n* [[LXIX Corps (Germany)|LXIX Infantry Corps]], \n* [[LXXXXVII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|LXXXXVII Infantry Corps]]. \nThese corps included seventeen weakened divisions ([[1st Cossack Division|1st Cossack]], 2nd Cossack, [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen|7th SS]], [[11th Luftwaffe Field Division|11th]] [[Luftwaffe Field Division]], 22nd, [[41st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|41st]], 104th, 117th, 138th, [[181st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|181st]], 188th,  237th, [[297th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|297th]], [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th Croat]], [[373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|373rd Croat]], [[392nd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|392nd Croat]] and the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Ukrainian)|14th SS Ukrainian Division]]). In addition to the seven corps, the Axis had remnant naval and [[Luftwaffe]] forces, under constant attack by the British [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Air Force]] and [[United States Air Force]].{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=9}}\n[[File:Royal Air Force- Italy, the Balkans and South-east Europe, 1942-1945.

There were also several armoured units. From early 1945, the Croatian Divisions were allocated to various German corps and by March 1945 were holding the Southern Front.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}} Securing the rear areas were some 32,000 men of the Croatian [[gendarmerie]] (''Hrvatsko Oruznistvo''), organised into 5 Police Volunteer Regiments plus 15 independent battalions, equipped with standard light infantry weapons, including mortars.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=30}}\n\nThe [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] (''Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr\u017eave Hrvatske'', or ZNDH) and the units of the [[Croatian Air Force Legion]] (''Hrvatska Zrakoplovna Legija'', or HZL), returned from service on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] provided some level of air support (attack, fighter and transport) right up until May 1945, encountering and sometimes defeating opposing aircraft from the British [[Royal Air Force]], [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]]. Although 1944 had been a catastrophic year for the ZNDH, with aircraft losses amounting to 234, primarily on the ground, it entered 1945 with 196 machines. Further deliveries of new aircraft from Germany continued in the early months of 1945 to replace losses. By 10 March, the ZNDH had 23 [[Messerschmitt 109]] G&Ks, three [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]], six [[Fiat G.50]], and two [[Messerschmitt 110]] G fighters.  The final deliveries of up-to-date German [[Messerschmitt 109]] G and K fighter aircraft were still taking place in March 1945.<ref>Savic & Ciglic, 2002, p. 70</ref> and the ZNDH still had 176 aircraft on its strength in April 1945.<ref>Ciglic, et al., 2007, p. 150</ref>\n\nBetween 30 March and 8 April 1945, General Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks mounted a final attempt to establish themselves as a credible force fighting the Axis in Yugoslavia. The Chetniks under [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107]] fought a combination of Usta\u0161a and Croatian Home Guard forces in the [[Battle on Lijev\u010da field]]. In late March 1945 elite NDH Army units were withdrawn from the Syrmian front to destroy Djurisic's Chetniks trying to make their way across the northern NDH.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|page=256}} The battle was fought near Banja Luka in what was then the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and ended in a decisive victory for the Independent State of Croatia forces.\n\nSerbian units included the remnants of the [[Serbian State Guard]] and the [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] from the [[Serbian Military Administration]]. There were even some units of the [[Slovene Home Guard]] (''Slovensko domobranstvo'', SD) still intact in [[Slovenia]].{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=22}}\n\nBy the end of March, 1945, it was obvious to the Croatian Army Command that, although the front remained intact, they would eventually be defeated by sheer lack of ammunition. For this reason, the decision was made to retreat into Austria, in order to surrender to the British forces advancing north from Italy.{{sfn|Shaw|1973|page=101}} The German Army was in the process of disintegration and the supply system lay in ruins.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ambrose, S.|title=The Victors \u2013 The Men of World War II|url=https://archive.org/details/victorseisenhowe00step|url-access=registration|location=London|year=1998|isbn= 978-0-684-85629-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/victorseisenhowe00step/page/335 335]}}</ref>\n\n[[Biha\u0107]] was liberated by the Partisans the same day that the general offensive was launched.

By 20 April, Drap\u0161in liberated [[Lika]] and the [[Croatian Littoral]], including the islands, and reached the old Yugoslav border with Italy. On 1 May, after capturing the Italian territories of [[Rijeka]] and [[Istria]] from the German LXXXXVII Corps, the Yugoslav 4th Army beat the western Allies to [[Trieste]] by one day.\n\nThe Yugoslav 2nd Army, under the command of [[Ko\u010da Popovi\u0107]], forced a crossing of the [[Bosna River]] on 5 April, capturing [[Doboj]], and reached the [[Una (Sava)|Una River]].  On 6 April, the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th Corps of the Yugoslav Partisans took [[Sarajevo]] from the German XXI Corps. On 12 April, the Yugoslav 3rd Army, under the command of [[Kosta Na\u0111]], forced a crossing of the [[Drava]] river. The 3rd Army then fanned out through [[Podravina]], reached a point north of Zagreb, and crossed the old Austrian border with Yugoslavia in the [[Dravograd]] sector. The 3rd Army closed the ring around the enemy forces when its advanced motorized detachments linked up with detachments of the 4th Army in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]].\n\nAlso, on 12 April, the Yugoslav 1st Army, under the command of [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]] penetrated the fortified front of the German XXXIV Corps in Syrmia. By 22 April, the 1st Army had smashed the fortifications and was advancing towards Zagreb.\n\nThe long-drawn out liberation of western Yugoslavia caused more victims among the population. The breakthrough of the Syrmian front on 12 April was, in [[Milovan \u0110ilas]]'s words, \"the greatest and bloodiest battle our army had ever fought\", and it would not have been possible had it not been for Soviet instructors and arms.{{sfn|\u0110ilas|1977|page=440}}\nBy the time General [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]]'s NOV units had reached Zagreb, on 9 May 1945, they had perhaps lost as many as 36,000 dead.

On 8 May 1945, the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germans surrendered unconditionally]] and the [[Victory in Europe Day|war in Europe officially ended]]. The Italians had quit the war in 1943, the Bulgarians in 1944, and the Hungarians earlier in 1945. Despite the German capitulation, however, sporadic fighting still took place in Yugoslavia. On 7 May, [[Zagreb]] was evacuated, on 9 May, [[Maribor]] and [[Ljubljana]] were captured by the Partisans, and General [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], Commander-in-Chief of [[Army Group E]] was forced to sign the total surrender of the forces under his command at Topol\u0161ica, near [[Velenje]], Slovenia, on Wednesday 9 May 1945. Only the Croatian and other anti-Partisan forces remained.\n\nFrom 10 to 15 May, the Yugoslav Partisans continued to face resistance from Croatian, and other anti-Partisan forces throughout the rest of Croatia and Slovenia. The [[Battle of Poljana]] started on 14 May, ending on 15 May 1945 at Poljana, near [[Prevalje]] in Slovenia. It was the culmination and last of a series of battles between Yugoslav Partisans and a large (in excess of 30,000) mixed column of German Army (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'') soldiers together with Croatian Usta\u0161e, Croatian Home Guard, Slovenian Home Guard, and other anti-Partisan forces who were attempting to retreat to Austria.

The representatives of the Independent State of Croatia attempted to negotiate a surrender to the British under the terms of the [[Geneva Convention]] that they had joined in 1943, and were recognised by it as a \"belligerent\", but were ignored.{{sfn|Shaw|1973|page=101}} Most of the people in the column were turned over to the Yugoslav government as part of what is sometimes referred to as [[Operation Keelhaul]].

A few days later he agreed to withdraw them. By 20 May, Yugoslav troops in Austria had begun to withdraw. On 8 June, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia agreed on the control of Trieste.

The new comprehensive research also included Slovenes killed by the Partisan resistance, both in battle (members of collaborationist and anti-Communist units), and civilians (around 4,000 between 1941 and 1945). Furthermore, the new estimates includes all the Slovenians from Nazi-occupied Slovenia who were drafted in the Wehrmacht and died either in battle or in prisoner camps during the war. The figure also includes the Slovenes from the [[Julian March]] who died in the Italian Army (1940\u201343), those from [[Prekmurje]] who died in the Hungarian Army, and those who fought and died in various Allied (mostly British) units. The figure does not include victims from [[Venetian Slovenia]] (except of those who joined the Slovenian Partisan units), nor does it include the victims among [[Carinthian Slovenes]] (again with the exception of those fighting in the Partisan units) and [[Hungarian Slovenes]]. 47% percent of casualties during the war were partisans, 33% were civilians (of which 82% were killed by Axis powers or Slovene home guard), and 20% were members of the Slovene home guard.<ref>Delo, ''Sobotna priloga'', 30 October 2010.</ref>\n\n;Territory of the NDH\nAccording to \u017derjavi\u0107's research on the losses of the Serbs in the NDH, 82,000 died as members of the Yugoslav Partisans, and 23,000 as Chetniks and Axis collaborators. Of the civilian casualties, 78,000 were killed by the Usta\u0161e in direct terror and in camps, 45,000 by German forces, 15,000 by Italian forces, 34,000 in battles between the Usta\u0161e, the Chetniks, and the Partisans, and 25,000 died of typhoid.

Of the total Croat and Bosniak civilian casualties in the NDH, his research showed that 41,000 civilian deaths (18,000+ Croats and 20,000+ Bosniaks) were caused by the Chetniks, 24,000 by the Usta\u0161e (17,000 Croats and 7,000 Bosniaks), 16,000 by the Partisans (14,000 Croats and 2,000 Bosniaks), 11,000 by German forces (7,000 Croats and 4,000 Bosniaks), 8,000 by Italian forces (5,000 Croats and 3,000 Bosniaks), while 12,000 died abroad (10,000 Croats and 2,000 Bosniaks).{{sfn|Geiger|2012|pp=117-118}}\n\nIndividual researchers who assert the inevitability of using identification of casualties and fatalities by individual names have raised serious objections to \u017derjavi\u0107's calculations/estimates of human losses by using standard statistical methods and consolidation of data from various sources, pointing out that such an approach is insufficient and unreliable in determining the number and character of casualties and fatalities, as well as the affiliation of the perpetrators of the crimes.{{sfn|Geiger|2012|p=103}}\n\nIn Croatia, the Commission for the Identification of War and Post-War Victims of the Second World War was active from 1991 until the Seventh Government of the republic, under Prime Minister [[Ivica Ra\u010dan]] ended the commission in 2002.<ref>[http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/308886.html 66 7.6.2002 Zakon o prestanku va\u017eenja Zakona o utvr\u0111ivanju ratnih i poratnih \u017ertava II. svjetskog rata], narodne-novine.nn.hr</ref> In the 2000s, concealed mass grave commissions were established in both [[Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia|Serbia]] to document and excavate mass graves from the Second World War.\n\n===German casualties===\nAccording to German casualty lists quoted by [[The Times]] for 30 July 1945, from documents found amongst the personal effects of General [[Hermann Reinecke]], head of the Public Relations Department of the German High Command, total German casualties in the Balkans amounted to 24,000 killed and 12,000 missing, no figure being mentioned for wounded.

Subsequently, a guerrilla [[liberation war]] was fought against the [[Axis powers|Axis]] occupying forces and their locally established puppet regimes, including the fascist [[Independent State of Croatia]] and the [[Government of National Salvation]] in the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied territory of Serbia]], by the [[KPJ|Communist]]-led republican [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. Simultaneously, a multi-side [[civil war]] was waged between the Yugoslav communist Partisans, the Serbian royalist [[Chetniks]], the Croatian fascist [[Ustashe]] and [[Croatian Home Guard (World War II)|Home Guard]], [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] and [[Serbian State Guard|State Guard]], as well as [[Slovene Home Guard]] troops.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pages=145\u2013155}}\n\nBoth the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chetnik movement initially resisted the occupation. However, after 1941, Chetniks extensively and systematically collaborated with the [[Military history of Italy during World War II|Italian occupation forces]] until the [[Italian capitulation]], and thereon also with [[Wehrmacht|German]] and Ustashe forces.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=145-155}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=246}} The Axis mounted a [[Seven anti-Partisan offensives|series of offensives]] intended to destroy the Partisans, coming close to doing so in the [[Battle of Neretva]] and [[Battle of Sutjeska]] in the spring and summer of 1943.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the Partisans remained a credible fighting force, with [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|their organisation]] gaining recognition from the Western Allies at the [[Tehran Conference#Results|Tehran Conference]] and laying the foundations for the [[SFRY|post-war Yugoslav state]]. With support in logistics and air power from the Western Allies, and [[Red Army|Soviet ground troops]] in the [[Belgrade Offensive]], the Partisans eventually gained control of the entire country and of the border regions of [[Trieste#World War II and aftermath|Trieste]] and [[Carinthia (state)#From 1920 to the Present|Carinthia]].\n\nThe [[World War II casualties|human cost of the war]] was enormous. The number of war victims is still in dispute, but is generally agreed to have been at least one million. Non-combat victims included the majority of the country's [[Jewish]] population, many of whom perished in [[concentration camp|concentration]] and [[extermination camp]]s (e.g. [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], [[Banjica concentration camp|Banjica]]) run by the client regimes.\n\nThe Ustashe regime (mostly [[Croats]], but also [[Bosniaks|Muslims]] and others) committed [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide against Serbs]], Jews, [[Romani people|Roma]] and anti-Fascist [[Croats]]. The Chetniks (mostly [[Serbs]], but also [[Montenegrins]] and others) pursued [[Chetnik war crimes in World War II|genocide]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TtWycwryensC&pg=PA430&lpg=PA430&dq=chetnik+genocide#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-0-203-89043-1|title=Century of genocide: critical essays and eyewitness accounts|page=430|author1=Samuel Totten|author2=William S.

In the same time, the country was destabilized by internal tensions, as Croatian leaders demanded a greater level of autonomy. Stojadinovi\u0107 was sacked by the regent [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]] in 1939 and replaced by [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]], who negotiated a compromise with Croatian leader [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]] in 1939, resulting in the formation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]].\n\nHowever, rather than reducing tensions, the agreement only reinforced the crisis in the country's governance.{{sfn|Trbovich|pages=131\u2013132}} Groups from both sides of the political spectrum were not satisfied: the pro-fascist [[Usta\u0161e]] sought an independent Croatia allied with the [[Axis powers|Axis]], Serbian public and military circles preferred alliance with the Western European empires, while the then-banned [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] saw the [[Soviet Union]] as a natural ally.\n\nAfter the [[fall of France]] to [[Nazi Germany]] in May 1940, the UK was the only empire in conflict with the Axis powers, and [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]] and the government saw no way of saving [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] except through adopting policies of accommodation with the Axis powers. Although [[Hitler]] was not particularly interested in creating another front in the [[Balkans]], and Yugoslavia itself remained at peace during the first year of the war, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy had [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded Albania]] in April 1939 and launched the rather unsuccessful [[Italo-Greek War]] in October 1940. These events resulted in Yugoslavia's geographical isolation from potential [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] support. The government tried to negotiate with the Axis on cooperation with as few concessions as possible, while attempting secret negotiations with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Soviet Union]], but those moves would fail to keep the country out of the war.{{sfn|Lampe|page=198}} A secret mission to the US, led by the influential Serbian-Jewish Captain [[David Albala]] with the purpose of obtaining funding to buy arms for the expected invasion went nowhere, while [[Stalin]] expelled Yugoslav Ambassador Gavrilovic just one month after agreeing a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"Gorodetsky2002\">{{cite book|author=Gabriel Gorodetsky|title=Stafford Cripps' Mission to Moscow, 1940-42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wd0hGHrq7d4C&pg=PA130|date=8 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52220-5|pages=130\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==1941==\nHaving steadily fallen within the orbit of the Axis during 1940 after events such as the [[Second Vienna Award]], Yugoslavia followed [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and formally joined the Axis powers by signing the [[Tripartite Pact]] on 25 March 1941.

The [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] lasted little more than ten days, ending with the unconditional surrender of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] on 17 April. Besides being hopelessly ill-equipped when compared to the German Army (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]''), the Yugoslav army attempted to defend all borders but only managed to thinly spread the limited resources available. Also, large numbers of the population refused to fight, instead welcoming the Germans as liberators from government oppression. However, as this meant each individual ethnic group would turn to movements opposed to the unity promoted by the South Slavic state, two different concepts of resistance emerged, the royalist [[Chetniks]], and the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|page=26}}\n\nTwo of the principal constituent national groups, Slovenes and Croats, were not prepared to fight in defense of a Yugoslav state with a continued [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty|Serb monarchy]]. The only effective opposition to the invasion was from units wholly from Serbia itself.{{sfn|Shaw|1973|page=92}} The Serbian General Staff was united on the question of Yugoslavia as a \"Greater Serbia\" ruled, in one way or another, by Serbia. On the eve of the invasion, there were 165 generals on the Yugoslav active list. Of these, all but four were Serbs.{{sfn|Shaw|1973|page=89}}\n\nThe terms of the capitulation were extremely severe, as the Axis proceeded to dismember Yugoslavia. Germany annexed northern [[Slovenia]], while retaining [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|direct occupation over a rump Serbian state]], and considerable influence over its newly created [[puppet state]], the [[Independent State of Croatia]], which extended over much of today's [[Croatia]] and contained all of modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Mussolini's Italy gained the remainder of Slovenia, [[Kosovo]], coastal and inland areas of the [[Croatian Littoral]] and large chunks of the coastal [[Dalmatia]] region (along with nearly all of the [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]] islands and the [[Bay of Kotor]]). It also gained control over the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]], and was granted the kingship in the Independent State of Croatia, though wielding little real power within it; although it did (alongside Germany) maintain a de facto zone of influence within the borders of the [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]]. [[Kingdom of Hungary (Regency)|Hungary]] dispatched the [[Hungarian Third Army]] to [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|occupy Vojvodina]] in northern Serbia, and later [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|forcibly annexed sections of Baranja, Ba\u010dka, Me\u0111imurje, and Prekmurje]].<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html Hungary profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203003152/http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html |date=3 February 2007 }}, Shoah Foundation Institute Visual History Archive; usc.edu; accessed 4 December 2015.</ref>\n\n[[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|The Bulgarian army]] moved in on 19 April 1941, occupying nearly all of modern-day [[North Macedonia]] and some districts of eastern Serbia which, with Greek western Thrace and eastern Macedonia (the Aegean Province), were annexed by Bulgaria on 14 May.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=24}}\n\nThe [[Yugoslav government-in-exile|government in exile]] was now only recognized by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]].{{sfn|Talmon|1998|page=294}} The [[Axis powers|Axis]] had recognized the territorial acquisitions of their allied states.{{sfn|Thomas|1995}}{{sfn|Lemkin|2008|pages=241\u201364}}\n\n===Early resistance===\nVarious military formations more or less linked to the general liberation movement were involved in armed confrontations with Axis forces which erupted in various areas of Yugoslavia in the ensuing weeks. {{quote|In the beginning there had been two resistance movements in Yugoslavia, the Chetniks and the Partisans. The resistance of the Chetniks had lasted only until the autumn of 1941, their leaders then going over to the enemy or returning to passivity.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Introduction}}}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0723, Marburg-Drau, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Maribor]], Yugoslavia in 1941. He later ordered his officials \"to make these lands German again\".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=85}}]]\nFrom the start, the Yugoslav resistance forces consisted of two factions: the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], a communist-led movement propagating pan-Yugoslav tolerance (\"[[brotherhood and unity]]\") and incorporating republican, left-wing and liberal elements of Yugoslav politics, on one hand, and the [[Chetniks]], a conservative royalist and nationalist force, enjoying support almost exclusively from the [[Serbs|Serbian]] population in occupied Yugoslavia, on the other hand. Initially the Chetniks received recognition from the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], while the Partisans were supported by the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nAt the very beginning, the Partisan forces were relatively small, poorly armed, and without any infrastructure. But they had two major advantages over other military and [[paramilitary]] formations in former Yugoslavia:  the first and most immediate advantage was a small but valuable cadre of [[Spanish Civil War]] veterans. Unlike some of the other military and paramilitary formations, these veterans had experience with a modern war fought in circumstances quite similar to those found in World War II Yugoslavia. In Slovenia, the Partisans likewise drew on the experienced [[TIGR]] members to train troops.\n\nTheir other major advantage, which became more apparent in later stages of War, was in the Partisans being founded on a communist ideology rather than [[ethnicity]]. Therefore, they won support that crossed national lines, meaning they could expect at least some levels of support in almost any corner of the country, unlike other paramilitary formations limited to territories with Croat or Serb majority. This allowed their units to be more mobile and fill their ranks with a larger pool of potential recruits.\n\nAlthough the activity of the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] Partisans were part of the Yugoslav People's Liberation War, the specific conditions in Macedonia and Slovenia, due to the strong [[Autonomism (political doctrine)|autonomist]] tendencies of the local communists, led to the creation of separate sub-armies called the [[People's Liberation Army of Macedonia]], and [[Slovene Partisans]] led by [[Liberation Front of the Slovene People]], respectively.\n\nThe most numerous local force, besides the four second-line German Wehrmacht infantry divisions assigned to occupation duties was the [[Croatian Home Guard (World War II)|Croatian Home Guard]] (''Hrvatsko domobranstvo''), founded in April 1941, a few days after the founding of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) itself. It was done with the authorisation of German occupation authorities. The task of the new Croatian armed forces was to defend the new state against both foreign and domestic enemies.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=419}}\n\nThe Croatian Home Guard was originally limited to 16 infantry [[battalion]]s and 2 cavalry [[Squadron (army)|squadrons]] \u2013 16,000 men in total. The original 16 battalions were soon enlarged to 15 infantry regiments of two battalions each between May and June 1941, organised into five divisional commands, some 55,000 enlisted men.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=12}} Support units included 35 light tanks supplied by Italy,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=420}} 10 artillery battalions (equipped with captured Royal Yugoslav Army weapons of Czech origin), a cavalry regiment in [[Zagreb]] and an independent cavalry battalion at [[Sarajevo]]. Two independent motorized infantry battalions were based at Zagreb and Sarajevo respectively.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=13}} Several regiments of Usta\u0161e militia were also formed at this time, which operated under a separate command structure to, and independently from, the Croatian Home Guard, until late 1944.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}} The Home Guard crushed the [[June 1941 uprising in eastern Herzegovina|Serb revolt in Eastern Herzegovina]] in June 1941, and in July they fought in Eastern and Western Bosnia. They fought in Eastern Herzegovina again, when Croatian-Dalmatian and Slavonian battalions reinforced local units.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=13}}\n\nThe Italian High Command assigned 24 divisions and three coastal brigades to occupation duties in Yugoslavia from 1941. These units were located from Slovenia, Croatia and Dalmatia through to Montenegro and Kosovo.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=10}}\n\nFrom 1931\u201339, the Soviet Union had prepared communists for a guerrilla war in Yugoslavia. On the eve of the war, hundreds of future prominent Yugoslav communist leaders completed special \"partisan courses\" organised by the Soviet military intelligence in the Soviet Union and Spain.{{sfn|Timofejev|2011}} [[Operation Barbarossa]], the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Higgins|1966|pages=11\u201359, 98\u2013151}} On the same day, Yugoslav Partisans formed the [[First Sisak Partisan Detachment|1st Sisak Partisan Detachment]], was the first armed anti-fascist resistance unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied Yugoslavia during World War II.{{sfn|Pavli\u010devi\u0107|2007|pages=441\u2013442}} Founded in the [[Brezovica Forest]] near [[Sisak]], Croatia, its creation marked the beginning of anti-Axis resistance in occupied Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Pavli\u010devi\u0107|2007|pages=441\u2013442}}\n\nAfter the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] formally decided to launch an armed uprising on 4 July 1941, a date which was later marked as Fighter's Day \u2013 a public holiday in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. In the village of [[Bela Crkva (Krupanj)|Bela Crkva]], Spanish veteran [[\u017dikica Jovanovi\u0107 \u0160panac]] shot the first bullet of the campaign on 7 July 1941, a date that later became known as the \"Day of Uprising of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]]\". On 10 August 1941 in Stanulovi\u0107, a mountain village, the Partisans formed the Kopaonik Partisan Detachment Headquarters. Their liberated area, consisting of nearby villages and called the \"Miners Republic\", was the first in Yugoslavia, and lasted 42 days. The resistance fighters formally joined the ranks of the Partisans later on.\n\nThe [[Chetnik movement]] was organised after the surrender of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] by some of the remaining Yugoslav soldiers. This force was organised in the [[Ravna Gora (Suvobor)|Ravna Gora]] district of western Serbia under Colonel [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]. However, unlike the Partisans, Mihailovi\u0107's forces were almost entirely ethnic Serbs. He directed his units to arm themselves and await his orders for the final push. Mihailovi\u0107 avoided direct action against the Axis, which he judged were of low strategic importance.\n\nThe royalist [[Chetniks]] (officially the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, JVUO), under the command of General Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107, drew primarily from the scattered remnants of the Royal Yugoslav Army, relying overwhelmingly on the ethnic Serbian population for support. They were formed soon after the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the surrender of the government on 17 April 1941. The Chetniks were initially the only [[resistance movement]] recognized by the [[Yugoslav government-in-exile]] and the Western Allies. The Partisans and Chetniks attempted to cooperate early during the conflict, but this quickly fell apart.\n\n[[File:Ustanak u Jugoslaviji 1941.png|thumb|Uprising in Yugoslavia, September 1941.]]\nIn September 1941, Partisans organised [[sabotage at the General Post Office in Zagreb]].\nAs the levels of resistance to its occupation grew, the Axis Powers responded with numerous minor offensives. There were also [[Seven anti-partisan offensives|seven major Axis operations]] specifically aimed at eliminating all or most Yugoslav Partisan resistance. These major offensives were typically combined efforts by the German [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italy]], Chetniks, the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbian collaborationist government, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungary]].\n\nThe [[Operation Uzice|First Anti-Partisan Offensive]] was the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the \"[[Republic of U\u017eice]]\", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility.\n\nAfter fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailovi\u0107, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs.<ref>Bailey, 1980, P. 80</ref> This however, did not stop the activities of the Partisan resistance, and Chetnik units attacked the Partisans in November 1941, while increasingly receiving supplies and cooperating with the Germans and Italians in this. The British liaison to Mihailovi\u0107 advised London to stop supplying the Chetniks after the U\u017eice attack (see [[First Anti-Partisan Offensive]]), but Britain continued to do so.<ref name=\"lcweb2.loc.gov\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+yu0031) LCWeb2.loc.gov]</ref>\n\nOn 22 December 1941 the Partisans formed the [[1st Proletarian Assault Brigade (Yugoslav Partisans)|1st Proletarian Assault Brigade]] (''1. Proleterska Udarna Brigada'') \u2013 the first regular Partisan military unit capable of operating outside its local area. 22 December became the \"Day of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]]\".\n\n==1942==\n{{one source|section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-602-B1242-25A, Balkan, italienische Sp\u00e4hpanzer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Italian armored cars in the Balkans.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-173-1103-25, Balkan, Beutepanzer H39.jpg|right|thumb|200px|German forces with French-made H39 tanks fording a river.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-161-0256-10, Balkan, Sp\u00e4hpanzer, bulgarische Soldaten.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Yugoslav POWs supervised by Bulgarian soldiers and German armored car.]]\nOn 15 January 1942, the Bulgarian 1st Army, with 3 infantry divisions, transferred to south-eastern Serbia. Headquartered at [[Ni\u0161]], it replaced German divisions needed in Croatia and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=32}}\n\nThe Chetniks initially enjoyed the support of the Western Allies (up to the [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943). In 1942, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' featured an article which praised the \"success\" of Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks and heralded him as the sole defender of freedom in Nazi-occupied Europe.\n\nTito's Partisans fought the Germans more actively during this time. Tito and Mihailovi\u0107 had a bounty of 100,000 [[Reichsmark]]s offered by Germans for their heads. While \"officially\" remaining mortal enemies of the Germans and the [[Usta\u0161e]], the Chetniks were known for making clandestine deals with the Italians. The [[Second Enemy Offensive]] was a coordinated Axis attack conducted in January 1942 against Partisan forces in eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. The Partisan troops once again avoided encirclement and were forced to retreat over the [[Igman]] mountain near [[Sarajevo]].\n\nThe [[Operation Trio|Third Enemy Offensive]], an offensive against Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia, [[Montenegro]], [[Sand\u017eak]] and [[Hercegovina]] which took place in the spring of 1942. It was known as ''Operation TRIO'' by the Germans, and again ended with a timely Partisan escape. This attack is mistakenly identified by some sources as the [[Battle of Kozara]]{{Which|date=June 2019}}, which took place in the summer of 1942.\n\nThe Partisans fought an increasingly successful [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla campaign]] against the Axis occupiers and their [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II#Yugoslavia|local collaborators]], including the Chetniks (which they also considered collaborators). They enjoyed gradually increased levels of success and support of the general populace, and succeeded in controlling large chunks of Yugoslav territory. [[People's committees]] were organised to act as civilian governments in areas of the country liberated by the Partisans. In places, even limited arms industries were set up.\n\nTo gather [[military intelligence|intelligence]], agents of the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were infiltrated into both the Partisans and the Chetniks. The intelligence gathered by liaisons to the resistance groups was crucial to the success of supply missions and was the primary influence on Allied strategy in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The search for intelligence ultimately resulted in the decline of the Chetniks and their eclipse by Tito's Partisans. In 1942, though supplies were limited, token support was sent equally to each. In November 1942, Partisan detachments were officially merged into the People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (''NOV i POJ'').\n[[File:Stahl, Ustase officer and Radic.jpg|thumb|German ''[[General (Germany)|Generalmajor]]'' (Brigadier) Friedrich Stahl stands alongside an [[Usta\u0161e militia|Usta\u0161a]] officer and [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] commander Rade Radi\u0107 in central Bosnia in mid\u20131942.]]\n\n==1943==\n\n===Critical Axis offensives===\nIn the first half of 1943 two Axis offensives came close to defeating the Partisans.  They are known by their German code names [[Case White|Fall Weiss]] ''(Case White)'' and [[Case Black|Fall Schwarz]] ''(Case Black)'', as the Battle of Neretva and the Battle of Sutjeska after the rivers in the areas they were fought, or the Fourth and Fifth Enemy Offensive, respectively, according to former Yugoslav communist historiography.\n\nOn 7 January 1943, the Bulgarian 1st Army also occupied south-west Serbia. Savage pacification measures reduced Partisan activity appreciably. Bulgarian infantry divisions participated in the [[Fifth anti-Partisan Offensive]] as a blocking force of the Partisan escape-route from [[Montenegro]] into [[Serbia]] and in the [[Sixth anti-Partisan Offensive]] in Eastern Bosnia.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=32}}\n\n[[German\u2013Yugoslav Partisan negotiations|Negotiations between Germans and Partisans]] started on 11 March 1943 in [[Gornji Vakuf]], Bosnia. Tito's key officers [[Vladimir Velebit]], [[Ko\u010da Popovi\u0107]] and [[Milovan \u0110ilas]] brought three proposals, first about an exchange of prisoners, second about the implementation of international law on treatment of prisoners and third about political questions.{{sfn|Lekovic|1985|page=83}}  The delegation expressed concerns about the Italian involvement in supplying the Chetnik army and stated that the National Liberation Movement is an independent movement, with no aid from the Soviet Union or the UK.{{sfn|Lekovic|1985|page=86,87}} Somewhat later, \u0110ilas and Velebit were brought to Zagreb to continue the negotiations.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|page=245}}\n\nIn the [[Case White|Fourth Enemy Offensive]], also known as the Battle of the Neretva or ''Fall Weiss'' (Case White), Axis forces pushed Partisan troops to retreat from [[Biha\u0107 Republic|western Bosnia]] to northern [[Herzegovina]], culminating in the Partisan retreat over the [[Neretva]] river. It took place from January to April, 1943.\n\n[[File:Jugoslavija i Evropa maj 1943.jpg|thumb|Partisan liberated territory in Yugoslavia, May 1943.]]\n\nThe [[Case Black|Fifth Enemy Offensive]], also known as the Battle of the Sutjeska or ''Fall Schwarz'' (Case Black), immediately followed the Fourth Offensive and included a complete encirclement of Partisan forces in southeastern Bosnia and northern Montenegro in May and June 1943.\n\n{{quote|In that August of my arrival [1943] there were over 30 enemy divisions on the territory of Jugoslavia, as well as a large number of satellite and police formations of Ustashe and Domobrani (military formations of the puppet Croat State), German Sicherheitsdienst, chetniks, Neditch militia, Ljotitch militia, and others. The partisan movement may have counted up to 150,000 fighting men and women (perhaps five per cent women) in close and inextricable co-operation with several million peasants, the people of the country. Partisan numbers were liable to increase rapidly.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Contact}}}}\n\nThe Croatian Home Guard reached its maximum size at the end of 1943, when it had 130,000 men. It also included an air force, the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] (''Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr\u017eave Hrvatske'', or ZNDH), the backbone of which was provided by 500 former [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers and 1,600 NCOs with 125 aircraft.<ref>Savic, et al., 2002, p. 60</ref> By 1943 the ZNDH was 9,775 strong and equipped with 295 aircraft.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}}\n\n===Italian capitulation and Allied support for the Partisans===\n[[File:Ustanak u Jugoslaviji 1943.png|thumb|Uprising in occupied Yugoslavia after [[capitulation of Italy]], September 1943.]]\n\nOn 8 September 1943, the Italians concluded [[armistice of Cassibile|an armistice with the Allies]], leaving 17 divisions stranded in Yugoslavia. All divisional commanders refused to join the Germans. Two Italian infantry divisions joined the Montenegrin Partisans as complete units, while another joined the Albanian Partisans. Other units surrendered to the Germans to face imprisonment in Germany or summary execution. Others surrendered themselves, arms, ammunition and equipment to Croatian forces or to the Partisans, simply disintegrated, or reached Italy on foot via Trieste or by ship across the Adriatic.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=12}} The Italian [[Governorship of Dalmatia]] was disestablished and the country's possessions were subsequently divided between Germany, which established its [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]], and the Independent State of Croatia, which established the new district of Sidraga-Ravni Kotari. The former Italian kingdoms [[Albania under Nazi Germany|of Albania]] and [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|of Montenegro]] were placed under German occupation.\n\nThe events, which occurred in 1943 would bring about change in the attitude of the Allies. The Germans were executing [[Case Black|Operation Schwarz]] (Battle of Sutjeska, the Fifth anti-Partisan offensive), one of a series of offensives aimed at the resistance fighters, when [[William Deakin|F.W.D. Deakin]] was sent by the British to gather information. His reports contained two important observations. The first was that the Partisans were courageous and aggressive in battling the German [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain]] and 104th Light Division, had suffered significant casualties, and required support. The second observation was that the entire German 1st Mountain Division had transited from the Soviet Union on rail lines through [[Chetniks|Chetnik]]-controlled territory. British intercepts (ULTRA) of German message traffic confirmed Chetnik timidity. Even though today many circumstances, facts, and motivations remain unclear, intelligence reports resulted in increased Allied interest in Yugoslavia air operations and shifted policy.\n\nThe [[Operation Kugelblitz|Sixth Enemy Offensive]] was a series of operations undertaken by the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Usta\u0161e]] after the [[capitulation of Italy]] in an attempt to secure the [[Adriatic]] coast. It took place in the autumn and winter of 1943/1944.\n\nAt this point the Partisans were able to win the moral, as well as limited material support of the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], who until then had supported General [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]'s Chetnik Forces, but were finally convinced of their collaboration by many intelligence-gathering missions dispatched to both sides during the course of the war.\n\nIn September 1943, at Churchill's request, Brigadier General [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]] was parachuted to Tito's headquarters near [[Drvar]] to serve as a permanent, formal liaison to the Partisans. While the Chetniks were still occasionally supplied, the Partisans received the bulk of all future support.<ref>Martin, 1946, p.34</ref>\n\nWhen the [[AVNOJ]] (the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] wartime council in Yugoslavia) was eventually recognized by the Allies, by late 1943, the official recognition of the Partisan [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] soon followed. The [[National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia]] was recognized by the major Allied powers at the [[Tehran Conference]], when United States agreed to the position of other Allied.<ref>Renduli\u0107, Zlatko.

The resolution of a fundamental question, whether the new state remained a monarchy or was to be a republic, was postponed until the end of the war, as was the status of King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]].\n\nSubsequent to switching their support to the Partisans, the Allies set-up the [[RAF Balkan Air Force]] (under the suggestion of Brigadier-General Fitzroy Maclean) with the aim to provide increased supplies and tactical air support for Marshal Tito's Partisan forces.\n\n==1944==\n\n===Last Axis offensive===\nIn January 1944, Tito's forces unsuccessfully attacked [[Banja Luka]].

Up until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will, as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during ''R\u00f6sselsprung'' as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse for the first time, establishing full [[Air supremacy|aerial superiority]]. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.<ref>Ciglic, et al., 2007, p. 113</ref>\n\nThe Yugoslav Partisan movement grew to become the largest resistance force in occupied Europe, with 800,000 men organised in 4 [[field army|field armies]]. Eventually the Partisans prevailed against all of their opponents as the official army of the newly founded [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] (later Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia).\n\nIn 1944, the Macedonian and Serbian commands made contact in southern Serbia and formed a joint command, which consequently placed the Macedonian Partisans under the direct command of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]].<ref>Narodnooslobodila\u010dka Vojska Jugoslavije.

This agreement was an attempt to form a new Yugoslav government which would include both the communists and the [[Monarchism|royalists]]. It called for a merge of the Partisan [[Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] (''Antifa\u0161isti\u010dko V(ij)e\u0107e Narodnog Oslobo\u0111enja Jugoslavije'', AVNOJ) and the Government in exile. The Tito-\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 agreement also called on all Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs to join the Partisans. The Partisans were recognized by the Royal Government as Yugoslavia's regular army. Mihajlovi\u0107 and many Chetniks refused to answer the call. The Chetniks were, however, praised for [[Operation Halyard|saving 500 downed Allied pilots]] in 1944; United States President Harry S. Truman posthumously awarded Mihailovi\u0107 the [[Legion of Merit]] for his contribution to the Allied victory.<ref>https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1948v04/d691</ref>\n\n===Allied advances in Romania and Bulgaria===\n[[File:Balkanfront 19440831-19441130.png|thumb|230px|Map of German retreat in autumn 1944 (week by week)]]\nIn August 1944 after the [[Jassy-Kishinev Offensive]] overwhelmed the front line of Germany's [[Army Group South Ukraine]], [[King Michael's Coup|King Michael I of Romania staged a coup]], Romania quit the war, and the Romanian army was placed under the command of the [[Red Army]]. Romanian forces, fighting against Germany, participated in the [[Prague Offensive]]. [[Bulgaria]] quit as well and, on 10 September, declared war on Germany and its remaining allies. The weak divisions sent by the [[Axis powers]] to invade Bulgaria were easily driven back. In Macedonia, the Bulgarian troops, surrounded by German forces and betrayed by high-ranking military commanders, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. In late September 1944 three Bulgarian armies, some 455,000 strong in total led by General Georgi Marinov Mandjev from the village of Goliamo Sharkovo \u2013 Elhovo, entered Yugoslavia with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. Southern and eastern Serbia and Macedonia were liberated within two months and the 130,000-strong [[Bulgarian First Army]] continued to Hungary.\n\nOn 10 September 1944, Bulgaria changed sides and declared war on Germany as an Allied Power. The Germans swiftly disarmed the 1st Occupation Corps of 5 divisions and the 5th Army, despite short-lived resistance by the latter. Survivors retreated to the old borders of Bulgaria. After the occupation of Bulgaria by the Soviet army negotiations between Tito and the Bulgarian Communist leaders were organised, resulting in a military alliance between them. The new Bulgarian People's Army and the Red Army 3rd Ukrainian Front troops were concentrated at the old Bulgarian-Yugoslav border. On 8 October, they entered Yugoslavia. The First and Fourth Bulgarian Armies invaded [[Vardar Macedonia]], and the Second Army south-eastern Serbia. The First Army then swung north with the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front, through eastern Yugoslavia and south-western Hungary, before linking up with the British 8th Army in Austria in May 1945.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=33}}\n\n===Liberation of Belgrade and eastern Yugoslavia===\n[[File:1944 Yugoslavia liberated territories.jpg|thumb|right|Territories under Partisan control, September 1944]]\nConcurrently, with Allied air support and assistance from the Red Army, the Partisans turned their attention to [[Central Serbia]]. The chief objective was to disrupt railroad communications in the valleys of the Vardar and Morava rivers, and prevent Germans from withdrawing their 300,000+ forces from Greece.\n\nThe Allied air forces sent 1,973 aircraft (mostly from the US 15th Air Force) over Yugoslavia, which discharged over 3,000 tons of bombs. On 17 August 1944 Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] offered an amnesty to all collaborators. On 12 September, King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] broadcast a message from London, calling upon all Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to \"join the National Liberation Army under the leadership of Marshal Tito\".  The message had a devastating effect on the morale of the Chetniks. Many of them switched sides to the Partisans.\n\nIn September, the Red Army and the Partisans launched the [[Belgrade Offensive]], and took the city on 20 October. At the onset of winter, the Partisans effectively controlled the entire eastern half of Yugoslavia\u2014Serbia, [[Vardar Macedonia|Macedonia]], Montenegro\u2014as well as most of the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. The Wehrmacht and the forces of the Usta\u0161e-controlled [[Independent State of Croatia]] fortified a [[Syrmian Front|front in Syrmia]] that held through the winter of 1944\u201345 in order to aid the evacuation of German [[Army Group E]] from the Balkans. To raise the number of Partisan troops Tito  again offered the amnesty on 21 November 1944. In November 1944, the units of the Usta\u0161e militia and the Croatian Home Guard were reorganised and combined to form the Army of the Independent State of Croatia.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}}\n\n==1945==\n{{quote|Every German unit which could safely evacuate from Yugoslavia might count itself lucky.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Rules and Reasons}}}}\nThe Germans continued their retreat. Having lost the easier withdrawal route through Serbia, they fought to hold the Syrmian front in order to secure the more difficult passage through Kosovo, Sandzak and Bosnia. They even scored a series of temporary successes against the People's Liberation Army. They left Mostar on 22 February 1945. They did not leave Sarajevo until 15 April. Sarajevo had assumed a last-moment strategic position as the only remaining withdrawal route and was held at substantial cost. In early March the Germans moved troops from southern Bosnia to support an unsuccessful counter-offensive in Hungary, which enabled the NOV to score some successes by attacking the Germans' weakened positions. Although strengthened by Allied aid, a secure rear and mass conscription in areas under their control, the one-time partisans found it difficult to switch to conventional warfare, particularly in the open country west of Belgrade, where the Germans held their own until mid-April in spite of all of the raw and untrained conscripts the NOV hurled in a bloody war of attrition against the Syrmian Front.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|page=258}}\n\nOn 8 March 1945, a coalition Yugoslav government was formed in Belgrade with Tito as Premier and [[Ivan \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107]] as Foreign Minister.\n\n===Partisan general offensive===\nOn 20 March 1945, the Partisans launched a general offensive in the [[Mostar]]-[[Vi\u0161egrad]]-[[Drina River|Drina]] sector. With large swaths of Bosnian, Croatian and Slovenian countryside already under Partisan guerrilla control, the final operations consisted in connecting these territories and capturing major cities and roads. For the general offensive Marshal Josip Broz Tito commanded a Partisan force of about 800,000 men organised into four [[field army|armies]]: the \n* [[1st Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|1st Army]] commanded by [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]], \n* [[2nd Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|2nd Army]] commanded by [[Ko\u010da Popovi\u0107]], \n* [[3rd Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|3rd Army]] commanded by [[Kosta Na\u0111]],  \n* [[4th Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|4th Army]] commanded by [[Petar Drap\u0161in]]. \nIn addition, the Yugoslav Partisans had eight independent army corps (the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and the 10th).\n\nSet against the Yugoslav Partisans was German General [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]] of [[Army Group E]] (''[[Army Group E|Heeresgruppe E]]''). This Army Group had seven army corps : \n* [[XV Mountain Corps (Germany)|XV Mountain Corps]], \n* [[XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps|XV Cossack Corps]], \n* [[XXI Mountain Corps (Germany)|XXI Mountain Corps]], \n* [[XXXIV Corps (Germany)|XXXIV Infantry Corps]], \n* [[LXIX Corps (Germany)|LXIX Infantry Corps]], \n* [[LXXXXVII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|LXXXXVII Infantry Corps]]. \nThese corps included seventeen weakened divisions ([[1st Cossack Division|1st Cossack]], 2nd Cossack, [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen|7th SS]], [[11th Luftwaffe Field Division|11th]] [[Luftwaffe Field Division]], 22nd, [[41st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|41st]], 104th, 117th, 138th, [[181st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|181st]], 188th,  237th, [[297th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|297th]], [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th Croat]], [[373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|373rd Croat]], [[392nd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|392nd Croat]] and the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Ukrainian)|14th SS Ukrainian Division]]). In addition to the seven corps, the Axis had remnant naval and [[Luftwaffe]] forces, under constant attack by the British [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Air Force]] and [[United States Air Force]].{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=9}}\n[[File:Royal Air Force- Italy, the Balkans and South-east Europe, 1942-1945.

There were also several armoured units. From early 1945, the Croatian Divisions were allocated to various German corps and by March 1945 were holding the Southern Front.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=17}} Securing the rear areas were some 32,000 men of the Croatian [[gendarmerie]] (''Hrvatsko Oruznistvo''), organised into 5 Police Volunteer Regiments plus 15 independent battalions, equipped with standard light infantry weapons, including mortars.{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=30}}\n\nThe [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] (''Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr\u017eave Hrvatske'', or ZNDH) and the units of the [[Croatian Air Force Legion]] (''Hrvatska Zrakoplovna Legija'', or HZL), returned from service on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] provided some level of air support (attack, fighter and transport) right up until May 1945, encountering and sometimes defeating opposing aircraft from the British [[Royal Air Force]], [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]]. Although 1944 had been a catastrophic year for the ZNDH, with aircraft losses amounting to 234, primarily on the ground, it entered 1945 with 196 machines. Further deliveries of new aircraft from Germany continued in the early months of 1945 to replace losses. By 10 March, the ZNDH had 23 [[Messerschmitt 109]] G&Ks, three [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]], six [[Fiat G.50]], and two [[Messerschmitt 110]] G fighters.  The final deliveries of up-to-date German [[Messerschmitt 109]] G and K fighter aircraft were still taking place in March 1945.<ref>Savic & Ciglic, 2002, p. 70</ref> and the ZNDH still had 176 aircraft on its strength in April 1945.<ref>Ciglic, et al., 2007, p. 150</ref>\n\nBetween 30 March and 8 April 1945, General Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks mounted a final attempt to establish themselves as a credible force fighting the Axis in Yugoslavia. The Chetniks under [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107]] fought a combination of Usta\u0161a and Croatian Home Guard forces in the [[Battle on Lijev\u010da field]]. In late March 1945 elite NDH Army units were withdrawn from the Syrmian front to destroy Djurisic's Chetniks trying to make their way across the northern NDH.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|page=256}} The battle was fought near Banja Luka in what was then the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and ended in a decisive victory for the Independent State of Croatia forces.\n\nSerbian units included the remnants of the [[Serbian State Guard]] and the [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] from the [[Serbian Military Administration]]. There were even some units of the [[Slovene Home Guard]] (''Slovensko domobranstvo'', SD) still intact in [[Slovenia]].{{sfn|Thomas|1995|page=22}}\n\nBy the end of March, 1945, it was obvious to the Croatian Army Command that, although the front remained intact, they would eventually be defeated by sheer lack of ammunition.

By 20 April, Drap\u0161in liberated [[Lika]] and the [[Croatian Littoral]], including the islands, and reached the old Yugoslav border with Italy. On 1 May, after capturing the Italian territories of [[Rijeka]] and [[Istria]] from the German LXXXXVII Corps, the Yugoslav 4th Army beat the western Allies to [[Trieste]] by one day.\n\nThe Yugoslav 2nd Army, under the command of [[Ko\u010da Popovi\u0107]], forced a crossing of the [[Bosna River]] on 5 April, capturing [[Doboj]], and reached the [[Una (Sava)|Una River]].  On 6 April, the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th Corps of the Yugoslav Partisans took [[Sarajevo]] from the German XXI Corps. On 12 April, the Yugoslav 3rd Army, under the command of [[Kosta Na\u0111]], forced a crossing of the [[Drava]] river. The 3rd Army then fanned out through [[Podravina]], reached a point north of Zagreb, and crossed the old Austrian border with Yugoslavia in the [[Dravograd]] sector. The 3rd Army closed the ring around the enemy forces when its advanced motorized detachments linked up with detachments of the 4th Army in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]].\n\nAlso, on 12 April, the Yugoslav 1st Army, under the command of [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]] penetrated the fortified front of the German XXXIV Corps in Syrmia. By 22 April, the 1st Army had smashed the fortifications and was advancing towards Zagreb.\n\nThe long-drawn out liberation of western Yugoslavia caused more victims among the population. The breakthrough of the Syrmian front on 12 April was, in [[Milovan \u0110ilas]]'s words, \"the greatest and bloodiest battle our army had ever fought\", and it would not have been possible had it not been for Soviet instructors and arms.{{sfn|\u0110ilas|1977|page=440}}\nBy the time General [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]]'s NOV units had reached Zagreb, on 9 May 1945, they had perhaps lost as many as 36,000 dead.

The new comprehensive research also included Slovenes killed by the Partisan resistance, both in battle (members of collaborationist and anti-Communist units), and civilians (around 4,000 between 1941 and 1945). Furthermore, the new estimates includes all the Slovenians from Nazi-occupied Slovenia who were drafted in the Wehrmacht and died either in battle or in prisoner camps during the war. The figure also includes the Slovenes from the [[Julian March]] who died in the Italian Army (1940\u201343), those from [[Prekmurje]] who died in the Hungarian Army, and those who fought and died in various Allied (mostly British) units. The figure does not include victims from [[Venetian Slovenia]] (except of those who joined the Slovenian Partisan units), nor does it include the victims among [[Carinthian Slovenes]] (again with the exception of those fighting in the Partisan units) and [[Hungarian Slovenes]]. 47% percent of casualties during the war were partisans, 33% were civilians (of which 82% were killed by Axis powers or Slovene home guard), and 20% were members of the Slovene home guard.<ref>Delo, ''Sobotna priloga'', 30 October 2010.</ref>\n\n;Territory of the NDH\nAccording to \u017derjavi\u0107's research on the losses of the Serbs in the NDH, 82,000 died as members of the Yugoslav Partisans, and 23,000 as Chetniks and Axis collaborators.

The Parish also includes the hamlets of '''Blackden''', '''Blackden Heath''' and '''Jodrell Bank'''.\n\n== History ==\nIt is possible that Goostrey was a meeting place or even a settlement during the 1st millennium BC, as stone and bronze axe heads and [[tumulus|barrows]] within the parish boundary show the area was inhabited before the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]]. [[British Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] barrows have also been found near [[Twemlow Hall]] and Terra Nova School on the edge of the parish. The 1,200-year-old [[Taxus baccata|yew tree]] in Goostrey's churchyard suggests that the mound on which the church is built was a focal point for a community during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] of the 1st millennium. At that time Cheshire was under the control of the [[Wrekinset|Wreocens\u00e6te]] people of [[Mercia]].\n\nGoostrey first appears in recorded history with two entries in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, when most of the parish was held by William FitzNigel, Baron of [[Halton (borough)|Halton]], and by Hugh de Mara, another follower of the [[Earl of Chester]]. Hugh FitzNorman gave much land in Goostrey to endow the new [[Chester Cathedral|Abbey of Saint Werburgh]] in Chester in 1119, as did a later owner, Baron Hugh of [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=39975&strquery=Goostrey |title=Houses of Benedictine monks: The abbey of Chester |work=A History of the County of Chester: Volume 3 |publisher=British History Online |accessdate=10 December 2007}}</ref> Some land in the parish or nearby Twemlow was also given to help endow the [[Vale Royal Abbey]], near [[Northwich]].\n\nThe Parish of '''Goostrey-cum-Barnshaw''' remained ecclesiastical property until the 14th century, leased out at first and then managed by the abbey directly. Abbey records mostly relate to maintenance of ditches, mills and fish ponds and give a picture of a scatter of small farms set amongst woods and heath supplying wood, flour and fish to the great [[Chester Cathedral|Chester Abbey]], some later gifted to the new foundation of [[Vale Royal Abbey]].\n\n[[File:Goostrey church.jpg|thumb|left|[[St Luke's Church, Goostrey|St Luke's Church]]]]\nAfter the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], the land was purchased by the [[Mainwaring Baronets|Mainwaring family]] of Over Peover and remained part of that family's estate until the 20th century. From the 17th century, farming techniques improved and farms became bigger and more prosperous. [[Dairy farming]] and particularly the Cheshire speciality, cheese, thrived, shielding the county from poor harvests and low prices. Goostrey became a centre for a comparatively well-to-do farming community. The church, [[St Luke's Church, Goostrey|St Luke's]], a wooden framed building built around 1220 was replaced by the present one of brick in 1792. The first recorded school early in the 17th century was rebuilt in 1775, a replacement built on another site in 1812 and that replaced by the present 'old' school in 1856 when some 62 boys and 40 girls were pupils. Also at that time, the village had at least two pubs, a mill, a blacksmith, two tailors, a shoemaker and two or three shops.\n\nThe first big change to the old way of life was the opening of the [[Crewe to Manchester Line|Crewe to Manchester railway]] near the village in 1842.<ref>M.C. Reed, ''The London and North Western Railway''. Penryn: Atlantic, 1996.</ref> However, Goostrey did not get its own station until 1891.<ref>{{Quick-Stations|page=190}}</ref> The [[Goostrey railway station|new station]] offered a market for milk and produce and brought in occasional trippers, temperance groups or Sunday schools out for a picnic. In the late 19th century, villas were built along Main Road and groups of cyclists began visiting the village, a connection which continues. After the [[First World War]], [[motor car]]s were more frequent and the annual Goostrey horseraces became fashionable. Goostrey remained largely a farming community until the late 1930s, when the district council decided to build council housing in the village and to install mains drainage. In 1963, the first of three new estate developments was started and by 1970 the number of houses had quadrupled.\n\nThough the new residents were initially seen as \"incomers\", many soon became active members of village clubs and societies. In 1976, the village's residents and activities were captured by a series of five one-hour ITV programmes titled ''Goostrey\u2014A Village'', which received a mixed welcome from the inhabitants themselves.\n\nCommunity spirit has grown along with the village. A sports field (originally planned in the 1920s) finally became a reality in the 1990s, and both \"old\" and \"new\" residents were involved in planning the village's [[millennium]] celebrations. Recent community ventures include a sports [[pavilion]], and a new children's play area in Boothbed Lane (completed in 2005).\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Goostrey west.jpg|thumb|right|The Bog Bean \u2013 the village green at the centre of the village]]\nThe village of Goostrey sprawls east-west along a single main road, stretching about three miles (5&nbsp;km).  There are two main concentrations of houses, one in the west of the village containing the local shop and a small sports venue, and the other in the centre of the village.  The east end of the village is marked by [[Goostrey railway station]], which is on the Manchester\u2013Crewe line.\n\nGoostrey has a [[Goostrey Primary School|village primary school]], a [[Methodist]] chapel and [[St Luke's Church, Goostrey|St Luke's Church]]. There are two [[public house]]s, the Crown Inn and the Red Lion. Goostrey also has two general stores, a post office, a newsagent, a hairdresser, a nail and skin salon, a cafe and a pharmacy. There are also a number of small businesses in the village.\n\nThe wooded valley of Red Lion Brook on the northern side of the village is known as \"The Bongs\" and features in [[Alan Garner]]'s play ''Holly from the Bongs'', which was performed by the children of the village in the 1970s for the BBC. Alan Garner lives in the village in the late 16th century house known as Toad Hall and set his popular novel ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]'' in nearby [[Alderley Edge]].\n\nGoostrey is near [[Holmes Chapel]]; most of the village children attend [[Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School]] after leaving [[Goostrey Primary School]]. Goostrey is also near [[Knutsford]], [[Wilmslow]], [[Alderley Edge]] and [[Sandbach]].\n\n== Community and culture ==\n\n[[File:Jbo-gavin-hollinshead.jpg|thumb|right|The Lovell Telescope taken from Station Road, Goostrey near the Livery Stables.]]\nGoostrey Rose Day is the annual summer village [[f\u00eate]] which is held on the last Saturday of June. The village children, organisations and the young at hearts dress in fancy-dress costumes and parade through the village. To mark the centenary, Goostrey held a [[scarecrow]] competition for the whole village to participate in, which has now become an annual event in the village. Photos of past Goostrey Rose Days can be seen in the Crown Inn.\n\nThere is a very popular local tradition of [[gooseberry]] growing, and an annual Goostrey Gooseberry Show. A plaque in the Crown Inn lists all of the show's past winners.\n\nGoostrey is a thriving village with a close knit community and has many clubs and organisations for all ages. The village has a village hall as well as a park and children's play area. The village also has its own sports pavilion and facilities which are available to village residents and include a [[bowling green]], football pitch and tennis courts.\n\nAn active footpaths group keeps the many public footpaths around the village in good order. ''More Goostrey Walks & Strolls'' details nine walks around the village and is available via the group's website (see External Links). It has photos, maps needed for the walks and is a mine of historical and ecological information about Goostrey.\n\nIn 2006, Goostrey became one of the first villages in the United Kingdom to have its own profile on the social networking website MySpace.\n\n2007 saw the introduction of the Goostrey Arts Festival. Also known as \"Goosfest\", the week-long showcase comprises a wide variety of events promoting the cultural life of the village, consisting of amateur and professional practitioners (many of whom are local) across a wide range of the arts, including stand-up comedy, classical, folk and contemporary music, pottery, photography and paintings. The majority of the events take place in the village hall, the Crown Inn and St Luke's Church.\n\nThe Lovell Telescope ( now a world heritage site) sit sits within Goostrey Parish.  This has resulted in a number of housing development submissions being refused, due to the adverse effect that they would have on the work of the dish.  The world HQ of the SKA (Square Kilometre Array Observatory) is also in Goostrey Parish.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cheshire}}\n*[[Listed buildings in Goostrey]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Goostrey}}\n*[http://www.goostreyfootpaths.org.uk  Goostrey Footpaths Group]\n*[http://www.goostrey.info Village Website]\n*[http://www.stlukesgoostrey.org.uk St Luke's Church]\n*[http://www.goostreyrosefestival.co.uk Goostrey Rose Festival]\n*[http://www.goostreynews.co.uk Goostrey News shop]\n*[http://www.goosfest.com Goosfest]\n*[http://www.myspace.com/goostrey www.myspace.com/goostrey]\n*[http://friendsofgoostreystation.org  Friends of Goostrey Station]\n*[https://cranageparishchronicle.co.uk/ Cranage Parish Chronicle]\n\n{{Cheshire, Cheshire East}}\n{{Cheshire}}\n\nFacebook media group: Country Post and County News and Signpost\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Cheshire]]\n[[Category:Civil parishes in Cheshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=June 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n|country=                  England\n|official_name=            Goostrey\n|london_distance=\n|static_image_name=        KenGunaryPics-035.jpg\n|static_image_width=             240px\n|static_image_caption=     Goostrey\n|coordinates = {{coord|53.231232|-2.336356|display=inline,title}}\n|civil_parish=             Goostrey\n|population = 2,179\n|region=                   North West England\n|unitary_england=       [[Cheshire East]]\n|lieutenancy_england=   [[Cheshire]]\n|constituency_westminster= [[Congleton (UK Parliament constituency)|Congleton]]\n|post_town=                Crewe\n|postcode_district=        CW4\n|postcode_area=            CW\n|dial_code=                01477\n|os_grid_reference=        SJ775705\n}}\n\n'''Goostrey''' is an old farming village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the unitary authority of [[Cheshire East]] and the ceremonial county of [[Cheshire]], England. It is located in open countryside, 14 miles NE of Crewe and 12 miles W of Macclesfield.  Goostrey Parish contains the huge Lovell radio telescope at the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]].

Two of the more prominent sites surviving from this time are the [[petroglyph]]s at [[Petroglyphs Provincial Park]] and [[Serpent Mounds Park|Serpent Mounds]].

The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name \"Nogojiwanong\" which means \"the place at the end of the rapids\".\n[[File:Cox Terrace Peterborough Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Cox Terrace on Rubidge Street, built in 1884 and declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1991]]\n\nThe year 1825 marked the arrival of [[Irish Immigrants|Irish immigrants]] from the city of Cork to Scott's Plains.

Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honor. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John. ''Irish settlements in Eastern Canada: a study of cultural transfer and adaptation''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974. 219.

He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish. to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character. but as Robinson traveled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming. I found them much more intelligent than I expected. Most of them could read and write'\".<ref>Mackay, Donald, Flight from Famine : The Coming of the Irish to Canada (Toronto : McClelland & Stewart, 1992/ Reissued, Toronto : Dundurn, 2009), 59</ref>\n\nThomas Poole, a nineteenth century writer, wrote that all 2024 passengers boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they traveled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here. One school and one bank agency were operating.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

The [[Peterborough Canoe Company]] was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boat-building industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.<ref name=\"1930boatemployee\">{{cite web | url = http://www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca/canoe.htm| title=A History of Peterborough's Canoe Industry | work = Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives\n|year = 1997\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nPeterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at [[Niagara Falls]]). Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometers north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) traveled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armor Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was

Trent's academic focus is on environmental, cultural and science studies. The main '''Symons Campus''' of Trent, located in the city's far north end, is approximately 14.6 square kilometres, over half of which is a part of Trent's Nature Areas, an ecologically diverse wild-life [[nature reserve]].\n\nTrent University operates largely through its colleges: Champlain, Lady Eaton, [[Catharine Parr Traill]], Otonabee, [[Peter Gzowski]] and Julian Blackburn. Each college has its own residence halls, dining room and student government, except for Catharine Parr Traill (which consists only of part-time students and is located near downtown Peterborough) and Julian Blackburn (which is mostly administrative).\n\n====Fleming College====\n{{Main|Fleming College}}\nEstablished in 1967, Fleming College (formerly Sir Sandford Fleming College), is a multidisciplinary institution with two primary campuses within the city of Peterborough:\n\n'''Sutherland Campus''' is located on Brealey Drive in the city's west end, and has recently undergone a massive expansion. The new St. Joseph's at Fleming is the first long-term care facility to be built on a college or university campus. In 2005, the Peterborough Sport & Wellness Centre was constructed to accommodate the college's athletic needs.\n\nMcRae Campus was located in a renovated [[textile]] mill located on McDonnel Street near Monaghan Road. Formerly the School of Continuing Education and Skilled Trades, the campus closed in 2014 when the Kawartha Trades and Technology Center opened on the Sutherland Campus.\n\nThe college also operates satellite campuses in nearby [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]], [[Cobourg]] and [[Dysart et al, Ontario|Haliburton]].\n\n====Kawartha Lakes Bible College====\n{{Main|Kawartha Lakes Bible College}}\nKawartha Lakes Bible College (KLBC) is a small evangelical Bible college affiliated with the [[Brethren Movement|Plymouth Brethren]].

Mechanics Institutes were established across Ontario to make education universal and accessible to all citizens. In Peterborough, the Institute and the Library were located on Water Street. In May 1895, the Mechanics Institute became the Peterborough Public Library. The library remained on Water Street.\n\nLater, the [[Peterborough Public Library]] received funding from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation and the new Carnegie Library located on George Street opened in 1911. This building is currently the Carnegie Wing of City Hall.\n\nIn February 1949, a branch library opened in the south end of Peterborough. It was situated above a hardware store and was a room measuring 50 by 20 feet. It was divided into two sections\u2014one for children, the other for adults.\n\nThe DelaFosse Branch Library opened officially on December 1, 1965. The Peterborough Examiner declared that this branch at 729 Park Street S., made \"south end residents the envy of the rest of the city.\" Currently, it holds a recreational reading collection of approximately 14,000 hardcover and paperback books for all ages. Recent additions to the collection include a variety of multimedia including CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMs and CD audio books. This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.\n\nThe Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were held on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|title=Film crew jumps around the city|last=|first=|date=September 5, 2006|website=mykawartha.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211000337/http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|archive-date=11 February 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]]. This is due in part to Peterborough's central location in a valley. Peterborough is also home to a single television station, [[CHEX-DT]], which is the local [[Global Television Network|Global]] O&O; as well as [[TVCogeco]], a local cable television channel operated by [[Cogeco]] Cable. Peterborough has two main newspapers, the ''[[Peterborough Examiner]]'', which publishes six days a week except Sunday; and ''[[Peterborough This Week]]'', which publishes every Wednesday and Friday.

Woodland Natives inhabited the area circa 1000 BCE &ndash; 1000 CE, followed by [[Iroquois]] and [[Mississaugas]] circa 1740 CE. Two of the more prominent sites surviving from this time are the [[petroglyph]]s at [[Petroglyphs Provincial Park]] and [[Serpent Mounds Park|Serpent Mounds]]. The petroglyphs are located northeast of Peterborough and are believed to have been carved by the [[Algonquin people]] between 900 and 1400 CE. The Serpent Mounds are located near [[Keene, Ontario|Keene]], approximately 30&nbsp;km southeast of Peterborough in [[Otonabee-South Monaghan, Ontario|Otonabee-South Monaghan]] township, in an area first inhabited sometime before 10 CE.<ref name=\"mounds\">{{cite web\n |title      = Serpent Mounds National Historic Site of Canada\n |work       = Parks Canada Directory of Federal Heritage Designations\n |publisher  = [[Government of Canada]]\n |date       = \n |url        = https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=511\n |accessdate = March 19, 2019\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1615, [[Samuel de Champlain]] travelled through the area, coming down from [[Lake Chemong]] and portaging down a trail, which is approximated by present-day Chemong Road, to the [[Otonabee River]]<ref name=\"champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |title=Peterborough and the Kawarthas |publisher=[[Trent University]] |date=September 26, 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211014631/http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref> and stayed for a brief time near the present-day site of [[Bridgenorth, Ontario|Bridgenorth]], just north of Peterborough.\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1818, Adam Scott settled on the west shore of the [[Otonabee River]]. The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name \"Nogojiwanong\" which means \"the place at the end of the rapids\".\n[[File:Cox Terrace Peterborough Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Cox Terrace on Rubidge Street, built in 1884 and declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1991]]\n\nThe year 1825 marked the arrival of [[Irish Immigrants|Irish immigrants]] from the city of Cork to Scott's Plains. In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to [[Upper Canada]].\n\nPeter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John. ''Irish settlements in Eastern Canada: a study of cultural transfer and adaptation''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974. 219. Print</ref>\n\nRobinson was urged by landlords to remove the \"pauper and undesirables\". He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish. to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character. but as Robinson travelled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming. I found them much more intelligent than I expected. Most of them could read and write'\".<ref>Mackay, Donald, Flight from Famine : The Coming of the Irish to Canada (Toronto : McClelland & Stewart, 1992/ Reissued, Toronto : Dundurn, 2009), 59</ref>\n\nThomas Poole, a nineteenth century writer, wrote that all 2024 passengers boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they travelled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here. One school and one bank agency were operating.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

The [[Peterborough Canoe Company]] was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boat-building industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.<ref name=\"1930boatemployee\">{{cite web | url = http://www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca/canoe.htm| title=A History of Peterborough's Canoe Industry | work = Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives\n|year = 1997\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nPeterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at [[Niagara Falls]]). Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometres north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) travelled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was

Only Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City, Barrie and Guelph had lower crime severity indexes, according to the survey. None of the census metropolitan areas had increases in crime severity in 2013. The crime severity index is calculated by Statistics Canada and takes into account both the volume and severity, based on average sentences for offenders, of police-reported crime in Canada. Nationally the CSI was down 9% in 2013 compared to 2012 and is 36% lower than 10 years ago.\n\nIn 2011, Peterborough had the highest rate of hate crimes reported in Canadian cities.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wedley |first1=Brendan |title=Peterborough had highest rate of reported hate crimes among cities in Canada in 2011: Statistics Canada |url=https://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/news-story/8201604-peterborough-had-highest-rate-of-reported-hate-crimes-among-cities-in-canada-in-2011-statistics-canada/ |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Peterborough Examiner |publisher=Metroland Media Group Ltd. |date=July 12, 2013}}</ref> However, in recent years Peterborough has been found to have a relatively low crime rate.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In November 2015, Peterborough gained nationwide notoriety after an arson took place at the Masjid Al-Salaam mosque.

Provincial [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]], part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], connects to [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]] heading west and eventually to [[Ottawa]] heading east. Other [[Provincial highways in Ontario|Provincial Highways]] important to Peterborough are [[Ontario Highway 7A|Highway 7A]], which junctions onto Highway 115 just southwest of the city, and [[Ontario Highway 28|Highway 28]], which routes from Highway 7 just east of the city to Lakefield and on further north.\n\nThe area is also served by numerous [[County roads in Ontario#Peterborough|county roads]].\n\nThere are four road bridges that cross the Otonabee River within the city limits of Peterborough. The most northerly one is the Nassau Mills Road Bridge near Trent University. The next most northerly bridge is the Parkhill Road Bridge. The Hunter Street Bridge crosses the river just north of Little Lake, linking East City with the downtown core. The most southerly bridge is the Lansdowne Street Bridge. In addition, Highway 115 crosses the river near the southern edge of the city. There are also numerous other bridges which cross the Trent Canal (notably the crossing at the lift lock which actually passes under the canal), Jackson Creek and the other minor creeks in the city. There are also numerous other river crossings throughout the CMA, the longest of which is the [[James A. Gifford Causeway]], which crosses Chemong Lake linking Bridgenorth with Ennismore.\n\n[[Public transit]] in the city of Peterborough is currently run by [[Peterborough Transit]], providing a total of 12 regular and 5 express routes throughout the city. Peterborough Transit's hub is a central terminal located on Simcoe Street in the city's downtown core. It also serves as the regional terminus for [[Coach Canada]] (formerly Trentway Wagar) routes into the city. [[Greyhound Lines of Canada]] operates an inter-city terminal nearby at the corner of Simcoe and Aylmer Streets, with several daily commuter buses to and from [[Toronto]]. [[GO Transit]] established a bus service from Peterborough to Oshawa starting September 5, 2009.\n\n===Railways{{anchor|Peterborough, Ontario railway station}}===\n{{Infobox station\n| name                = Peterborough\n| style               =\n| image               = Former Canadian Pacific Railway Station, Peterborough.jpg\n| caption             = Heritage railway station building\n| address             = 175, George Street North \n| borough             = Peterborough, Ontario\n| country             = [[Canada]]\n| coordinates         = {{Coord|44|17|56|N|78|19|12|W|region:CA-ON_type:railwaystation|display=inline}}\n| owned               = \n| operator            = \n| line                = [[Kawartha Lakes Railway|Havelock Subdivision]]\n| distance            = \n| platforms           = \n| tracks              = \n| train_operators     = \n| connections         = \n| structure           =\n| parking             = \n| bicycle             = \n| disabled            = \n| architect           = Thomas Charles Sorby\n| architectural_style =\n| status              =\n| code                = \n| zone                = \n| website             = \n| opened              = {{Start date|1884|10|29}}\n| opening             =\n| closed              = {{End date|1990|01|01}}\n| rebuilt             =\n| former              =\n| original            =\n| services            = <!-- Only use S-rail/S-line Templates, without start or end -->\n| embedded            = {{Designation list|embed=yes | designation1= HRSC | designation1_offname=Peterborough CPR Station | designation1_date= 2006 | designation1_number = [http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=4400 4400]}}\n}}\nPeterborough is served by [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].

The main '''Symons Campus''' of Trent, located in the city's far north end, is approximately 14.6 square kilometres, over half of which is a part of Trent's Nature Areas, an ecologically diverse wild-life [[nature reserve]].\n\nTrent University operates largely through its colleges: Champlain, Lady Eaton, [[Catharine Parr Traill]], Otonabee, [[Peter Gzowski]] and Julian Blackburn. Each college has its own residence halls, dining room and student government, except for Catharine Parr Traill (which consists only of part-time students and is located near downtown Peterborough) and Julian Blackburn (which is mostly administrative).\n\n====Fleming College====\n{{Main|Fleming College}}\nEstablished in 1967, Fleming College (formerly Sir Sandford Fleming College), is a multidisciplinary institution with two primary campuses within the city of Peterborough:\n\n'''Sutherland Campus''' is located on Brealey Drive in the city's west end, and has recently undergone a massive expansion.

Mechanics Institutes were established across Ontario to make education universal and accessible to all citizens. In Peterborough, the Institute and the Library were located on Water Street. In May 1895, the Mechanics Institute became the Peterborough Public Library. The library remained on Water Street.\n\nLater, the [[Peterborough Public Library]] received funding from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation and the new Carnegie Library located on George Street opened in 1911. This building is currently the Carnegie Wing of City Hall.\n\nIn February 1949, a branch library opened in the south end of Peterborough. It was situated above a hardware store and was a room measuring 50 by 20 feet. It was divided into two sections\u2014one for children, the other for adults.\n\nThe DelaFosse Branch Library opened officially on December 1, 1965. The Peterborough Examiner declared that this branch at 729 Park Street S., made \"south end residents the envy of the rest of the city.\" Currently, it holds a recreational reading collection of approximately 14,000 hardcover and paperback books for all ages. Recent additions to the collection include a variety of multimedia including CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMs and CD audio books. This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.\n\nThe Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were held on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|title=Film crew jumps around the city|last=|first=|date=September 5, 2006|website=mykawartha.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211000337/http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|archive-date=11 February 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]].

It is required for every type of [[Motor vehicle|motorised vehicle]] with the exception of the smallest mopeds below 50&nbsp;cm\u00b3, with a speed limit of 25&nbsp;km/h, as well as motorised bicycles. (Even for these, there is a minimum age of 15 years and a small mandatory driving school course). \nThe types of licences one may obtain are the same in all the [[European Economic Area]]. See [[European driving licence]]. \nThe minimum age to obtain a driving licence is: 16 years for a restricted motorcycle up to 125 cm\u00b3, 17 years for a car with a legal guardian, 18 years for unrestricted car and 21 years for buses and cargo vehicles.<ref>Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur, http://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/LA/voraussetzungen-fuer-die-fahrerlaubnis-und-geltungsdauer.html</ref>\n\n==Obtaining a driving licence==\n\nThe German driving licence can be obtained after finishing [[Driver's education|driving school]] and passing a two-stage test, the theory test and road test. Before being allowed to take these tests an eye-exam must have been performed and a first-aid course (usually lasts 8 hours) completed.\n\nThe learner driver's training usually takes place in legally authorised and mostly privately-owned, for-profit driving schools. The driving school handles all the necessary paperwork for the students, such as: applying for a licence, registering for tests etc.\n\nThe theoretical part of the education comprises lessons at the driving school, held by legally authorised driving instructors, typically in the evening. The content and number of the lessons is set by law and depending on the type of licence the student wishes to acquire; a different number of lessons has to be attended. Remarkably enough, a student does not have to attend different lessons, they could theoretically attend the same lesson several times to meet the criteria. Lessons are divided into general knowledge about road rules that anyone studying for any licence might attend and specialised lessons for certain types of vehicles. \nTo prepare for the written theory test, students usually obtain a study package from the driving school which can consist of software programmes, textbooks and sample exam papers. Schools usually take responsibility for their students' success and thus keep track of class attendance and hand out sample exams for practising. \nThe theory test is a multiple-choice test consisting of randomised questions from a published guidebook. Thus the questions and correct answers can be studied in advance.\n\nPractical training also takes place with driving school instructors. Specially labelled and fitted vehicles are provided by the driving school. Cars are usually dual control (feature extra mirrors and pedals for the instructor so that they can take control of the vehicle in dangerous situations) since driving and parking maneuvers are taught on public roads. For motorcycles, the student operates the motorcycle on their own with a driving instructor following in another vehicle and giving instruction via radio.\nA certain number of practical and technical lessons has to be completed again depending on the type of vehicle. Obligatory lessons include a minimum number of lessons each driving on: the motorway [[Autobahn]]; rural areas, and in the dark. The actual number of lessons a student completes varies with individual skill. As the most difficult part of the driving test is usually urban driving, most lessons actually take place there, even though there is no mandated minimum for that.\n\nIf a student wishes to be tested in a car with an automatic transmission and sits the road test in such a car, a code or note will be added to the licence and the holder will only be permitted drive cars with an automatic transmission. A test passed on a manual transmission car also gives qualification to drive either manual or automatic.\n\nTheoretical and practical training may be commenced at the same or different times. Some driving schools may insist a student attend a certain number of lessons before giving out appointments for driving lessons.\n\nBoth exams are held by an authorised inspector who visits the driving school for this purpose. Students must pass the theory test before sitting the road test, with no more than a twelve month gap between the two. During the road test, the driving instructor is present in the car with the assisting features of the driving school car deactivated or connected to audio signals and a warning light (if the instructor has to intervene, the test will result in failure.)\n\nAfter each exam, results are immediately given to the students. In case of the road test, if the student meets all the required criteria, the licence is handed over by the inspector. Should the student, for any reason, not be allowed to hold the licence at the time of a successful test (for example because he has not yet reached the minimum age), the licence will be sent to the Kraftfahrzeug-Zulassungsbeh\u00f6rde (compare [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency|DVLA]]) of the student's place of residence where it can be picked up as soon as the person becomes eligible.\nThere are limits on the frequency and the time elapsed before failed tests can be reattempted.\n\nThe failure rate for driving tests in 2011 was 28%. Automobile associations have given the opinion that this is due to the low quality of the education at driving schools as it benefits their income if students take additional lessons after failing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.t-online.de/auto/news/id_61798136/fuehrerschein-fast-jeder-dritte-faellt-durch-die-praktische-oder-theoretische-fahrpruefung.html|title=F\u00fchrerschein: Fast jeder Dritte f\u00e4llt durch die praktische oder theoretische Fahrpr\u00fcfung|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFor cars, people aged seventeen do not get a standard driving licence after passing all required tests.
