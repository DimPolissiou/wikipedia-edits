The story focuses on the adventures of two ordinary kids, Emmy and Max, and their dragon friends Ord, Cassie, Zak, Wheezie, and Quetzal. The series began broadcasting on [[PBS]] on their [[PBS Kids]] block on September 6, 1999, with its final episode airing on April 1, 2005. Following the series finale, reruns remained on the block as well as on a channel related to it named [[Universal Kids|PBS Kids Sprout]] (renamed Universal Kids) until August 31, 2010. [[Yearim|Yearim Productions]] was responsible for the animation for all seasons ([[Sunwoo Entertainment]] and [[Wang Film Productions]] only did animation for season 1), with the exception of [[CNK International|Koko Enterprises]], which recorded the show, and [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting|The Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], [[United States Department of Education|The U.S. Department of Education]], [[Kellogg's]], and greeting card manufacturer, [[American Greetings]]<ref>{{Citation|title=Miss Lori & Hooper Preschool Close (2007 WFWA-TV)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-OUzRU8BJQ|language=en|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref> were responsible for the funding.\n\nThe show was close-captioned by the National Captioning Institute when seen on PBS Kids in America and CBC in Canada during its original run.\n\n==Background==\n===Origin===\n''Dragon Tales'' is based on characters created in 1978<ref name=\"sesamearchive\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sesameworkshop.org/who-we-are|title=Who We Are &#124; Sesame Workshop|website=www.sesameworkshop.org}}</ref> by Laguna Beach, California artist and retired educator [[Ron Rodecker]].

The project was considered something of a risky venture, because it was not based on a well-known franchise like many children's television programs, such as ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' or ''[[Paddington Bear]]''. The series was immediately shipped to PBS member stations at the suggestion of PBS, but all originally passed at the time. In October 1995, Jim Coane met Marjorie Kalins, senior VP of programming and production at Children's Television Workshop, and showed her the idea for the series. Kalins, who loved the idea, brought the series to Children's Television Workshop, who agreed to a partnership with the Columbia TriStar Television Group. Kalins helped him and Columbia TriStar Television obtain an $8.5 million grant from the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]. The grant proposal was written by Wesley Eure.<ref name=\"kidscreen\">{{Cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/1999/10/01/26892-19991001/|title=Dragon Tales|first=Theresa|last=Dillon|date=October 1, 1999|accessdate=February 28, 2017|publisher=[[Playback (magazine)#Kidscreen|Kidscreen]]}}</ref> Coane stated that there was never any consideration of trying to shop the program to a commercial broadcast network and that PBS was, in his mind, the only destination for the program.<ref name=\"Don't tell kids\">{{cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/715869/Dont-tell-kids-Dragon-Tales-is-a-show-thats-good-for-them.html|title=Don't tell kids 'Dragon Tales' is a show that's good for them|first=Scott|last=Pierce|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|date=September 3, 1999|accessdate=May 4, 2019}}</ref> As Columbia TriStar was the TV division of two major Hollywood [[Columbia Pictures|film]] [[TriStar Pictures|studios]], which in turn are owned by the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] division of Japanese multinational conglomerate [[Sony]], ''Dragon Tales'' became one of the few [[PBS Kids]] and [[Sprout (TV network)|Sprout]] programs to be co-produced by a major Hollywood studio's TV subsidiary; The other PBS shows were ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' (made by [[Walt Disney Television]]) and ''[[Curious George (TV series)|Curious George]]'' (produced by [[Universal Television]]). In 2002, C-T was renamed to [[Sony Pictures Television]], a company that would co-produce the third season of the program.\n\nAfter a tour of the lot of Sony Studios, Wesley Eure created the first treatment of the show, including the initial conception of the two-headed dragon Zak and Wheezie, back then known as \"Snarf and Bugger.\" The series received a massive multi-million dollar grant from the federal government, beating out ''[[The Muppets]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]'' for the request. As part of the conditions for the grant, Eure was required to create a companion series for the program, which he titled ''Show and Tell Me'', based on his own lecture series known as \"Anyone Can Write a Book.\" Though the companion series was never actually created, Eure remains hopeful that it will one day be produced. Eure's name was not included in the initial credits for the series, forcing him to hire an attorney to ensure that he received credit.<ref name=\"eurewebsite\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wesleyeure.com/Wesley_Eure/Dragon_Tales.html|title=Dragon Tales - Wesley Eure|accessdate=March 13, 2017|first=Wesley|last=Eure}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the development of a [[Bible (screenwriting)|show bible]] by Jeffrey Scott, with some tweaks by writers Cliff Ruby and Elana Lesser, the series was ordered for just over 60 eleven-minute episodes by PBS. Scott was assigned to write and edit half, with Ruby/Lesser assigned to the other half. At this point, the writing team was provided with a document titled \"FUN AND LEARNING IN DRAGON LAND: A Writer\u2019s Guide to Dragon Tales Educational Content\" which provided directives as to which curriculum should be included within the stories, such as \"emotional challenges > understanding other people\u2019s emotions > recognizing and labeling feelings in others\" and the statement that \"CURRICULUM IS PARAMOUNT!\"  After the creation of the first script, all writing parties involved agreed that the scripts \"weren\u2019t fun or funny, they were flat and boring.\" The writers successfully explained to the consultants, educators and psychologists of PBS that children watch television to be entertained and must be entertained in order to be educated. They were then provided with a new directive, \"Come up with entertaining stories and shoehorn in the curriculum wherever it fits!\" Scott states that from the experience he learned an invaluable lesson about how to create a successful preschool series.<ref name=\"entertainfirst\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/blog/formula-successful-preschool-series-entertain-first-educate-last|title= FORMULA FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRESCHOOL SERIES: ENTERTAIN FIRST, EDUCATE LAST - A Dragon Tale: How an Emmy-nominated PBS preschool series almost died at birth...|first=Jeffrey|last=Scott|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=January 14, 2017|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref> [[Dong Woo Animation]], [[Rough Draft Korea]], [[Sunwoo Entertainment]], [[Wang Film Productions]] (season 1 only), [[Yearim]], and lotto animation contributed some of the animation for this series.\n\n===Show premise and overview===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 15em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = left\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = ''Dragon Tales'' has three primary educational goals.

Befriended by four friendly talking dragons with distinctive personalities, Ord, Cassie, Zak, and Wheezie, they frequently travel to Dragon Land and help their friends in fulfilling particular quests, assisting them in their daily problems, and learning important morals through their experiences with Dragon Land.\n\nDesigned to educate preschoolers mildly in Hispanic culture, a new character named Enrique debuted during the show's final season, providing the series with a third protagonist. Surrounded by a variety of unique characters and faced with numerous differing situations, Emmy and Max commonly embark on adventures with their dragon friends, conquering fears or achieving goals in spite of any obstacles preventing them from doing so.\n\nAs a series broadcast on PBS, the program had an educational focus, combining lessons of a pro-social nature with those of more general educational value. Educational themes covered included identifying shapes, learning words and letters in both English and Spanish, counting and basic math. Social themes were also covered, such as good sportsmanship, the importance of being a good friend, overcoming obstacles such as jealousy or fears and getting along with siblings. Many of the show's interstitial song segments, known as \"Dragon Tunes,\" also covered such themes, such as \"Make It Fun\", which encouraged viewers to not complain about having to do seemingly mundane chores such as washing dishes or helping parents with cooking meals, but instead find ways to make them fun. Another, \"Hum,\" encouraged those who had a fear of the dark or trying new things to hum a gentle tune to comfort them. Stated goals of the program's educational philosophy included the encouragement of pursuing new experiences, finding ways to approach and learn from challenges and that learning can come through trying and not succeeding.<ref name=\"ephilosophy\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/educational_philosophy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308175138/http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/educational_philosophy.html|archive-date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=December 4, 2014|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Educational Philosophy}}</ref> Despite two of the show's human leads, Emmy and Enrique, being six years old, the show's described target audience was children closer to the age of four.<ref name=\"target\">Scott, Jeffrey.

In \"Cassie, the Green-Eyed Dragon,\" Cassie felt jealous of her little brother, Finn, when he gets everyone's attention when she takes him to school for \"[[circle time]].\" Discussing the matter with her best friend, Emmy, and her teacher, Quetzal, helps her to understand that jealousy is a natural feeling that everyone experiences sometimes, but that there are ways that she can appreciate her brother, while still feeling appreciated herself.<ref name=\"greeneyed\">''Dragon Tales'' story - Season 2 - \"Cassie, the Green-Eyed Dragon\"</ref> In \"Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os, Enrique,\" Enrique feels sad and homesick for his homeland of Colombia when his birthday celebrations in Dragon Land aren't like the traditions of those back in his old home.

She\u2019s Max's older sister. Her best friend is Cassie, and she\u2019s perhaps known for saying, \"Definitely!\" whenever a good idea arises. Though Emmy isn\u2019t ashamed to do \"girly\" things with Cassie, she\u2019s also heavily into sports and games and generally is up for any activity regardless of traditional gender roles. Though she experiences occasional jealousy of her brother, the two are otherwise usually together within Dragon Land and share many adventures. Though a brave, smart natural leader, she\u2019s also impulsive and doesn\u2019t always think before she acts. She\u2019s typically seen wearing a blue button-up dress over a red short sleeve shirt.<ref name=\"chardesc\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308175122/http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archive-date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=December 4, 2014|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Character Descriptions}}</ref>\n\n===Max===\nMaximilian \"Max\", voiced by [[Danny McKinnon]], is 4-years-old,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130924074134/http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Dragon-Tales/side-by-side/ http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Dragon-Tales/side-by-side/]</ref> and is Emmy's younger brother. For the most part, he and Emmy get along fine, but occasionally have arguments due to him being prone to anger. His best friend is Ord. Though Max loves Emmy, he sometimes struggles with being the younger brother, and is usually frustrated about being too little to do certain things, or when Emmy acts in certain ways. He\u2019s of an adventurous sort and sometimes helps to give courage to Ord when he's afraid of certain things. He\u2019s kind to others, but often enjoys acting silly or goofy. He sometimes acts in a stubborn manner, determined to prove that a child his age can do things on his own, even when he really needs help. He usually wears a green short-sleeved shirt with yellow on the collar & edges of the shirt-sleeves and brown slacks.<ref name=\"chardesc\" /> Max was named after the son of executive producer Jim Coane.<ref name=\"eurewebsite\" />\n\n===Enrique===\nEnrique, voiced by Aida Ortega, is 6-years-old. He\u2019s Emmy and Max's new friend and next-door neighbor who moved from [[Colombia]] to the United States and also once lived in Puerto Rico. He\u2019s raised by his father and his grandmother (\"''abuelita''\") <ref name=\"officialfaq\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/faq_general.html|accessdate=March 7, 2017|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Frequently Asked Questions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213062357/http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/faq_general.html|archivedate=December 13, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He first appears in the Season 3 episode, To Fly With A New Friend, and travels to Dragon Land with the children when Max encourages Emmy to share their secret, despite Emmy's reluctance. His recent experiences in South America provide more opportunities for the characters to demonstrate the meanings of new Spanish words.<ref name=\"officialfaq\" />\n\nHe rides with Zak and Wheezie, the two-headed dragon who rarely flew with any human friends prior to Enrique's debut in Season 3.\n\nHis personality is somewhat bashful, missing his homeland of Colombia and sometimes shy to join in on new experiences and saddened by reminders of times from his old home. However, he finds that he enjoys himself when he allows himself to let go, express his feelings and then move forward to have fun. He\u2019s raised by his grandparents and described as an intensely smart and logical character. A series of moves throughout his early life has left him jaded and wary of both making new friends and trying new things. He normally wears a bright yellow short-sleeved shirt and blue jeans.<ref name=\"officialfaq\" />\n\nThe presence of Enrique on the program, in conjunction with Max and Emmy, was the subject of a study \"'They Are?!' Latino Difference vis-\u00e0-vis Dragon Tales,\" which was critical of the show's use of the characters, feeling that the series ultimately \"undermines multiculturalism because it fails to nurture children's ability to live fearlessly with and within difference.\"<ref name=\"theyare\">{{cite web|url=http://citeweb.info/20092083465|title=\"They Are?!\": Latino Difference vis-\u00e0-vis Dragon Tales|last=Serrato|first=Phillip|date=|year=2009|website=|doi=10.1177/1532708608325936|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301092905/http://citeweb.info/20092083465|archive-date=1 March 2017|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Ord===\nOrd, voiced by [[Ty Olsson]], is a strong blue male dragon who\u2019s Max\u2019s best friend. He\u2019s extremely fond of food and always carries some just in case; a running gag in the show features Ord making \"Dragon Corn\" by throwing the kernels in the air and popping them with his fire breath. He\u2019s also allergic to dandelions. Despite his physical strength, Ord is afraid of almost everything, particularly darkness and thunder, and possesses a magical tendency to turn invisible when he is upset or frightened. Ord's sun-shaped Dragon Badge glows when he faces his fears.<ref name=\"sproutchar\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|title=Sprout Online - ''Dragon Tales'' - Parents - \"Who are the main characters in the series?\"|accessdate=March 7, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213025018/http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archivedate=December 13, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Cassie===\nCassie, voiced by [[Chantal Strand]], is a shy, cute, demure and sweet pink female dragon and Emmy's best friend. She possesses a magical tendency to shrink when unhappy, may occasionally come across as slightly insecure and uncertain, and is prone to worrying. However, Cassie is distinguished by her maternal sweetness as a result of her responsibilities as an older sister and babysitter to a humongous myriad of younger siblings, and has been shown to be gifted with great singing and dancing abilities. Cassie also is characterized by her color combination consisting of pink and yellow, albeit her body is spotted with blue speckles in some areas. Cassie knows just about everything there is to know about Dragon Land and has a deep love of fairy-tales, both stemming from her love of reading. Her dragon badge glows when she feels confident, but she often worries about making a mistake.<ref name=\"ctwcassie\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctw.org/preschool/dragontales/characters/0,4278,cassie,00.html|title=Dragontales - characters - \"Meet Cassie!\"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000620023542/http://www.ctw.org/preschool/dragontales/characters/0,4278,cassie,00.html|archive-date=June 20, 2000|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Zak and Wheezie===\nZak and Wheezie, voiced by Jason Michas and [[Kathleen Barr]], are [[conjoined twin]] dragons with opposite personalities; Zak (green) is male, and Wheezie (purple) is female. Zak is neat and clean, worries a lot, and is pessimistic about many things. His catchphrase is \"Take it easy, Wheezie!\", which he often says when Wheezie takes off running, dragging him with her. Wheezie, on the other hand, is bold, hyper, and free-spirited, with a tendency to be messy, much to her brother's annoyance. Her catchphrase is \"Love it!\", when she loves something. The two have a shared love of music and performing and they often perform in talent shows and recitals together.<ref name=\"sproutchar\" />\n\nZak and Wheezie always fly with Enrique, although prior to his debut, Zak and Wheezie rarely flew with any of their human friends. Their dragon badges glow when they work together and get along, though will sometimes glow independently when one of them accomplishes something on their own of significance. Although they fight a lot, they are very close and care about each other a lot.\n\n===Quetzal===\nQuetzal, portrayed by [[Eli Gabay]], is an elderly dragon who\u2019s the teacher at The School in the Sky where young dragons attend. He has an [[Twin|identical twin]] brother named Fernando who works in his garden. Quetzal typically speaks with a Mexican accent and is named after the Aztec deity [[Quetzalcoatl]]. He tries to encourage his students to find solutions to their problems on their own, but is a sounding board who offers stability and comfort, as well as sound advice.<ref name=\"sproutchar\" /> In the episode 'Snow Dragon,' Quetzal mentions it has been hundreds of years since he visited the dragon snow sculpture as a child, implying he is centuries old.\n\n===Other characters===\nEach of the following have appeared more than once:\n* Arlo, a dragon who works at the Dragon Dump, he has a machine at the Dragon Dump which he calls his \"lil' ol' recycler\" that sorts out things that can be used again.

([[Ian James Corlett]])\n* The Doodle Fairy, a fairy with green skin and purple dress. She doesn't speak, but can doodle. Later installments depict the character as being crowned queen of an entire group of doodle fairies.\n* Eunice, a winged unicorn. She cannot see very well, so she wears glasses. ([[Janyse Jaud]])\n* Finn, voiced by Ellen Kennedy, is Cassie's younger brother. He is light blue, toddler-aged, attached to his blankie, and only just learning to fly.

It is home to numerous colorful, anthropomorphic dragons and many other fantastical creatures. Max and Emmy travel to Dragon Land  by holding an enchanted dragon scale while reciting the rhyme: \"I wish, I wish, with all my heart, to fly with dragons in a land apart.\" The scale then teleports them to Dragon Land. It appears that it does not matter who does or does not say the rhyme, as long as at least one person says it; whoever is holding the dragon scale while they say the rhyme will be teleported with them. Returning home from Dragon Land is done in the same fashion, although no dragon scale is needed. The rhyme is: \"I wish, I wish, to use this rhyme, to go back home until next time.\" The person reciting the rhyme, as well as all those holding their hand, will be transported back to where the reciter said the rhyme that took them to Dragon Land.\n*Basketball Court \u2013 For one episode, Emmy and Max and the dragons come here for a game of basketball.\n*Chile Valley \u2013 A valley with lots of tasty, yet spicy chilly peppers, which are red in color and resemble dragonberries.\n*The Cloud Factory \u2013 Where a dragon named Polly Nimbus manufactures rain clouds, snow clouds, etc., and ejects them into the sky as needed.\n*Crystal Cave \u2013 A giant, crystallized cave where crystals are stored and special crystals dance, with the aid of water from Singing Springs, and some Dandelion fuzzies from the Dandelion Forest.\n*Crystal Fountain \u2013 A fountain inside Crystal Cave for cleaning.\n*Dandelion Forest \u2013 A forest made of dandelions that actually roar and growl like real lions, and are as tall as trees.

In the first half, they discovered Ord's missing tooth, while the adventures continued in the second story with Ord facing his fear of the dark. A total of forty episodes were aired in the first season, with the finale airing on April 28, 2000. The show's second season premiered on June 4, 2001 and had 25 episodes. 20 of these episodes were broadcast from June 4, 2001 to September 20, 2001. The final installment of this set, \"Just the Two of Us/Cowboy Max,\" was broadcast only in non-U.S. markets such as Guam and Canada and did not premiere to U.S. audiences until the program's third season, though \"Cowboy Max\" was released on DVD prior to this. The special \"Let's Start a Band!,\" featuring the dragon characters blended with live humans in a musical show based on the program's \"Dragon Tunes\" segments, was released on March 2, 2003. Following this, no new episodes were aired until February 21, 2005, leading many long-time viewers to believe the program had been quietly canceled. The new season introduced the new character Enrique, an immigrant from Colombia, as well as an updated focus on folk songs and teaching of Spanish. The premiere installment, in two parts, showed Enrique being introduced to the sights and sounds of Dragon Lands, learning to fly on Zak & Wheezie, and having his first adventure. The second half appeared as \"The Mystery of the Missing Knuckerholes\" in some listings, but on the program was simply titled as Part 2 of the episode. Though 29 episodes were broadcast, including \"Just the Two of Us/Cowboy Max,\" only one story from each was original, while the others were a repeat of a story from the second season. The series officially concluded with the \"Big, Big Friends Day\" special on November 25, 2005.\n\nThe program's first musical album, ''Dragon Tunes'', was released on March 20, 2001 and featured the character themes of Cassie and Ord, as well as tunes such as \"Betcha Can,\" the \"Wiggle Song\" and \"Shake Your Dragon Tail.\"<ref name=\"tunes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Tunes-Brian-Garland/dp/B00005A09V/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1417007873&sr=1-1&keywords=dragon+tunes|title=Amazon - ''Dragon Tunes''|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref> A second album, ''More Dragon Tunes'', was issued on February 15, 2005.

The program was stated to use \"messages built into the children's series to inform parental challenges. From bedtime dramatics to tantrums and assorted other small-fry rebellions...\" For the special, parents were given video cameras used to record problematic behavior, then counselors analyzed the video footage and provided specific tips to the parents, who all reported significantly improved behavior two months later.

In all, there were a total of 155 original stories. The show also had two specials: ''Let's Start a Band'' and ''Big, Big Friend Day''. ''Let's Start a Band'' was a musical feature in which the characters of the show were seen alongside real human children. ''Big, Big Friend Day'', however, was merely a special featuring episodes of ''Dragon Tales'' and ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', with interstitial segments introducing characters from the new series ''[[It's a Big Big World]]''.

The kids and dragons embark on different adventures and attend the School in the Sky, all while learning how to face their fears and handle new situations.

The story focuses on the adventures of two ordinary kids, Emmy and Max, and their dragon friends Ord, Cassie, Zak, Wheezie, and Quetzal. The series began broadcasting on [[PBS]] on their [[PBS Kids]] block on September 6, 1999, with its final episode airing on April 1, 2005.

The project was considered something of a risky venture, because it was not based on a well-known franchise like many children's television programs, such as ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' or ''[[Paddington Bear]]''. The series was immediately shipped to PBS member stations at the suggestion of PBS, but all originally passed at the time. In October 1995, Jim Coane met Marjorie Kalins, senior VP of programming and production at Children's Television Workshop, and showed her the idea for the series. Kalins, who loved the idea, brought the series to Children's Television Workshop, who agreed to a partnership with the Columbia TriStar Television Group. Kalins helped him and Columbia TriStar Television obtain an $8.5 million grant from the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]. The grant proposal was written by Wesley Eure.<ref name=\"kidscreen\">{{Cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/1999/10/01/26892-19991001/|title=Dragon Tales|first=Theresa|last=Dillon|date=October 1, 1999|accessdate=February 28, 2017|publisher=[[Playback (magazine)#Kidscreen|Kidscreen]]}}</ref> Coane stated that there was never any consideration of trying to shop the program to a commercial broadcast network and that PBS was, in his mind, the only destination for the program.<ref name=\"Don't tell kids\">{{cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/715869/Dont-tell-kids-Dragon-Tales-is-a-show-thats-good-for-them.html|title=Don't tell kids 'Dragon Tales' is a show that's good for them|first=Scott|last=Pierce|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|date=September 3, 1999|accessdate=May 4, 2019}}</ref> As Columbia TriStar was the TV division of two major Hollywood [[Columbia Pictures|film]] [[TriStar Pictures|studios]], which in turn are owned by the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] division of Japanese multinational conglomerate [[Sony]], ''Dragon Tales'' became one of the few [[PBS Kids]] and [[Sprout (TV network)|Sprout]] programs to be co-produced by a major Hollywood studio's TV subsidiary; The other PBS shows were ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' (made by [[Walt Disney Television]]) and ''[[Curious George (TV series)|Curious George]]'' (produced by [[Universal Television]]). In 2002, C-T was renamed to [[Sony Pictures Television]], a company that would co-produce the third season of the program.\n\nAfter a tour of the lot of Sony Studios, Wesley Eure created the first treatment of the show, including the initial conception of the two-headed dragon Zak and Wheezie, back then known as \"Snarf and Bugger.\" The series received a massive multi-million dollar grant from the federal government, beating out ''[[The Muppets]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]'' for the request. As part of the conditions for the grant, Eure was required to create a companion series for the program, which he titled ''Show and Tell Me'', based on his own lecture series known as \"Anyone Can Write a Book.\" Though the companion series was never actually created, Eure remains hopeful that it will one day be produced. Eure's name was not included in the initial credits for the series, forcing him to hire an attorney to ensure that he received credit.<ref name=\"eurewebsite\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wesleyeure.com/Wesley_Eure/Dragon_Tales.html|title=Dragon Tales - Wesley Eure|accessdate=March 13, 2017|first=Wesley|last=Eure}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the development of a [[Bible (screenwriting)|show bible]] by Jeffrey Scott, with some tweaks by writers Cliff Ruby and Elana Lesser, the series was ordered for just over 60 eleven-minute episodes by PBS. Scott was assigned to write and edit half, with Ruby/Lesser assigned to the other half. At this point, the writing team was provided with a document titled \"FUN AND LEARNING IN DRAGON LAND: A Writer\u2019s Guide to Dragon Tales Educational Content\" which provided directives as to which curriculum should be included within the stories, such as \"emotional challenges > understanding other people\u2019s emotions > recognizing and labeling feelings in others\" and the statement that \"CURRICULUM IS PARAMOUNT!\"  After the creation of the first script, all writing parties involved agreed that the scripts \"weren\u2019t fun or funny, they were flat and boring.\" The writers successfully explained to the consultants, educators and psychologists of PBS that children watch television to be entertained and must be entertained in order to be educated. They were then provided with a new directive, \"Come up with entertaining stories and shoehorn in the curriculum wherever it fits!\" Scott states that from the experience he learned an invaluable lesson about how to create a successful preschool series.<ref name=\"entertainfirst\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/blog/formula-successful-preschool-series-entertain-first-educate-last|title= FORMULA FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRESCHOOL SERIES: ENTERTAIN FIRST, EDUCATE LAST - A Dragon Tale: How an Emmy-nominated PBS preschool series almost died at birth...|first=Jeffrey|last=Scott|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=January 14, 2017|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref> [[Dong Woo Animation]], [[Rough Draft Korea]], [[Sunwoo Entertainment]], [[Wang Film Productions]] (season 1 only), [[Yearim]], and lotto animation contributed some of the animation for this series.\n\n===Show premise and overview===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 15em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = left\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = ''Dragon Tales'' has three primary educational goals.

Befriended by four friendly talking dragons with distinctive personalities, Ord, Cassie, Zak, and Wheezie, they frequently travel to Dragon Land and help their friends in fulfilling particular quests, assisting them in their daily problems, and learning important morals through their experiences with Dragon Land.\n\nDesigned to educate preschoolers mildly in Hispanic culture, a new character named Enrique debuted during the show's final season, providing the series with a third protagonist. Surrounded by a variety of unique characters and faced with numerous differing situations, Emmy and Max commonly embark on adventures with their dragon friends, conquering fears or achieving goals in spite of any obstacles preventing them from doing so.\n\nAs a series broadcast on PBS, the program had an educational focus, combining lessons of a pro-social nature with those of more general educational value. Educational themes covered included identifying shapes, learning words and letters in both English and Spanish, counting and basic math. Social themes were also covered, such as good sportsmanship, the importance of being a good friend, overcoming obstacles such as jealousy or fears and getting along with siblings. Many of the show's interstitial song segments, known as \"Dragon Tunes,\" also covered such themes, such as \"Make It Fun\", which encouraged viewers to not complain about having to do seemingly mundane chores such as washing dishes or helping parents with cooking meals, but instead find ways to make them fun. Another, \"Hum,\" encouraged those who had a fear of the dark or trying new things to hum a gentle tune to comfort them. Stated goals of the program's educational philosophy included the encouragement of pursuing new experiences, finding ways to approach and learn from challenges and that learning can come through trying and not succeeding.<ref name=\"ephilosophy\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/educational_philosophy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308175138/http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/educational_philosophy.html|archive-date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=December 4, 2014|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Educational Philosophy}}</ref> Despite two of the show's human leads, Emmy and Enrique, being six years old, the show's described target audience was children closer to the age of four.<ref name=\"target\">Scott, Jeffrey.

In \"Cassie, the Green-Eyed Dragon,\" Cassie felt jealous of her little brother, Finn, when he gets everyone's attention when she takes him to school for \"[[circle time]].\" Discussing the matter with her best friend, Emmy, and her teacher, Quetzal, helps her to understand that jealousy is a natural feeling that everyone experiences sometimes, but that there are ways that she can appreciate her brother, while still feeling appreciated herself.<ref name=\"greeneyed\">''Dragon Tales'' story - Season 2 - \"Cassie, the Green-Eyed Dragon\"</ref> In \"Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os, Enrique,\" Enrique feels sad and homesick for his homeland of Colombia when his birthday celebrations in Dragon Land aren't like the traditions of those back in his old home.

She\u2019s Max's older sister. Her best friend is Cassie, and she\u2019s perhaps known for saying, \"Definitely!\" whenever a good idea arises. Though Emmy isn\u2019t ashamed to do \"girly\" things with Cassie, she\u2019s also heavily into sports and games and generally is up for any activity regardless of traditional gender roles. Though she experiences occasional jealousy of her brother, the two are otherwise usually together within Dragon Land and share many adventures. Though a brave, smart natural leader, she\u2019s also impulsive and doesn\u2019t always think before she acts. She\u2019s typically seen wearing a blue button-up dress over a red short sleeve shirt.<ref name=\"chardesc\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308175122/http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archive-date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=December 4, 2014|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Character Descriptions}}</ref>\n\n===Max===\nMaximilian \"Max\", voiced by [[Danny McKinnon]], is 4-years-old,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130924074134/http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Dragon-Tales/side-by-side/ http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Dragon-Tales/side-by-side/]</ref> and is Emmy's younger brother. For the most part, he and Emmy get along fine, but occasionally have arguments due to him being prone to anger. His best friend is Ord. Though Max loves Emmy, he sometimes struggles with being the younger brother, and is usually frustrated about being too little to do certain things, or when Emmy acts in certain ways. He\u2019s of an adventurous sort and sometimes helps to give courage to Ord when he's afraid of certain things. He\u2019s kind to others, but often enjoys acting silly or goofy. He sometimes acts in a stubborn manner, determined to prove that a child his age can do things on his own, even when he really needs help. He usually wears a green short-sleeved shirt with yellow on the collar & edges of the shirt-sleeves and brown slacks.<ref name=\"chardesc\" /> Max was named after the son of executive producer Jim Coane.<ref name=\"eurewebsite\" />\n\n===Enrique===\nEnrique, voiced by Aida Ortega, is 6-years-old. He\u2019s Emmy and Max's new friend and next-door neighbor who moved from [[Colombia]] to the United States and also once lived in Puerto Rico. He\u2019s raised by his father and his grandmother (\"''abuelita''\") <ref name=\"officialfaq\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/faq_general.html|accessdate=March 7, 2017|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Frequently Asked Questions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213062357/http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/faq_general.html|archivedate=December 13, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He first appears in the Season 3 episode, To Fly With A New Friend, and travels to Dragon Land with the children when Max encourages Emmy to share their secret, despite Emmy's reluctance. His recent experiences in South America provide more opportunities for the characters to demonstrate the meanings of new Spanish words.<ref name=\"officialfaq\" />\n\nHe rides with Zak and Wheezie, the two-headed dragon who rarely flew with any human friends prior to Enrique's debut in Season 3.\n\nHis personality is somewhat bashful, missing his homeland of Colombia and sometimes shy to join in on new experiences and saddened by reminders of times from his old home. However, he finds that he enjoys himself when he allows himself to let go, express his feelings and then move forward to have fun. He\u2019s raised by his grandparents and described as an intensely smart and logical character. A series of moves throughout his early life has left him jaded and wary of both making new friends and trying new things. He normally wears a bright yellow short-sleeved shirt and blue jeans.<ref name=\"officialfaq\" />\n\nThe presence of Enrique on the program, in conjunction with Max and Emmy, was the subject of a study \"'They Are?!' Latino Difference vis-\u00e0-vis Dragon Tales,\" which was critical of the show's use of the characters, feeling that the series ultimately \"undermines multiculturalism because it fails to nurture children's ability to live fearlessly with and within difference.\"<ref name=\"theyare\">{{cite web|url=http://citeweb.info/20092083465|title=\"They Are?!\": Latino Difference vis-\u00e0-vis Dragon Tales|last=Serrato|first=Phillip|date=|year=2009|website=|doi=10.1177/1532708608325936|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301092905/http://citeweb.info/20092083465|archive-date=1 March 2017|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Ord===\nOrd, voiced by [[Ty Olsson]], is a strong blue male dragon who\u2019s Max\u2019s best friend. He\u2019s extremely fond of food and always carries some just in case; a running gag in the show features Ord making \"Dragon Corn\" by throwing the kernels in the air and popping them with his fire breath. He\u2019s also allergic to dandelions. Despite his physical strength, Ord is afraid of almost everything, particularly darkness and thunder, and possesses a magical tendency to turn invisible when he is upset or frightened. Ord's sun-shaped Dragon Badge glows when he faces his fears.<ref name=\"sproutchar\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|title=Sprout Online - ''Dragon Tales'' - Parents - \"Who are the main characters in the series?\"|accessdate=March 7, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213025018/http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archivedate=December 13, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Cassie===\nCassie, voiced by [[Chantal Strand]], is a shy, cute, demure and sweet pink female dragon and Emmy's best friend. She possesses a magical tendency to shrink when unhappy, may occasionally come across as slightly insecure and uncertain, and is prone to worrying. However, Cassie is distinguished by her maternal sweetness as a result of her responsibilities as an older sister and babysitter to a humongous myriad of younger siblings, and has been shown to be gifted with great singing and dancing abilities. Cassie also is characterized by her color combination consisting of pink and yellow, albeit her body is spotted with blue speckles in some areas. Cassie knows just about everything there is to know about Dragon Land and has a deep love of fairy-tales, both stemming from her love of reading. Her dragon badge glows when she feels confident, but she often worries about making a mistake.<ref name=\"ctwcassie\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctw.org/preschool/dragontales/characters/0,4278,cassie,00.html|title=Dragontales - characters - \"Meet Cassie!\"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000620023542/http://www.ctw.org/preschool/dragontales/characters/0,4278,cassie,00.html|archive-date=June 20, 2000|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Zak and Wheezie===\nZak and Wheezie, voiced by Jason Michas and [[Kathleen Barr]], are [[conjoined twin]] dragons with opposite personalities; Zak (green) is male, and Wheezie (purple) is female. Zak is neat and clean, worries a lot, and is pessimistic about many things. His catchphrase is \"Take it easy, Wheezie!\", which he often says when Wheezie takes off running, dragging him with her. Wheezie, on the other hand, is bold, hyper, and free-spirited, with a tendency to be messy, much to her brother's annoyance. Her catchphrase is \"Love it!\", when she loves something. The two have a shared love of music and performing and they often perform in talent shows and recitals together.<ref name=\"sproutchar\" />\n\nZak and Wheezie always fly with Enrique, although prior to his debut, Zak and Wheezie rarely flew with any of their human friends. Their dragon badges glow when they work together and get along, though will sometimes glow independently when one of them accomplishes something on their own of significance. Although they fight a lot, they are very close and care about each other a lot.\n\n===Quetzal===\nQuetzal, portrayed by [[Eli Gabay]], is an elderly dragon who\u2019s the teacher at The School in the Sky where young dragons attend. He has an [[Twin|identical twin]] brother named Fernando who works in his garden. Quetzal typically speaks with a Mexican accent and is named after the Aztec deity [[Quetzalcoatl]]. He tries to encourage his students to find solutions to their problems on their own, but is a sounding board who offers stability and comfort, as well as sound advice.<ref name=\"sproutchar\" /> In the episode 'Snow Dragon,' Quetzal mentions it has been hundreds of years since he visited the dragon snow sculpture as a child, implying he is centuries old.\n\n===Other characters===\nEach of the following have appeared more than once:\n* Arlo, a dragon who works at the Dragon Dump, he has a machine at the Dragon Dump which he calls his \"lil' ol' recycler\" that sorts out things that can be used again.

It is home to numerous colorful, anthropomorphic dragons and many other fantastical creatures. Max and Emmy travel to Dragon Land  by holding an enchanted dragon scale while reciting the rhyme: \"I wish, I wish, with all my heart, to fly with dragons in a land apart.\" The scale then teleports them to Dragon Land. It appears that it does not matter who does or does not say the rhyme, as long as at least one person says it; whoever is holding the dragon scale while they say the rhyme will be teleported with them. Returning home from Dragon Land is done in the same fashion, although no dragon scale is needed. The rhyme is: \"I wish, I wish, to use this rhyme, to go back home until next time.\" The person reciting the rhyme, as well as all those holding their hand, will be transported back to where the reciter said the rhyme that took them to Dragon Land.\n*Basketball Court \u2013 For one episode, Emmy and Max and the dragons come here for a game of basketball.\n*Chile Valley \u2013 A valley with lots of tasty, yet spicy chilly peppers, which are red in color and resemble dragonberries.\n*The Cloud Factory \u2013 Where a dragon named Polly Nimbus manufactures rain clouds, snow clouds, etc., and ejects them into the sky as needed.\n*Crystal Cave \u2013 A giant, crystallized cave where crystals are stored and special crystals dance, with the aid of water from Singing Springs, and some Dandelion fuzzies from the Dandelion Forest.\n*Crystal Fountain \u2013 A fountain inside Crystal Cave for cleaning.\n*Dandelion Forest \u2013 A forest made of dandelions that actually roar and growl like real lions, and are as tall as trees.

Of course, there are also lots of other knuckerholes all over Dragonland.\n*Lost Forever Hole \u2013 A small tunnel formed by a river.

In the first half, they discovered Ord's missing tooth, while the adventures continued in the second story with Ord facing his fear of the dark. A total of forty episodes were aired in the first season, with the finale airing on April 28, 2000. The show's second season premiered on June 4, 2001 and had 25 episodes. 20 of these episodes were broadcast from June 4, 2001 to September 20, 2001. The final installment of this set, \"Just the Two of Us/Cowboy Max,\" was broadcast only in non-U.S. markets such as Guam and Canada and did not premiere to U.S. audiences until the program's third season, though \"Cowboy Max\" was released on DVD prior to this. The special \"Let's Start a Band!,\" featuring the dragon characters blended with live humans in a musical show based on the program's \"Dragon Tunes\" segments, was released on March 2, 2003. Following this, no new episodes were aired until February 21, 2005, leading many long-time viewers to believe the program had been quietly canceled. The new season introduced the new character Enrique, an immigrant from Colombia, as well as an updated focus on folk songs and teaching of Spanish. The premiere installment, in two parts, showed Enrique being introduced to the sights and sounds of Dragon Lands, learning to fly on Zak & Wheezie, and having his first adventure. The second half appeared as \"The Mystery of the Missing Knuckerholes\" in some listings, but on the program was simply titled as Part 2 of the episode. Though 29 episodes were broadcast, including \"Just the Two of Us/Cowboy Max,\" only one story from each was original, while the others were a repeat of a story from the second season. The series officially concluded with the \"Big, Big Friends Day\" special on November 25, 2005.\n\nThe program's first musical album, ''Dragon Tunes'', was released on March 20, 2001 and featured the character themes of Cassie and Ord, as well as tunes such as \"Betcha Can,\" the \"Wiggle Song\" and \"Shake Your Dragon Tail.\"<ref name=\"tunes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Tunes-Brian-Garland/dp/B00005A09V/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1417007873&sr=1-1&keywords=dragon+tunes|title=Amazon - ''Dragon Tunes''|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref> A second album, ''More Dragon Tunes'', was issued on February 15, 2005.

The program was stated to use \"messages built into the children's series to inform parental challenges. From bedtime dramatics to tantrums and assorted other small-fry rebellions...\" For the special, parents were given video cameras used to record problematic behavior, then counselors analyzed the video footage and provided specific tips to the parents, who all reported significantly improved behavior two months later.

In all, there were a total of 155 original stories. The show also had two specials: ''Let's Start a Band'' and ''Big, Big Friend Day''. ''Let's Start a Band'' was a musical feature in which the characters of the show were seen alongside real human children. ''Big, Big Friend Day'', however, was merely a special featuring episodes of ''Dragon Tales'' and ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', with interstitial segments introducing characters from the new series ''[[It's a Big Big World]]''.

The kids and dragons embark on different adventures and attend the School in the Sky, all while learning how to face their fears and handle new situations.

He took a Scriptural view of the origin of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopian]]s, Egyptians, and other races of ancient Africa, arguing that they were descended from the four sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]; and showed from classic authority the high civilisation to which they had attained when Greece was yet barbarous, and before Rome arose. [[Herodotus]] had spoken of the Ethiopians as remarkable for their stature, longevity, and physical beauty; and although in the eyes of the white man they were not remarkable for the latter quality at present, the influence of adverse circumstances and of centuries of oppression should be taken into account. There was scarcely a race, he showed, on the face of the earth, which had not declined in intellectual power and physical beauty under the same influences, and in the medi\u00e6val ages, when Englishmen were sold as slaves, they were described by their purchasers, the Irishmen and Romans, as ugly and stupid. The lecturer then dwelt more particularly upon the leading characteristics of the African race, their religious tendency, and the predominance of the moral over the intellectual in their character\u2014the affeetionateness of their disposition, their love of humour, &c. He gave many weighty hits at Anglo-Saxon civilisation, which told well with the audience, who appeared very much delighted. He was listened to with deep attention, and loudly applauded.<ref>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[Liverpool Mercury]] ([[Liverpool, England]])\n|date=August 26, 1857\n|title=The African Race.

He took a Scriptural view of the origin of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopian]]s, Egyptians, and other races of ancient Africa, arguing that they were descended from the four sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]; and showed from classic authority the high civilisation to which they had attained when Greece was yet barbarous, and before Rome arose. [[Herodotus]] had spoken of the Ethiopians as remarkable for their stature, longevity, and physical beauty; and although in the eyes of the white man they were not remarkable for the latter quality at present, the influence of adverse circumstances and of centuries of oppression should be taken into account. There was scarcely a race, he showed, on the face of the earth, which had not declined in intellectual power and physical beauty under the same influences, and in the medi\u00e6val ages, when Englishmen were sold as slaves, they were described by their purchasers, the Irishmen and Romans, as ugly and stupid. The lecturer then dwelt more particularly upon the leading characteristics of the African race, their religious tendency, and the predominance of the moral over the intellectual in their character\u2014the affeetionateness of their disposition, their love of humour, &c. He gave many weighty hits at Anglo-Saxon civilisation, which told well with the audience, who appeared very much delighted. He was listened to with deep attention, and loudly applauded.<ref>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[Liverpool Mercury]] ([[Liverpool, England]])\n|date=August 26, 1857\n|title=The African Race.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

Ritter's character, Paul Hennessy, was said to have died after collapsing in a grocery store while buying milk. ABC aired the first three episodes of the show's second season that had been taped before his death, each of which was introduced by Katey Sagal. The remainder of the show dealt with the family trying to grapple with Paul's death. New male characters, played by [[James Garner]] and [[David Spade]], were later added to the main cast as Ritter's replacements. Shortly before his death, Ritter had done a week-long taping with ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', which was aired as a tribute to him, introduced by [[Henry Winkler]], the executive producer of the show and very close friend of Ritter's.

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The album was released in March 1978 on [[Monument Records]] and was produced by [[Ray Baker (music producer)|Ray Baker]]. It was Smith's final studio album released under Monument and contained four singles released between 1977 and 1978, including \"[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]].\"\n\n== Background ==\n''New Horizons'' consisted of ten tracks new material recorded by Connie Smith. The album included three cover versions: \"[[The Wayward Wind]]\" originally by [[Gogi Grant]], \"[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]]\" by [[Andy Gibb]] and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" by [[Debby Boone]]. Like her previous album for Monument, ''[[Pure Connie Smith]],'' ''New Horizons'' was recorded with material that had a softer [[Country pop]] sound. Under Monument Records, Smith's musical style changed from Pure Country (which she had recorded under [[RCA Victor]] and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]) to [[Adult Contemporary]] and [[Disco music|Disco]]. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of ''[[Allmusic]]'' reviewed Smith's 1993 compilation, ''Greatest Hits on Monument'' (which included seven tracks from ''New Horizons'') and did not receive her musical sound well, stating, \"Smith still sings well throughout it, but it's not a very good showcase for her talents, nor is it very good as crossover pop -- it's too square and middle of the road, making the urban cowboy bubbling up at the time seem risky and edgy.\" Erlewine did find Smith's cover of \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything,\" \"relatively faithful\" to the original version.<ref name=\"allmusicreview\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r168958/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Greatest Hits on Monument'' > Review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|publisher=[[allmusic]]|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref> It was issued on a [[LP album]], with five songs on each side of the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/connie_smith/new_horizons/|title=''New Horizons'' by Connie Smith|publisher=[[Rate Your Music]]|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''New Horizons'' spawned four singles to the Billboard Country Chart between 1977 and 1978. The first single was Smith's cover of \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything.\" Released in September 1977, the song became the album's biggest hit, reaching #14 on the ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart and #23 on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks chart, becoming her final Top 20 hit.

It was Smith's final studio album released under Monument and contained four singles released between 1977 and 1978, including \"[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]].\"\n\n== Background ==\n''New Horizons'' consisted of ten tracks new material recorded by Connie Smith. The album included three cover versions: \"[[The Wayward Wind]]\" originally by [[Gogi Grant]], \"[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]]\" by [[Andy Gibb]] and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" by [[Debby Boone]]. Like her previous album for Monument, ''[[Pure Connie Smith]],'' ''New Horizons'' was recorded with material that had a softer [[Country pop]] sound. Under Monument Records, Smith's musical style changed from Pure Country (which she had recorded under [[RCA Victor]] and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]) to [[Adult Contemporary]] and [[Disco music|Disco]]. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of ''[[Allmusic]]'' reviewed Smith's 1993 compilation, ''Greatest Hits on Monument'' (which included seven tracks from ''New Horizons'') and did not receive her musical sound well, stating, \"Smith still sings well throughout it, but it's not a very good showcase for her talents, nor is it very good as crossover pop -- it's too square and middle of the road, making the urban cowboy bubbling up at the time seem risky and edgy.\" Erlewine did find Smith's cover of \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything,\" \"relatively faithful\" to the original version.<ref name=\"allmusicreview\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r168958/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Greatest Hits on Monument'' > Review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|publisher=[[allmusic]]|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref> It was issued on a [[LP album]], with five songs on each side of the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/connie_smith/new_horizons/|title=''New Horizons'' by Connie Smith|publisher=[[Rate Your Music]]|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''New Horizons'' spawned four singles to the Billboard Country Chart between 1977 and 1978. The first single was Smith's cover of \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything.\" Released in September 1977, the song became the album's biggest hit, reaching #14 on the ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart and #23 on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks chart, becoming her final Top 20 hit. The second single, \"Lovin' You Baby\" reached the ''Billboard'' Country Top 40 at #34, becoming her final Top 40 single.<ref name=\"charts\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r168958/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}|title=Charts & awards > Greatest Hits on Monument|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref> The third single, \"They'll Never Be Another for Me\" peaked only at #68 on the Billboard Country Chart.
