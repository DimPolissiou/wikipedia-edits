Despite this, [[Daniel O'Connell]] had trouble arranging rallies in [[Ulster]] for his [[Repeal Association]], that sought repeal of the Act of Union. Having successfully arranged supportive \"monster meetings\" in the rest of Ireland, his visit to Belfast in 1841 was marked by stonings, hostile and supportive crowds, and threats of riots.<ref>[http://www.historyireland.com/volumes/volume13/issue2/features/?id=113816 Online notes about O'Connell's visit in 1841]</ref> Long before the 1885 Bill it was already clear that a significant number of Irish people wanted to maintain the Union, particularly those resident in Ulster who were not Roman Catholics.\n\nAnglicans of the established [[Church of Ireland]] and the other Protestant groups such as [[Presbyterian]]s had had different legal rights and priorities, and mutual disagreements, until the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland by the [[Irish Church Act 1869]]. While the Act was passed to reflect the small percentage of Church of Ireland members in the Irish population, and to increase the [[self-esteem]] of Irish Roman Catholics, the resulting level playing field allowed the different Protestant groups to act as political equals for the first time.\n\nFrom 1882 [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] turned his attention from Irish [[Land League|land reform]] to pursuing [[Irish Home Rule movement|Home Rule]].

[[Lord Randolph Churchill]] played it with gusto. In 1886, the year of Gladstone's first Home Rule Bill, Churchill crossed to Belfast to make an inflammatory anti-Home Rule speech in the [[Ulster Hall]], and a little later, coined the memorable phrase, \"Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right''\"''.<ref name=\"Holt\"/>\n\nParnell's political opponents pointed out that he was the only non-Catholic MP in his party. To avoid further accusations about Rome Rule, he nominated six other non-Catholics for safe seats (out of the IPP's new total of 85 MPs) in the [[1886 United Kingdom general election|1886 election]].\n\n===Other elements===\nAs the Irish nationalist movement recovered in the 1890s from the division caused by Parnell's relationship with [[Katharine O'Shea|Mrs O'Shea]], it embraced [[Gaelic Athletic Association|Gaelic games]] and a growing [[Irish language]] revival movement, which were often encouraged by the Catholic Church for the good of its parishioners, but which also alienated Irish Protestants. The fate of [[Bridget Cleary]] in 1895 suggested that many rural Irish Catholics were still unduly superstitious. An \"Irish-Ireland\" ideology of nationalism was developed by [[D.P. Moran|David Moran]], who stated in 1905 that it was essential to be Catholic to be Irish.\n\nThe resurgent Church's dogma on the [[Syllabus of Errors]] (1864) and [[Papal infallibility]] (1871) were unattractive. For observant Protestants the encyclical [http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13ac.htm \"''Apostolicae Curae''\"] in 1896 had simply denied the validity of the Anglican hierarchy. In 1907 [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]] was proscribed in ''[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]'' and [http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_df07ls.htm ''Lamentabili sane''], indicating that no Protestant, being a [[heresy|heretic]], could ever be well regarded by a Catholic-led government.\n\nOpponents of Rome Rule could also quote from several anti-clerical books by [[Margaret Anna Cusack|Margaret Cusack]], the founder of [[The Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace]], who had then converted to Protestantism in 1887.<ref>Cusack, A. ''What Rome Teaches'' (1892); ''The Black Pope: History of the Jesuits''(1896); ''Revolution and War, the secret conspiracy of the Jesuits in Great Britain'' (published posthumously, 1910).</ref> In ''The Nun of Kenmare: An Autobiography'' (1889), Cusack complained that she had been vilified by her fellow churchmen behind her back: \"The practice of the [[Inquisition]] still holds in the Roman church, as I have found again and again, and as this book will show.

''Ne Temere'' was tolerated by the UK parliament as it had little impact in Britain; Irish Protestants felt that it would have a much greater impact in a future Catholic-dominated Home Rule Ireland. In 1911 debates, both views were considered, and notably those against ''Ne Temere'' were unionists and those tolerating it were not.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1911/feb/07/mixed-marriages-in-ireland Mixed marriages debate (Hansard) Feb 1911]</ref><ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1911/feb/28/marriage-law-the-ne-temere-decree Ne temere debate, Feb 1911 (Hansard)]</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|\"Index\"]], or list of books forbidden to Catholics, was modified by Pope Leo XIII.

F. McCarthy, in a book on \"Priests and People in Ireland\", makes a vigorous and uncompromising attack on the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Ireland. He ascribes the ills of Ireland mainly to a single cause, that is sacerdotalism. In his opinion it is the priesthood which is keeping Celtic Ireland \"poor, miserable, depressed, unprogressive\". Mr. Frank Hugh O'Donnell, himself a Roman Catholic and an Irish Nationalist, declares that notwithstanding the appalling poverty of masses of the Irish people, large sums are obtained by the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Ireland. He says that: \"All over Ireland urgent wants of the lay Catholic community are left unattended. All over Ireland, not even wants, but mere caprices of the clergy are the excuse for costly outlay. All over Ireland, and outside Ireland, the sight of collecting priests on all sorts of mendicant missions is an abiding vision. Sometimes it is to construct a sumptuous cathedral in a hamlet of grog-shops and hovels. Sometimes it is to raise a memorial church of marble at a cost of \u00a380,000 on an uninhabited hillside in Kerry out of respect to the birthplace of Daniel O\u2019Connell. Sometimes it is to defray the mistake of an architect. Sometimes it is to defray the bill of a Jew purveyor of decorative monstrosities. Never is it to endow the most crying needs of a Catholic university.\"\n\nWe hear from time to time that the Irish people are determined to formulate their own politics, and not to take them from Rome; but events constantly demonstrate that not only the religion but the politics of Ireland are those of the Church of Rome, and that the Irish people are still being exploited in the interest of clericalism and for the proselytising of England. The question is: How long will the people of Ireland permit themselves to be used in this way, and to constitute one of the most effectual barriers to Irish independence by the suspicion that Home Rule only means Rome Rule?|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nThe Irish socialist and nationalist [[James Connolly]] wrote much about religion and politics, but did not consider the insecurities of Irish loyalists. His optimistic view in 1910 was that the Catholic Church would accommodate itself with an Irish \"Workers' Republic\", and so Rome Rule could never occur:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/connolly/1910/lih/chap16.htm|title=James Connolly: Labour in Irish History - Chapter 16|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=North and the South will again clasp hands, again will it be demonstrated, as in \u201998, that the pressure of a common exploitation can make enthusiastic rebels out of a Protestant working class, earnest champions of civil and religious liberty out of Catholics, and out of both a united Social democracy.|author=|title=|source=}}\n\n==1912\u20131925==\n[[Image:Ireland protestants 1861-1991.gif|right|thumb|440px|Concentration of Protestants in Ireland per county.]]\nThe phrase took on a new lease of life from the introduction of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] in April 1912. Ulster loyalist opponents of Home Rule formed the [[Ulster Volunteers]] and their opponents in the rest of Ireland set up the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913. Both paramilitary groups imported arms, and by mid-1914 it seemed likely that an Irish civil war would erupt, with people's allegiances based largely, if not primarily, on their parents' religions.\n\n<blockquote>The Protestants' fears about a Dublin Parliament may seem to have been exaggerated at the time, but the history of Ireland since independence has, on the whole, tended to suggest that they were not.

His general policy of church supremacy led to [[Pius X#Church policies towards secular governments|antagonism across Europe]] between secular governments and his Church. Unlike other Catholic churches in Europe, such as in Spain or Portugal, the Irish Church was no longer semi-autonomous but had been assigned in 1833 to the [[Propaganda Fide|Congregation of Missions]] in Rome. As a result the Irish Church could be governed under [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] by the relatively informal [[motu proprio]] system. Concern about this led to proposals for safeguards in the debates that led to the [[Home Rule Act 1914]].<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1912/apr/11/religious-equality#S5CV0036P0-04178 Hansard statement 11 April 1912]</ref>\n\nLoyalists were unspecific about the likely effect of \"Rome Rule\", but it became an effective slogan in maintaining the loyalty of the Protestant working class, and contributed to the lack of trust which caused the near-civil war prior to the 1914 [[Third Home Rule Act]] and the [[Partition of Ireland]] during 1914\u201325.

The letter was not published until recently; it included:\n\n\"''Irish Catholics believe that their devotion to their religion and to the Holy See handicaps their efforts for independence.

Ulstermen were proud of their achievements and would have seen them as proof of the [[Max Weber|Weberian]] theory of the \"[[Protestant work ethic]]\".\n\nReligious faith combined with business acumen to raise in Ulster a fixed opposition to Home Rule, which was later expressed in the popular slogan, ''Home Rule means Rome Rule''.<ref name=\"Holt\">Holt, Edgar ''Protest in Arms'' Ch. III Orange Drums, pp.32\u201333, Putnam London (1960)</ref> The Ulster unionist subjective sense of separate identity, articulated in religious idiom, dominated Ulster unionist hostility to home rule. That home rule meant Rome Rule was, for the average Ulster Protestant, conclusive condemnation of any tampering with the union. Rome Rule conjured the nightmare of a native rising for a settler community. Economic factors merely reinforced racial pride.<ref>[[John Joseph Lee|Lee, J.

[[Lord Randolph Churchill]] played it with gusto. In 1886, the year of Gladstone's first Home Rule Bill, Churchill crossed to Belfast to make an inflammatory anti-Home Rule speech in the [[Ulster Hall]], and a little later, coined the memorable phrase, \"Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right''\"''.<ref name=\"Holt\"/>\n\nParnell's political opponents pointed out that he was the only non-Catholic MP in his party. To avoid further accusations about Rome Rule, he nominated six other non-Catholics for safe seats (out of the IPP's new total of 85 MPs) in the [[1886 United Kingdom general election|1886 election]].\n\n===Other elements===\nAs the Irish nationalist movement recovered in the 1890s from the division caused by Parnell's relationship with [[Katharine O'Shea|Mrs O'Shea]], it embraced [[Gaelic Athletic Association|Gaelic games]] and a growing [[Irish language]] revival movement, which were often encouraged by the Catholic Church for the good of its parishioners, but which also alienated Irish Protestants. The fate of [[Bridget Cleary]] in 1895 suggested that many rural Irish Catholics were still unduly superstitious. An \"Irish-Ireland\" ideology of nationalism was developed by [[D.P. Moran|David Moran]], who stated in 1905 that it was essential to be Catholic to be Irish.\n\nThe resurgent Church's dogma on the [[Syllabus of Errors]] (1864) and [[Papal infallibility]] (1871) were unattractive. For observant Protestants the encyclical [http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13ac.htm \"''Apostolicae Curae''\"] in 1896 had simply denied the validity of the Anglican hierarchy. In 1907 [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]] was proscribed in ''[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]'' and [http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_df07ls.htm ''Lamentabili sane''], indicating that no Protestant, being a [[heresy|heretic]], could ever be well regarded by a Catholic-led government.\n\nOpponents of Rome Rule could also quote from several anti-clerical books by [[Margaret Anna Cusack|Margaret Cusack]], the founder of [[The Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace]], who had then converted to Protestantism in 1887.<ref>Cusack, A. ''What Rome Teaches'' (1892); ''The Black Pope: History of the Jesuits''(1896); ''Revolution and War, the secret conspiracy of the Jesuits in Great Britain'' (published posthumously, 1910).</ref> In ''The Nun of Kenmare: An Autobiography'' (1889), Cusack complained that she had been vilified by her fellow churchmen behind her back: \"The practice of the [[Inquisition]] still holds in the Roman church, as I have found again and again, and as this book will show. You are condemned unheard.\"<ref>[http://www.catholicdigest.com/books/201011-01the-nun-of-kenmare/ ''Catholic Digest'' review, 1 Nov. 2010]</ref>\n\nThe [[Ne Temere|''Ne Temere'']] papal decree of 1907 required non-Catholics married to a Catholic to agree to educate their children as Catholics, and often the non-Catholic was required to convert before the marriage. ''Ne Temere'' was tolerated by the UK parliament as it had little impact in Britain; Irish Protestants felt that it would have a much greater impact in a future Catholic-dominated Home Rule Ireland. In 1911 debates, both views were considered, and notably those against ''Ne Temere'' were unionists and those tolerating it were not.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1911/feb/07/mixed-marriages-in-ireland Mixed marriages debate (Hansard) Feb 1911]</ref><ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1911/feb/28/marriage-law-the-ne-temere-decree Ne temere debate, Feb 1911 (Hansard)]</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|\"Index\"]], or list of books forbidden to Catholics, was modified by Pope Leo XIII. Along with indecent works it still included [[List of authors and works on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum|forbidden authors]] such as [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Daniel Defoe]], and the scientists [[John Locke]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], that most Europeans would by then have found unexceptional.\n\n==Socialist theorists on Rome Rule==\nThe English socialist organiser [[Harry Quelch]] wrote in his 1902 essay, \"Home Rule and Rome Rule\":\n*\"''It is not too much to say that from the time that a Pope of Rome formally sold Ireland to an English King, the Church of Rome has been the persistent, unrelenting enemy of Ireland and the Irish people.''\"\n*\"''A Roman Catholic writer, Mr. [[Michael McCarthy (Irish lawyer)|Michael J. F. McCarthy]], in a book on \"Priests and People in Ireland,\u201d makes a vigorous and uncompromising attack on the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Ireland.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cu31924029383944 McCarthy, MJF's book online; retrieved December 2009]</ref> He ascribes the ills of Ireland mainly to a single cause, that is sacerdotalism. In his opinion it is the priesthood which is keeping Celtic Ireland \"poor, miserable, depressed, unprogressive.\" Mr. [[Frank Hugh O'Donnell]], himself a Roman Catholic and an Irish Nationalist, declares that notwithstanding the appalling poverty of masses of the Irish people, large sums are obtained by the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Ireland. He says that:- \u201cAll over Ireland urgent wants of the lay Catholic community are left unattended. All over Ireland, not even wants, but mere caprices of the clergy are the excuse for costly outlay. All over Ireland, and outside Ireland, the sight of collecting priests on all sorts of mendicant missions is an abiding vision. Sometimes it is to construct a sumptuous cathedral in a hamlet of grog-shops and hovels. Sometimes it is to raise a memorial church of marble at a cost of \u00a380,000 on an uninhabited hillside in Kerry out of respect to the birthplace of Daniel O\u2019Connell. Sometimes it is to defray the mistake of an architect. Sometimes it is to defray the bill of a Jew purveyor of decorative monstrosities. Never is it to endow the most crying needs of a Catholic university.''\"\n*\"''We hear from time to time that the Irish people are determined to formulate their own politics, and not to take them from Rome; but events constantly demonstrate that not only the religion but the politics of Ireland are those of the Church of Rome, and that the Irish people are still being exploited in the interest of clericalism and for the proselytising of England. The question is: How long will the people of Ireland permit themselves to be used in this way, and to constitute one of the most effectual barriers to Irish independence by the suspicion that Home Rule only means Rome Rule?''\"<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/quelch/1902/11/home-rule.htm Quelch, H essay 1902]</ref>\n\nThe Irish socialist and nationalist [[James Connolly]] wrote much about religion and politics, but did not consider the insecurities of Irish loyalists. His optimistic view in 1910 was that the Catholic Church would accommodate itself with an Irish \"Workers' Republic\", and so Rome Rule could never occur:\n*\"''North and the South will again clasp hands, again will it be demonstrated, as in \u201998, that the pressure of a common exploitation can make enthusiastic rebels out of a Protestant working class, earnest champions of civil and religious liberty out of Catholics, and out of both a united Social democracy.''\"<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/connolly/1910/lih/chap16.htm Conolly, James 1910 chapter]</ref>\n\n==1912\u20131925==\n[[Image:Ireland protestants 1861-1991.gif|right|thumb|440px|Concentration of Protestants in Ireland per county.]]\nThe phrase took on a new lease of life from the introduction of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] in April 1912. Ulster loyalist opponents of Home Rule formed the [[Ulster Volunteers]] and their opponents in the rest of Ireland set up the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913. Both paramilitary groups imported arms, and by mid-1914 it seemed likely that an Irish civil war would erupt, with people's allegiances based largely, if not primarily, on their parents' religions.\n\n<blockquote>The Protestants' fears about a Dublin Parliament may seem to have been exaggerated at the time, but the history of Ireland since independence has, on the whole, tended to suggest that they were not. ''\"Home Rule\"'', they declared, ''\"would be Rome Rule, and that was all there was to it\"''. \"It may seem strange to you and me,\" [[Bonar Law]] told [[Riddell Baronets|Lord Riddell]], \"but it is a religious question. Those people are . . . . prepared to die for their convictions\".<ref>Stewart, A. T. Q.: p.44</ref></blockquote>\n\nIndeed, occasional speeches by leading Nationalists designed to allay [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] fears that \"Home Rule really would be Rome Rule,\" were in 1911 clearly making some Catholic churchmen anxious. The end and the reward of Home Rule commanded the sympathy of all of us, but the question is: Are they not as likely, or more likely, to have as their reward [[Secularism]] in the Schools?<ref>Miller, David W.: ''Church, State and Nation in Ireland 1898\u20131921, Home Rule Politics'', Gill & Macmillan, 1973, p.268-269 {{ISBN|0-7171-0645-4}}</ref>\n\nThe nationalist view was also indicatively divergent:<blockquote> \"Our home was a Catholic household; all the children were at Catholic schools and the Catholic University, so all the children\u2019s friends were Catholics, and all my grandmother\u2019s subtle match-making and her ambition\u2019s pre-supposed Catholic dynasties. ''Home Rule means Rome Rule'' said the Ulster Protestant slogan. Not at all.   .  .  .  .  .  .  It was 'our people', neither Rome nor the Protestant ascendancy, who should rule in Ireland. 'Our people', through an '''\u00e9lite''', sprung from it, trained for its service,  .  .  .  .  .  . The [[Jesuits]] were helping to train such an \u00e9lite\".<ref>[[Conor Cruise O'Brien|O'Brien, Conor Cruise]] ''States of Ireland'', pp.63\u201364, Hutchinson of London (1972) {{ISBN|0-09-113100-6}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe envisaged threat from both Home Rule and Rome was expressed in an angry poem by [[Rudyard Kipling]] ''Ulster 1912'\u2019 4th verse:\n<blockquote>\u2019\u2019We know the war prepared<br>On every peaceful home,<br>We know the hells declared<br>For such as serve not Rome \u2013-'' <ref>Stewart, A. T. Q.: p.56</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt so happened that [[Pius X]] was Pope in 1903\u20131914, the period when the policies of Ulster unionism were cast. His general policy of church supremacy led to [[Pius X#Church policies towards secular governments|antagonism across Europe]] between secular governments and his Church. Unlike other Catholic churches in Europe, such as in Spain or Portugal, the Irish Church was no longer semi-autonomous but had been assigned in 1833 to the [[Propaganda Fide|Congregation of Missions]] in Rome. As a result the Irish Church could be governed under [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] by the relatively informal [[motu proprio]] system. Concern about this led to proposals for safeguards in the debates that led to the [[Home Rule Act 1914]].<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1912/apr/11/religious-equality#S5CV0036P0-04178 Hansard statement 11 April 1912]</ref>\n\nLoyalists were unspecific about the likely effect of \"Rome Rule\", but it became an effective slogan in maintaining the loyalty of the Protestant working class, and contributed to the lack of trust which caused the near-civil war prior to the 1914 [[Third Home Rule Act]] and the [[Partition of Ireland]] during 1914\u201325. From the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 on a number of prominent [[Protestant Irish nationalism|Nationalist Protestants]] or [[lapsed Catholic]]s even felt the [[Protestant Nationalist#Protestant nationalist converts to Roman Catholicism|need to conform]] to be considered fully involved in the nationalist movement.\n\nDuring the [[Irish War of Independence]] the [[Irish Republic]] sought international recognition from other countries including the [[Holy See]]. Its envoy [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]] wrote to [[Pope Benedict XV]] in 1920 in terms suggesting that the war was a part of a long religious struggle, and identifying the Irish Republic with \"Catholic Ireland\". The letter was not published until recently; it included:\n\n\"''Irish Catholics believe that their devotion to their religion and to the Holy See handicaps their efforts for independence. While this in no way shakes their adherence to the Faith, they naturally resent the audacity of an officially heretical government approaching the Holy See on occasions through Catholic or non-Catholic channels, seeking to procure, on pretexts of faith and morals, the condemnation of Catholic Ireland. It is true that the latter happens to be weak and England strong; hence England tries to turn into an instrument of further oppression a force on which Ireland should obviously have paramount claims and for which Ireland suffered and fought and bled while the oppressor repudiated, blasphemed and persecuted it.''\"<ref>[http://difp.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=35 O'Kelly, ST \u2013 letter of 18 May 1920 \u2013 accessed 20 January 2009]</ref>\n\nAfter 1922 Rome Rule was occasionally used as a disparaging term by anti-clerical socialists in Ireland who opposed the Church's views on social policy.<ref>[http://www.fourthwrite.ie/odwyer.html Fourthwrite article]</ref> In a campaign against [[Contraception in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland's laws forbidding contraception]] the [[Feminism in Ireland|Irish feminist]] [[Mary Kenny]] stated in 1971 that \u2013 \"Ian Paisley was right; Home Rule is Rome Rule\".<ref>Irish Times, 30 March 1971, page 13.</ref>\n\nIn 2009 Professor Ronan Fanning of [[University College Dublin|UCD]] considered that \u2013 \"..in an overwhelmingly Catholic Ireland, the old Unionist taunt that Home Rule would mean Rome Rule had no force because Rome Rule had become more a cause for pride than for shame.\"<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/the-age-of-our-craven-deference-is-finally-over-1965621.html Sunday Independent op-ed, Dec 2009, downloaded April 2010]</ref>\n\n==Outburst in 1988==\nThe slogan continued to be used for decades in unionist politics in [[Northern Ireland]], and explains the visceral outburst by [[Ian Paisley]] in the [[European Parliament]] against the presence of [[Pope John Paul II]] on 12 October 1988.<ref>Paisley's intervention can be found on YouTube.</ref> Paisley referred to the Pope as \"The [[Antichrist]]\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/12/world/ulster-protestant-interrupts-pope-yelling-antichrist.html NY Times online; accessed Jan 2010]</ref>\n\n==Culmination 2009==\n{{Quote box\n|It is all too often forgotten that immediately before [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]] (Northern Ireland's prime minister 1921\u20131940) proclaimed that \"all I boast of is that we are [[A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People|a Protestant parliament and a Protestant state]]\u201d, it was preceded by his asking Northern Ireland's critics \"to remember that in the south they boasted of a Catholic state\".

Major bodies of water include the [[Aral Sea]] and [[Lake Balkhash]], both of which are part of the huge west-central Asian [[endorheic]] basin that also includes the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\nBoth of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia and can lead to rather significant international disputes.\n\n== Historical regions ==\n{{Location map+ | Kazakhstan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Kazakhstan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historical regions of Central Asia<br />\non a map of Kazakhstan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=73.37|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=44.00|long=76.95|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=45.00|long=85.00|label=Dzun-<br />garia|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=84.00|label=Tarim_Basin|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n|float=right\n| caption = Historical Regions of Central Asia<br />on a map of Uzbekistan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=40.00|long=72.00|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.50|long=65.00|label=Transoxiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.00|long=65.00|label=(Sogdia)|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=43.00|long=72.00|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.50|long=70.00|label=Bactria|position=bottom|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.00|long=61.90|label=Margiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historic cities of Central Asia<br />Kokand is one of the many towns that rose and fell in the Ferghana Valley\n| places  =\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.70|long=66.98|label=Samarkand|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.77|long=64.33|label=Bukhara|position=left|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.38|long=60.22|label=Khiva|position=top}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=40.53|long=70.93|label=Kokand|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.27|long=69.22|label=Tashkent|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=37.66|long=62.19|label=Merv}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=36.8|long=66.87|label=Balkh}}\n}}\n\nCentral Asia is bounded on the north by the forests of Siberia. The northern half of Central Asia (Kazakhstan) is the middle part of the [[Eurasian steppe]]. Westward the Kazakh steppe merges into the Russian-Ukrainian steppe and eastward into the steppes and deserts of Dzungaria and Mongolia. Southward the land becomes increasingly dry and the nomadic population increasingly thin. The south supports areas of dense population and cities wherever irrigation is possible. The main irrigated areas are along the eastern mountains, along the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]] and [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] Rivers and along the north flank of the [[Kopet Dagh]] near the Persian border. East of the Kopet Dagh is the important oasis of [[Merv]] and then a few places in Afghanistan like [[Herat]] and [[Balkh]]. Two projections of the [[Tian Shan]] create three \"bays\" along the eastern mountains. The largest, in the north, is eastern Kazakhstan, traditionally called [[Jetysu]] or Semirechye which contains [[Lake Balkhash]]. In the center is the small but densely-populated [[Ferghana valley]]. In the south is [[Bactria]], later called Tocharistan, which is bounded on the south by the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of Afghanistan. The [[Syr Darya]] (Jaxartes) rises in the Ferghana valley and the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus) rises in Bactria. Both flow northwest into the [[Aral Sea]]. Where the Oxus meets the Aral Sea it forms a large delta called [[Khwarazm]] and later the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. North of the Oxus is the less-famous but equally important [[Zarafshan River]] which waters the great trading cities of [[Bokhara]] and [[Samarkand]]. The other great commercial city was [[Tashkent]] northwest of the mouth of the Ferghana valley. The land immediately north of the Oxus was called [[Transoxiana]] and also [[Sogdia]], especially when referring to the Sogdian merchants who dominated the silk road trade.\n\nTo the east, Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin were united into the Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] about 1759. Caravans from China usually went along the north or south side of the Tarim basin and joined at [[Kashgar]] before crossing the mountains northwest to Ferghana or southwest to Bactria. A minor branch of the silk road went north of the Tian Shan through Dzungaria and Zhetysu before turning southwest near Tashkent. Nomadic migrations usually moved from Mongolia through Dzungaria before turning southwest to conquer the settled lands or continuing west toward Europe.\n\nThe [[Kyzyl Kum]] Desert or semi-desert is between the Oxus and Jaxartes, and the [[Karakum Desert]] is between the Oxus and [[Kopet Dagh]] in Turkmenistan. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] meant approximately northeast Persia and northern Afghanistan. [[Margiana]] was the region around Merv. The [[Ustyurt Plateau]] is between the Aral and Caspian Seas.\n\nTo the southwest, across the Kopet Dagh, lies Persia. From here Persian and Islamic civilization penetrated Central Asia and dominated its high culture until the Russian conquest. In the southeast is the route to India. In early times Buddhism spread north and throughout much of history warrior kings and tribes would move southeast to establish their rule in northern India. Most nomadic conquerors entered from the northeast. After 1800 western civilization in its Russian and Soviet form penetrated from the northwest.\n\n=== Names of historical regions ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Ariana]]\n* [[Bactria]]\n* [[Dahae|Dahistan]]\n* [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]\n* [[Khwarazm]]\n* [[Margiana]]\n* [[Parthia]]\n* [[Sogdia]]\n* [[Transoxiana]]\n* [[Turan]]\n* [[Turkestan]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\nBecause Central Asia is not buffered by a large body of water, temperature fluctuations are often severe, excluding the hot, sunny summer months. In most areas the climate is dry and continental, with hot summers and cool to cold winters, with occasional snowfall. Outside high-elevation areas, the climate is mostly semi-arid to arid. In lower elevations, summers are hot with blazing sunshine. Winters feature occasional rain and/or snow from low-pressure systems that cross the area from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Average monthly precipitation is extremely low from July to September, rises in autumn (October and November) and is highest in March or April, followed by swift drying in May and June. Winds can be strong, producing dust storms sometimes, especially toward the end of the dry season in September and October. Specific cities that exemplify Central Asian climate patterns include [[Tashkent]] and [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan, [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan, and [[Dushanbe]], Tajikistan, the last of these representing one of the wettest climates in Central Asia, with an average annual precipitation of over 22 inches.\n\nAccording to the [[Biome#WWF system|WWF Ecozones system]], Central Asia is part of the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]]. The largest [[biomes]] in Central Asia are the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome. Central Asia also contains the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] as well as [[temperate coniferous forests]] biomes.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Central Asia}}\n\nAlthough, during the golden age of Orientalism the place of Central Asia in the world history was marginalized, contemporary historiography has rediscovered the \"centrality\" of the Central Asia.{{sfnp|Mehmet Akif Okur|2014|pp=86\u201390}} The history of Central Asia is defined by the area's climate and geography. The aridness of the region made [[Agriculture in Central Asia|agriculture]] difficult, and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus, few major cities developed in the region; instead, the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the [[steppe]].\n\nRelations between the [[Eurasian nomads|steppe nomads]] and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict. The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to [[war]]fare, and the steppe [[Horses in warfare|horse riders]] became some of the most militarily potent people in the world, limited only by their lack of internal unity. Any internal unity that was achieved was most probably due to the influence of the [[Silk Road]], which traveled along Central Asia. Periodically, great leaders or changing conditions would organize several tribes into one force and create an almost unstoppable power. These included the [[Huns|Hun]] invasion of Europe, the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] attacks on China and most notably the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] of much of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html A Land Conquered by the Mongols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Three.html |date=23 April 2008 }}</ref>\n[[File:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC.

The [[Tang Dynasty|Tang Chinese]] were defeated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arabs]] at the [[battle of Talas]] in 751, marking the end of the Tang Dynasty's western expansion. The [[Tibetan Empire]] would take the chance to rule portion of Central Asia along with South Asia. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Mongols]] conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history.  Most of Central Asia fell under the control of the [[Chagatai Khanate]].\n\nThe dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as [[firearm]]s allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. [[Russia]], [[China]], and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the western Central Asian regions were incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]]. The eastern part of Central Asia, known as East Turkestan or [[Xinjiang]], was [[Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China|incorporated]] into the [[People's Republic of China]].

The first years of the Soviet regime saw the appearance of modernism, which took inspiration from the Russian avant-garde movement. Until the 1980s, Central Asian arts had developed along with general tendencies of Soviet arts. In the 90s, arts of the region underwent some significant changes. Institutionally speaking, some fields of arts were regulated by the birth of the art market, some stayed as representatives of official views, while many were sponsored by international organizations. The years of 1990\u20132000 were times for the establishment of contemporary arts.

The ultimate aim is to emulate the Asian Tigers by becoming the local equivalent, Central Asian snow leopards. However, reform has been deliberately gradual and selective, as governments strive to limit the social cost and ameliorate living standards. All five countries are implementing structural reforms to improve competitiveness. In particular, they have been modernizing the industrial sector and fostering the development of service industries through business-friendly fiscal policies and other measures, to reduce the share of agriculture in GDP. Between 2005 and 2013, the share of agriculture dropped in all but Tajikistan, where it increased while industry descreased. The fastest growth in industry was observed in Turkmenistan, whereas the services sector progressed most in the other four countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nPublic policies pursued by Central Asian governments focus on buffering the political and economic spheres from external shocks. This includes maintaining a trade balance, minimizing public debt and accumulating national reserves. They cannot totally insulate themselves from negative exterior forces, however, such as the persistently weak recovery of global industrial production and international trade since 2008. Notwithstanding this, they have emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009. Growth faltered only briefly in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan and not at all in Uzbekistan, where the economy grew by more than 7% per year on average between 2008 and 2013. Turkmenistan achieved unusually high 14.7% growth in 2011. Kyrgyzstan's performance has been more erratic but this phenomenon was visible well before 2008.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe republics which have fared best benefitted from the commodities boom during the first decade of the 2000s. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have abundant oil and natural gas reserves and Uzbekistan's own reserves make it more or less self-sufficient.

Fluctuating global demand for cotton, aluminium and other metals (except gold) in recent years has hit Tajikistan hardest, since aluminium and raw cotton are its chief exports \u2212 the Tajik Aluminium Company is the country's primary industrial asset.

The technopark will house research on alternative energy sources (sun, wind) and the assimilation of nanotechnologies. Between 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Nur-Sultan. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies which will be part of the planned Caspian Energy Hub. In addition, the Centre for Technology Commercialization has been set up in Kazakhstan as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups. The centre plans to conduct a technology audit in Kazakhstan and to review the legal framework regulating the commercialization of research results and technology.<ref name=\":13\" />\n[[File:Trends in GERD GDP ratio in Central Asia, 2001\u22122013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Trends in research expenditure in Central Asia, as a percentage of GDP, 2001\u20132013.

In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources in Uzbekistan, with funding from the [[Asian Development Bank]] and other institutions: the SPU Physical\u2212Technical Institute ([[Physics Sun Institute]]) and the [[International Solar Energy Institute]]. Three universities have been set up since 2011 to foster competence in strategic economic areas: [[Nazarbayev University]] in Kazakhstan (first intake in 2011), an international research university, [[Inha University in Tashkent|Inha University]] in Uzbekistan (first intake in 2014), specializing in information and communication technologies, and the [[International Oil and Gas University]] in Turkmenistan (founded in 2013). Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are both generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have both adopted the three-tier bachelor's, master's and PhD degree system, in 2007 and 2012 respectively, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science. In 2010, Kazakhstan became the only Central Asian member of the [[Bologna Process]], which seeks to harmonize higher education systems in order to create a European Higher Education Area.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Financial investment in research ===\nThe Central Asian republics' ambition of developing the business sector, education and research is being hampered by chronic low investment in research and development. Over the decade to 2013, the region's investment in research and development hovered around 0.2\u20130.3% of GDP. Uzbekistan broke with this trend in 2013 by raising its own research intensity to 0.41% of GDP.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is the only country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development \u2013 but research intensity overall is low in Kazakhstan: just 0.18% of GDP in 2013. Moreover, few industrial enterprises conduct research in Kazakhstan. Only one in eight (12.5%) of the country's manufacturing firms were active in innovation in 2012, according to a survey by the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]]. Enterprises prefer to purchase technological solutions that are already embodied in imported machinery and equipment. Just 4% of firms purchase the license and patents that come with this technology. Nevertheless, there appears to be a growing demand for the products of research, since enterprises spent 4.5 times more on scientific and technological services in 2008 than in 1997.<ref name=\":13\" />\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.

The number of researchers per million population is close to the world average (1,083 in 2013) in Kazakhstan (1,046) and higher than the world average in Uzbekistan (1,097).<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is the only Central Asian country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development. Uzbekistan is in a particularly vulnerable position, with its heavy reliance on higher education: three-quarters of researchers were employed by the university sector in 2013 and just 6% in the business enterprise sector. With most Uzbek university researchers nearing retirement, this imbalance imperils Uzbekistan's research future. Almost all holders of a Candidate of Science, Doctor of Science or PhD are more than 40 years old and half are aged over 60; more than one in three researchers (38.4%) holds a PhD degree, or its equivalent, the remainder holding a bachelor's or master's degree.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.4]]Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have all maintained a share of women researchers above 40% since the fall of the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan has even achieved gender parity, with Kazakh women dominating medical and health research and representing some 45\u201355% of engineering and technology researchers in 2013. In Tajikistan, however, only one in three scientists (34%) was a woman in 2013, down from 40% in 2002. Although policies are in place to give Tajik women equal rights and opportunities, these are underfunded and poorly understood. Turkmenistan has offered a state guarantee of equality for women since a law adopted in 2007 but the lack of available data makes it impossible to draw any conclusions as to the law's impact on research.  As for Turkmenistan, it does not make data available on higher education, research expenditure or researchers.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n'''Table:''' '''PhDs obtained in science and engineering in Central Asia, 2013 or closest year'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" href=\"\u00dcr\u00fcmqi\"\n| href=\"File:Bringing the sheep home, on the southern shore of Issy-Kol.

Kazakh imports nearly doubled between 2008 and 2013, from US$2.7 billion to US$5.1 billion. There has been a surge in imports of computers, electronics and telecommunications; these products represented an investment of US$744 million in 2008 and US$2.6 billion five years later. The growth in exports was more gradual \u2013 from US$2.3 billion to US$3.1 billion \u2013 and dominated by chemical products (other than pharmaceuticals), which represented two-thirds of exports in 2008 (US$1.5 billion) and 83% (US$2.6 billion) in 2013.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== International cooperation ===\nThe five Central Asian republics belong to several international bodies, including the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]]. They are also members of the [[Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program|Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation]] (CAREC) Programme, which also includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia and Pakistan. In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the ''CAREC 2020 Strategy'', a blueprint for furthering regional co-operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50 billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members' competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems. Only Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan border the [[Caspian Sea]] and none of the republics has direct access to an ocean, complicating the transportation of hydrocarbons, in particular, to world markets.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is also one of the three founding members of the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] in 2014, along with Belarus and the Russian Federation. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan have since joined this body. As co-operation among the member states in science and technology is already considerable and well-codified in legal texts, the Eurasian Economic Union is expected to have a limited additional impact on co-operation among public laboratories or academia but it should encourage business ties and scientific mobility, since it includes provision for the free circulation of labour and unified patent regulations.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":02\">{{cite book |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf |title=Countries in the Black Sea basin.

In 2012, 86 Russian organizations participated, plus three from Belarus, one from Kazakhstan and three from Tajikistan, as well as two scientific research groups from Germany. At the time, Vladimir Debabov, Scientific Director of the Genetika State Research Institute for Genetics and the Selection of Industrial Micro-organisms in the Russian Federation, stressed the paramount importance of developing bio-industry. 'In the world today, there is a strong tendency to switch from petrochemicals to renewable biological sources,' he said. 'Biotechnology is developing two to three times faster than chemicals.'<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan also participated in a second project of the Eurasian Economic Community, the establishment of the Centre for Innovative Technologies on 4 April 2013, with the signing of an agreement between the Russian Venture Company (a government fund of funds), the Kazakh JSC National Agency and the Belarusian Innovative Foundation. Each of the selected projects is entitled to funding of US$3\u201390 million and is implemented within a public\u2013private partnership. The first few approved projects focused on supercomputers, space technologies, medicine, petroleum recycling, nanotechnologies and the ecological use of natural resources. Once these initial projects have spawned viable commercial products, the venture company plans to reinvest the profits in new projects. This venture company is not a purely economic structure; it has also been designed to promote a common economic space among the three participating countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nFour of the five Central Asian republics have also been involved in a project launched by the [[European Union]] in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage [[European Union's scientific cooperation beyond the bloc|Central Asian countries to participate in research projects]] within [[Horizon 2020]], the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research projects is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions \u2013 universities, companies and research institutes \u2013 for funding of up to \u20ac10, 000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe [[International Science and Technology Center]] (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer.

The region itself never held a dominant stationary population nor was able to make use of natural resources. Thus, it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state. Central Asia has been divided, redivided, conquered out of existence, and fragmented time and time again. Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers than as a power in its own right.\n\nCentral Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.\n* To the North, the steppe allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols, and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the Russian Empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports. The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan.\n* To the East, the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia since the [[Silk Road]] period of [[Han Dynasty]]. However, with the Sino-Soviet split and collapse of Soviet Union, China would project its soft power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.\n* To the Southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the [[Hindu Kush]], and slightly beyond. From its base in India, the [[British Empire]] competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n* To the Southwest, Western Asian powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia (usually Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan). Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; Alexander the Great's Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia; two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well. Turkey, through a common [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nation identity, has gradually increased its ties and influence as well in the region. Furthermore, since Uzbekistan announced their intention to join in April 2018, Turkey and all of the Central Asian Turkic-speaking states except Turkmenistan are together part of the [[Turkic Council]].<ref>http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/uzbekistan-decides-to-join-turkic-alliance-during-erdogans-visit-131109</ref>\n\nIn the post\u2013Cold War era, Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the United States:\n* Russia continues to dominate political decision-making throughout the former SSRs; although, as other countries move into the area, Russia's influence has begun to wane though Russia still maintains military bases in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Why Russia Will Send More Troops to Central Asia|url = https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/why-russia-will-send-more-troops-central-asia|website = Stratfor|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}</ref>\n* The United States, with its military involvement in the region and oil diplomacy, is also significantly involved in the region's politics.

U.S. military bases have also been established in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, causing both Russia and the People's Republic of China to voice their concern over a permanent U.S. military presence in the region.\n\nWestern governments have accused Russia, China and the former Soviet republics of justifying the suppression of separatist movements, and the associated ethnics and religion with the War on Terror.\n\n== Major cultural, scientific and economic centres ==\n=== Cities within the regular definition of Central Asia and Afghanistan<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan |title=Afghanistan |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=17 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225235842/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan |archivedate=25 February 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Tan |first1=Anjelica |title=A new strategy for Central Asia |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/international/483511-a-new-strategy-for-central-asia |work=TheHill |date=18 February 2020 |language=en|quote=, as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has noted, Afghanistan is itself a Central Asian country.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Afghanistan {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |publisher=Cambridge University |isbn=9781107619500 |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/afghanistan |language=en}}</ref> ===\n{{Largest cities of Central Asia}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Population\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Image\n! style=\"width:350px;\"|Information\n|-\n| [[Nur-Sultan]]\n| Kazakhstan\n| {{nts|1,006,574}}<br />(2017)\n| [[File:Central Astana on a Sunny, Snowy Day in February 2013.jpg|200px]]\n| The capital and second largest city in Kazakhstan.

(3968109583).jpg|thumb|right|On the southern shore of Issyk Kul lake, [[Issyk Kul Region]].]]\nCentral Asia is an extremely large region of varied geography, including high passes and [[mountain ranges|mountains]] ([[Tian Shan]]), vast [[desert]]s ([[Kyzyl Kum]], [[Taklamakan]]), and especially treeless, grassy [[steppe]]s. The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of [[Eastern Europe]] as a homogeneous geographical zone known as the [[Eurasian Steppe]].\n\nMuch of the land of Central Asia is too dry or too rugged for farming. The [[Gobi desert]] extends from the foot of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], 77\u00b0&nbsp;E, to the [[Great Khingan]] (Da Hinggan) Mountains, 116\u00b0\u2013118\u00b0&nbsp;E.\n\nCentral Asia has the following geographic extremes:\n* The world's northernmost [[desert]] ([[dune|sand dunes]]), at Buurug Deliin Els, [[Mongolia]], 50\u00b018'&nbsp;N.\n* The [[Northern Hemisphere]]'s southernmost [[permafrost]], at Erdenetsogt sum, [[Mongolia]], 46\u00b017'&nbsp;N.\n* The world's shortest distance between non-frozen [[desert]] and [[permafrost]]: {{convert|770|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n* The Eurasian [[pole of inaccessibility]].\n\nA majority of the people earn a living by herding livestock. Industrial activity centers in the region's cities.\n\nMajor rivers of the region include the [[Amu Darya]], the [[Syr Darya]], [[Irtysh]], the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] and the [[Morghab River (Afghanistan)|Murghab River]]. Major bodies of water include the [[Aral Sea]] and [[Lake Balkhash]], both of which are part of the huge west-central Asian [[endorheic]] basin that also includes the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\nBoth of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia and can lead to rather significant international disputes.\n\n== Historical regions ==\n{{Location map+ | Kazakhstan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Kazakhstan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historical regions of Central Asia<br />\non a map of Kazakhstan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=73.37|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=44.00|long=76.95|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=45.00|long=85.00|label=Dzun-<br />garia|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=84.00|label=Tarim_Basin|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n|float=right\n| caption = Historical Regions of Central Asia<br />on a map of Uzbekistan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=40.00|long=72.00|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.50|long=65.00|label=Transoxiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.00|long=65.00|label=(Sogdia)|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=43.00|long=72.00|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.50|long=70.00|label=Bactria|position=bottom|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.00|long=61.90|label=Margiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historic cities of Central Asia<br />Kokand is one of the many towns that rose and fell in the Ferghana Valley\n| places  =\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.70|long=66.98|label=Samarkand|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.77|long=64.33|label=Bukhara|position=left|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.38|long=60.22|label=Khiva|position=top}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=40.53|long=70.93|label=Kokand|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.27|long=69.22|label=Tashkent|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=37.66|long=62.19|label=Merv}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=36.8|long=66.87|label=Balkh}}\n}}\n\nCentral Asia is bounded on the north by the forests of Siberia. The northern half of Central Asia (Kazakhstan) is the middle part of the [[Eurasian steppe]]. Westward the Kazakh steppe merges into the Russian-Ukrainian steppe and eastward into the steppes and deserts of Dzungaria and Mongolia. Southward the land becomes increasingly dry and the nomadic population increasingly thin. The south supports areas of dense population and cities wherever irrigation is possible. The main irrigated areas are along the eastern mountains, along the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]] and [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] Rivers and along the north flank of the [[Kopet Dagh]] near the Persian border. East of the Kopet Dagh is the important oasis of [[Merv]] and then a few places in Afghanistan like [[Herat]] and [[Balkh]]. Two projections of the [[Tian Shan]] create three \"bays\" along the eastern mountains. The largest, in the north, is eastern Kazakhstan, traditionally called [[Jetysu]] or Semirechye which contains [[Lake Balkhash]]. In the center is the small but densely-populated [[Ferghana valley]]. In the south is [[Bactria]], later called Tocharistan, which is bounded on the south by the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of Afghanistan. The [[Syr Darya]] (Jaxartes) rises in the Ferghana valley and the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus) rises in Bactria. Both flow northwest into the [[Aral Sea]]. Where the Oxus meets the Aral Sea it forms a large delta called [[Khwarazm]] and later the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. North of the Oxus is the less-famous but equally important [[Zarafshan River]] which waters the great trading cities of [[Bokhara]] and [[Samarkand]]. The other great commercial city was [[Tashkent]] northwest of the mouth of the Ferghana valley. The land immediately north of the Oxus was called [[Transoxiana]] and also [[Sogdia]], especially when referring to the Sogdian merchants who dominated the silk road trade.\n\nTo the east, Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin were united into the Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] about 1759. Caravans from China usually went along the north or south side of the Tarim basin and joined at [[Kashgar]] before crossing the mountains northwest to Ferghana or southwest to Bactria. A minor branch of the silk road went north of the Tian Shan through Dzungaria and Zhetysu before turning southwest near Tashkent. Nomadic migrations usually moved from Mongolia through Dzungaria before turning southwest to conquer the settled lands or continuing west toward Europe.\n\nThe [[Kyzyl Kum]] Desert or semi-desert is between the Oxus and Jaxartes, and the [[Karakum Desert]] is between the Oxus and [[Kopet Dagh]] in Turkmenistan. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] meant approximately northeast Persia and northern Afghanistan. [[Margiana]] was the region around Merv. The [[Ustyurt Plateau]] is between the Aral and Caspian Seas.\n\nTo the southwest, across the Kopet Dagh, lies Persia. From here Persian and Islamic civilization penetrated Central Asia and dominated its high culture until the Russian conquest. In the southeast is the route to India. In early times Buddhism spread north and throughout much of history warrior kings and tribes would move southeast to establish their rule in northern India. Most nomadic conquerors entered from the northeast. After 1800 western civilization in its Russian and Soviet form penetrated from the northwest.\n\n=== Names of historical regions ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Ariana]]\n* [[Bactria]]\n* [[Dahae|Dahistan]]\n* [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]\n* [[Khwarazm]]\n* [[Margiana]]\n* [[Parthia]]\n* [[Sogdia]]\n* [[Transoxiana]]\n* [[Turan]]\n* [[Turkestan]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\nBecause Central Asia is not buffered by a large body of water, temperature fluctuations are often severe, excluding the hot, sunny summer months. In most areas the climate is dry and continental, with hot summers and cool to cold winters, with occasional snowfall. Outside high-elevation areas, the climate is mostly semi-arid to arid. In lower elevations, summers are hot with blazing sunshine. Winters feature occasional rain and/or snow from low-pressure systems that cross the area from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Average monthly precipitation is extremely low from July to September, rises in autumn (October and November) and is highest in March or April, followed by swift drying in May and June. Winds can be strong, producing dust storms sometimes, especially toward the end of the dry season in September and October. Specific cities that exemplify Central Asian climate patterns include [[Tashkent]] and [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan, [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan, and [[Dushanbe]], Tajikistan, the last of these representing one of the wettest climates in Central Asia, with an average annual precipitation of over 22 inches.\n\nAccording to the [[Biome#WWF system|WWF Ecozones system]], Central Asia is part of the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]]. The largest [[biomes]] in Central Asia are the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome. Central Asia also contains the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] as well as [[temperate coniferous forests]] biomes.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Central Asia}}\n\nAlthough, during the golden age of Orientalism the place of Central Asia in the world history was marginalized, contemporary historiography has rediscovered the \"centrality\" of the Central Asia.{{sfnp|Mehmet Akif Okur|2014|pp=86\u201390}} The history of Central Asia is defined by the area's climate and geography. The aridness of the region made [[Agriculture in Central Asia|agriculture]] difficult, and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus, few major cities developed in the region; instead, the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the [[steppe]].\n\nRelations between the [[Eurasian nomads|steppe nomads]] and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict. The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to [[war]]fare, and the steppe [[Horses in warfare|horse riders]] became some of the most militarily potent people in the world, limited only by their lack of internal unity. Any internal unity that was achieved was most probably due to the influence of the [[Silk Road]], which traveled along Central Asia. Periodically, great leaders or changing conditions would organize several tribes into one force and create an almost unstoppable power. These included the [[Huns|Hun]] invasion of Europe, the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] attacks on China and most notably the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] of much of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html A Land Conquered by the Mongols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Three.html |date=23 April 2008 }}</ref>\n[[File:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC.

The [[Tang Dynasty|Tang Chinese]] were defeated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arabs]] at the [[battle of Talas]] in 751, marking the end of the Tang Dynasty's western expansion. The [[Tibetan Empire]] would take the chance to rule portion of Central Asia along with South Asia. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Mongols]] conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history.  Most of Central Asia fell under the control of the [[Chagatai Khanate]].\n\nThe dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as [[firearm]]s allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. [[Russia]], [[China]], and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the western Central Asian regions were incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]].

The first years of the Soviet regime saw the appearance of modernism, which took inspiration from the Russian avant-garde movement. Until the 1980s, Central Asian arts had developed along with general tendencies of Soviet arts. In the 90s, arts of the region underwent some significant changes. Institutionally speaking, some fields of arts were regulated by the birth of the art market, some stayed as representatives of official views, while many were sponsored by international organizations. The years of 1990\u20132000 were times for the establishment of contemporary arts.

The ultimate aim is to emulate the Asian Tigers by becoming the local equivalent, Central Asian snow leopards. However, reform has been deliberately gradual and selective, as governments strive to limit the social cost and ameliorate living standards. All five countries are implementing structural reforms to improve competitiveness. In particular, they have been modernizing the industrial sector and fostering the development of service industries through business-friendly fiscal policies and other measures, to reduce the share of agriculture in GDP. Between 2005 and 2013, the share of agriculture dropped in all but Tajikistan, where it increased while industry descreased. The fastest growth in industry was observed in Turkmenistan, whereas the services sector progressed most in the other four countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nPublic policies pursued by Central Asian governments focus on buffering the political and economic spheres from external shocks. This includes maintaining a trade balance, minimizing public debt and accumulating national reserves. They cannot totally insulate themselves from negative exterior forces, however, such as the persistently weak recovery of global industrial production and international trade since 2008. Notwithstanding this, they have emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009. Growth faltered only briefly in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan and not at all in Uzbekistan, where the economy grew by more than 7% per year on average between 2008 and 2013. Turkmenistan achieved unusually high 14.7% growth in 2011. Kyrgyzstan's performance has been more erratic but this phenomenon was visible well before 2008.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe republics which have fared best benefitted from the commodities boom during the first decade of the 2000s.

Many national research institutions established during the Soviet era have since become obsolete with the development of new technologies and changing national priorities. This has led countries to reduce the number of national research institutions since 2009 by grouping existing institutions to create research hubs. Several of the [[Turkmen Academy of Sciences|Turkmen Academy of Science']]<nowiki/>s institutes were merged in 2014: the Institute of Botany was merged with the Institute of Medicinal Plants to become the [[Institute of Biology and Medicinal Plants]]; the Sun Institute was merged with the Institute of Physics and Mathematics to become the [[Institute of Solar Energy]]; and the Institute of Seismology merged with the State Service for Seismology to become the [[Institute of Seismology and Atmospheric Physics]]. In [[Science and technology in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]], more than 10 institutions of the Academy of Sciences have been reorganized, following the issuance of a decree by the Cabinet of Ministers in February 2012. The aim is to orient academic research towards problem-solving and ensure continuity between basic and applied research. For example, the Mathematics and Information Technology Research Institute has been subsumed under the [[National University of Uzbekistan]] and the Institute for Comprehensive Research on Regional Problems of Samarkand has been transformed into a problem-solving laboratory on environmental issues within [[Samarkand State University]]. Other research institutions have remained attached to the [[Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan|Uzbek Academy of Sciences]], such as the [[Centre of Genomics and Bioinformatics]].<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[Science and technology in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] and [[Science and technology in Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan]] are also building technology parks as part of their drive to modernize infrastructure. In 2011, construction began of a technopark in the village of Bikrova near Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital. It will combine research, education, industrial facilities, business incubators and exhibition centres. The technopark will house research on alternative energy sources (sun, wind) and the assimilation of nanotechnologies. Between 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Nur-Sultan. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies which will be part of the planned Caspian Energy Hub. In addition, the Centre for Technology Commercialization has been set up in Kazakhstan as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups. The centre plans to conduct a technology audit in Kazakhstan and to review the legal framework regulating the commercialization of research results and technology.<ref name=\":13\" />\n[[File:Trends in GERD GDP ratio in Central Asia, 2001\u22122013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Trends in research expenditure in Central Asia, as a percentage of GDP, 2001\u20132013.

In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources in Uzbekistan, with funding from the [[Asian Development Bank]] and other institutions: the SPU Physical\u2212Technical Institute ([[Physics Sun Institute]]) and the [[International Solar Energy Institute]]. Three universities have been set up since 2011 to foster competence in strategic economic areas: [[Nazarbayev University]] in Kazakhstan (first intake in 2011), an international research university, [[Inha University in Tashkent|Inha University]] in Uzbekistan (first intake in 2014), specializing in information and communication technologies, and the [[International Oil and Gas University]] in Turkmenistan (founded in 2013). Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are both generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have both adopted the three-tier bachelor's, master's and PhD degree system, in 2007 and 2012 respectively, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science. In 2010, Kazakhstan became the only Central Asian member of the [[Bologna Process]], which seeks to harmonize higher education systems in order to create a European Higher Education Area.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Financial investment in research ===\nThe Central Asian republics' ambition of developing the business sector, education and research is being hampered by chronic low investment in research and development. Over the decade to 2013, the region's investment in research and development hovered around 0.2\u20130.3% of GDP. Uzbekistan broke with this trend in 2013 by raising its own research intensity to 0.41% of GDP.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is the only country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development \u2013 but research intensity overall is low in Kazakhstan: just 0.18% of GDP in 2013. Moreover, few industrial enterprises conduct research in Kazakhstan. Only one in eight (12.5%) of the country's manufacturing firms were active in innovation in 2012, according to a survey by the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]]. Enterprises prefer to purchase technological solutions that are already embodied in imported machinery and equipment. Just 4% of firms purchase the license and patents that come with this technology. Nevertheless, there appears to be a growing demand for the products of research, since enterprises spent 4.5 times more on scientific and technological services in 2008 than in 1997.<ref name=\":13\" />\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.

The number of researchers per million population is close to the world average (1,083 in 2013) in Kazakhstan (1,046) and higher than the world average in Uzbekistan (1,097).<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is the only Central Asian country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development. Uzbekistan is in a particularly vulnerable position, with its heavy reliance on higher education: three-quarters of researchers were employed by the university sector in 2013 and just 6% in the business enterprise sector. With most Uzbek university researchers nearing retirement, this imbalance imperils Uzbekistan's research future. Almost all holders of a Candidate of Science, Doctor of Science or PhD are more than 40 years old and half are aged over 60; more than one in three researchers (38.4%) holds a PhD degree, or its equivalent, the remainder holding a bachelor's or master's degree.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.4]]Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have all maintained a share of women researchers above 40% since the fall of the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan has even achieved gender parity, with Kazakh women dominating medical and health research and representing some 45\u201355% of engineering and technology researchers in 2013. In Tajikistan, however, only one in three scientists (34%) was a woman in 2013, down from 40% in 2002. Although policies are in place to give Tajik women equal rights and opportunities, these are underfunded and poorly understood. Turkmenistan has offered a state guarantee of equality for women since a law adopted in 2007 but the lack of available data makes it impossible to draw any conclusions as to the law's impact on research.  As for Turkmenistan, it does not make data available on higher education, research expenditure or researchers.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n'''Table:''' '''PhDs obtained in science and engineering in Central Asia, 2013 or closest year'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" href=\"\u00dcr\u00fcmqi\"\n| href=\"File:Bringing the sheep home, on the southern shore of Issy-Kol.

Kazakh imports nearly doubled between 2008 and 2013, from US$2.7 billion to US$5.1 billion. There has been a surge in imports of computers, electronics and telecommunications; these products represented an investment of US$744 million in 2008 and US$2.6 billion five years later. The growth in exports was more gradual \u2013 from US$2.3 billion to US$3.1 billion \u2013 and dominated by chemical products (other than pharmaceuticals), which represented two-thirds of exports in 2008 (US$1.5 billion) and 83% (US$2.6 billion) in 2013.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== International cooperation ===\nThe five Central Asian republics belong to several international bodies, including the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]]. They are also members of the [[Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program|Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation]] (CAREC) Programme, which also includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia and Pakistan. In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the ''CAREC 2020 Strategy'', a blueprint for furthering regional co-operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50 billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members' competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems. Only Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan border the [[Caspian Sea]] and none of the republics has direct access to an ocean, complicating the transportation of hydrocarbons, in particular, to world markets.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is also one of the three founding members of the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] in 2014, along with Belarus and the Russian Federation. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan have since joined this body. As co-operation among the member states in science and technology is already considerable and well-codified in legal texts, the Eurasian Economic Union is expected to have a limited additional impact on co-operation among public laboratories or academia but it should encourage business ties and scientific mobility, since it includes provision for the free circulation of labour and unified patent regulations.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":02\">{{cite book |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf |title=Countries in the Black Sea basin.

In 2012, 86 Russian organizations participated, plus three from Belarus, one from Kazakhstan and three from Tajikistan, as well as two scientific research groups from Germany. At the time, Vladimir Debabov, Scientific Director of the Genetika State Research Institute for Genetics and the Selection of Industrial Micro-organisms in the Russian Federation, stressed the paramount importance of developing bio-industry. 'In the world today, there is a strong tendency to switch from petrochemicals to renewable biological sources,' he said. 'Biotechnology is developing two to three times faster than chemicals.'<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan also participated in a second project of the Eurasian Economic Community, the establishment of the Centre for Innovative Technologies on 4 April 2013, with the signing of an agreement between the Russian Venture Company (a government fund of funds), the Kazakh JSC National Agency and the Belarusian Innovative Foundation. Each of the selected projects is entitled to funding of US$3\u201390 million and is implemented within a public\u2013private partnership. The first few approved projects focused on supercomputers, space technologies, medicine, petroleum recycling, nanotechnologies and the ecological use of natural resources. Once these initial projects have spawned viable commercial products, the venture company plans to reinvest the profits in new projects. This venture company is not a purely economic structure; it has also been designed to promote a common economic space among the three participating countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nFour of the five Central Asian republics have also been involved in a project launched by the [[European Union]] in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage [[European Union's scientific cooperation beyond the bloc|Central Asian countries to participate in research projects]] within [[Horizon 2020]], the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research projects is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions \u2013 universities, companies and research institutes \u2013 for funding of up to \u20ac10, 000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe [[International Science and Technology Center]] (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer.

The region itself never held a dominant stationary population nor was able to make use of natural resources. Thus, it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state. Central Asia has been divided, redivided, conquered out of existence, and fragmented time and time again. Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers than as a power in its own right.\n\nCentral Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.\n* To the North, the steppe allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols, and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the Russian Empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports. The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan.\n* To the East, the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia since the [[Silk Road]] period of [[Han Dynasty]]. However, with the Sino-Soviet split and collapse of Soviet Union, China would project its soft power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.\n* To the Southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the [[Hindu Kush]], and slightly beyond. From its base in India, the [[British Empire]] competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n* To the Southwest, Western Asian powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia (usually Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan). Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; Alexander the Great's Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia; two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well. Turkey, through a common [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nation identity, has gradually increased its ties and influence as well in the region. Furthermore, since Uzbekistan announced their intention to join in April 2018, Turkey and all of the Central Asian Turkic-speaking states except Turkmenistan are together part of the [[Turkic Council]].<ref>http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/uzbekistan-decides-to-join-turkic-alliance-during-erdogans-visit-131109</ref>\n\nIn the post\u2013Cold War era, Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the United States:\n* Russia continues to dominate political decision-making throughout the former SSRs; although, as other countries move into the area, Russia's influence has begun to wane though Russia still maintains military bases in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Why Russia Will Send More Troops to Central Asia|url = https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/why-russia-will-send-more-troops-central-asia|website = Stratfor|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}</ref>\n* The United States, with its military involvement in the region and oil diplomacy, is also significantly involved in the region's politics.

U.S. military bases have also been established in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, causing both Russia and the People's Republic of China to voice their concern over a permanent U.S. military presence in the region.\n\nWestern governments have accused Russia, China and the former Soviet republics of justifying the suppression of separatist movements, and the associated ethnics and religion with the War on Terror.\n\n== Major cultural, scientific and economic centres ==\n=== Cities within the regular definition of Central Asia and Afghanistan<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan |title=Afghanistan |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=17 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225235842/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan |archivedate=25 February 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Tan |first1=Anjelica |title=A new strategy for Central Asia |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/international/483511-a-new-strategy-for-central-asia |work=TheHill |date=18 February 2020 |language=en|quote=, as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has noted, Afghanistan is itself a Central Asian country.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Afghanistan {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |publisher=Cambridge University |isbn=9781107619500 |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/afghanistan |language=en}}</ref> ===\n{{Largest cities of Central Asia}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Population\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Image\n! style=\"width:350px;\"|Information\n|-\n| [[Nur-Sultan]]\n| Kazakhstan\n| {{nts|1,006,574}}<br />(2017)\n| [[File:Central Astana on a Sunny, Snowy Day in February 2013.jpg|200px]]\n| The capital and second largest city in Kazakhstan.

The desire of the nobles prevailed.\n\n==Battle of Haldighati==\n{{Main|Battle of Haldighati}}\nThe bloody [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1567\u20131568)|Siege of Chittorgarh]] in 1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom was still under the control of the Rana. The Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] was intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh was crowned king (Rana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys entreating the Rana to become a vassal like many other Rajput leaders in the region. When the Rana refused to personally submit to Akbar, war became inevitable.{{sfn|Sarkar|1960|p=75}}{{sfn|Chandra|2005|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nThe Battle of Haldighati was fought on 18 June 1576 between Maharana Pratap and Akbar's forces led by [[Man Singh I]] of [[Amer, Rajasthan|Amer]]. The Mughals were victorious and inflicted significant casualties among the Mewaris but failed to capture Maharana. The site of the battle was a narrow mountain pass at [[Haldighati]] near [[Gogunda]], modern day Rajsamand in [[Rajasthan]]. Maharana Pratap fielded a force of around 3000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers. The Mughals were led by Man Singh of Amber, who commanded an army numbering around 5000-10,000 men. After a fierce battle lasting more than six hours, Maharana found himself wounded and the day lost. The mughal were unable to capture him. He managed to escape to the hills and lived to fight another day.{{sfn|Sarkar|1960|p=77\u201379}}\n\nHaldighati was a futile victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to capture Maharana Pratap, or any of his close family members in [[Udaipur]]. As soon as the empire's focus shifted north-west, Pratap and his army came out of hiding and recaptured the western regions of his dominion. {{sfn|Chandra|2005|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\n==Resurgence==\nMughal pressure on Mewar relaxed after 1579 following rebellions in Bengal and Bihar and [[Mirza Muhammad Hakim|Mirza Hakim's]] incursion into the Punjab. In 1582, Maharana Pratap attacked and occupied the Mughal post at Dewair (or Dawer).<ref>{{cite book |author=A. N.

No major Mughal expedition was sent to Mewar during this period. Taking advantage of the situation, Pratap recovered Western Mewar including Kumbhalgarh, Udaipur and Gogunda. During this period, he also built a new capital, [[Chavand, Rajasthan|Chavand]], near modern Dungarpur.{{sfn|Chandra|2005|p=122}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\nReportedly, Pratap died of injuries sustained in a hunting accident<ref>{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Sri Ram|title=Maharana Pratap|year=2005|isbn=978-8-17871-003-7|page=91}}</ref> at Chavand{{sfn|Chandra|2005|p=122}}on 19 January 1597,<ref name=brittanica /> aged 56.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=R.K.|last2=Bakshi|first2=S.R.|title=Studies In Indian History: Rajasthan Through The Ages The Heritage of Rajputs (Set Of 5 Vols.)|year=2008|isbn=978-8-17625-841-8|page=46}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chittorgarh.com/maharana-pratap.asp|title=Maharana Pratap - Mewar|website=www.chittorgarh.com|access-date=17 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119181341/http://www.chittorgarh.com/maharana-pratap.asp|archive-date=19 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> He was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Amar Singh I]].\n\nHistorian [[Satish Chandra (historian)|Satish Chandra]] notes that {{Quote|Rana Pratap's defiance of the mighty Mughal empire, almost alone and unaided by the other Rajput states, constitute a glorious saga of Rajput valour and the spirit of self sacrifice for cherished principles.

[[Mewar]], a region in north-western India in the present day state of [[Rajasthan]].\n\n==Early life and accession==\nMaharana Pratap was born in a Hindu [[Rajput]] family.

The desire of the nobles prevailed.\n\n==Battle of Haldighati==\n{{Main|Battle of Haldighati}}\nThe bloody [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1567\u20131568)|Siege of Chittorgarh]] in 1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom was still under the control of the Rana. The Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] was intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh was crowned king (Rana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys entreating the Rana to become a vassal like many other Rajput leaders in the region. When the Rana refused to personally submit to Akbar, war became inevitable.{{sfn|Sarkar|1960|p=75}}{{sfn|Chandra|2005|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nThe Battle of Haldighati was fought on 18 June 1576 between Maharana Pratap and Akbar's forces led by [[Man Singh I]] of [[Amer, Rajasthan|Amer]]. The Mughals were victorious and inflicted significant casualties among the Mewaris but failed to capture Maharana. The site of the battle was a narrow mountain pass at [[Haldighati]] near [[Gogunda]], modern day Rajsamand in [[Rajasthan]]. Maharana Pratap fielded a force of around 3000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers. The Mughals were led by Man Singh of Amber, who commanded an army numbering around 5000-10,000 men. After a fierce battle lasting more than six hours, Maharana found himself wounded and the day lost. The mughal were unable to capture him. He managed to escape to the hills and lived to fight another day.{{sfn|Sarkar|1960|p=77\u201379}}\n\nHaldighati was a futile victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to capture Maharana Pratap, or any of his close family members in [[Udaipur]]. As soon as the empire's focus shifted north-west, Pratap and his army came out of hiding and recaptured the western regions of his dominion. {{sfn|Chandra|2005|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\n==Resurgence==\nMughal pressure on Mewar relaxed after 1579 following rebellions in Bengal and Bihar and [[Mirza Muhammad Hakim|Mirza Hakim's]] incursion into the Punjab. In 1582, Maharana Pratap attacked and occupied the Mughal post at Dewair (or Dawer).<ref>{{cite book |author=A. N.

No major Mughal expedition was sent to Mewar during this period. Taking advantage of the situation, Pratap recovered Western Mewar including Kumbhalgarh, Udaipur and Gogunda. During this period, he also built a new capital, [[Chavand, Rajasthan|Chavand]], near modern Dungarpur.{{sfn|Chandra|2005|p=122}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\nReportedly, Pratap died of injuries sustained in a hunting accident<ref>{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Sri Ram|title=Maharana Pratap|year=2005|isbn=978-8-17871-003-7|page=91}}</ref> at Chavand{{sfn|Chandra|2005|p=122}}on 19 January 1597,<ref name=brittanica /> aged 56.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=R.K.|last2=Bakshi|first2=S.R.|title=Studies In Indian History: Rajasthan Through The Ages The Heritage of Rajputs (Set Of 5 Vols.)|year=2008|isbn=978-8-17625-841-8|page=46}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chittorgarh.com/maharana-pratap.asp|title=Maharana Pratap - Mewar|website=www.chittorgarh.com|access-date=17 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119181341/http://www.chittorgarh.com/maharana-pratap.asp|archive-date=19 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> He was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Amar Singh I]].\n\nHistorian [[Satish Chandra (historian)|Satish Chandra]] notes that {{Quote|Rana Pratap's defiance of the mighty Mughal empire, almost alone and unaided by the other Rajput states, constitute a glorious saga of Rajput valour and the spirit of self sacrifice for cherished principles.

Modern diplomatic immunity was codified as [[international law]] in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] (1961) which has been ratified by all but a handful of nations. The concept and custom of diplomatic immunity dates back thousands of years. Many principles of diplomatic immunity are now considered to be [[customary law]]. Diplomatic immunity was developed to allow for the maintenance of government relations, including during periods of difficulties and [[War|armed conflict]]. When receiving diplomats, who formally represent the sovereign, the receiving head of state grants certain privileges and immunities to ensure they may effectively carry out their duties, on the understanding that these are provided on a reciprocal basis.\n\nOriginally, these privileges and immunities were granted on a [[Bilateralism|bilateral]], [[ad hoc]] basis, which led to misunderstandings and conflict, pressure on weaker states, and an inability for other states to judge which party was at fault. An international agreement known as the Vienna Convention codified the rules and agreements, providing standards and privileges to all states.\n\nIt is possible for the official's home country to waive immunity; this tends to happen only when the individual has committed a serious [[crime]], unconnected with their diplomatic role (as opposed to, for example, allegations of [[espionage|spying]]), or has witnessed such a crime. However, many countries refuse to waive immunity as a matter of course; individuals have no authority to waive their own immunity<ref name=\"Subramanian2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Subramanian|first1=S.

In such cases, the servants of the \"criminal\" sovereign were often considered accomplices and their persons violated. In other circumstances, harbingers of inconsiderable demands were killed as a declaration of war. [[Herodotus]] records that when heralds of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian king]] [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] demanded \"earth and water\" (i.e., symbols of submission) of Greek cities, the [[Athens|Athenians]] threw them into a pit and the [[Sparta]]ns threw them down a well for the purpose of suggesting they would find both earth and water at the bottom, these often being mentioned by the messenger as a threat of siege. However, even for Herodotus, this maltreatment of envoys is a crime.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} He recounts a story of divine vengeance befalling Sparta for this deed.<ref>Herodotos.

''Am\u0101n'' was readily granted to any emissary bearing a letter or another sealed document. The duration of the ''am\u0101n'' was typically a year. Envoys with this right of passage were given immunity of person and property. They were exempt from [[taxation]], as long as they didn't engage in trade.<ref name=\"FadlAbou2009\"/>\n\nAs diplomats by definition enter the country under safe conduct, violating them is normally viewed as a great breach of honor, although there have been numerous cases in which diplomats have been killed. [[Genghis Khan]] and the [[Mongols]] were well known for strongly insisting on the rights of diplomats, and they would often take terrifying vengeance against any state that violated these rights. The Mongols would often raze entire cities in retaliation for the execution of their ambassadors, and [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|invaded and destroyed the Khwarezmid Empire]] after their ambassadors had been mistreated.<ref name=Prawdin>[[Michael Prawdin|Prawdin, Michael]]. ''The Mongol Empire''.</ref>\n\n===Modern===\n\nThe [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] first guaranteed [[Diplomatic Privileges Act 1708|diplomatic immunity]] to foreign ambassadors in 1709, after Count [[Andrey Matveyev]], a Russian resident in London, had been subjected to verbal and physical abuse by [[Bailiff#British Isles|British bailiffs]].\n\nModern diplomatic immunity evolved parallel to the development of modern diplomacy. In the 17th century, European diplomats realized that protection from prosecution was essential to doing their jobs, and a set of rules evolved guaranteeing the rights of diplomats. These were still confined to Western Europe and were closely tied to the prerogatives of nobility. Thus, an emissary to the Ottoman Empire could expect to be arrested and imprisoned upon the outbreak of hostilities between his state and the empire. The French Revolution also disrupted this system, as the revolutionary state and Napoleon imprisoned numerous diplomats who were accused of working against France. More recently, the [[Iran hostage crisis]] is universally considered a violation of diplomatic immunity. Although the hostage takers did not officially represent the state, host countries are obligated to protect diplomatic property and personnel. On the other hand, during [[World War II]], diplomatic immunity was upheld and the embassies of the belligerents were evacuated through neutral countries.\n\nFor the upper class of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, diplomatic immunity was an easy concept to understand. The first embassies were not permanent establishments but actual visits by high-ranking representatives, often close relatives, of the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] or the sovereign in person. As permanent representations evolved, usually on a treaty basis between two powers, they were frequently staffed by relatives of the sovereign or high-ranking nobles.\n\n[[War]]fare was a status of hostilities not between individuals but between their sovereigns, and the officers and officials of European governments and armies often changed employers. Truces and ceasefires were commonplace, along with fraternization between officers of enemy armies during them. When prisoners, the officers usually gave their [[wikt:parole|parole]] and were only restricted to a city away from the theatre of war. Almost always, they were given leave to carry their personal sidearms. Even during the French revolutionary wars, British scientists visited the French Academy. In such an atmosphere, it was easy to accept that some persons were immune to the laws. After all, they were still bound by strict requirements of honour and customs.\n\nIn the 19th century, the [[Congress of Vienna]] reasserted the rights of diplomats; and they have been largely respected since then, as the European model has spread throughout the world. Currently, diplomatic relations, including diplomatic immunity, are governed internationally by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], which has been ratified by almost every country in the world.\n\nIn modern times, diplomatic immunity continues to provide a means, albeit imperfect, to safeguard diplomatic personnel from any animosity that might arise between nations. As one article put it: \"So why do we agree to a system in which we're dependent on a foreign country's whim before we can prosecute a criminal inside our own borders? The practical answer is: because we depend on other countries to honor our own diplomats' immunity just as scrupulously as we honor theirs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jinnah-institute.org/issues/252-raymond-davis-and-the-vienna-convention- |title=Raymond Davis and the Vienna Convention |publisher=Jinnah-institute.org |accessdate=19 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726203911/http://www.jinnah-institute.org/issues/252-raymond-davis-and-the-vienna-convention- |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDuring 18 April 1961 Vienna Convention, the [[Holy See]] was granted diplomatic immunity to its [[nuncio|foreign ambassadors]] as well.<ref name=\"CNA2019\">{{Cite web |title=Holy See waives diplomatic immunity for accused nuncio to France |work=Catholic News Agency |date=8 July 2019 |access-date=7 October 2019 |url= https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/holy-see-waves-diplomatic-immunity-for-accused-nuncio-to-france-22125 }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978 ({{UnitedStatesCode|22|254a}} et seq.) follows the principles introduced by the Vienna Conventions. The United States tends to be generous when granting diplomatic immunity to visiting diplomats, because a large number of U.S. diplomats work in host countries less protective of individual rights. If the United States were to punish a visiting diplomat without sufficient grounds, U.S. representatives in other countries could receive harsher treatment. If a person with immunity is alleged to have committed a crime or faces a civil lawsuit, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] asks the home country to waive immunity of the alleged offender so that the complaint can be moved to the courts. If immunity is not waived, prosecution cannot be undertaken. However, the State Department still has the right to [[Persona non-grata|expel the diplomat]]. In many such cases, the diplomat's visas are canceled, and they and their family may be barred from returning to the United States. Crimes committed by members of a diplomat's family can also result in dismissal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/diplomatic-immunity |title=diplomatic immunity: West's Encyclopedia of American Law (Full Article) from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Exceptions to the Vienna Convention==\nSome countries have made reservations to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, but they are minor. A number of countries limit the diplomatic immunity of persons who are citizens of the receiving country. As nations keep faith to their treaties with differing zeal, other rules may also apply, though in most cases this summary is a reasonably accurate approximation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=List of Party States, Declarations and Reservations to Chapter III of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961 |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=III-3&chapter=3&lang=en |date=16 April 2011 |publisher=UNITED NATIONS TREATY COLLECTION |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227154400/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=III-3&chapter=3&lang=en |archivedate=27 December 2010 }}</ref> The Convention does not cover the personnel of [[international organization]]s, whose privileges are decided upon on a case-by-case basis, usually in the [[Treaty|treaties]] founding such organizations. The United Nations system (including its agencies, which comprise the most recognizable international bodies such as the World Bank and many others) has a relatively standardized form of limited immunities for staff traveling on [[United Nations laissez-passer|U.N. laissez-passer]]; diplomatic immunity is often granted to the highest-ranking officials{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} of these agencies. Consular officials (that do not have concurrent diplomatic accreditation) formally have a more limited form of immunity, generally limited to their official duties. Diplomatic technical and administrative staff also have more limited immunity under the Vienna Convention; for this reason, some countries may accredit a member of technical or administrative staff as an [[attach\u00e9]].\n\nOther categories of government officials that may travel frequently to other countries may not have diplomatic passports or diplomatic immunity, such as members of the military, high-ranking government officials, ministers, and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Many countries provide non-diplomatic official passports to such personnel, and there may be different classes of such travel documents such as official passports, service passports, and others. De facto recognition of some form of immunity may be conveyed by states accepting officials traveling on such documents, or there may exist bilateral agreements to govern such cases (as in, for example, the case of military personnel conducting or observing exercises on the territory of the receiving country).\n\nFormally, diplomatic immunity may be limited to officials accredited to a host country, or traveling to or from their host country. In practice, many countries may effectively recognize diplomatic immunity for those traveling on diplomatic passports, with admittance to the country constituting acceptance of the diplomatic status. However, this is not universal, and diplomats have been prosecuted and jailed for crimes committed outside the country they are accredited to.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/saudi-diplomat-lawyer-ordered-to-pay-costs-for-frivolous-9941168|title=Saudi diplomat's lawyer ordered to pay costs for 'frivolous' application to Court of Appeal|website=channelnewsasia.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Uses and abuses==\nIn reality, most diplomats are representatives of nations with a tradition of professional [[civil service]], and are expected to obey regulations governing their behaviour and they suffer severe disciplinary action if they flout local laws. In many nations, a professional diplomat's career may be compromised if they (or members of their family) disobey the local authorities or cause serious embarrassment, and such cases are, at any rate, a violation of the spirit of the Vienna Conventions.\n\nThe Vienna Convention is explicit that \"without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State.\" Nevertheless, on some occasions, diplomatic immunity leads to some unfortunate results; protected diplomats have violated laws (including those that would be violations at home as well) of the host country and that country has been essentially limited to informing the diplomat's nation that the diplomat is no longer welcome (''[[persona non-grata]]'').

Some financial institutions do not extend credit to diplomats because they have no legal means of ensuring the money be repaid. Local citizens and businesses are often at a disadvantage when filing civil claims against a diplomat, especially in cases of unpaid rent, alimony, and child support.\n\n====Rents====\n{{globalize|date=May 2017}}\nThe bulk of diplomatic debt lies in the rental of office space and living quarters. Individual debts can range from a few thousand dollars to $1 million in back rent. A group of diplomats and the office space in which they work are referred to as a [[diplomatic mission]]. Creditors cannot sue missions individually to collect money they owe. Landlords and creditors have found that the only thing they can do is contact a city agency to see if they can try to get some money back. They cannot enter the offices or apartments of diplomats to evict them because the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]] says that \"the property in the United States of a foreign state shall be immune from [[Attachment (law)|attachment]], arrest and execution\" ({{UnitedStatesCode|28|1609}}). This has led creditors who are owed money by diplomats to become more cautious about their renters and to change their rental or payment policies.\n\nIn one case, for example, officials from Zaire stopped paying rent to their private landlord and ran up $400,000 in debt. When the landlord sued, the U.S. State Department defended the Zaireans on the basis of diplomatic immunity, and a circuit court agreed. When the landlord finally cut off the utilities, the officials fled without paying their back rent. The landlords reportedly later reached an \"amicable agreement\" with the Zaire government.<ref name=\"Reader's Digest\"/>\n\n====Alimony and child support====\nThe issue of abusing diplomatic immunity in family relations, especially [[alimony]] and [[child support]], has become so widespread that it prompted discussion at the 1995 U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women, in [[Beijing]]. Historically, the [[United Nations]] has not become involved with family disputes and has refused to garnish the wages of diplomats who owe money for child support, citing [[sovereign immunity]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} However, in September 1995, the incumbent head of [[Legal Affairs]] for the [[United Nations]] acknowledged there was a moral and legal obligation to take at least a partial responsibility in family disputes. Fathers working as diplomats who refused to fulfill their family-related financial duties were increasing in numbers in the [[United Nations]]: several men who had left their wives and children were still claiming U.N. dependency, travel, and education allowances for their families, though they are no longer supporting those families.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Diplomatic+Immunity |title=Diplomatic Immunity legal definition of Diplomatic Immunity.

In certain cases, whether a payment is or is not considered a tax may be disputed, such as [[central London]]'s [[congestion charge]]. It was reported in 2006 that the UAE embassy had agreed to pay their own accumulated charges of nearly \u00a3100,000.<ref>{{cite news | title = Embassy to pay congestion charge | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4881442.stm | work = BBC News | date = 6 April 2006 | accessdate = 28 March 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThere is an obligation for the receiving state not to \"discriminate as between states\"; in other words, any such fees should be payable by all accredited diplomats equally. This may allow the [[diplomatic corps]] to negotiate as a group with the authorities of the receiving country.\n\nDiplomats are exempt from [[import duty]] and [[tariffs]] for items for their personal use. In some countries, this has led to charges that diplomatic agents are profiting personally from resale of \"tax free\" goods. The receiving state may choose to impose restrictions on what may reasonably constitute personal use (for example, only a certain quantity of [[cigarette]]s per day). When enacted, such restrictions are generally quite generous so as to avoid [[Tit for tat|tit-for-tat]] responses.\n\n===Espionage===\nOn 24 April 2008, in [[New Orleans]], Mexican [[press attach\u00e9]] Rafael Quintero Curiel was seen stealing [[BlackBerry]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] units from a [[White House]] press meeting room.

Modern diplomatic immunity was codified as [[international law]] in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] (1961) which has been ratified by all but a handful of nations. The concept and custom of diplomatic immunity dates back thousands of years. Many principles of diplomatic immunity are now considered to be [[customary law]]. Diplomatic immunity was developed to allow for the maintenance of government relations, including during periods of difficulties and [[War|armed conflict]]. When receiving diplomats, who formally represent the sovereign, the receiving head of state grants certain privileges and immunities to ensure they may effectively carry out their duties, on the understanding that these are provided on a reciprocal basis.\n\nOriginally, these privileges and immunities were granted on a [[Bilateralism|bilateral]], [[ad hoc]] basis, which led to misunderstandings and conflict, pressure on weaker states, and an inability for other states to judge which party was at fault. An international agreement known as the Vienna Convention codified the rules and agreements, providing standards and privileges to all states.\n\nIt is possible for the official's home country to waive immunity; this tends to happen only when the individual has committed a serious [[crime]], unconnected with their diplomatic role (as opposed to, for example, allegations of [[espionage|spying]]), or has witnessed such a crime. However, many countries refuse to waive immunity as a matter of course; individuals have no authority to waive their own immunity<ref name=\"Subramanian2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Subramanian|first1=S.

In such cases, the servants of the \"criminal\" sovereign were often considered accomplices and their persons violated. In other circumstances, harbingers of inconsiderable demands were killed as a declaration of war. [[Herodotus]] records that when heralds of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian king]] [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] demanded \"earth and water\" (i.e., symbols of submission) of Greek cities, the [[Athens|Athenians]] threw them into a pit and the [[Sparta]]ns threw them down a well for the purpose of suggesting they would find both earth and water at the bottom, these often being mentioned by the messenger as a threat of siege. However, even for Herodotus, this maltreatment of envoys is a crime.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} He recounts a story of divine vengeance befalling Sparta for this deed.<ref>Herodotos.

''Am\u0101n'' was readily granted to any emissary bearing a letter or another sealed document. The duration of the ''am\u0101n'' was typically a year. Envoys with this right of passage were given immunity of person and property. They were exempt from [[taxation]], as long as they didn't engage in trade.<ref name=\"FadlAbou2009\"/>\n\nAs diplomats by definition enter the country under safe conduct, violating them is normally viewed as a great breach of honor, although there have been numerous cases in which diplomats have been killed. [[Genghis Khan]] and the [[Mongols]] were well known for strongly insisting on the rights of diplomats, and they would often take terrifying vengeance against any state that violated these rights. The Mongols would often raze entire cities in retaliation for the execution of their ambassadors, and [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|invaded and destroyed the Khwarezmid Empire]] after their ambassadors had been mistreated.<ref name=Prawdin>[[Michael Prawdin|Prawdin, Michael]]. ''The Mongol Empire''.</ref>\n\n===Modern===\n\nThe [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] first guaranteed [[Diplomatic Privileges Act 1708|diplomatic immunity]] to foreign ambassadors in 1709, after Count [[Andrey Matveyev]], a Russian resident in London, had been subjected to verbal and physical abuse by [[Bailiff#British Isles|British bailiffs]].\n\nModern diplomatic immunity evolved parallel to the development of modern diplomacy. In the 17th century, European diplomats realized that protection from prosecution was essential to doing their jobs, and a set of rules evolved guaranteeing the rights of diplomats. These were still confined to Western Europe and were closely tied to the prerogatives of nobility. Thus, an emissary to the Ottoman Empire could expect to be arrested and imprisoned upon the outbreak of hostilities between his state and the empire. The French Revolution also disrupted this system, as the revolutionary state and Napoleon imprisoned numerous diplomats who were accused of working against France. More recently, the [[Iran hostage crisis]] is universally considered a violation of diplomatic immunity. Although the hostage takers did not officially represent the state, host countries are obligated to protect diplomatic property and personnel. On the other hand, during [[World War II]], diplomatic immunity was upheld and the embassies of the belligerents were evacuated through neutral countries.\n\nFor the upper class of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, diplomatic immunity was an easy concept to understand. The first embassies were not permanent establishments but actual visits by high-ranking representatives, often close relatives, of the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] or the sovereign in person. As permanent representations evolved, usually on a treaty basis between two powers, they were frequently staffed by relatives of the sovereign or high-ranking nobles.\n\n[[War]]fare was a status of hostilities not between individuals but between their sovereigns, and the officers and officials of European governments and armies often changed employers. Truces and ceasefires were commonplace, along with fraternization between officers of enemy armies during them. When prisoners, the officers usually gave their [[wikt:parole|parole]] and were only restricted to a city away from the theatre of war. Almost always, they were given leave to carry their personal sidearms. Even during the French revolutionary wars, British scientists visited the French Academy. In such an atmosphere, it was easy to accept that some persons were immune to the laws. After all, they were still bound by strict requirements of honour and customs.\n\nIn the 19th century, the [[Congress of Vienna]] reasserted the rights of diplomats; and they have been largely respected since then, as the European model has spread throughout the world. Currently, diplomatic relations, including diplomatic immunity, are governed internationally by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], which has been ratified by almost every country in the world.\n\nIn modern times, diplomatic immunity continues to provide a means, albeit imperfect, to safeguard diplomatic personnel from any animosity that might arise between nations. As one article put it: \"So why do we agree to a system in which we're dependent on a foreign country's whim before we can prosecute a criminal inside our own borders? The practical answer is: because we depend on other countries to honor our own diplomats' immunity just as scrupulously as we honor theirs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jinnah-institute.org/issues/252-raymond-davis-and-the-vienna-convention- |title=Raymond Davis and the Vienna Convention |publisher=Jinnah-institute.org |accessdate=19 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726203911/http://www.jinnah-institute.org/issues/252-raymond-davis-and-the-vienna-convention- |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDuring 18 April 1961 Vienna Convention, the [[Holy See]] was granted diplomatic immunity to its [[nuncio|foreign ambassadors]] as well.<ref name=\"CNA2019\">{{Cite web |title=Holy See waives diplomatic immunity for accused nuncio to France |work=Catholic News Agency |date=8 July 2019 |access-date=7 October 2019 |url= https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/holy-see-waves-diplomatic-immunity-for-accused-nuncio-to-france-22125 }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978 ({{UnitedStatesCode|22|254a}} et seq.) follows the principles introduced by the Vienna Conventions. The United States tends to be generous when granting diplomatic immunity to visiting diplomats, because a large number of U.S. diplomats work in host countries less protective of individual rights. If the United States were to punish a visiting diplomat without sufficient grounds, U.S. representatives in other countries could receive harsher treatment. If a person with immunity is alleged to have committed a crime or faces a civil lawsuit, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] asks the home country to waive immunity of the alleged offender so that the complaint can be moved to the courts. If immunity is not waived, prosecution cannot be undertaken. However, the State Department still has the right to [[Persona non-grata|expel the diplomat]]. In many such cases, the diplomat's visas are canceled, and they and their family may be barred from returning to the United States. Crimes committed by members of a diplomat's family can also result in dismissal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/diplomatic-immunity |title=diplomatic immunity: West's Encyclopedia of American Law (Full Article) from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Exceptions to the Vienna Convention==\nSome countries have made reservations to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, but they are minor. A number of countries limit the diplomatic immunity of persons who are citizens of the receiving country. As nations keep faith to their treaties with differing zeal, other rules may also apply, though in most cases this summary is a reasonably accurate approximation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=List of Party States, Declarations and Reservations to Chapter III of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961 |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=III-3&chapter=3&lang=en |date=16 April 2011 |publisher=UNITED NATIONS TREATY COLLECTION |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227154400/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=III-3&chapter=3&lang=en |archivedate=27 December 2010 }}</ref> The Convention does not cover the personnel of [[international organization]]s, whose privileges are decided upon on a case-by-case basis, usually in the [[Treaty|treaties]] founding such organizations. The United Nations system (including its agencies, which comprise the most recognizable international bodies such as the World Bank and many others) has a relatively standardized form of limited immunities for staff traveling on [[United Nations laissez-passer|U.N. laissez-passer]]; diplomatic immunity is often granted to the highest-ranking officials{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} of these agencies. Consular officials (that do not have concurrent diplomatic accreditation) formally have a more limited form of immunity, generally limited to their official duties. Diplomatic technical and administrative staff also have more limited immunity under the Vienna Convention; for this reason, some countries may accredit a member of technical or administrative staff as an [[attach\u00e9]].\n\nOther categories of government officials that may travel frequently to other countries may not have diplomatic passports or diplomatic immunity, such as members of the military, high-ranking government officials, ministers, and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Many countries provide non-diplomatic official passports to such personnel, and there may be different classes of such travel documents such as official passports, service passports, and others. De facto recognition of some form of immunity may be conveyed by states accepting officials traveling on such documents, or there may exist bilateral agreements to govern such cases (as in, for example, the case of military personnel conducting or observing exercises on the territory of the receiving country).\n\nFormally, diplomatic immunity may be limited to officials accredited to a host country, or traveling to or from their host country. In practice, many countries may effectively recognize diplomatic immunity for those traveling on diplomatic passports, with admittance to the country constituting acceptance of the diplomatic status. However, this is not universal, and diplomats have been prosecuted and jailed for crimes committed outside the country they are accredited to.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/saudi-diplomat-lawyer-ordered-to-pay-costs-for-frivolous-9941168|title=Saudi diplomat's lawyer ordered to pay costs for 'frivolous' application to Court of Appeal|website=channelnewsasia.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Uses and abuses==\nIn reality, most diplomats are representatives of nations with a tradition of professional [[civil service]], and are expected to obey regulations governing their behaviour and they suffer severe disciplinary action if they flout local laws. In many nations, a professional diplomat's career may be compromised if they (or members of their family) disobey the local authorities or cause serious embarrassment, and such cases are, at any rate, a violation of the spirit of the Vienna Conventions.\n\nThe Vienna Convention is explicit that \"without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State.\" Nevertheless, on some occasions, diplomatic immunity leads to some unfortunate results; protected diplomats have violated laws (including those that would be violations at home as well) of the host country and that country has been essentially limited to informing the diplomat's nation that the diplomat is no longer welcome (''[[persona non-grata]]''). Diplomatic agents are not, however, exempt from the jurisdiction of their home state, and hence prosecution may be undertaken by the sending state. For minor violations of the law, the sending state may impose administrative procedures specific to the foreign service or diplomatic mission.\n\nViolation of the law by diplomats has included [[espionage]], smuggling, [[child custody]] law violations, money laundering,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Respectable and Professional?

Some financial institutions do not extend credit to diplomats because they have no legal means of ensuring the money be repaid. Local citizens and businesses are often at a disadvantage when filing civil claims against a diplomat, especially in cases of unpaid rent, alimony, and child support.\n\n====Rents====\n{{globalize|date=May 2017}}\nThe bulk of diplomatic debt lies in the rental of office space and living quarters. Individual debts can range from a few thousand dollars to $1 million in back rent. A group of diplomats and the office space in which they work are referred to as a [[diplomatic mission]]. Creditors cannot sue missions individually to collect money they owe. Landlords and creditors have found that the only thing they can do is contact a city agency to see if they can try to get some money back. They cannot enter the offices or apartments of diplomats to evict them because the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]] says that \"the property in the United States of a foreign state shall be immune from [[Attachment (law)|attachment]], arrest and execution\" ({{UnitedStatesCode|28|1609}}). This has led creditors who are owed money by diplomats to become more cautious about their renters and to change their rental or payment policies.\n\nIn one case, for example, officials from Zaire stopped paying rent to their private landlord and ran up $400,000 in debt. When the landlord sued, the U.S. State Department defended the Zaireans on the basis of diplomatic immunity, and a circuit court agreed. When the landlord finally cut off the utilities, the officials fled without paying their back rent. The landlords reportedly later reached an \"amicable agreement\" with the Zaire government.<ref name=\"Reader's Digest\"/>\n\n====Alimony and child support====\nThe issue of abusing diplomatic immunity in family relations, especially [[alimony]] and [[child support]], has become so widespread that it prompted discussion at the 1995 U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women, in [[Beijing]]. Historically, the [[United Nations]] has not become involved with family disputes and has refused to garnish the wages of diplomats who owe money for child support, citing [[sovereign immunity]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} However, in September 1995, the incumbent head of [[Legal Affairs]] for the [[United Nations]] acknowledged there was a moral and legal obligation to take at least a partial responsibility in family disputes. Fathers working as diplomats who refused to fulfill their family-related financial duties were increasing in numbers in the [[United Nations]]: several men who had left their wives and children were still claiming U.N. dependency, travel, and education allowances for their families, though they are no longer supporting those families.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Diplomatic+Immunity |title=Diplomatic Immunity legal definition of Diplomatic Immunity.

In certain cases, whether a payment is or is not considered a tax may be disputed, such as [[central London]]'s [[congestion charge]]. It was reported in 2006 that the UAE embassy had agreed to pay their own accumulated charges of nearly \u00a3100,000.<ref>{{cite news | title = Embassy to pay congestion charge | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4881442.stm | work = BBC News | date = 6 April 2006 | accessdate = 28 March 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThere is an obligation for the receiving state not to \"discriminate as between states\"; in other words, any such fees should be payable by all accredited diplomats equally. This may allow the [[diplomatic corps]] to negotiate as a group with the authorities of the receiving country.\n\nDiplomats are exempt from [[import duty]] and [[tariffs]] for items for their personal use. In some countries, this has led to charges that diplomatic agents are profiting personally from resale of \"tax free\" goods. The receiving state may choose to impose restrictions on what may reasonably constitute personal use (for example, only a certain quantity of [[cigarette]]s per day). When enacted, such restrictions are generally quite generous so as to avoid [[Tit for tat|tit-for-tat]] responses.\n\n===Espionage===\nOn 24 April 2008, in [[New Orleans]], Mexican [[press attach\u00e9]] Rafael Quintero Curiel was seen stealing [[BlackBerry]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] units from a [[White House]] press meeting room.

He initially denied taking the devices, but after being confronted with security video, Quintero claimed it was purely accidental, gave the devices back, claimed diplomatic immunity and left New Orleans with the Mexican delegation.

She also sang \"The Hokey Pokey Polka\" on the 1954 soundtrack for the film ''As Long As They're Happy''.\n\nDors recorded only one complete album, the [[Swing music|swing]]-themed ''Swingin' Dors'', in 1960. The LP was originally released on red vinyl and with a gatefold sleeve. The accompanying orchestra was conducted by [[Angela Morley|Wally Stott]].\n\nShe also sang as a special guest for the Italian TV show ''Un, due, tre'' (''One, two, three'', starring [[Ugo Tognazzi]] and [[Raimondo Vianello]]) on 31 May 1959, at the Teatro della Fiera in [[Milan]], with orchestra conducted by Mario Bertolazzi and recorded singles on various record labels from the 1960s through the early 1980s, including a single for the Nomis label, \"[[Where Did They Go]]?\" / \"It's You Again\" (the latter being a duet with her son, Gary Dawson), while she was battling cancer. While promoting the single on TV, Dors claimed \"Where Did They Go?\" had been especially written for her, but in fact, the track had been recorded originally by [[Peggy Lee]] in 1971 and in 1972 by [[Sandie Shaw]].\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCC\"\n!

During the short relationship, Dors became pregnant, but Caborn-Waterfield paid for a back-street abortion, which took place on a kitchen table in [[Battersea]]. The relationship continued for a time, before Dors met Dennis Hamilton Gittins on the set of ''Lady Godiva Rides Again'', with whom she had a second abortion in 1951.<ref name=DDStar2>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/1_the_star_2_33.html|title=The Diana Dors Story &ndash; The Star 2|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIt is said that Dors became a close friend of [[Ruth Ellis]], the last woman to be hanged in Britain, after Ellis had a bit part in ''Lady Godiva Rides Again'', four years before she was executed by [[Albert Pierrepoint]], having admitted to and been found guilty of shooting her lover. However Diana never mentioned having known Ruth either in interviews or in her memoirs. Through her husband Hamilton, Dors was close friends with the notorious [[Kray twins]] and their mother Violet.<ref name=Bret/>\n\n===Parties===\nDuring her relationship with Hamilton and until a few months before her death, Dors regularly held adult parties at her home. There, a number of celebrities, amply supplied with alcohol and drugs, mixed with young starlets against a background of both softcore and hardcore porn films.<ref name=Bret>{{cite book|title=Diana Dors: Hurricane In Mink|author=David Bret|date=October 2010|publisher=JR Books, London|isbn=978-1-907532-10-8 }}</ref><!--There seems to be some disagreement about the date of publication--> Dors gave all her guests full access to the entire house; her son Jason Lake later alleged in various media interviews and publications that she had equipped it with [[8 mm film|8 mm movie cameras]]. The young starlets were made aware of the arrangements and were allowed to attend for free in return for making sure that their celebrity partners performed in bed at the right camera angles.<ref name=Bret/> Dors later enjoyed watching the films, keeping an archive of the best performances.\n\nDors became an early subject of the \"celebrity expos\u00e9\" [[tabloid journalism|tabloids]], appearing regularly in the ''[[News of the World]]''. In large part, she brought this notoriety upon herself. In desperate need of cash after her separation from Hamilton in 1958, she gave an interview in which she described their lives and the adult group parties in full, frank detail. The interview was serialised in the tabloid for 12 weeks,<ref name=DDStar6/> followed by an extended six-week series of sensational stories, creating negative publicity. Subsequently, the Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher denounced Dors as a \"wayward hussy\".<ref name=DDStar6>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/the_star_6_28.html|title=The Diana Dors Story -The Star 6|website=Dianadors.co.uk|access-date=24 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109020302/http://www.dianadors.co.uk/the_star_6_28.html|archive-date=9 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nTelevision news and film companies with more general interests, partly because of her popularity and partly because of who was attending the parties, were unwilling to repeat the stories until well after Dors' death.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/200209300041 \"Girls, booze, drugs and parties\" (30 September 2002) ''New Statesman'']</ref> Her former lover and party guest [[Bob Monkhouse]]<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/aug/20/features.magazine27 | location=London | work=The Observer | first=Lynn | last=Barber | title=Interview: Bob Monkhouse | date=20 August 2000}}</ref> later commented in an interview after Dors' death, \"The awkward part about an [[orgy]], is that afterwards you're not too sure who to thank.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/sep/29/features.review137 | location=London | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | first=Andrew | last=Anthony | title=Television: Under the weather | date=29 September 2002}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nTowards the end of her life Dors had meningitis and twice underwent surgery to remove cancerous tumours.

She was buried in Sunningdale Catholic Cemetery.\n===Alan Lake suicide===\nAfter her death, Alan Lake burned all of Dors' remaining clothes and fell into a depression. On 10 October 1984, Lake did a telephone interview with ''[[Daily Express]]'' journalist [[Jean Rook]] and then he walked into their son's bedroom and took his own life by firing a shotgun into his mouth.<ref name=Express208200>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/208200|title=Men who destroyed Diana Dors|author=Neil Norman|work=Express.co.uk|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> He was 43.

The house's contents were bulk-sold by [[Sotheby's]], which sold her jewellery collection in an auction. After solicitors' bills, outstanding tax payments, death duties, and other distributions, the combined estates of Dors and Lake left little for the upkeep of their son Jason (aged 14), who was subsequently made a [[ward of court]] to his half-brother Gary Dawson in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/orchard_manor_41.html|title=Orchard Manor, Diana's last home.|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn 14th September 2019, Jason Dors Lake, the son of Diana Dors and Alan Lake, was reported to have died several days after his 50th birthday at his flat in Notting Hill Gate, London. <ref>[https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/15/diana-dors-youngest-son-jason-dies-just-days-50th-birthday-10745943/ Diana Dors\u2019 youngest son Jason Dors Lake dies just days after his 50th birthday].

In 1982, she gave her son Mark Dawson a sheet of paper on which, she told him, was a code that would reveal the whereabouts of the money.<ref name=Bret/> His stepfather Alan Lake supposedly knew the key that would crack the code, but he committed suicide soon after her death and Dawson was left with an apparently unsolvable puzzle.<ref name=Bret/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/5104063.Secret_code_of_Diana_Dors__millions/|title=Secret code of Diana Dors' millions|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}</ref>\n\nHe sought out computer [[forensic]] specialists Inforenz, who recognised the encryption as the [[Vigen\u00e8re cipher]]. Inforenz then used their own cryptanalysis software to suggest a 10-letter [[decryption]] key, DMARYFLUCK (short for Diana Mary Fluck, Dors's real name).<ref name=Bret/> With the aid of a bank statement found among Alan Lake's papers, Inforenz was then able to decode the existing material to reveal a list of surnames and towns only &ndash; suggesting that there must be a second page that would reveal first names and bank details, to complete the message. As this has never come to light, no money has ever been traced.

She first came to public notice as a [[Blonde stereotype#Blondebombshell|blonde bombshell]] in the style of American [[Marilyn Monroe]], as promoted by her first husband, Dennis Hamilton, mostly via sex film-comedies and risqu\u00e9 modelling. After it turned out that Hamilton had been defrauding her, she continued to play up to her established image, and she made [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines with the parties reportedly held at her house. Later, she showed a genuine talent as a performer on TV, in recordings, and in [[cabaret]], and gained new popularity as a regular chat-show guest. She also gave some well-regarded performances in worthwhile films at different points in her career.\n\nAccording to [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], \"Dors represented that period between the end of the [[World War II|war]] and the coming of [[Lady Chatterley's Lover|Lady Chatterley]] in paperback, a time when sexuality was naughty, repressed and fit to burst.\" <ref>FILM STUDIES: She could have been a contender.

In December 1958 RKO terminated its contract with Dors alleging she \"has become an object of disgrace, obloquy, ill will and ridicule.\" Dors sued the studio for $1,250,000 in damages.<ref name=\"rko\"/> She later settled for $200,000.<ref>\"Diana Dors to Get $200,000 in Studio Suit\", ''Los Angeles Times'' 11 July 1960: B3. </ref>\n\nDors played an American in the French-Italian ''[[The Love Specialist]]'' (1958) and was a prostitute in ''[[Passport to Shame]]'' (1958). Joseph Kaufman announced he wanted to make a film starring her called ''Stopover'' but it was never made.

Details about the affair were reportedly leaked to the press by Yeardye.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1460720/Tommy-Yeardye.html Obituary: Tommy Yeardye], ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 1 May 2004</ref> Hamilton discovered the relationship, and another period of separation began that led to divorce proceedings.<ref name=Bret/>\n\nFollowing her final separation from Hamilton in 1958, Dors discovered that her company Diana Dors Ltd was in serious debt. Hamilton had steered the company toward the dual purpose of publicising his wife and helping himself, overpaying tax bills and establishing financial stability.<ref name=DDStar5/>\n\nHaving been forced by Hamilton to sign over all of her assets on their separation, and in need of money to pay her divorce lawyers and their accountants, she agreed to the suggestion of agent Joseph Collins to undertake a theatre-based cabaret tour titled \"The Diana Dors Show\".\n\nYeardye suggested that they hire the comedian Dickie Dawson, later known as [[Richard Dawson]]. Dawson subsequently scripted the show and wrote most of the material. Dors started a relationship with Dawson and ended the relationship with Yeardye, who subsequently emptied her cash box at [[Harrods]] of \u00a318,000 and sold his story to the media.<ref name=Bret/> This brought negative publicity to the show, but audience numbers remained high, which allowed Dors extra time to explain her affairs to a subsequent [[Inland Revenue]] investigation of her cash holdings.<ref name=DDStar5>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/1_the_star_5_36.html|title=The Diana Dors Story -The Star 5|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref> In 1959, Hamilton died, and Dors married Dawson in New York while making an appearance on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]''. \"The Diana Dors Show\" was commissioned for two studio-based series on television at [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].<ref name=Bret/>\n\n===Hollywood once more===\nAfter the birth of her first child in February 1960, and wishing to stay in the United States with Dawson, Dors undertook a cabaret contract to headline at the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes hotel and casino]] in Las Vegas.<ref name=Bret/>\n\nShe appeared in some American films: ''[[On the Double (film)|On the Double]]'' (1961), a [[Danny Kaye]] comedy, and ''[[The Big Bankroll]]'' (1962), a crime film also known as ''King of the Roaring 20's: The Story of Arnold Rothstein''.

Dors also starred in a 1963 episode of ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' titled \"Run for Doom\", co-starring [[John Gavin]], and an episode of ''[[Straightaway]]''.\n\nDors returned to Britain. In 1961 she narrowly escaped death at a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] party in [[Wraysbury]] where fireworks were accidentally ignited indoors. The house was destroyed, three people died in the fire and another one had a fatal heart attack, and Dors was slightly injured while escaping through a window.<ref>Diana Dors Leaps Out Window as Blast and Blaze Kill 3 at Party\n''Los Angeles Times'' 6 Nov 1961: 1. </ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Diana Dors Injured, 3 Killed in Party Blast|periodical=Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|date=1961-11-06|page=37}}</ref>\n\nShe appeared in ''[[Mrs. Gibbons' Boys (film)|Mrs. Gibbons' Boys]]'' (1962), ''[[West 11]]'' (1963), ''[[The Counterfeit Constable]]'' (1964), and ''[[The Sandwich Man (1966 film)|The Sandwich Man]]'' (1966).\n\nShe did return to America to guest star on episodes of ''[[Burke's Law (1960s TV series)|Burke's Law]]'' and ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', and was on ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'' in Britain.

She became a regular on ''[[Jokers Wild (TV series)|Jokers Wild]]'', ''[[Blankety Blank]]'' and ''[[Celebrity Squares]]'', and was a regular guest on [[BBC Radio 2]]'s ''The Law Game''. She also had a recurring role in ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wiltshire/content/image_galleries/diana_dors_gallery.shtml?27|title=Diana Dors: A Life in Pictures|publisher=BBC}}</ref>  A popular chat-show guest, an entire show&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Russell Harty]]: At Home with Dors''&nbsp;\u2013 came from the pool room of her home, Orchard Manor.<ref name=DDTwilight/> Younger musical artists engaged her persona, brought about after the 1981 [[Adam and the Ants]] music video \"[[Prince Charming (Adam and the Ants song)|Prince Charming]]\", where she played the [[fairy godmother]] opposite [[Adam Ant]], who played a male [[Cinderella]] figure.\n\nDors' other final appearances were in ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1980 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1980), ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' (1981), ''[[Dick Turpin (TV series)|Dick Turpin]]'' (1981),  and ''[[Cannon and Ball]]'' (1981).\n\nHaving turned her life story into a cash flow through interviews and leaked tabloid stories, like many celebrities in their later careers, she turned to the autobiography to generate retirement cash. In 1960 she wrote and published ''Swingin' Dors'' and between 1978 and 1984, she published four autobiographical books under her own name: ''For Adults Only'', ''Behind Closed Dors'', ''Dors by Diana'', and ''A. to Z. of Men''.\n\nDiana Dors was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions, in April 1957 when she was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC Television Theatre, and in October 1982, when Andrews surprised her at London's Royalty Theatre.\n\nHaving gone through her first round of cancer treatment, by the early 1980s Dors' hour-glass figure had become plumper, and she addressed the issue through co-authoring a diet book,<ref>{{cite book|title=X-Cel diet|author=Diana Dors & Michael Waterfield|publisher=Julian P.|date=May 1983|isbn=0-901943-20-7}}</ref> and creating a diet and exercise [[videocassette]]. This resulted in her working for [[TV-am]], ITV's breakfast station, in the summer of 1983, in a regular slot focusing on diet and nutrition, which later developed into an [[Advice column|agony aunt]] segment. As the cancer treatment took its toll again, though, her appearances became less frequent.<ref name=DDTwilight>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/twilight_years_13.html|title=The Diana Dors Story &ndash; Twilight Years|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref>  She sued the show for withholding her fan mail.<ref>Diana Dors in row over TV-am 'fan mail', Barker, Dennis.

The tracks were \"I Feel So Mmmm\" and \"A Kiss and a Cuddle (and a Few Kind Words From You)\". HMV also released sheet music featuring sultry photos of Dors on the cover. She also sang \"The Hokey Pokey Polka\" on the 1954 soundtrack for the film ''As Long As They're Happy''.\n\nDors recorded only one complete album, the [[Swing music|swing]]-themed ''Swingin' Dors'', in 1960. The LP was originally released on red vinyl and with a gatefold sleeve. The accompanying orchestra was conducted by [[Angela Morley|Wally Stott]].\n\nShe also sang as a special guest for the Italian TV show ''Un, due, tre'' (''One, two, three'', starring [[Ugo Tognazzi]] and [[Raimondo Vianello]]) on 31 May 1959, at the Teatro della Fiera in [[Milan]], with orchestra conducted by Mario Bertolazzi and recorded singles on various record labels from the 1960s through the early 1980s, including a single for the Nomis label, \"[[Where Did They Go]]?\" / \"It's You Again\" (the latter being a duet with her son, Gary Dawson), while she was battling cancer. While promoting the single on TV, Dors claimed \"Where Did They Go?\" had been especially written for her, but in fact, the track had been recorded originally by [[Peggy Lee]] in 1971 and in 1972 by [[Sandie Shaw]].\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCC\"\n!

During the short relationship, Dors became pregnant, but Caborn-Waterfield paid for a back-street abortion, which took place on a kitchen table in [[Battersea]]. The relationship continued for a time, before Dors met Dennis Hamilton Gittins on the set of ''Lady Godiva Rides Again'', with whom she had a second abortion in 1951.<ref name=DDStar2>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/1_the_star_2_33.html|title=The Diana Dors Story &ndash; The Star 2|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIt is said that Dors became a close friend of [[Ruth Ellis]], the last woman to be hanged in Britain, after Ellis had a bit part in ''Lady Godiva Rides Again'', four years before she was executed by [[Albert Pierrepoint]], having admitted to and been found guilty of shooting her lover. However Diana never mentioned having known Ruth either in interviews or in her memoirs. Through her husband Hamilton, Dors was close friends with the notorious [[Kray twins]] and their mother Violet.<ref name=Bret/>\n\n===Parties===\nDuring her relationship with Hamilton and until a few months before her death, Dors regularly held adult parties at her home.

It is assigned to the [[USAF Weapons School]] at [[Nellis Air Force Base]]. The mission of the squadron is to provide advanced [[Lockheed C-130J Hercules]] instructional flying.\n\nThe squadron was first activated in 1942 as the '''29th Transport Squadron'''.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] as the '''29th Troop Carrier Squadron'''.  The squadron dropped [[paratrooper]]s in the invasions of Sicily and Italy before moving to England.  From England it participated in [[Operation Overlord]].  The 29th earned two [[Distinguished Unit Citation]]s for combat actions.  Following [[VE Day]], the squadron returned to the United States where it was inactivated in September 1945.\n\nThe squadron was activated again in September 1946 and served with the [[military occupation|occupation]] forces in Italy and Austria before returning to the United States in 1947.  In 1948 the squadron moved to Germany, where it participated in the [[Berlin Airlift]] until being inactivated in 1949 as American [[airlift]] forces in Germany were reduced after the blockade of Berlin was ended.  The squadron was activated again at [[Mitchel Air Force Base]] in February 1953, when it assumed the resources of the [[335th Troop Carrier Squadron]], a reserve unit that had been activated for the [[Korean War]], and which was returning to reserve status.  The squadron was inactivated in June 1955.\n\nThe squadron was again activated in October 1964 at [[Forbes Air Force Base]], Kansas.  In December 1965, the squadron moved to [[Clark Air Base]], Philippines, from which it deployed its Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports to support the [[Vietnam War]].  In 1971, it moved on paper to [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia, where it again worked up on the C-130.  Shortly after it became combat ready, however, it was inactivated and its personnel and aircraft were transferred to the [[38th Tactical Airlift Squadron]], which was simultaneously activated.\n\n==Mission==\nThe 29th Weapons Squadron conducts graduate-level instruction in weapons and tactics employment with the [[Lockheed C-130J Hercules]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.littlerock.af.mil/units/ |title=Little Rock Air Force Base Units|publisher=19th Airlift Wing Public Affairs|accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> A detachment of the squadron at [[Rosecrans Field]] performs the same mission for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve C-130H crews.<ref name=weaponscourse>{{cite web |url= https://www.dvidshub.net/news/140776/c-130-weapons-course-comes-air-national-guard-base#.Vp19yPkrKM8 |last1=Crane|first1=TSG Michael|title=C-130 'weapons' course comes to Air National Guard base|date=28 August 2014|publisher=Defense Video Information and Distribution System|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n[[File:313tcg-c47-1.jpg|thumb|left|313th Troop Carrier Group C-47]]\nThe [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was activated as the '''29th Transport Squadron''' in March 1942 as the original squadron of the [[313th Transport Group]].

It performed [[airlift]] of supplies and personnel to ground forces advancing through Algeria into Tunisia as part of [[Twelfth Air Force]].  The unit also evacuated wounded personnel to rear areas.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nThe 29th, along with the 47th and 48th Squadrons of the 313th Group, took part in [[Operation Husky]], the invasion of [[Sicily]].  Although blown far off course on the first airdrops on the island by strong winds, the squadron managed to drop their paratroops near [[Avola]], where they were able to assist British forces in seizing that town.<ref>Warren , p. 35</ref> Two days later, 11 July 1943, the squadron was part of a formation of troop carrier units of the [[52d Troop Carrier Wing]] bringing reinforcements, planning to drop [[paratroop]]s near [[Gela]].  Planes of the 313th Group led the stream of troop carriers.  However, attacks in the Gela area by enemy aircraft had sunk two ships and forced other ships in the invasion force to disperse.  The heaviest enemy attack came at 2150 hours.  Fifty minutes later, the first 313th Group aircraft approached the [[drop zone]].  The 48th was able to successfully make its drop on Farello Airfield.  Mistaking the troop carriers for another enemy attack, ships of the assault force and antiaircraft units ashore began a heavy fire on squadron's C-47s as they departed.  Of the 144 planes of the 52d Wing that participated in the mission, 23 were shot down and an additional 37 were heavily damaged.<ref>Garland & Smyth, pp. 177\u2013181</ref><ref>Warren, p. 39</ref> For its completion of this mission the squadron earned its first [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] (DUC).<ref name=29WSfacts/>\n\nIt moved to Sicily for [[Operation Avalanche]], the invasion of Italy.

On [[D-Day]] the squadron dropped paratroopers near [[Picauville]], Normandy and dropped reinforcements the following day.  The squadron's efforts during [[Operation Overlord]] earned it a second DUC.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nOn 17 September, the squadron participated in [[Operation Market Garden]], the airborne assault on the Netherlands, when it dropped troopers near [[Arnhem]] and [[Nijmegen]].  In February 1945, the squadron moved to [[Achiet Airfield]] in France, where it began converting to [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s in preparation for [[Operation Varsity]], the airborne assault across the [[Rhine]].  On 24 March 1945 it dropped elements of the [[17th Airborne Division]] near [[Wesel]].<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nThe squadron continued to operate from Achiet during 1945, performing transportation of personnel and supplies within Europe.  It evacuated wounded and former [[prisoners of war]] and brought gasoline, ammunition to forward areas.  After [[V-E Day]], it continued to transport medical equipment and other supplies.  In September, the squadron's personnel returned to the United States and it was inactivated on arrival at the Port of Embarkation.<ref name=29WSfacts/><ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nIn August 1945 the squadron returned to the United States, and was inactivated at the Port of Embarkation in September.<ref name=29WSfacts/>\n\n===Army of Occupation and Berlin Airlift===\n[[File:C-54 landing at Tempelhof 1948.jpg|thumb|C-54 landing at Tempelhof Airport, Berlin]]\nThe squadron was activated at [[Capodichino Airport]] near Naples, Italy at the end of September 1946, absorbing the mission, personnel and equipment of the [[305th Troop Carrier Squadron]], which was simultaneously inactivated.<ref>''See'' Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 369\u2013370 (305th Squadron inactivation)</ref> It once again was equipped with C-47s.

At [[Bergstrom Field]], Texas it trained with [[Fairchild C-82 Packet]]s and gliders.  The squadron departed Bergstrom for in late October 1948 for Germany, arriving in early November to reinforce airlift units in [[Operation Vittles]], the Berlin airlift as winter approached and the demand for supplies increased.  Operating from a [[Royal Air Force]] base because of congestion at [[United States Air Forces Europe]] bases in Germany, the unit used [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]]s to transport cargo including coal, food, and medicine into [[West Berlin]].  As airlift forces in Europe were reduced following the lifting of the Soviet blockade, and faced with President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman\u2019s]] smaller 1949 defense budget, the Air Force was required to reduce the number of its groups to 48.

It is assigned to the [[USAF Weapons School]] at [[Nellis Air Force Base]]. The mission of the squadron is to provide advanced [[Lockheed C-130J Hercules]] instructional flying.\n\nThe squadron was first activated in 1942 as the '''29th Transport Squadron'''.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] as the '''29th Troop Carrier Squadron'''.  The squadron dropped [[paratrooper]]s in the invasions of Sicily and Italy before moving to England.  From England it participated in [[Operation Overlord]].  The 29th earned two [[Distinguished Unit Citation]]s for combat actions.  Following [[VE Day]], the squadron returned to the United States where it was inactivated in September 1945.\n\nThe squadron was activated again in September 1946 and served with the [[military occupation|occupation]] forces in Italy and Austria before returning to the United States in 1947.  In 1948 the squadron moved to Germany, where it participated in the [[Berlin Airlift]] until being inactivated in 1949 as American [[airlift]] forces in Germany were reduced after the blockade of Berlin was ended.  The squadron was activated again at [[Mitchel Air Force Base]] in February 1953, when it assumed the resources of the [[335th Troop Carrier Squadron]], a reserve unit that had been activated for the [[Korean War]], and which was returning to reserve status.  The squadron was inactivated in June 1955.\n\nThe squadron was again activated in October 1964 at [[Forbes Air Force Base]], Kansas.  In December 1965, the squadron moved to [[Clark Air Base]], Philippines, from which it deployed its Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports to support the [[Vietnam War]].  In 1971, it moved on paper to [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia, where it again worked up on the C-130.  Shortly after it became combat ready, however, it was inactivated and its personnel and aircraft were transferred to the [[38th Tactical Airlift Squadron]], which was simultaneously activated.\n\n==Mission==\nThe 29th Weapons Squadron conducts graduate-level instruction in weapons and tactics employment with the [[Lockheed C-130J Hercules]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.littlerock.af.mil/units/ |title=Little Rock Air Force Base Units|publisher=19th Airlift Wing Public Affairs|accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> A detachment of the squadron at [[Rosecrans Field]] performs the same mission for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve C-130H crews.<ref name=weaponscourse>{{cite web |url= https://www.dvidshub.net/news/140776/c-130-weapons-course-comes-air-national-guard-base#.Vp19yPkrKM8 |last1=Crane|first1=TSG Michael|title=C-130 'weapons' course comes to Air National Guard base|date=28 August 2014|publisher=Defense Video Information and Distribution System|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n[[File:313tcg-c47-1.jpg|thumb|left|313th Troop Carrier Group C-47]]\nThe [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was activated as the '''29th Transport Squadron''' in March 1942 as the original squadron of the [[313th Transport Group]].

Planes of the 313th Group led the stream of troop carriers.  However, attacks in the Gela area by enemy aircraft had sunk two ships and forced other ships in the invasion force to disperse.  The heaviest enemy attack came at 2150 hours.  Fifty minutes later, the first 313th Group aircraft approached the [[drop zone]].  The 48th was able to successfully make its drop on Farello Airfield.  Mistaking the troop carriers for another enemy attack, ships of the assault force and antiaircraft units ashore began a heavy fire on squadron's C-47s as they departed.  Of the 144 planes of the 52d Wing that participated in the mission, 23 were shot down and an additional 37 were heavily damaged.<ref>Garland & Smyth, pp. 177\u2013181</ref><ref>Warren , p. 39</ref> For its completion of this mission the squadron earned its first [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] (DUC).<ref name=29WSfacts/>\n\nIt moved to Sicily for [[Operation Avalanche]], the invasion of Italy.

On [[D-Day]] the squadron dropped paratroopers near [[Picauville]], Normandy and dropped reinforcements the following day.  The squadron's efforts during [[Operation Overlord]] earned it a second DUC.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nOn 17 September, the squadron participated in [[Operation Market Garden]], the airborne assault on the Netherlands, when it dropped troopers near [[Arnhem]] and [[Nijmegen]].  In February 1945, the squadron moved to [[Achiet Airfield]] in France, where it began converting to [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s in preparation for [[Operation Varsity]], the airborne assault across the [[Rhine]].  On 24 March 1945 it dropped elements of the [[17th Airborne Division]] near [[Wesel]].<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nThe squadron continued to operate from Achiet during 1945, performing transportation of personnel and supplies within Europe.  It evacuated wounded and former [[prisoners of war]] and brought gasoline, ammunition to forward areas.  After [[V-E Day]], it continued to transport medical equipment and other supplies.  In September, the squadron's personnel returned to the United States and it was inactivated on arrival at the Port of Embarkation.<ref name=29WSfacts/><ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nIn August 1945 the squadron returned to the United States, and was inactivated at the Port of Embarkation in September.<ref name=29WSfacts/>\n\n===Army of Occupation and Berlin Airlift===\n[[File:C-54 landing at Tempelhof 1948.jpg|thumb|C-54 landing at Tempelhof Airport, Berlin]]\nThe squadron was activated at [[Capodichino Airport]] near Naples, Italy at the end of September 1946, absorbing the mission, personnel and equipment of the [[305th Troop Carrier Squadron]], which was simultaneously inactivated.<ref>''See'' Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 369\u2013370 (305th Squadron inactivation)</ref> It once again was equipped with C-47s.

At [[Bergstrom Field]], Texas it trained with [[Fairchild C-82 Packet]]s and gliders.  The squadron departed Bergstrom for in late October 1948 for Germany, arriving in early November to reinforce airlift units in [[Operation Vittles]], the Berlin airlift as winter approached and the demand for supplies increased.  Operating from a [[Royal Air Force]] base because of congestion at [[United States Air Forces Europe]] bases in Germany, the unit used [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]]s to transport cargo including coal, food, and medicine into [[West Berlin]].  As airlift forces in Europe were reduced following the lifting of the Soviet blockade, and faced with President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman\u2019s]] smaller 1949 defense budget, the Air Force was required to reduce the number of its groups to 48.

The building was [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]'s vantage point in his [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963. Oswald, an employee at the depository, shot and killed President Kennedy from a sixth floor window on the building's southeastern corner; 30 minutes after the shooting, Kennedy died at [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]].

It was rebuilt in 1902 in the Commercial [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style and expanded to seven stories. In 1937, the Carraway Byrd Corporation purchased the property, but they defaulted on the loan. It was sold at public auction July 4, 1939 and purchased by [[D.

In November 1961, Sexton Foods moved to a modern distribution facility located at 650 Regal Row Dallas; by then, the building was known locally as the Sexton Building.

{"title_page": "Command-line interface", "text_new": "{{short description|Type of computer interface based on entering text commands and viewing text output}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2012|cs1-dates=y}}\n[[File:Linux command-line. Bash. GNOME Terminal. screenshot.png|thumb|300px|Screenshot of a sample [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] session in [[GNOME Terminal]] 3, [[Fedora 15]].]]\n[[File:Windows PowerShell 1.0 PD.png|thumb|300px|Screenshot of [[PowerShell|Windows PowerShell]] 1.0, running on [[Windows Vista]].]]\n\nA '''command-line interface''' ('''CLI''') processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a '''command-line interpreter''' or '''command-line processor'''. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a [[shell (computing)|shell]] for interactive access to operating system functions or services. Such access was primarily provided to users by [[computer terminal]]s starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on [[OpenVMS|VAX/VMS]], [[Unix]] systems and personal computer systems including [[DOS]], [[CP/M]] and [[Apple DOS]].\n\nToday, users rely upon [[graphical user interface]]s and menu-driven interactions. However some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line. \n\nAlternatives to the command line interface include [[text user interface]] [[menu (computing)|menus]] (for example, [[IBM AIX SMIT]]), [[keyboard shortcut]]s, and various [[desktop metaphor]]s centered on the [[pointer (graphical user interfaces)|pointer]] (usually controlled with a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]). Examples of this include the Microsoft Windows, [[DOSSHELL|DosShell]], and Mouse Systems PowerPanel. Command line interfaces are often implemented in terminal devices that are also capable of screen-oriented text user interfaces that use cursor addressing to place symbols on a display screen.\n\nPrograms with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via [[scripting language|scripting]].\n\nMany software systems implement command line interfaces for control and operation. This includes programming environments and utility programs.\n\n==Comparison to graphical user interfaces==\n[[File:Gem_11_Desktop.png|thumb|250px|A graphical user interface with icons and windows ([[GEM (desktop environment)|GEM 1.1 Desktop]])]]\nCompared with a graphical user interface, a command line interface requires fewer system resources to implement. Since options to commands are given in a few characters in each command line, an experienced user may often find the options easier to access. Automation of repetitive tasks is simplified by line editing and history mechanisms for storing frequently used sequences; this may extend to a [[scripting language]] that can take parameters and variable options. A command-line history can be kept, allowing review or repetition of commands. \n \nA command-line system may require paper or online manuals for the user's reference, although often a \"help\" option provides a concise review of the options of a command. The command-line environment may not provide the graphical enhancements such as different [[Computer font|fonts]] or extended [[window (computing)|edit windows]] found in a GUI. It may be difficult for a new user to become familiar with all the commands and options available, compared with the [[icon (computing)|icons]] and [[drop-down menu]]s of a graphical user interface, without repeated reference to manuals.\n\n==Types==\n===Operating system command-line interfaces===\n[[File:Apple Unix with Netscape.png|thumb|250px|[[Apple Computer]]'s CommandShell in [[A/UX]] 3.0.1.]]\nOperating system (OS) command-line interfaces are usually distinct programs supplied with the operating system. A program that implements such a text interface is often called a command-line interpreter, command processor or [[shell (computing)|shell]]. \n\nExamples of command-line interpreters include [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC's]] [[DIGITAL Command Language]] (DCL) in [[OpenVMS]] and [[RSX-11]], the various [[Unix shell]]s ([[Bourne shell|sh]], [[KornShell|ksh]], [[C shell|csh]], [[tcsh]], [[Z shell|zsh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], etc.), [[CP/M]]'s [[Console Command Processor|CCP]], [[DOS]]'s [[COMMAND.COM]], as well as the [[OS/2]] and the Windows [[CMD.EXE]] programs, the latter groups being based heavily on DEC's RSX-11 and [[RSTS/E|RSTS]] CLIs. Under most operating systems, it is possible to replace the default shell program with alternatives; examples include [[4DOS]] for DOS, [[4OS2]] for OS/2, and [[Take Command Console|4NT / Take Command]] for Windows.\n\nAlthough the term 'shell' is often used to describe a command-line interpreter, strictly speaking a 'shell' can be any program that constitutes the user-interface, including fully graphically oriented ones. For example, the default Windows GUI is a shell program named [[EXPLORER.EXE]], as defined in the SHELL=EXPLORER.EXE line in the WIN.INI configuration file. These programs are shells, but not CLIs.\n\n===Application command-line interfaces===\n[[File:GNUOctave430.png|thumb|250px|[[GNU Octave]]'s GUI with command-line interface]]\nApplication programs (as opposed to operating systems) may also have command line interfaces.\n\nAn application program may support none, any, or all of these three major types of command line interface mechanisms:\n\n* ''Parameters'': Most operating systems support a means to pass additional information to a program when it is launched. When a program is launched from an OS command line shell, additional text provided along with the program name is passed to the launched program.\n* ''Interactive command line sessions'': After launch, a program may provide an operator with an independent means to enter commands in the form of text.\n* ''Inter-process communication'': Most operating systems support means of [[inter-process communication]] (for example, [[standard streams]] or [[named pipe]]s). Command lines from client processes may be redirected to a CLI program by one of these methods.\n\nSome applications support only a CLI, presenting a CLI prompt to the user and acting upon command lines as they are entered. Other programs support both a CLI and a GUI. In some cases, a GUI is simply a [[Wrapper function|wrapper]] around a separate CLI [[executable file]]. In other cases, a program may provide a CLI as an optional alternative to its GUI. CLIs and GUIs often support different functionality. For example, all features of [[MATLAB]], a [[numerical analysis]] computer program, are available via the CLI, whereas the MATLAB GUI exposes only a subset of features.\n\nThe early Sierra games, such as the first three ''[[King's Quest]]'' games (1984\u20131986), used commands from an internal command line to move the character around in the graphic window.\n\n==History==\nThe command-line interface evolved from a form of dialog once conducted by humans over [[teleprinter]] (TTY) machines, in which human operators remotely exchanged information, usually one line of text at a time. Early computer systems often used teleprinter machines as the means of interaction with a human operator. The computer became one end of the human-to-human teleprinter model. So instead of a human communicating with another human over a teleprinter, a human communicated with a computer.\n\nThe mechanical teleprinter was replaced by a [[dumb terminal#Early VDUs|\"glass tty\"]], a keyboard and screen emulating the teleprinter. [[computer terminal#.22Intelligent.22 terminals|\"Smart\" terminal]]s permitted additional functions, such as cursor movement over the entire screen, or local editing of data on the terminal for transmission to the computer. As the [[microcomputer revolution]] replaced the traditional{{snd}}minicomputer + terminals{{snd}}[[time sharing]] architecture, hardware terminals were replaced by [[terminal emulator]]s&nbsp;\u2014 PC software that interpreted terminal signals sent through the PC's [[serial port]]s. These were typically used to interface an organization's new PC's with their existing mini- or mainframe computers, or to connect PC to PC. Some of these PCs were running [[Bulletin Board System]] software.\n\nEarly operating system CLIs were implemented as part of [[resident monitor]] programs, and could not easily be replaced. The first implementation of the shell as a replaceable component was part of the [[Multics]] [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]].<ref name=\"Unix_Shells\"/> In 1964, [[MIT Computation Center]] staff member [[Louis Pouzin]] developed the [[RUNCOM]] tool for executing command scripts while allowing argument substitution.<ref name=\"multicians\"/> Pouzin coined the term \"[[shell (computing)|shell]]\" to describe the technique of using commands like a programming language, and wrote a paper about how to implement the idea in the [[Multics]] operating system.<ref name=\"Metz_2013\"/> Pouzin returned to his native France in 1965, and the first Multics shell was developed by [[Glenda Schroeder]].<ref name=\"multicians\"/>\n\n[[File:Version 7 UNIX SIMH PDP11 Kernels Shell.png|thumb|250px|[[Bourne shell]] interaction on [[Version 7 Unix]]]]\nThe first [[Unix shell]], the [[Thompson shell|V6 shell]], was developed by [[Ken Thompson]] in 1971 at [[Bell Labs]] and was modeled after Schroeder's Multics shell.<ref name=\"Mazieres_2004\"/><ref name=\"ibm\"/> The [[Bourne shell]] was introduced in 1977 as a replacement for the V6 shell. Although it is used as an interactive command interpreter, it was also intended as a scripting language and contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce structured programs. The Bourne shell led to the development of the [[Korn shell]] (ksh), [[Almquist shell]] (ash), and the popular [[Bourne-again shell]] (or Bash).<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nEarly microcomputers themselves were based on a command-line interface such as [[CP/M]], [[DOS]] or [[AppleSoft BASIC]]. During the 1980s and 1990s, the introduction of the [[Apple Macintosh]] and of [[Microsoft Windows]] on PCs saw the command line interface as the primary user interface replaced by the [[Graphical User Interface]]. The command line remained available as an alternative user interface, often used by [[System Administrator|system administrators]] and other advanced users for system administration, [[computer programming]] and [[batch processing]].\n\nIn November 2006, [[Microsoft]] released version 1.0 of [[Windows PowerShell]] (formerly codenamed ''Monad''), which combined features of traditional Unix shells with their proprietary object-oriented [[.NET Framework]]. [[MinGW]] and [[Cygwin]] are [[open-source software|open-source]] packages for Windows that offer a Unix-like CLI. Microsoft provides [[MKS Inc.]]'s [[Korn shell|ksh]] implementation ''MKS Korn shell'' for Windows through their [[Windows Services for UNIX|Services for UNIX]] add-on.\n\nSince 2001, the [[Macintosh]] operating system [[macOS]] has been based on a [[Unix-like]] operating system called [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. On these computers, users can access a Unix-like command-line interface by running the [[terminal emulator]] program called [[Terminal (macOS)|Terminal]], which is found in the Utilities sub-folder of the Applications folder, or by remotely logging into the machine using [[ssh]]. [[Z shell]] is the default shell for macOS; [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[tcsh]], and the [[Korn shell]] are also provided. Before [[macOS Catalina]], bash was the default.\n\n==Usage==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nA CLI is used whenever a large vocabulary of commands or queries, coupled with a wide (or arbitrary) range of options, can be entered more rapidly as text than with a pure GUI. This is typically the case with [[operating system shell<!-- please, see [[talk:Shell (computing)]] before changing the link back -->|operating system command shell]]s. CLIs are also used by systems with insufficient resources to support a graphical user interface.  Some computer language systems (such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], [[LISP]], [[Rexx]], and many dialects of [[BASIC]]) provide an interactive command-line mode to allow for rapid evaluation of code.\n\nCLIs are often used by programmers and system administrators, in engineering and scientific environments, and by technically advanced personal computer users. CLIs are also popular among people with visual disabilities, since the commands and responses can be displayed using [[refreshable Braille display]]s.\n\n==Anatomy of a shell CLI==\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe general pattern of an OS command line interface<ref name=\"Bash\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_Windows\"/> is:\n\n [[#Command prompt|Prompt]] command param1 param2 param3 \u2026 paramN\n\n* [[#Command prompt|Prompt]] \u2014 generated by the program to provide context for the client.\n* Command&nbsp;\u2014 provided by the client.  Commands are usually one of three classes:\n*# Internal&nbsp;\u2014 recognized and processed by the command line interpreter itself and not dependent upon any external executable file.\n*# Included&nbsp;\u2014 A separate executable file generally considered part of the operating environment and always included with the OS.\n*# External&nbsp;\u2014 External executable files not part of the basic OS, but added by other parties for specific purposes and applications.\n* param1 \u2026paramN&nbsp;\u2014 Optional parameters provided by the client.  The format and meaning of the parameters depends upon the command issued. In the case of Included or External commands, the values of the parameters are delivered to the program (specified by the Command) as it is launched by the OS.  Parameters may be either [[Argument (computer science)#Parameters and arguments|Arguments]] or [[Command-line option|Options]].\n\nIn this example, the delimiters between command line elements are [[whitespace character]]s and the end-of-line delimiter is the [[newline]] delimiter. This is a widely used (but not universal) convention for command-line interfaces.\n\n<!-- Above is more 'anatomy' and below is a bit mote theory and background and higher level concepts. Maybe separate sections for both? -->\nA CLI can generally be considered as consisting of [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] and [[semantics]]. The ''syntax'' is the grammar that all commands must follow. In the case of [[operating system]]s, [[DOS]] and [[Unix]] each define their own set of rules that all commands must follow. In the case of [[embedded systems]], each vendor, such as [[Nortel]], [[Juniper Networks]] or [[Cisco Systems]], defines their own proprietary set of rules that all commands within their CLI conform to. These rules also dictate how a user navigates through the system of commands. The ''semantics'' define what sort of operations are possible, on what sort of data these operations can be performed, and how the grammar represents these operations and data\u2014the symbolic meaning in the syntax.\n\nTwo different CLIs may agree on either syntax or semantics, but it is only when they agree on both that they can be considered sufficiently similar to allow users to use both CLIs without needing to learn anything, as well as to enable re-use of scripts.\n\nA simple CLI will display a prompt, accept a \"command line\" typed by the user terminated by the [[Enter key]], then execute the specified command and provide textual display of results or error messages.  Advanced CLIs will validate, interpret and parameter-expand the command line before executing the specified command, and optionally capture or redirect its output.\n\nUnlike a button or menu item in a GUI, a command line is typically self-documenting, stating exactly what the user wants done.  In addition, command lines usually include many [[Default (computer science)|default]]s that can be changed to customize the results.  Useful command lines can be saved by assigning a [[character string]] or [[alias (command)|alias]] to represent the full command, or several commands can be grouped to perform a more complex sequence&nbsp;\u2013 for instance, compile the program, install it, and run it&nbsp;\u2014 creating a single entity, called a command procedure or script which itself can be treated as a command. These advantages mean that a user must figure out a complex command or series of commands only once, because they can be saved, to be used again.\n\nThe commands given to a CLI shell are often in one of the following forms:\n\n* {{kbd|doSomething how toFiles}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how sourceFile destinationFile}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how < inputFile > outputFile}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how {{!}} doSomething how {{!}} doSomething how > outputFile}}\n\nwhere ''doSomething'' is, in effect, a [[verb]], ''how'' an [[adverb]] (for example, should the command be executed \"verbosely\" or \"quietly\") and ''toFiles'' an object or objects (typically one or more files) on which the command should act. The <code>&gt;</code> in the third example is a [[redirection operator]], telling the command-line interpreter to send the output of the command not to its own standard output (the screen) but to the named file. This will overwrite the file. Using <code>&gt;&gt;</code> will redirect the output and append it to the file. Another redirection operator is the [[vertical bar]] (<code>|</code>), which creates a [[pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]] where the output of one command becomes the input to the next command.\n\n===CLI and resource protection===\nOne can modify the set of available commands by modifying which paths appear in the [[PATH (variable)|PATH]] environment variable. Under Unix, commands also need be marked as [[executable]] files. The directories in the path variable are searched in the order they are given. By re-ordering the path, one can run e.g. \\OS2\\MDOS\\E.EXE instead of \\OS2\\E.EXE, when the default is the opposite. Renaming of the executables also works: people often rename their favourite editor to EDIT, for example.\n\nThe command line allows one to restrict available commands, such as access to advanced internal commands.  The Windows [[CMD.EXE]] does this. Often, shareware programs will limit the range of commands, including printing a command 'your administrator has disabled running batch files' from the prompt.\n\nSome CLIs, such as those in [[network router]]s, have a hierarchy of [[mode (user interface)|mode]]s, with a different set of commands supported in each mode. The set of commands are grouped by association with security, system, interface, etc. In these systems the user might traverse through a series of sub-modes. For example, if the CLI had two modes called ''interface'' and ''system'', the user might use the command ''interface'' to enter the interface mode. At this point, commands from the system mode may not be accessible until the user exits the interface mode and enters the system mode.\n\n===Command prompt===\n[[File:Hard reset BBC Micro 32K Acorn DFS.gif|thumb|Prompt of a [[BBC Micro]] after switch-on or hard reset.]]\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Z shell]], [[Prompt]] and [[Abort, Retry, Fail]] -->\n{{Redirect|Command prompt|the Windows component named Command Prompt|cmd.exe}}\nA command prompt (or just ''prompt'') is a sequence of (one or more) characters used in a command-line interface to indicate readiness to accept commands.  It literally [[Wiktionary:prompt|prompt]]s the user to take action. A prompt usually ends with one of the characters <code>$</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>#</code>,<ref name=\"DR_1978_SID\"/><ref name=\"DR_1982_SID86\"/> <code>:</code>, <code>&gt;</code> or <code>-</code><!-- DOS DEBUG --><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> and often includes other information, such as the path of the current [[working directory]] and the [[hostname]].\n\nOn many [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like|derivative systems]], the prompt commonly ends in  <code>$</code> or <code>%</code> if the user is a normal user, but in <code>#</code> if the user is a [[superuser]] (\"root\" in Unix terminology).\n\nEnd-users can often modify prompts. Depending on the environment, they may include colors, special characters, and other elements (like variables and functions for the current time, user, shell number or working directory) in order, for instance, to make the prompt more informative or visually pleasing, to distinguish sessions on various machines, or to indicate the current level of nesting of commands. On some systems, special tokens in the definition of the prompt can be used to cause external programs to be called by the command-line interpreter while displaying the prompt.\n\nIn DOS's COMMAND.COM and in Windows NT's [[cmd.exe]] users can modify the prompt by issuing a <code>PROMPT</code> command or by directly changing the value of the corresponding <code>[[%PROMPT%]]</code> [[environment variable]]. The default of most modern systems, the <code>C:\\></code> style is obtained, for instance, with <code>PROMPT $P$G</code>. The default of older DOS systems, <code>C></code> is obtained by just <code>PROMPT</code>, although on some systems this produces the newer <code>C:\\></code> style, unless used on floppy drives A: or B:; on those systems <code>PROMPT $N$G</code> can be used to override the automatic default and explicitly switch to the older style.\n\nMany Unix systems feature the <code>$PS1</code> variable (Prompt String 1),<ref name=\"Parker_2011\"/> although other variables also may affect the prompt (depending on the [[Unix shell|shell]] used). In the [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] shell, a prompt of the form:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">[time] user@host: work_dir $</source>\ncould be set by issuing the command\n<source lang=\"bash\">export PS1='[\\t] \\u@\\H: \\W $'</source>\n\nIn [[zsh]] the <code>$RPROMPT</code> variable controls an optional \"prompt\" on the right-hand side of the display. It is not a real prompt in that the location of text entry does not change. It is used to display information on the same line as the prompt, but right-justified.\n\nIn [[RISC OS]] the command prompt is a <code>*</code> symbol, and thus (OS)CLI commands are often referred to as \"star commands\".<ref name=\"Acorn_1992\"/> One can also access the same commands from other command lines (such as the [[BBC BASIC]] command line), by preceding the command with a <code>*</code>.\n\n==={{anchor|Arguments_section}}Arguments===\n[[File:COMMAND LINE.svg|thumb|right|An MS-DOS command line, illustrating parsing into command and arguments]]\nA '''command-line argument''' or '''[[Parameter#Computing|parameter]]''' is an item of information provided to a program when it is started.  A program can have many command-line arguments that identify sources or destinations of information, or that alter the operation of the program.\n\nWhen a command processor is active a program is typically invoked by typing its name followed by command-line arguments (if any). For example, in [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] environments, an example of a command-line argument is:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">\nrm file.s\n</source>\n\n\"file.s\" is a command-line argument which tells the program [[rm (Unix)|rm]] to remove the file \"file.s\".\n\nSome programming languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], allow a program to interpret the command-line arguments by handling them as string parameters in the [[Main function (programming)|main function]]. Other languages, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], expose operating system specific [[Application programming interface|API]] (functionality) through <code>sys</code> [[Modular programming|module]], and in particular <code>sys.argv</code> for \"command-line arguments\".\n\nIn [[Unix-like operating system]]s, a single hyphen used in place of a file name is a special value specifying that a program should handle data coming from the [[standard input]] or send data to the [[standard output]].\n\n===={{anchor|SwitChar}}Command-line option====\n<!-- This section is linked from several places inside or outside this article, preferable by \"#SwitChar\". Do not remove or rename this section heading without also updating the links. -->\nA '''command-line option''' or simply '''option''' (also known as a '''flag''' or '''switch''') modifies the operation of a command; the effect is determined by the command's program. Options follow the command name on the command line, separated by spaces. A space before the first option is not always required, such as <code>Dir/?</code> and <code style=\"white-space:nowrap\">DIR /?</code> in DOS, which have the same effect<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> of listing the DIR command's available options, whereas <code>dir --help</code> (in many versions of Unix) ''does'' require the option to be preceded by at least one space (and is case-sensitive).\n\nThe format of options varies widely between operating systems. In most cases the syntax is by convention rather than an operating system requirement; the entire command line is simply a string passed to a program, which can process it in any way the programmer wants, so long as the interpreter can tell where the command name ends and its arguments and options begin.\n\nA few representative samples of command-line options, all relating to listing files in a directory, to illustrate some conventions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Operating system !! Command !! Valid alternative !! Notes\n|-\n| [[OpenVMS]] || <code>directory/owner</code> || <code>Dir /Owner</code> || instruct the ''directory'' command to also display the ownership of the files.<br><small>''Note the Directory command name is not case sensitive, and can be abbreviated to as few letters as required to remain unique.''</small>\n|-\n| Windows || <code>DIR/Q/O:S d*</code> || <code>dir /q d* /o:s</code> || display ownership of files whose names begin with \"D\", sorted by size, smallest first.<br><small>''Note spaces around argument d* are required.''</small>\n|-\n| [[Unix-like]] systems || <code>ls -lS D*</code> || <code>ls -S -l D*</code> || display in long format files and directories beginning with \"D\" (but not \"d\"), sorted by size (largest first).<br><small>''Note spaces are required around all arguments and options, but some can be run together, e.g. '''-lS''' is the same as '''-l -S'''.''</small>\n|-\n| [[Data General RDOS]] [[Data General RDOS#RDOS CLI|CLI]]|| <code>list/e/s 04-26-80/b</code> || <code>List /S/E 4-26-80/B</code> || list every attribute for files created before 26 April 1980.<br><small>''Note the /B at the end of the date argument is a '''local switch''', that modifies the meaning of that argument, while /S and /E are '''global switches''', i.e. apply to the whole command.''</small>\n|}\n\n=====Abbreviating commands=====\n{{See also|Tab completion}}\nIn [[Multics]], command-line options and subsystem keywords may be abbreviated. This idea appears to derive from the [[PL/I programming language]], with its shortened keywords (e.g., STRG for STRINGRANGE and DCL for DECLARE). For example, in the Multics \"forum\" subsystem, the ''-long_subject'' parameter can be abbreviated ''-lgsj''. It is also common for Multics commands to be abbreviated, typically corresponding to the initial letters of the words that are strung together with underscores to form command names, such as the use of ''did'' for ''delete_iacl_dir''.\n\nIn some other systems abbreviations are automatic, such as permitting enough of the first characters of a command name to uniquely identify it (such as <code>SU</code> as an abbreviation for <code>SUPERUSER</code>) while others may have some specific abbreviations pre-programmed (e.g. <code>MD</code> for <code>[[MKDIR]]</code> in COMMAND.COM) or user-defined via batch scripts and aliases (e.g. <code>alias md mkdir</code> in [[tcsh]]).\n\n=====Option conventions in DOS, Windows, OS/2=====\nOn DOS, OS/2 and Windows, different programs called from their COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE (or internal their commands) may use different syntax within the same operating system. For example:\n\n* Options may be indicated by either of the \"switch characters\": <code>/</code>, <code>-</code>, or either may be allowed. See below.\n* They may or may not be [[case-sensitive]].\n* Sometimes options and their arguments are run together, sometimes separated by whitespace, and sometimes by a character, typically <code>:</code> or <code>=</code>; thus <code>Prog -fFilename</code>, <code>Prog -f Filename</code>, <code>Prog -f:Filename</code>, <code>Prog -f=Filename</code>.\n* Some programs allow single-character options to be combined;<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> others do not. The switch <code>-fA</code> may mean the same as <code>-f -A</code>,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> or it may be incorrect, or it may even be a valid but different parameter.\n\nIn [[DOS]], [[OS/2]] and [[Windows]], the forward slash (<code>/</code>) is most prevalent, although the hyphen-minus is also sometimes used. In many versions of DOS (MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 2.xx and higher, all versions of [[DR-DOS]] since 5.0, as well as [[PTS-DOS]], [[Embedded DOS]], [[FreeDOS]] and [[RxDOS]]) the '''switch character''' (sometimes abbreviated '''switchar''' or '''switchchar''') to be used is defined by a value returned from a [[system call]] ([[INT&nbsp;21h]]/AH=37h). The default character returned by this API is <code>/</code>, but can be changed to a hyphen-minus on the above-mentioned systems, except for under Datalight ROM-DOS and MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 5.0 and higher, which always return <code>/</code> from this call (unless one of many available [[Terminate & Stay Resident|TSR]]s to reenable the SwitChar feature is loaded). In some of these systems (MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 2.xx, DOS Plus 2.1, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, PTS-DOS, Embedded DOS, FreeDOS and RxDOS), the setting can also be pre-configured by a [[SWITCHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SWITCHAR]] directive in [[CONFIG.SYS]]. General Software's Embedded DOS provides a SWITCH command for the same purpose, whereas [[4DOS]] allows the setting to be changed via <code>SETDOS /W:n</code>.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> Under DR-DOS, if the setting has been changed from <code>/</code>, the first directory separator <code>\\</code> in the display of the [[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]] parameter <code>$G</code> will change to a forward slash <code>/</code> (which is also a valid directory separator in DOS, FlexOS, 4680 OS, 4690 OS, OS/2 and Windows) thereby serving as a visual clue to indicate the change.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> Also, the current setting is reflected also in the built-in help screens.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> Some versions of DR-DOS [[COMMAND.COM]]<!-- 7.07 --> also support a PROMPT token <code>$/</code> to display the current setting. COMMAND.COM since DR-DOS 7.02 also provides a [[pseudo-environment variable]] named <code>[[%/%]]</code> to allow portable batchjobs to be written.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_DELTREE101\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/> Several external DR-DOS commands<!-- f.e. SYS in DR-DOS 7.07 --> additionally support an [[environment variable]] <code>[[%SWITCHAR%]]</code> to override the system setting.\n\nHowever, many programs are hardwired to use <code>/</code> only, rather than retrieving the switch setting before parsing command-line arguments. A very small number, mainly ports from Unix-like systems, are programmed to accept \"-\" even if the switch character is not set to it (for example <code>[[netstat]]</code> and <code>[[ping (networking utility)|ping]]</code>, supplied with [[Microsoft Windows]], will accept the /? option to list available options, and yet the list will specify the \"-\" convention).\n\n=====Option conventions in Unix-like systems=====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nIn [[Unix-like]] systems, the ASCII [[hyphen-minus]] begins options; the new (and [[GNU]]) convention is to use ''two'' hyphens then a word (e.g. <code>--create</code>) to identify the option's use while the old convention (and still available as an option for frequently-used options) is to use one hyphen then one letter (e.g., <code>-c</code>); if one hyphen is followed by two or more letters it may mean two options are being specified, or it may mean the second and subsequent letters are a parameter (such as filename or date) for the first option.\n\nTwo hyphen-minus characters without following letters (<code>--</code>) may indicate that the remaining arguments should not be treated as options, which is useful for example if a file name itself begins with a hyphen, or if further arguments are meant for an inner command (e.g., [[sudo]]). Double hyphen-minuses are also sometimes used to prefix \"long options\" where more descriptive option names are used. This is a common feature of [[GNU]] software. The ''[[getopt]]'' function and program, and the ''[[getopts]]'' command are usually used for parsing command-line options.\n\nUnix command names, arguments and options are case-sensitive (except in a few examples, mainly where popular commands from other operating systems have been ported to Unix).\n\n=====Option conventions in other systems=====\n[[FlexOS]], [[IBM 4680 OS|4680 OS]] and [[IBM 4690 OS|4690 OS]] use <code>-</code>.\n\n[[CP/M]] typically used <code><nowiki>[</nowiki></code>.\n\n[[Conversational Monitor System]] (CMS) uses a single [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|left parenthesis]] to separate options at the end of the command from the other arguments.  For example, in the following command the options indicate that the target file should be replaced if it exists, and the date and time of the source file should be retained on the copy:\n<code>COPY source file a target file b (REPLACE OLDDATE</code>\n\n[[Data General]]'s CLI under their [[Data General RDOS|RDOS]], [[Data General AOS|AOS]], etc. operating systems, as well as the version of CLI that came with their [[Business Basic]], uses only <code>/</code> as the switch character, is case-insensitive, and allows \"local switches\" on some arguments to control the way they are interpreted, such as <code>MAC/U LIB/S A B C $LPT/L</code> has the global option \"U\" to the macro assembler command to append user symbols, but two local switches, one to specify LIB should be skipped on pass 2 and the other to direct listing to the printer, $LPT.\n\n===Built-in usage help===\n{{see also|help (command)}}\nOne of the criticisms of a CLI is the lack of cues to the user as to the available actions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  In contrast, GUIs usually inform the user of available actions with menus, icons, or other visual cues.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} To overcome this limitation, many CLI programs display a brief summary of its valid parameters, typically when invoked with no arguments or one of <code>?</code>, <code>-?</code>, <code>-h</code>, <code>-H</code>, <code>/?</code>, <code>/h</code>, <code>/H</code>, <code>/Help</code>, <code>-help</code>, or <code>--help</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_DEBUG\"/>  \n\nHowever, entering a program name without parameters in the hope that it will display usage help can be hazardous, as programs and scripts for which command line arguments are optional will execute without further notice.\n\nAlthough desirable at least for the help parameter, programs may not support all option lead-in characters exemplified above.\nUnder DOS, where the default [[Command-line_interface#Option_conventions_in_DOS.2C_Windows.2C_OS.2F2|command-line option character]] can be changed from <code>/</code> to <code>-</code>, programs may query the [[SwitChar]] API in order to determine the current setting. So, if a program is not hardwired to support them all, a user may need to know the current setting even to be able to reliably request help.\nIf the SwitChar has been changed to <code>-</code> and therefore the <code>/</code> character is accepted as alternative path delimiter also at the DOS command line, programs may misinterpret options like <code>/h</code> or <code>/H</code> as paths rather than help parameters.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> However, if given as first or only parameter, most DOS programs will, by convention<!-- at least in all versions of DR-DOS as well as under 4DOS and NDOS -->, accept it as request for help regardless of the current SwitChar setting.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/>\n\nIn some cases, different levels of help can be selected for a program. Some programs supporting this allow to give a verbosity level as an optional argument to the help parameter (as in <code>/H:1</code>, <code>/H:2</code>, etc.) or they give just a short help on help parameters with question mark and a longer help screen for the other help options.<ref name=\"Paul_2006_FreeKEYB\"/>\n\nDepending on the program, additional or more specific help on accepted parameters is sometimes available by either providing the parameter in question as an argument to the help parameter or vice versa (as in <code>/H:W</code> or in <code>/W:?</code> (assuming <code>/W</code> would be another parameter supported by the program)).<ref name=\"CCI_1997_HELP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_DRDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_DEBUG\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2006_FreeKEYB\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\"/>\n\nIn a similar fashion to the help parameter, but much less common, some programs provide additional information about themselves (like mode, status, version, author, license or contact information) when invoked with an \"about\" parameter like <code>-!</code>, <code>/!</code>, <code>-about</code>, or <code>--about</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/>\n\nSince the <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> characters typically also serve other purposes at the command line, they may not be available in all scenarios, therefore, they should not be the only options to access the corresponding help information.\n\n[[File:RT-11 help.jpg|thumb|The end of the <tt>HELP</tt> command output from [[:en:RT-11|RT-11SJ]] displayed on a [[:en:VT100|VT100]].]]\nIf more detailed help is necessary than provided by a program's built-in internal help, many systems support a dedicated external \"<code>[[help (command)|help]] ''command''</code>\" command (or similar), which accepts a command name as calling parameter and will invoke an external help system.\n\nIn the DR-DOS family, typing <code>/?</code> or <code>/H</code> at the [[COMMAND.COM]] prompt instead of a command itself will display a dynamically generated list of available internal commands;<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> [[4DOS]] and [[NDOS]] support the same feature by typing <code>?</code> at the prompt<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> (which is also accepted by newer versions<!-- only 7.02 and higher --> of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM); internal commands can be individually disabled or reenabled via <code>SETDOS /I</code>.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> In addition to this, some newer versions of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM<!-- 7.07 --> also accept a <code>?%</code> command to display a list of available built-in [[DR-DOS system information variable|pseudo-environment variable]]s. Besides their purpose as quick help reference this can be used in batchjobs to query the facilities of the underlying command-line processor.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\n===Command description syntax===\nBuilt-in usage help and [[man page]]s commonly employ a small syntax to describe the valid command form:<ref name=\"OpenGroup_2008\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2005_Shell\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2010_Syntax\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB2\"/>\n\n* angle brackets for ''required'' parameters: <code>ping <hostname></code>\n* square brackets for ''optional'' parameters: <code>mkdir [-p] <dirname></code>\n* ellipses for ''repeated'' items: <code>cp <source1> [source2\u2026] <dest></code>\n* vertical bars for ''choice'' of items: <code>netstat {-t|-u}</code>\n\nNotice that these characters have different meanings than when used directly in the shell. Angle brackets may be omitted when confusing the parameter name with a literal string is not likely.\n\n===The space character===\n<!-- this is a file-system feature, nothing to do with the command line -->\nIn many areas of computing, but particularly in the command line, the [[space character]] can cause problems as it has two distinct and incompatible functions: as part of a command or parameter, or as a parameter or name [[Delimiter|separator]]. Ambiguity can be prevented either by prohibiting embedded spaces in file and directory names in the first place (for example, by substituting them with [[underscores]] <code>_</code>), or by enclosing a name with embedded spaces between quote characters or using an [[escape character]] before the space, usually a [[backslash]] (<code>\\</code>).  For example\n:<code>Long path/Long program name Parameter one Parameter two</code> \u2026\nis ambiguous (is \"program name\" part of the program name, or two parameters?); however\n:<code>Long_path/Long_program_name Parameter_one Parameter_two</code> \u2026,\n:<code>LongPath/LongProgramName ParameterOne ParameterTwo</code> \u2026,\n:<code>\"Long path/Long program name\" \"Parameter one\" \"Parameter two\"</code> \u2026\nand\n:<code>Long\\ path/Long\\ program\\ name Parameter\\ one Parameter\\ two</code> \u2026\nare not ambiguous. [[Unix]]-based operating systems minimize the use of embedded spaces to minimize the need for quotes. In [[Microsoft Windows]], one often has to use quotes because embedded spaces (such as in directory names) are common.\n\n==Command-line interpreter==\n{{see also|List of command-line interpreters}}\n{{quotation|Although most users think of the shell as an interactive command interpreter, it is really a programming language in which each statement runs a command. Because it must satisfy both the interactive and programming aspects of command execution, it is a strange language, shaped as much by history as by design.|[[Brian W. Kernighan]] & [[Rob Pike]]<ref name=\"Kerninghan_1984\"/>}}\n\nThe term '''command-line interpreter''' ('''CLI''') is applied to [[computer program]]s designed to [[interpreter (computing)|interpret]] a sequence of lines of text which may be entered by a user, read from a [[computer file|file]] or another kind of [[data stream]]. The context of interpretation is usually one of a given [[operating system]] or [[programming language]].\n\nCommand-line interpreters allow users to issue various commands in a very efficient (and often terse) way. This requires the user to know the names of the commands and their parameters, and the syntax of the [[programming language|language]] that is interpreted.\n\nThe Unix [[Shebang (Unix)|<code>#!</code>]] mechanism and OS/2 EXTPROC command facilitate the passing of batch files to external processors.  One can use these mechanisms to write specific command processors for dedicated uses, and process external data files which reside in batch files.\n\nMany graphical interfaces, such as the OS/2 [[Presentation Manager]] and early versions of Microsoft Windows use command-lines to call helper programs to open documents and programs.  The commands are stored in the graphical shell{{clarify|date=May 2012}} or in files like the registry or the [[OS/2]] <code>OS2USER.INI</code> file.\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:TTY33ASR.jpg|thumb|A [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR teleprinter keyboard with punched tape reader and punch.]]\n[[File:Terminal-dec-vt52.jpg|thumb|[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VT52]] terminal.]]\nThe earliest computers did not support interactive input/output devices, often relying on [[sense switch]]es and lights to communicate with the [[computer operator]]. This was adequate for [[Batch processing|batch]] systems that ran one program at a time, often with the programmer acting as operator. This also had the advantage of low overhead, since lights and switches could be tested and set with one machine instruction. Later a single [[system console]] was added to allow the operator to communicate with the system.\n\nFrom the 1960s onwards, user interaction with computers was primarily by means of command-line interfaces, initially on machines like the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, but then on early [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-based [[computer terminals]] such as the [[VT52]].\n\nAll of these devices were purely text based, with no ability to display graphic or pictures.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB3\"/> For business [[Application software|application programs]], text-based [[menu (computing)|menus]] were used, but for more general interaction the command line was the interface.\n\nAround 1964 [[Louis Pouzin]] introduced the concept and the name ''shell'' in [[Multics]], building on earlier, simpler facilities in the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] (CTSS).<ref name=\"Pouzin\"/>{{better source|introduced the concept (sic)|date=September 2013}}\n\nFrom the early 1970s the [[Unix]] operating system adapted the concept of a powerful command-line environment, and introduced the ability to ''[[Pipeline (Unix)|pipe]]'' the output of one command in as input to another. Unix also had the capability to save and re-run strings of commands as \"[[shell scripts]]\" which acted like custom commands.\n\nThe command-line was also the main interface for the early home computers such as the [[Commodore PET]], [[Apple II]] and [[BBC Micro]]&nbsp;\u2013 almost always in the form of a [[BASIC]] interpreter. When more powerful business oriented microcomputers arrived with [[CP/M]] and later [[DOS]] computers such as the [[IBM PC]], the command-line began to borrow some of the syntax and features of the Unix shells such as [[globbing]] and [[Pipeline (Unix)|piping]] of output.\n\nThe command-line was first seriously challenged by the [[PARC (company)|PARC]] [[GUI]] approach used in the 1983 [[Apple Lisa]] and the 1984 [[Apple Macintosh]]. A few computer users used GUIs such as [[GEOS (16-bit operating system)|GEOS]] and [[Windows 3.1]] but the majority of [[IBM PC]] users did not replace their [[COMMAND.COM]] shell with a GUI until [[Windows 95]] was released in 1995.<ref name=\"Betanews\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_History\"/>\n\n===Modern usage as an operating system shell===\nWhile most non-expert computer users now use a GUI almost exclusively, more advanced users have access to powerful command-line environments:\n\n* The default VAX/VMS command shell, using the [[DIGITAL Command Language|DCL]] language, has been ported to Windows systems at least three times, including [[PC-DCL]] and Acceler8 DCL Lite. Unix command shells have been ported to VMS and DOS/Windows 95 and Windows NT types of operating systems. COMMAND.COM and Windows NT cmd.exe have been ported to Windows CE and presumably works on Microsoft Windows NT Embedded 4.0\n* Windows [[Resource Kit]] and Windows [[Services for Unix]] include Korn and the Bourne shells along with a Perl interpreter (Services of Unix contains Active State [[ActivePerl]] in later versions and [[Interix]] for versions 1 and 2 and a shell compiled by Microsoft)\n* IBM OS/2 has the [[cmd.exe]] processor. This copies the [[COMMAND.COM]] commands, with extensions to [[REXX]].\n* cmd.exe and COMMAND.COM are part of the Windows NT stream of operating systems.\n* Yet another cmd.exe is a stripped-down shell for [[Windows CE]] 3.0.\n* An MS-DOS type interpreter called [[PocketDOS]] has been ported to Windows CE machines; the most recent release is almost identical to MS-DOS 6.22 and can also run Windows 1, 2, and 3.0, [[QBasic]] and other development tools, 4NT and 4DOS. The latest release includes several shells, namely MS-DOS 6.22, PC&nbsp;DOS 7, DR&nbsp;DOS 3.xx, and others.\n* [[PocketConsole]] is a Windows NT 4.0 shell for Windows CE that is much like 4NT.\n* Windows users have a CLI environment named [[Windows Command Prompt]], which might use the [[CScript]] interface to alternate programs. [[PowerShell]] provides a command-line interface, but its applets are not written in [[Shell script]]. Implementations of the [[Unix shell]] are also available as part of the [[Microsoft POSIX subsystem|POSIX sub-system]],<ref name=\"Microsoft_POSIX\"/> [[Cygwin]], [[MKS Toolkit]], [[UWIN]], [[Hamilton C shell]] and other software packages. Available shells for these interoperability tools include [[C shell|csh]], [[Korn shell|ksh]], [[Bourne shell|sh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[Restricted shell|rsh]], [[tclsh]] and less commonly [[zsh]], psh\n* COMMAND.COM (4DOS), Windows NT cmd.exe (4NT, TCC), and OS/2 cmd.exe (4OS2) and others based on them are enhanced shells which can be a replacement for the native shell or a means of enhancement of the default shell.\n* Implementations of [[PHP]] have a shell for interactive use called php-cli.\n* Standard [[Tcl/Tk]] has two interactive shells, Tclsh and Wish, the latter being the GUI version.\n* [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]],<!-- [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], --> [[XLNT]], and other interpreters also have command shells for interactive use.\n* [[FreeBSD]] uses [[tcsh]] as its default interactive shell for the [[superuser]].\n* Apple [[macOS]]<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB4\"/> and many [[Linux distribution]]s have the [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] implementation of the [[Unix shell]]. Early versions of macOS used [[tcsh]] as the default shell.\n* [[Embedded Linux]] (and other embedded [[Unix-like]]) devices often use the [[Almquist shell|Ash]] implementation of the Unix shell, as part of [[Busybox]].\n* [[Android (operating system)|Android]] uses the [[Korn shell|mksh]] shell,<ref name=\"Android_mksh\"/><ref name=\"Android_adb\"/> which replaces a shell derived from [[Almquist shell|ash]]<ref name=\"Android_sh\"/> that was used in older Android versions<!-- Not clear if switch was in Gengerbread, or before-->, supplemented with commands from the separate ''toolbox''<ref name=\"Android_Toolbox\"/> binary.\n* Routers with [[Cisco IOS]],<ref name=\"Cisco_IOS\"/> [[Junos]]<ref name=\"Juniper\"/> and many others are commonly configured from the command line.\n\n==Scripting==\nMost command-line interpreters support [[script (computer programming)|scripting]], to various extents. (They are, after all, interpreters of an [[interpreted programming language]], albeit in many cases the language is unique to the particular command-line interpreter.) They will interpret scripts (variously termed [[shell script]]s or [[batch file]]s) written in the [[programming language|language]] that they interpret. Some command-line interpreters also incorporate the interpreter engines of other languages, such as [[REXX]], in addition to their own, allowing the executing of scripts, in those languages, directly within the command-line interpreter itself.\n\nConversely, [[scripting programming language]]s, in particular those with an [[eval]] [[function (programming)|function]] (such as REXX, [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] or [[Jython]]), can be used to implement command-line interpreters and filters. For a few [[operating system]]s, most notably [[DOS]], such a command interpreter provides a more flexible command-line interface than the one supplied. In other cases, such a command interpreter can present a highly customised user interface employing the user interface and input/output facilities of the language.\n\n==Other command-line interfaces==\nThe command line provides an interface between programs as well as the user. In this sense, a command line is an alternative to a [[dialog box]]. Editors and databases present a command line, in which alternate command processors might run. On the other hand, one might have options on the command line, which opens a dialog box. The latest version of 'Take Command' has this feature. DBase used a dialog box to construct command lines, which could be further edited before use.\n\nPrograms like BASIC, Diskpart, EDLIN, and QBASIC all provide command-line interfaces, some of which use the system shell. Basic is modeled on the default interface for 8-bit Intel computers. Calculators can be run as command-line or dialog interfaces.\n\n[[Emacs]] provides a command-line interface in the form of its minibuffer. Commands and arguments can be entered using Emacs standard text editing support, and output is displayed in another buffer.\n\nThere are a number of text mode games, like ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' or ''[[King's Quest#Series|King's Quest 1-3]]'', which relied on the user typing commands at the bottom of the screen. One controls the character by typing commands like 'get ring' or 'look'. The program returns a text which describes how the character sees it, or makes the action happen. The [[text adventure]] ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', a piece of [[interactive fiction]] based on [[Douglas Adams|Douglas Adam's]] book of the same name, is a teletype-style command-line game.\n\nThe most notable of these interfaces is the [[standard streams]] interface, which allows the output of one command to be passed to the input of another. Text files can serve either purpose as well. This provides the interfaces of piping, filters and redirection. Under Unix, [[Everything is a file|devices are files]] too, so the normal type of file for the shell used for stdin,stdout and stderr is a [[Teleprinter#Teleprinters in computing|tty]] device file.\n\nAnother command-line interface allows a shell program to launch helper programs, either to launch documents or start a program. The command is processed internally by the shell, and then passed on to another program to launch the document. The graphical interface of Windows and OS/2 rely heavily on command-lines passed through to other programs&nbsp;\u2013 console or graphical, which then usually process the command line without presenting a user-console.\n\nPrograms like the OS/2 E editor and some other IBM [[text editor|editors]], can process command-lines normally meant for the shell, the output being placed directly in the document window.\n\nA web browser's URL input field can be used as a command line. It can be used to \"launch\" [[web app]]s, [[about:config|access browser configuration]], as well as perform a search. [[Google]], which has been called \"the command line of the internet\" will perform a domain-specific search when it detects search parameters in a known format.<ref name=\"Google\"/> This functionality is present whether the search is triggered from a browser field or on Google's website.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[List of command-line interpreters]]\n* [[Batch processing]]\n* [[Batch file]]\n* [[Console application]]\n* [[Interpreter directive]]\n* [[Read-eval-print loop]]\n* [[Shell (computing)]]\n* [[Scripting language]]\n* [[Shell script]]\n* [[clig]]\n* [[Computer terminal]]\n* [[Terminal emulator]]\n* [[Run command]]\n* {{Section link|Graphical user interface|Comparison to other interfaces}}\n* [[In the Beginning\u2026 Was the Command Line]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\">An example is the comprehensive internal help system of the [[DR-DOS 7.03]] [[DEBUG (DOS command)|DEBUG]] command, which can be invoked via <code>??</code> at the debug prompt (rather than only the default <code>?</code> overview).

The program which handles the interface is called a '''command-line interpreter''' or '''command-line processor'''. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a [[shell (computing)|shell]] for interactive access to operating system functions or services. Such access was primarily provided to users by [[computer terminal]]s starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on [[OpenVMS|VAX/VMS]], [[Unix]] systems and personal computer systems including [[DOS]], [[CP/M]] and [[Apple DOS]].\n\nToday, users rely upon [[graphical user interface]]s and menu-driven interactions. However some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line. \n\nAlternatives to the command line interface include [[text user interface]] [[menu (computing)|menus]] (for example, [[IBM AIX SMIT]]), [[keyboard shortcut]]s, and various [[desktop metaphor]]s centered on the [[pointer (graphical user interfaces)|pointer]] (usually controlled with a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]). Examples of this include the Microsoft Windows, [[DOSSHELL|DosShell]], and Mouse Systems PowerPanel. Command line interfaces are often implemented in terminal devices that are also capable of screen-oriented text user interfaces that use cursor addressing to place symbols on a display screen.\n\nPrograms with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via [[scripting language|scripting]].\n\nMany software systems implement command line interfaces for control and operation. This includes programming environments and utility programs.\n\n==Comparison to graphical user interfaces==\n[[File:Gem_11_Desktop.png|thumb|250px|A graphical user interface with icons and windows ([[GEM (desktop environment)|GEM 1.1 Desktop]])]]\nCompared with a graphical user interface, a command line interface requires fewer system resources to implement. Since options to commands are given in a few characters in each command line, an experienced user may often find the options easier to access. Automation of repetitive tasks is simplified by line editing and history mechanisms for storing frequently used sequences; this may extend to a [[scripting language]] that can take parameters and variable options. A command-line history can be kept, allowing review or repetition of commands. \n \nA command-line system may require paper or online manuals for the user's reference, although often a \"help\" option provides a concise review of the options of a command. The command-line environment may not provide the graphical enhancements such as different [[Computer font|fonts]] or extended [[window (computing)|edit windows]] found in a GUI. It may be difficult for a new user to become familiar with all the commands and options available, compared with the [[icon (computing)|icons]] and [[drop-down menu]]s of a graphical user interface, without repeated reference to manuals.\n\n==Types==\n===Operating system command-line interfaces===\n[[File:Apple Unix with Netscape.png|thumb|250px|[[Apple Computer]]'s CommandShell in [[A/UX]] 3.0.1.]]\nOperating system (OS) command-line interfaces are usually distinct programs supplied with the operating system. A program that implements such a text interface is often called a command-line interpreter, command processor or [[shell (computing)|shell]]. \n\nExamples of command-line interpreters include [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC's]] [[DIGITAL Command Language]] (DCL) in [[OpenVMS]] and [[RSX-11]], the various [[Unix shell]]s ([[Bourne shell|sh]], [[KornShell|ksh]], [[C shell|csh]], [[tcsh]], [[Z shell|zsh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], etc.), [[CP/M]]'s [[Console Command Processor|CCP]], [[DOS]]'s [[COMMAND.COM]], as well as the [[OS/2]] and the Windows [[CMD.EXE]] programs, the latter groups being based heavily on DEC's RSX-11 and [[RSTS/E|RSTS]] CLIs. Under most operating systems, it is possible to replace the default shell program with alternatives; examples include [[4DOS]] for DOS, [[4OS2]] for OS/2, and [[Take Command Console|4NT / Take Command]] for Windows.\n\nAlthough the term 'shell' is often used to describe a command-line interpreter, strictly speaking a 'shell' can be any program that constitutes the user-interface, including fully graphically oriented ones. For example, the default Windows GUI is a shell program named [[EXPLORER.EXE]], as defined in the SHELL=EXPLORER.EXE line in the WIN.INI configuration file. These programs are shells, but not CLIs.\n\n===Application command-line interfaces===\n[[File:GNUOctave430.png|thumb|250px|[[GNU Octave]]'s GUI with command-line interface]]\nApplication programs (as opposed to operating systems) may also have command line interfaces.\n\nAn application program may support none, any, or all of these three major types of command line interface mechanisms:\n\n* ''Parameters'': Most operating systems support a means to pass additional information to a program when it is launched. When a program is launched from an OS command line shell, additional text provided along with the program name is passed to the launched program.\n* ''Interactive command line sessions'': After launch, a program may provide an operator with an independent means to enter commands in the form of text.\n* ''Inter-process communication'': Most operating systems support means of [[inter-process communication]] (for example, [[standard streams]] or [[named pipe]]s). Command lines from client processes may be redirected to a CLI program by one of these methods.\n\nSome applications support only a CLI, presenting a CLI prompt to the user and acting upon command lines as they are entered. Other programs support both a CLI and a GUI. In some cases, a GUI is simply a [[Wrapper function|wrapper]] around a separate CLI [[executable file]]. In other cases, a program may provide a CLI as an optional alternative to its GUI. CLIs and GUIs often support different functionality. For example, all features of [[MATLAB]], a [[numerical analysis]] computer program, are available via the CLI, whereas the MATLAB GUI exposes only a subset of features.\n\nThe early Sierra games, such as the first three ''[[King's Quest]]'' games (1984\u20131986), used commands from an internal command line to move the character around in the graphic window.\n\n==History==\nThe command-line interface evolved from a form of dialog once conducted by humans over [[teleprinter]] (TTY) machines, in which human operators remotely exchanged information, usually one line of text at a time. Early computer systems often used teleprinter machines as the means of interaction with a human operator. The computer became one end of the human-to-human teleprinter model. So instead of a human communicating with another human over a teleprinter, a human communicated with a computer.\n\nThe mechanical teleprinter was replaced by a [[dumb terminal#Early VDUs|\"glass tty\"]], a keyboard and screen emulating the teleprinter. [[computer terminal#.22Intelligent.22 terminals|\"Smart\" terminal]]s permitted additional functions, such as cursor movement over the entire screen, or local editing of data on the terminal for transmission to the computer. As the [[microcomputer revolution]] replaced the traditional{{snd}}minicomputer + terminals{{snd}}[[time sharing]] architecture, hardware terminals were replaced by [[terminal emulator]]s&nbsp;\u2014 PC software that interpreted terminal signals sent through the PC's [[serial port]]s. These were typically used to interface an organization's new PC's with their existing mini- or mainframe computers, or to connect PC to PC. Some of these PCs were running [[Bulletin Board System]] software.\n\nEarly operating system CLIs were implemented as part of [[resident monitor]] programs, and could not easily be replaced. The first implementation of the shell as a replaceable component was part of the [[Multics]] [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]].<ref name=\"Unix_Shells\"/> In 1964, [[MIT Computation Center]] staff member [[Louis Pouzin]] developed the [[RUNCOM]] tool for executing command scripts while allowing argument substitution.<ref name=\"multicians\"/> Pouzin coined the term \"[[shell (computing)|shell]]\" to describe the technique of using commands like a programming language, and wrote a paper about how to implement the idea in the [[Multics]] operating system.<ref name=\"Metz_2013\"/> Pouzin returned to his native France in 1965, and the first Multics shell was developed by [[Glenda Schroeder]].<ref name=\"multicians\"/>\n\n[[File:Version 7 UNIX SIMH PDP11 Kernels Shell.png|thumb|250px|[[Bourne shell]] interaction on [[Version 7 Unix]]]]\nThe first [[Unix shell]], the [[Thompson shell|V6 shell]], was developed by [[Ken Thompson]] in 1971 at [[Bell Labs]] and was modeled after Schroeder's Multics shell.<ref name=\"Mazieres_2004\"/><ref name=\"ibm\"/> The [[Bourne shell]] was introduced in 1977 as a replacement for the V6 shell. Although it is used as an interactive command interpreter, it was also intended as a scripting language and contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce structured programs. The Bourne shell led to the development of the [[Korn shell]] (ksh), [[Almquist shell]] (ash), and the popular [[Bourne-again shell]] (or Bash).<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nEarly microcomputers themselves were based on a command-line interface such as [[CP/M]], [[DOS]] or [[AppleSoft BASIC]]. During the 1980s and 1990s, the introduction of the [[Apple Macintosh]] and of [[Microsoft Windows]] on PCs saw the command line interface as the primary user interface replaced by the [[Graphical User Interface]]. The command line remained available as an alternative user interface, often used by [[System Administrator|system administrators]] and other advanced users for system administration, [[computer programming]] and [[batch processing]].\n\nIn November 2006, [[Microsoft]] released version 1.0 of [[Windows PowerShell]] (formerly codenamed ''Monad''), which combined features of traditional Unix shells with their proprietary object-oriented [[.NET Framework]]. [[MinGW]] and [[Cygwin]] are [[open-source software|open-source]] packages for Windows that offer a Unix-like CLI. Microsoft provides [[MKS Inc.]]'s [[Korn shell|ksh]] implementation ''MKS Korn shell'' for Windows through their [[Windows Services for UNIX|Services for UNIX]] add-on.\n\nSince 2001, the [[Macintosh]] operating system [[macOS]] has been based on a [[Unix-like]] operating system called [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. On these computers, users can access a Unix-like command-line interface by running the [[terminal emulator]] program called [[Terminal (macOS)|Terminal]], which is found in the Utilities sub-folder of the Applications folder, or by remotely logging into the machine using [[ssh]]. [[Z shell]] is the default shell for macOS; [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[tcsh]], and the [[Korn shell]] are also provided. Before [[macOS Catalina]], bash was the default.\n\n==Usage==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nA CLI is used whenever a large vocabulary of commands or queries, coupled with a wide (or arbitrary) range of options, can be entered more rapidly as text than with a pure GUI. This is typically the case with [[operating system shell<!-- please, see [[talk:Shell (computing)]] before changing the link back -->|operating system command shell]]s. CLIs are also used by systems with insufficient resources to support a graphical user interface.  Some computer language systems (such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], [[LISP]], [[Rexx]], and many dialects of [[BASIC]]) provide an interactive command-line mode to allow for rapid evaluation of code.\n\nCLIs are often used by programmers and system administrators, in engineering and scientific environments, and by technically advanced personal computer users. CLIs are also popular among people with visual disabilities, since the commands and responses can be displayed using [[refreshable Braille display]]s.\n\n==Anatomy of a shell CLI==\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe general pattern of an OS command line interface<ref name=\"Bash\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_Windows\"/> is:\n\n [[#Command prompt|Prompt]] command param1 param2 param3 \u2026 paramN\n\n* [[#Command prompt|Prompt]] \u2014 generated by the program to provide context for the client.\n* Command&nbsp;\u2014 provided by the client.  Commands are usually one of three classes:\n*# Internal&nbsp;\u2014 recognized and processed by the command line interpreter itself and not dependent upon any external executable file.\n*# Included&nbsp;\u2014 A separate executable file generally considered part of the operating environment and always included with the OS.\n*# External&nbsp;\u2014 External executable files not part of the basic OS, but added by other parties for specific purposes and applications.\n* param1 \u2026paramN&nbsp;\u2014 Optional parameters provided by the client.  The format and meaning of the parameters depends upon the command issued. In the case of Included or External commands, the values of the parameters are delivered to the program (specified by the Command) as it is launched by the OS.  Parameters may be either [[Argument (computer science)#Parameters and arguments|Arguments]] or [[Command-line option|Options]].\n\nIn this example, the delimiters between command line elements are [[whitespace character]]s and the end-of-line delimiter is the [[newline]] delimiter. This is a widely used (but not universal) convention for command-line interfaces.\n\n<!-- Above is more 'anatomy' and below is a bit mote theory and background and higher level concepts. Maybe separate sections for both? -->\nA CLI can generally be considered as consisting of [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] and [[semantics]]. The ''syntax'' is the grammar that all commands must follow. In the case of [[operating system]]s, [[DOS]] and [[Unix]] each define their own set of rules that all commands must follow. In the case of [[embedded systems]], each vendor, such as [[Nortel]], [[Juniper Networks]] or [[Cisco Systems]], defines their own proprietary set of rules that all commands within their CLI conform to. These rules also dictate how a user navigates through the system of commands. The ''semantics'' define what sort of operations are possible, on what sort of data these operations can be performed, and how the grammar represents these operations and data\u2014the symbolic meaning in the syntax.\n\nTwo different CLIs may agree on either syntax or semantics, but it is only when they agree on both that they can be considered sufficiently similar to allow users to use both CLIs without needing to learn anything, as well as to enable re-use of scripts.\n\nA simple CLI will display a prompt, accept a \"command line\" typed by the user terminated by the [[Enter key]], then execute the specified command and provide textual display of results or error messages.  Advanced CLIs will validate, interpret and parameter-expand the command line before executing the specified command, and optionally capture or redirect its output.\n\nUnlike a button or menu item in a GUI, a command line is typically self-documenting, stating exactly what the user wants done.  In addition, command lines usually include many [[Default (computer science)|default]]s that can be changed to customize the results.  Useful command lines can be saved by assigning a [[character string]] or [[alias (command)|alias]] to represent the full command, or several commands can be grouped to perform a more complex sequence&nbsp;\u2013 for instance, compile the program, install it, and run it&nbsp;\u2014 creating a single entity, called a command procedure or script which itself can be treated as a command. These advantages mean that a user must figure out a complex command or series of commands only once, because they can be saved, to be used again.\n\nThe commands given to a CLI shell are often in one of the following forms:\n\n* {{kbd|doSomething how toFiles}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how sourceFile destinationFile}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how < inputFile > outputFile}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how {{!}} doSomething how {{!}} doSomething how > outputFile}}\n\nwhere ''doSomething'' is, in effect, a [[verb]], ''how'' an [[adverb]] (for example, should the command be executed \"verbosely\" or \"quietly\") and ''toFiles'' an object or objects (typically one or more files) on which the command should act. The <code>&gt;</code> in the third example is a [[redirection operator]], telling the command-line interpreter to send the output of the command not to its own standard output (the screen) but to the named file. This will overwrite the file. Using <code>&gt;&gt;</code> will redirect the output and append it to the file. Another redirection operator is the [[vertical bar]] (<code>|</code>), which creates a [[pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]] where the output of one command becomes the input to the next command.\n\n===CLI and resource protection===\nOne can modify the set of available commands by modifying which paths appear in the [[PATH (variable)|PATH]] environment variable. Under Unix, commands also need be marked as [[executable]] files. The directories in the path variable are searched in the order they are given. By re-ordering the path, one can run e.g. \\OS2\\MDOS\\E.EXE instead of \\OS2\\E.EXE, when the default is the opposite. Renaming of the executables also works: people often rename their favourite editor to EDIT, for example.\n\nThe command line allows one to restrict available commands, such as access to advanced internal commands.  The Windows [[CMD.EXE]] does this. Often, shareware programs will limit the range of commands, including printing a command 'your administrator has disabled running batch files' from the prompt.\n\nSome CLIs, such as those in [[network router]]s, have a hierarchy of [[mode (user interface)|mode]]s, with a different set of commands supported in each mode. The set of commands are grouped by association with security, system, interface, etc. In these systems the user might traverse through a series of sub-modes. For example, if the CLI had two modes called ''interface'' and ''system'', the user might use the command ''interface'' to enter the interface mode. At this point, commands from the system mode may not be accessible until the user exits the interface mode and enters the system mode.\n\n===Command prompt===\n[[File:Hard reset BBC Micro 32K Acorn DFS.gif|thumb|Prompt of a [[BBC Micro]] after switch-on or hard reset.]]\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Z shell]], [[Prompt]] and [[Abort, Retry, Fail]] -->\n{{Redirect|Command prompt|the Windows component named Command Prompt|cmd.exe}}\nA command prompt (or just ''prompt'') is a sequence of (one or more) characters used in a command-line interface to indicate readiness to accept commands.  It literally [[Wiktionary:prompt|prompt]]s the user to take action. A prompt usually ends with one of the characters <code>$</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>#</code>,<ref name=\"DR_1978_SID\"/><ref name=\"DR_1982_SID86\"/> <code>:</code>, <code>&gt;</code> or <code>-</code><!-- DOS DEBUG --><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> and often includes other information, such as the path of the current [[working directory]] and the [[hostname]].\n\nOn many [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like|derivative systems]], the prompt commonly ends in  <code>$</code> or <code>%</code> if the user is a normal user, but in <code>#</code> if the user is a [[superuser]] (\"root\" in Unix terminology).\n\nEnd-users can often modify prompts. Depending on the environment, they may include colors, special characters, and other elements (like variables and functions for the current time, user, shell number or working directory) in order, for instance, to make the prompt more informative or visually pleasing, to distinguish sessions on various machines, or to indicate the current level of nesting of commands. On some systems, special tokens in the definition of the prompt can be used to cause external programs to be called by the command-line interpreter while displaying the prompt.\n\nIn DOS's COMMAND.COM and in Windows NT's [[cmd.exe]] users can modify the prompt by issuing a <code>PROMPT</code> command or by directly changing the value of the corresponding <code>[[%PROMPT%]]</code> [[environment variable]]. The default of most modern systems, the <code>C:\\></code> style is obtained, for instance, with <code>PROMPT $P$G</code>. The default of older DOS systems, <code>C></code> is obtained by just <code>PROMPT</code>, although on some systems this produces the newer <code>C:\\></code> style, unless used on floppy drives A: or B:; on those systems <code>PROMPT $N$G</code> can be used to override the automatic default and explicitly switch to the older style.\n\nMany Unix systems feature the <code>$PS1</code> variable (Prompt String 1),<ref name=\"Parker_2011\"/> although other variables also may affect the prompt (depending on the [[Unix shell|shell]] used). In the [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] shell, a prompt of the form:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">[time] user@host: work_dir $</source>\ncould be set by issuing the command\n<source lang=\"bash\">export PS1='[\\t] \\u@\\H: \\W $'</source>\n\nIn [[zsh]] the <code>$RPROMPT</code> variable controls an optional \"prompt\" on the right-hand side of the display. It is not a real prompt in that the location of text entry does not change. It is used to display information on the same line as the prompt, but right-justified.\n\nIn [[RISC OS]] the command prompt is a <code>*</code> symbol, and thus (OS)CLI commands are often referred to as \"star commands\".<ref name=\"Acorn_1992\"/> One can also access the same commands from other command lines (such as the [[BBC BASIC]] command line), by preceding the command with a <code>*</code>.\n\n==={{anchor|Arguments_section}}Arguments===\n[[File:COMMAND LINE.svg|thumb|right|An MS-DOS command line, illustrating parsing into command and arguments]]\nA '''command-line argument''' or '''[[Parameter#Computing|parameter]]''' is an item of information provided to a program when it is started.  A program can have many command-line arguments that identify sources or destinations of information, or that alter the operation of the program.\n\nWhen a command processor is active a program is typically invoked by typing its name followed by command-line arguments (if any). For example, in [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] environments, an example of a command-line argument is:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">\nrm file.s\n</source>\n\n\"file.s\" is a command-line argument which tells the program [[rm (Unix)|rm]] to remove the file \"file.s\".\n\nSome programming languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], allow a program to interpret the command-line arguments by handling them as string parameters in the [[Main function (programming)|main function]]. Other languages, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], expose operating system specific [[Application programming interface|API]] (functionality) through <code>sys</code> [[Modular programming|module]], and in particular <code>sys.argv</code> for \"command-line arguments\".\n\nIn [[Unix-like operating system]]s, a single hyphen used in place of a file name is a special value specifying that a program should handle data coming from the [[standard input]] or send data to the [[standard output]].\n\n===={{anchor|SwitChar}}Command-line option====\n<!-- This section is linked from several places inside or outside this article, preferable by \"#SwitChar\". Do not remove or rename this section heading without also updating the links. -->\nA '''command-line option''' or simply '''option''' (also known as a '''flag''' or '''switch''') modifies the operation of a command; the effect is determined by the command's program. Options follow the command name on the command line, separated by spaces. A space before the first option is not always required, such as <code>Dir/?</code> and <code style=\"white-space:nowrap\">DIR /?</code> in DOS, which have the same effect<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> of listing the DIR command's available options, whereas <code>dir --help</code> (in many versions of Unix) ''does'' require the option to be preceded by at least one space (and is case-sensitive).\n\nThe format of options varies widely between operating systems. In most cases the syntax is by convention rather than an operating system requirement; the entire command line is simply a string passed to a program, which can process it in any way the programmer wants, so long as the interpreter can tell where the command name ends and its arguments and options begin.\n\nA few representative samples of command-line options, all relating to listing files in a directory, to illustrate some conventions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Operating system !! Command !! Valid alternative !! Notes\n|-\n| [[OpenVMS]] || <code>directory/owner</code> || <code>Dir /Owner</code> || instruct the ''directory'' command to also display the ownership of the files.<br><small>''Note the Directory command name is not case sensitive, and can be abbreviated to as few letters as required to remain unique.''</small>\n|-\n| Windows || <code>DIR/Q/O:S d*</code> || <code>dir /q d* /o:s</code> || display ownership of files whose names begin with \"D\", sorted by size, smallest first.<br><small>''Note spaces around argument d* are required.''</small>\n|-\n| [[Unix-like]] systems || <code>ls -lS D*</code> || <code>ls -S -l D*</code> || display in long format files and directories beginning with \"D\" (but not \"d\"), sorted by size (largest first).<br><small>''Note spaces are required around all arguments and options, but some can be run together, e.g. '''-lS''' is the same as '''-l -S'''.''</small>\n|-\n| [[Data General RDOS]] [[Data General RDOS#RDOS CLI|CLI]]|| <code>list/e/s 04-26-80/b</code> || <code>List /S/E 4-26-80/B</code> || list every attribute for files created before 26 April 1980.<br><small>''Note the /B at the end of the date argument is a '''local switch''', that modifies the meaning of that argument, while /S and /E are '''global switches''', i.e. apply to the whole command.''</small>\n|}\n\n=====Abbreviating commands=====\n{{See also|Tab completion}}\nIn [[Multics]], command-line options and subsystem keywords may be abbreviated. This idea appears to derive from the [[PL/I programming language]], with its shortened keywords (e.g., STRG for STRINGRANGE and DCL for DECLARE). For example, in the Multics \"forum\" subsystem, the ''-long_subject'' parameter can be abbreviated ''-lgsj''. It is also common for Multics commands to be abbreviated, typically corresponding to the initial letters of the words that are strung together with underscores to form command names, such as the use of ''did'' for ''delete_iacl_dir''.\n\nIn some other systems abbreviations are automatic, such as permitting enough of the first characters of a command name to uniquely identify it (such as <code>SU</code> as an abbreviation for <code>SUPERUSER</code>) while others may have some specific abbreviations pre-programmed (e.g. <code>MD</code> for <code>[[MKDIR]]</code> in COMMAND.COM) or user-defined via batch scripts and aliases (e.g. <code>alias md mkdir</code> in [[tcsh]]).\n\n=====Option conventions in DOS, Windows, OS/2=====\nOn DOS, OS/2 and Windows, different programs called from their COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE (or internal their commands) may use different syntax within the same operating system. For example:\n\n* Options may be indicated by either of the \"switch characters\": <code>/</code>, <code>-</code>, or either may be allowed. See below.\n* They may or may not be [[case-sensitive]].\n* Sometimes options and their arguments are run together, sometimes separated by whitespace, and sometimes by a character, typically <code>:</code> or <code>=</code>; thus <code>Prog -fFilename</code>, <code>Prog -f Filename</code>, <code>Prog -f:Filename</code>, <code>Prog -f=Filename</code>.\n* Some programs allow single-character options to be combined;<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> others do not. The switch <code>-fA</code> may mean the same as <code>-f -A</code>,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> or it may be incorrect, or it may even be a valid but different parameter.\n\nIn [[DOS]], [[OS/2]] and [[Windows]], the forward slash (<code>/</code>) is most prevalent, although the hyphen-minus is also sometimes used. In many versions of DOS (MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 2.xx and higher, all versions of [[DR-DOS]] since 5.0, as well as [[PTS-DOS]], [[Embedded DOS]], [[FreeDOS]] and [[RxDOS]]) the '''switch character''' (sometimes abbreviated '''switchar''' or '''switchchar''') to be used is defined by a value returned from a [[system call]] ([[INT&nbsp;21h]]/AH=37h). The default character returned by this API is <code>/</code>, but can be changed to a hyphen-minus on the above-mentioned systems, except for under Datalight ROM-DOS and MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 5.0 and higher, which always return <code>/</code> from this call (unless one of many available [[Terminate & Stay Resident|TSR]]s to reenable the SwitChar feature is loaded). In some of these systems (MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 2.xx, DOS Plus 2.1, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, PTS-DOS, Embedded DOS, FreeDOS and RxDOS), the setting can also be pre-configured by a [[SWITCHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SWITCHAR]] directive in [[CONFIG.SYS]]. General Software's Embedded DOS provides a SWITCH command for the same purpose, whereas [[4DOS]] allows the setting to be changed via <code>SETDOS /W:n</code>.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> Under DR-DOS, if the setting has been changed from <code>/</code>, the first directory separator <code>\\</code> in the display of the [[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]] parameter <code>$G</code> will change to a forward slash <code>/</code> (which is also a valid directory separator in DOS, FlexOS, 4680 OS, 4690 OS, OS/2 and Windows) thereby serving as a visual clue to indicate the change.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> Also, the current setting is reflected also in the built-in help screens.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> Some versions of DR-DOS [[COMMAND.COM]]<!-- 7.07 --> also support a PROMPT token <code>$/</code> to display the current setting. COMMAND.COM since DR-DOS 7.02 also provides a [[pseudo-environment variable]] named <code>[[%/%]]</code> to allow portable batchjobs to be written.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_DELTREE101\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/> Several external DR-DOS commands<!-- f.e. SYS in DR-DOS 7.07 --> additionally support an [[environment variable]] <code>[[%SWITCHAR%]]</code> to override the system setting.\n\nHowever, many programs are hardwired to use <code>/</code> only, rather than retrieving the switch setting before parsing command-line arguments. A very small number, mainly ports from Unix-like systems, are programmed to accept \"-\" even if the switch character is not set to it (for example <code>[[netstat]]</code> and <code>[[ping (networking utility)|ping]]</code>, supplied with [[Microsoft Windows]], will accept the /? option to list available options, and yet the list will specify the \"-\" convention).\n\n=====Option conventions in Unix-like systems=====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nIn [[Unix-like]] systems, the ASCII [[hyphen-minus]] begins options; the new (and [[GNU]]) convention is to use ''two'' hyphens then a word (e.g. <code>--create</code>) to identify the option's use while the old convention (and still available as an option for frequently-used options) is to use one hyphen then one letter (e.g., <code>-c</code>); if one hyphen is followed by two or more letters it may mean two options are being specified, or it may mean the second and subsequent letters are a parameter (such as filename or date) for the first option.\n\nTwo hyphen-minus characters without following letters (<code>--</code>) may indicate that the remaining arguments should not be treated as options, which is useful for example if a file name itself begins with a hyphen, or if further arguments are meant for an inner command (e.g., [[sudo]]). Double hyphen-minuses are also sometimes used to prefix \"long options\" where more descriptive option names are used. This is a common feature of [[GNU]] software. The ''[[getopt]]'' function and program, and the ''[[getopts]]'' command are usually used for parsing command-line options.\n\nUnix command names, arguments and options are case-sensitive (except in a few examples, mainly where popular commands from other operating systems have been ported to Unix).\n\n=====Option conventions in other systems=====\n[[FlexOS]], [[IBM 4680 OS|4680 OS]] and [[IBM 4690 OS|4690 OS]] use <code>-</code>.\n\n[[CP/M]] typically used <code><nowiki>[</nowiki></code>.\n\n[[Conversational Monitor System]] (CMS) uses a single [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|left parenthesis]] to separate options at the end of the command from the other arguments.  For example, in the following command the options indicate that the target file should be replaced if it exists, and the date and time of the source file should be retained on the copy:\n<code>COPY source file a target file b (REPLACE OLDDATE</code>\n\n[[Data General]]'s CLI under their [[Data General RDOS|RDOS]], [[Data General AOS|AOS]], etc. operating systems, as well as the version of CLI that came with their [[Business Basic]], uses only <code>/</code> as the switch character, is case-insensitive, and allows \"local switches\" on some arguments to control the way they are interpreted, such as <code>MAC/U LIB/S A B C $LPT/L</code> has the global option \"U\" to the macro assembler command to append user symbols, but two local switches, one to specify LIB should be skipped on pass 2 and the other to direct listing to the printer, $LPT.\n\n===Built-in usage help===\n{{see also|help (command)}}\nOne of the criticisms of a CLI is the lack of cues to the user as to the available actions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  In contrast, GUIs usually inform the user of available actions with menus, icons, or other visual cues.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} To overcome this limitation, many CLI programs display a brief summary of its valid parameters, typically when invoked with no arguments or one of <code>?</code>, <code>-?</code>, <code>-h</code>, <code>-H</code>, <code>/?</code>, <code>/h</code>, <code>/H</code>, <code>/Help</code>, <code>-help</code>, or <code>--help</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_DEBUG\"/>  \n\nHowever, entering a program name without parameters in the hope that it will display usage help can be hazardous, as programs and scripts for which command line arguments are optional will execute without further notice.\n\nAlthough desirable at least for the help parameter, programs may not support all option lead-in characters exemplified above.\nUnder DOS, where the default [[Command-line_interface#Option_conventions_in_DOS.2C_Windows.2C_OS.2F2|command-line option character]] can be changed from <code>/</code> to <code>-</code>, programs may query the [[SwitChar]] API in order to determine the current setting. So, if a program is not hardwired to support them all, a user may need to know the current setting even to be able to reliably request help.\nIf the SwitChar has been changed to <code>-</code> and therefore the <code>/</code> character is accepted as alternative path delimiter also at the DOS command line, programs may misinterpret options like <code>/h</code> or <code>/H</code> as paths rather than help parameters.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> However, if given as first or only parameter, most DOS programs will, by convention<!-- at least in all versions of DR-DOS as well as under 4DOS and NDOS -->, accept it as request for help regardless of the current SwitChar setting.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/>\n\nIn some cases, different levels of help can be selected for a program. Some programs supporting this allow to give a verbosity level as an optional argument to the help parameter (as in <code>/H:1</code>, <code>/H:2</code>, etc.) or they give just a short help on help parameters with question mark and a longer help screen for the other help options.<ref name=\"Paul_2006_FreeKEYB\"/>\n\nDepending on the program, additional or more specific help on accepted parameters is sometimes available by either providing the parameter in question as an argument to the help parameter or vice versa (as in <code>/H:W</code> or in <code>/W:?</code> (assuming <code>/W</code> would be another parameter supported by the program)).<ref name=\"CCI_1997_HELP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_DRDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_DEBUG\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2006_FreeKEYB\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\"/>\n\nIn a similar fashion to the help parameter, but much less common, some programs provide additional information about themselves (like mode, status, version, author, license or contact information) when invoked with an \"about\" parameter like <code>-!</code>, <code>/!</code>, <code>-about</code>, or <code>--about</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/>\n\nSince the <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> characters typically also serve other purposes at the command line, they may not be available in all scenarios, therefore, they should not be the only options to access the corresponding help information.\n\n[[File:RT-11 help.jpg|thumb|The end of the <tt>HELP</tt> command output from [[:en:RT-11|RT-11SJ]] displayed on a [[:en:VT100|VT100]].]]\nIf more detailed help is necessary than provided by a program's built-in internal help, many systems support a dedicated external \"<code>[[help (command)|help]] ''command''</code>\" command (or similar), which accepts a command name as calling parameter and will invoke an external help system.\n\nIn the DR-DOS family, typing <code>/?</code> or <code>/H</code> at the [[COMMAND.COM]] prompt instead of a command itself will display a dynamically generated list of available internal commands;<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> [[4DOS]] and [[NDOS]] support the same feature by typing <code>?</code> at the prompt<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> (which is also accepted by newer versions<!-- only 7.02 and higher --> of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM); internal commands can be individually disabled or reenabled via <code>SETDOS /I</code>.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> In addition to this, some newer versions of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM<!-- 7.07 --> also accept a <code>?%</code> command to display a list of available built-in [[DR-DOS system information variable|pseudo-environment variable]]s. Besides their purpose as quick help reference this can be used in batchjobs to query the facilities of the underlying command-line processor.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\n===Command description syntax===\nBuilt-in usage help and [[man page]]s commonly employ a small syntax to describe the valid command form:<ref name=\"OpenGroup_2008\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2005_Shell\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2010_Syntax\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB2\"/>\n\n* angle brackets for ''required'' parameters: <code>ping <hostname></code>\n* square brackets for ''optional'' parameters: <code>mkdir [-p] <dirname></code>\n* ellipses for ''repeated'' items: <code>cp <source1> [source2\u2026] <dest></code>\n* vertical bars for ''choice'' of items: <code>netstat {-t|-u}</code>\n\nNotice that these characters have different meanings than when used directly in the shell. Angle brackets may be omitted when confusing the parameter name with a literal string is not likely.\n\n===The space character===\n<!-- this is a file-system feature, nothing to do with the command line -->\nIn many areas of computing, but particularly in the command line, the [[space character]] can cause problems as it has two distinct and incompatible functions: as part of a command or parameter, or as a parameter or name [[Delimiter|separator]]. Ambiguity can be prevented either by prohibiting embedded spaces in file and directory names in the first place (for example, by substituting them with [[underscores]] <code>_</code>), or by enclosing a name with embedded spaces between quote characters or using an [[escape character]] before the space, usually a [[backslash]] (<code>\\</code>).  For example\n:<code>Long path/Long program name Parameter one Parameter two</code> \u2026\nis ambiguous (is \"program name\" part of the program name, or two parameters?); however\n:<code>Long_path/Long_program_name Parameter_one Parameter_two</code> \u2026,\n:<code>LongPath/LongProgramName ParameterOne ParameterTwo</code> \u2026,\n:<code>\"Long path/Long program name\" \"Parameter one\" \"Parameter two\"</code> \u2026\nand\n:<code>Long\\ path/Long\\ program\\ name Parameter\\ one Parameter\\ two</code> \u2026\nare not ambiguous. [[Unix]]-based operating systems minimize the use of embedded spaces to minimize the need for quotes. In [[Microsoft Windows]], one often has to use quotes because embedded spaces (such as in directory names) are common.\n\n==Command-line interpreter==\n{{see also|List of command-line interpreters}}\n{{quotation|Although most users think of the shell as an interactive command interpreter, it is really a programming language in which each statement runs a command. Because it must satisfy both the interactive and programming aspects of command execution, it is a strange language, shaped as much by history as by design.|[[Brian W. Kernighan]] & [[Rob Pike]]<ref name=\"Kerninghan_1984\"/>}}\n\nThe term '''command-line interpreter''' ('''CLI''') is applied to [[computer program]]s designed to [[interpreter (computing)|interpret]] a sequence of lines of text which may be entered by a user, read from a [[computer file|file]] or another kind of [[data stream]]. The context of interpretation is usually one of a given [[operating system]] or [[programming language]].\n\nCommand-line interpreters allow users to issue various commands in a very efficient (and often terse) way. This requires the user to know the names of the commands and their parameters, and the syntax of the [[programming language|language]] that is interpreted.\n\nThe Unix [[Shebang (Unix)|<code>#!</code>]] mechanism and OS/2 EXTPROC command facilitate the passing of batch files to external processors.  One can use these mechanisms to write specific command processors for dedicated uses, and process external data files which reside in batch files.\n\nMany graphical interfaces, such as the OS/2 [[Presentation Manager]] and early versions of Microsoft Windows use command-lines to call helper programs to open documents and programs.  The commands are stored in the graphical shell{{clarify|date=May 2012}} or in files like the registry or the [[OS/2]] <code>OS2USER.INI</code> file.\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:TTY33ASR.jpg|thumb|A [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR teleprinter keyboard with punched tape reader and punch.]]\n[[File:Terminal-dec-vt52.jpg|thumb|[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VT52]] terminal.]]\nThe earliest computers did not support interactive input/output devices, often relying on [[sense switch]]es and lights to communicate with the [[computer operator]]. This was adequate for [[Batch processing|batch]] systems that ran one program at a time, often with the programmer acting as operator. This also had the advantage of low overhead, since lights and switches could be tested and set with one machine instruction. Later a single [[system console]] was added to allow the operator to communicate with the system.\n\nFrom the 1960s onwards, user interaction with computers was primarily by means of command-line interfaces, initially on machines like the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, but then on early [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-based [[computer terminals]] such as the [[VT52]].\n\nAll of these devices were purely text based, with no ability to display graphic or pictures.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB3\"/> For business [[Application software|application programs]], text-based [[menu (computing)|menus]] were used, but for more general interaction the command line was the interface.\n\nAround 1964 [[Louis Pouzin]] introduced the concept and the name ''shell'' in [[Multics]], building on earlier, simpler facilities in the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] (CTSS).<ref name=\"Pouzin\"/>{{better source|introduced the concept (sic)|date=September 2013}}\n\nFrom the early 1970s the [[Unix]] operating system adapted the concept of a powerful command-line environment, and introduced the ability to ''[[Pipeline (Unix)|pipe]]'' the output of one command in as input to another. Unix also had the capability to save and re-run strings of commands as \"[[shell scripts]]\" which acted like custom commands.\n\nThe command-line was also the main interface for the early home computers such as the [[Commodore PET]], [[Apple II]] and [[BBC Micro]]&nbsp;\u2013 almost always in the form of a [[BASIC]] interpreter. When more powerful business oriented microcomputers arrived with [[CP/M]] and later [[DOS]] computers such as the [[IBM PC]], the command-line began to borrow some of the syntax and features of the Unix shells such as [[globbing]] and [[Pipeline (Unix)|piping]] of output.\n\nThe command-line was first seriously challenged by the [[PARC (company)|PARC]] [[GUI]] approach used in the 1983 [[Apple Lisa]] and the 1984 [[Apple Macintosh]]. A few computer users used GUIs such as [[GEOS (16-bit operating system)|GEOS]] and [[Windows 3.1]] but the majority of [[IBM PC]] users did not replace their [[COMMAND.COM]] shell with a GUI until [[Windows 95]] was released in 1995.<ref name=\"Betanews\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_History\"/>\n\n===Modern usage as an operating system shell===\nWhile most non-expert computer users now use a GUI almost exclusively, more advanced users have access to powerful command-line environments:\n\n* The default VAX/VMS command shell, using the [[DIGITAL Command Language|DCL]] language, has been ported to Windows systems at least three times, including [[PC-DCL]] and Acceler8 DCL Lite. Unix command shells have been ported to VMS and DOS/Windows 95 and Windows NT types of operating systems. COMMAND.COM and Windows NT cmd.exe have been ported to Windows CE and presumably works on Microsoft Windows NT Embedded 4.0\n* Windows [[Resource Kit]] and Windows [[Services for Unix]] include Korn and the Bourne shells along with a Perl interpreter (Services of Unix contains Active State [[ActivePerl]] in later versions and [[Interix]] for versions 1 and 2 and a shell compiled by Microsoft)\n* IBM OS/2 has the [[cmd.exe]] processor. This copies the [[COMMAND.COM]] commands, with extensions to [[REXX]].\n* cmd.exe and COMMAND.COM are part of the Windows NT stream of operating systems.\n* Yet another cmd.exe is a stripped-down shell for [[Windows CE]] 3.0.\n* An MS-DOS type interpreter called [[PocketDOS]] has been ported to Windows CE machines; the most recent release is almost identical to MS-DOS 6.22 and can also run Windows 1, 2, and 3.0, [[QBasic]] and other development tools, 4NT and 4DOS. The latest release includes several shells, namely MS-DOS 6.22, PC&nbsp;DOS 7, DR&nbsp;DOS 3.xx, and others.\n* [[PocketConsole]] is a Windows NT 4.0 shell for Windows CE that is much like 4NT.\n* Windows users have a CLI environment named [[Windows Command Prompt]], which might use the [[CScript]] interface to alternate programs. [[PowerShell]] provides a command-line interface, but its applets are not written in [[Shell script]]. Implementations of the [[Unix shell]] are also available as part of the [[Microsoft POSIX subsystem|POSIX sub-system]],<ref name=\"Microsoft_POSIX\"/> [[Cygwin]], [[MKS Toolkit]], [[UWIN]], [[Hamilton C shell]] and other software packages. Available shells for these interoperability tools include [[C shell|csh]], [[Korn shell|ksh]], [[Bourne shell|sh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[Restricted shell|rsh]], [[tclsh]] and less commonly [[zsh]], psh\n* COMMAND.COM (4DOS), Windows NT cmd.exe (4NT, TCC), and OS/2 cmd.exe (4OS2) and others based on them are enhanced shells which can be a replacement for the native shell or a means of enhancement of the default shell.\n* Implementations of [[PHP]] have a shell for interactive use called php-cli.\n* Standard [[Tcl/Tk]] has two interactive shells, Tclsh and Wish, the latter being the GUI version.\n* [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]],<!-- [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], --> [[XLNT]], and other interpreters also have command shells for interactive use.\n* [[FreeBSD]] uses [[tcsh]] as its default interactive shell for the [[superuser]].\n* Apple [[macOS]]<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB4\"/> and many [[Linux distribution]]s have the [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] implementation of the [[Unix shell]]. Early versions of macOS used [[tcsh]] as the default shell.\n* [[Embedded Linux]] (and other embedded [[Unix-like]]) devices often use the [[Almquist shell|Ash]] implementation of the Unix shell, as part of [[Busybox]].\n* [[Android (operating system)|Android]] uses the [[Korn shell|mksh]] shell,<ref name=\"Android_mksh\"/><ref name=\"Android_adb\"/> which replaces a shell derived from [[Almquist shell|ash]]<ref name=\"Android_sh\"/> that was used in older Android versions<!-- Not clear if switch was in Gengerbread, or before-->, supplemented with commands from the separate ''toolbox''<ref name=\"Android_Toolbox\"/> binary.\n* Routers with [[Cisco IOS]],<ref name=\"Cisco_IOS\"/> [[Junos]]<ref name=\"Juniper\"/> and many others are commonly configured from the command line.\n\n==Scripting==\nMost command-line interpreters support [[script (computer programming)|scripting]], to various extents. (They are, after all, interpreters of an [[interpreted programming language]], albeit in many cases the language is unique to the particular command-line interpreter.) They will interpret scripts (variously termed [[shell script]]s or [[batch file]]s) written in the [[programming language|language]] that they interpret. Some command-line interpreters also incorporate the interpreter engines of other languages, such as [[REXX]], in addition to their own, allowing the executing of scripts, in those languages, directly within the command-line interpreter itself.\n\nConversely, [[scripting programming language]]s, in particular those with an [[eval]] [[function (programming)|function]] (such as REXX, [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] or [[Jython]]), can be used to implement command-line interpreters and filters. For a few [[operating system]]s, most notably [[DOS]], such a command interpreter provides a more flexible command-line interface than the one supplied. In other cases, such a command interpreter can present a highly customised user interface employing the user interface and input/output facilities of the language.\n\n==Other command-line interfaces==\nThe command line provides an interface between programs as well as the user. In this sense, a command line is an alternative to a [[dialog box]]. Editors and databases present a command line, in which alternate command processors might run. On the other hand, one might have options on the command line, which opens a dialog box. The latest version of 'Take Command' has this feature. DBase used a dialog box to construct command lines, which could be further edited before use.\n\nPrograms like BASIC, Diskpart, EDLIN, and QBASIC all provide command-line interfaces, some of which use the system shell. Basic is modeled on the default interface for 8-bit Intel computers. Calculators can be run as command-line or dialog interfaces.\n\n[[Emacs]] provides a command-line interface in the form of its minibuffer. Commands and arguments can be entered using Emacs standard text editing support, and output is displayed in another buffer.\n\nThere are a number of text mode games, like ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' or ''[[King's Quest#Series|King's Quest 1-3]]'', which relied on the user typing commands at the bottom of the screen. One controls the character by typing commands like 'get ring' or 'look'. The program returns a text which describes how the character sees it, or makes the action happen. The [[text adventure]] ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', a piece of [[interactive fiction]] based on [[Douglas Adams|Douglas Adam's]] book of the same name, is a teletype-style command-line game.\n\nThe most notable of these interfaces is the [[standard streams]] interface, which allows the output of one command to be passed to the input of another. Text files can serve either purpose as well. This provides the interfaces of piping, filters and redirection. Under Unix, [[Everything is a file|devices are files]] too, so the normal type of file for the shell used for stdin,stdout and stderr is a [[Teleprinter#Teleprinters in computing|tty]] device file.\n\nAnother command-line interface allows a shell program to launch helper programs, either to launch documents or start a program. The command is processed internally by the shell, and then passed on to another program to launch the document. The graphical interface of Windows and OS/2 rely heavily on command-lines passed through to other programs&nbsp;\u2013 console or graphical, which then usually process the command line without presenting a user-console.\n\nPrograms like the OS/2 E editor and some other IBM [[text editor|editors]], can process command-lines normally meant for the shell, the output being placed directly in the document window.\n\nA web browser's URL input field can be used as a command line. It can be used to \"launch\" [[web app]]s, [[about:config|access browser configuration]], as well as perform a search. [[Google]], which has been called \"the command line of the internet\" will perform a domain-specific search when it detects search parameters in a known format.<ref name=\"Google\"/> This functionality is present whether the search is triggered from a browser field or on Google's website.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[List of command-line interpreters]]\n* [[Orthodox file manager]], also known as command-based file manager\n* [[Batch processing]]\n* [[Batch file]]\n* [[Console application]]\n* [[Interpreter directive]]\n* [[Read-eval-print loop]]\n* [[Shell (computing)]]\n* [[Scripting language]]\n* [[Shell script]]\n* [[clig]]\n* [[Computer terminal]]\n* [[Terminal emulator]]\n* [[Run command]]\n* {{Section link|Graphical user interface|Comparison to other interfaces}}\n* [[In the Beginning\u2026 Was the Command Line]]\n* [[Natural user interface]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\">An example is the comprehensive internal help system of the [[DR-DOS 7.03]] [[DEBUG (DOS command)|DEBUG]] command, which can be invoked via <code>??</code> at the debug prompt (rather than only the default <code>?</code> overview). Specific help pages can be selected via <code>?n</code> (where <code>n</code> is the number of the page). Additionally, help for specific commands can be displayed by specifying the command name after <code>?</code>, f.e. <code>?D</code> will invoke help for the various dump commands (like <code>D</code> etc.).
