Folk costume has various details according to the place of origin and social status of the wearer. The modern dirndl is heavily stylized but clearly influenced by typical Bavarian costume.

Simple forms were also worn commonly by working women in plain colors or a simple check.

In 1890, they founded in [[Munich]] the ''M\u00fcnchner Volkskunsthaus'' (\"Munich house of folk art\"). \nTheir seamstresses industriously produced the first elegant tracht dresses from colourful printed fabrics, predominantly silk. These were first exhibited by models from the firm at summer holiday resorts in the Alps. The breakthrough came in 1910, when the Wallach brothers organized and paid for the traditional costume parade for the 100th anniversary celebrations of the [[Oktoberfest]]. <ref name=\"staendecke\"> St\u00e4ndecke, Monika. 2007.

Folk costume has various details according to the place of origin and social status of the wearer. The modern dirndl is heavily stylized but clearly influenced by typical Bavarian costume.

Simple forms were also worn commonly by working women in plain colors or a simple check.

In 1890, they founded in [[Munich]] the ''M\u00fcnchner Volkskunsthaus'' (\"Munich house of folk art\"). \nTheir seamstresses industriously produced the first elegant tracht dresses from colourful printed fabrics, predominantly silk. These were first exhibited by models from the firm at summer holiday resorts in the Alps. The breakthrough came in 1910, when the Wallach brothers organized and paid for the traditional costume parade for the 100th anniversary celebrations of the [[Oktoberfest]]. <ref name=\"staendecke\"> St\u00e4ndecke, Monika. 2007.

He was already well known in the automobile industry as a capable engineer, business innovator, and youngest person to become a [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] (GM) executive. [[Investment]] [[Capital (economics)|capital]] came primarily in the form of business loans from [[Bank of America]] and from the formation of [[partnership]]s and private investment from select parties, including ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' host [[Johnny Carson]] and entertainers [[Roy Clark]] and [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]]. Capital was also raised through a dealer investment program in which those dealerships offering DeLorean's cars for sale were made shareholders in the company.\n\nDeLorean also sought lucrative incentives from various government and economic organizations to pay for constructing the company's automobile manufacturing facilities. To gain these, he looked to build his first factory in a country or area where unemployment was particularly high. One candidate was the [[Republic of Ireland]], although that state's then [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Minister for Industry and Commerce]], [[Desmond O'Malley]], [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], decided not to support the project. A deal in [[Puerto Rico]] was about to be agreed when DeLorean took up a last-minute offer from the [[Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland]] (the IDB). Besides taking some early [[seed capital]] from Hollywood stars [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] and [[Johnny Carson]], DeLorean Motor Company relied on the British Government for about $120 million of its $200 million startup costs according to the newspaper ''[[The Times]]''.  The British Government was very keen to create jobs in [[Northern Ireland]] to reduce [[sectarian violence]] by reducing unemployment. As part of this offer, DeLorean was apparently under the impression that the British Government would provide his company with [[Export Credit Agencies|Export Credit]] financing. This would provide a loan of 80% of the wholesale cost of the vehicles (US$20,000) upon completion and delivery for shipping.\n\n===Manufacturing facility===\nIn October 1978, construction of the six-building, 660,000&nbsp;ft\u00b2 (61,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) manufacturing plant began in [[Northern Ireland]] and was designed and managed by Brodie and Hawthorn Architects based in Belfast and constructed in 16 months by Farrans McLaughlin & Harvey. Officially known as DMCL (DeLorean Motor Cars, Ltd.), the facility was located in The Cutts in [[Dunmurry]], a suburb on the south-western edge of [[Belfast]]. It was situated on an interface between two communities with differing political outlooks:  [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] [[Twinbrook, Belfast|Twinbrook]] and [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] Dunmurry.\n\n[[Manufacturing|Unit production]] was scheduled to begin in 1979, but engineering delays and budget overruns caused the [[assembly line]]s to start only in early 1981. Workers at the factory were generally inexperienced; many never had jobs before joining DMC. This may have contributed to the reported [[quality assurance|quality issues]] attributed to the early production vehicles and the subsequent establishment of Quality Assurance Centers (QAC) located at various delivery locations. QACs were set up in [[California]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Michigan]] where some of the quality issues were to be addressed and resolved before delivery to [[Car dealership|dealership]]s. Some of the issues related to the fitting of body panels, higher-output [[Alternator (automotive)|alternators]], and [[gullwing door]] adjustments.\n\nThe combined efforts of quality assurance improvements at the factory and the post-production [[quality assurance]] done at the QACs were generally successful, although workmanship complaints would still occasionally arise; the 1981 DeLoreans were delivered with a 12-month, {{convert|12000|mi|km|abbr=on}} [[warranty]]. By 1982, improvements in components and the more experienced workforce meant that production quality was vastly improved. Disputes between dealerships and customers arose later because many dealerships refused to do warranty work because they were not reimbursed.\n\n===Downturn and bankruptcy===\nThe lack of demand, [[cost overrun]]s, and unfavorable exchange rates began to take their toll on DMC's cash flow in late 1981. The company had estimated its break-even point to be between 10,000 and 12,000 units, but sales were only around 6,000. In response to the income shortfall, a restructuring plan was devised where a new \"DeLorean Motors Holding Company\" would be formed, which in turn would have become corporate parent to DMC and each of its subsidiaries: DeLorean Motor Cars Limited (manufacturer), DeLorean Motor Cars of America (distributor in the U.S.) and DeLorean Research Partnership (a research and development company). In January 1982, due to [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] questions about the company's viability, the company was forced to cancel the stock issue for the holding company that DeLorean had hoped would raise about $27 million.\n\nJohn DeLorean then lobbied the British government for aid, but was refused unless he was able to find a matching amount from other investors. What followed is a matter of debate between the British government, the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], DeLorean, his investors, and the US court system. At some point in 1982, John DeLorean became the target of an FBI [[sting operation]] designed to arrest drug traffickers. He was arrested in October 1982 and charged with conspiring to smuggle $24 million worth of cocaine into the US. The key element of evidence for the prosecution was a videotape showing DeLorean discussing the drugs deal with undercover FBI agents Benedict (Ben) Tisa and West, although DeLorean's attorney [[Howard Weitzman]] successfully demonstrated to the court that he was coerced into participation in the deal by the agents who initially approached him as legitimate investors. He was acquitted of all charges, but his reputation was forever tarnished. After his trial and subsequent acquittal, DeLorean quipped, \"Would you buy a used car from me?\"\n\nIn the end, sufficient funds could not be raised to keep the company alive. DMC went bankrupt in 1982, taking with it 2,500 jobs and over $100 million in investments. The British government attempted to revive some usable remnants of the manufacturing facility without success, and the Dunmurry factory was closed. DeLorean himself retired in [[New Jersey]], and the dream with which he had mesmerized Britain's Labour government, of industry rising out of the ashes of [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], was shattered. He claimed that the DMCL was deliberately closed for political reasons, and at the time of closing was a solidly viable company with millions of dollars in the bank and two years of dealer orders on the books.\n\nApproximately 9,000 cars were made between January 1981 and December 1982, although actual production figures are unclear and estimates differ. Some of the cars manufactured in 1982, but not shipped to the states (as the US arm of DMC had no money to 'buy' the cars from the factory in Northern Ireland), with 15XXX and 16XXX Vehicle Identification Numbers are actually 1982 models that were given later VINs, dated 1983, by Consolidated International (now known as [[Big Lots]]), a company that had a buyback program with DMC and had bought out the remaining unsold cars and also the inventory of unused parts left in the factory after the bankruptcy.\n\nThe DeLorean assembly plant was eventually occupied by the French firm Montupet, which began to manufacture cast aluminium cylinder heads automobile engines at the Dunmurry facility in 1989.<ref>[https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/montupet-set-for-expansion-as-company-is-sold-for-629m-34648105.html]{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nAlthough he was cleared of all drug trafficking charges, John DeLorean still had to battle many legal cases (stemming from the company's bankruptcy) well into the 1990s.  He declared bankruptcy in September 1999, and was evicted from his {{convert|434|acre|km2|abbr=on}} New Jersey estate in March 2000.  He died of stroke complications at 80 years of age on March 19, 2005.\n\n==Vehicles==\n\n===Production vehicles===\n\n====DeLorean====\n{{Main|DMC DeLorean}}\n[[Image:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|DeLorean with gull-wing doors open.]]\n\nThe ''DeLorean'' was the only car put into production by DMC. Reception by the car-buying public and automotive magazines was mixed. Although the early vehicles had impressive waiting lists of anxious consumers, the MSRP of $25,000; this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}  was cost-prohibitive for the majority of the market \u2014 especially for what many considered to be an under-powered and impractical plaything. \"It's not a barn burner,\" observed ''Road & Track'', \"(with) a 0-60&nbsp;mph time of 10.5 seconds. Frankly, that's not quick for a sports/GT car in this price category.\" The stainless steel body panels were an attractive design concept and impervious to corrosion, but in practice the sheen surface tended to show fingerprints. It also meant that the car could not be easily painted; every factory original DeLorean looked virtually identical. Some dealerships painted their cars on delivery to help make theirs more distinctive. DMC was testing the use of translucent paint to help provide different color options on the cars while also allowing the stainless steel grain to show through, but no cars were sold with factory painted body panels. The only factory option initially available was an automatic transmission. A grey interior was offered later in 1981 as an alternative to the standard black interior. Several accessories including pinstriping and luggage racks helped provide further individuality.<ref>[http://www.babbtechnology.com/thecar/misc.htm Misc.

There is an active enthusiast community around the cars, with strong owners' clubs.

In particular, DMC<ref name=\"delorean.com\"/> (based in [[Humble, Texas]]), operates under entirely new ownership and with no direct ties to the original DeLorean Motor Company.

He was already well known in the automobile industry as a capable engineer, business innovator, and youngest person to become a [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] (GM) executive. [[Investment]] [[Capital (economics)|capital]] came primarily in the form of business loans from [[Bank of America]] and from the formation of [[partnership]]s and private investment from select parties, including ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' host [[Johnny Carson]] and entertainers [[Roy Clark]] and [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]]. Capital was also raised through a dealer investment program in which those dealerships offering DeLorean's cars for sale were made shareholders in the company.\n\nDeLorean also sought lucrative incentives from various government and economic organizations to pay for constructing the company's automobile manufacturing facilities. To gain these, he looked to build his first factory in a country or area where unemployment was particularly high. One candidate was the [[Republic of Ireland]], although that state's then [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Minister for Industry and Commerce]], [[Desmond O'Malley]], [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], decided not to support the project. A deal in [[Puerto Rico]] was about to be agreed when DeLorean took up a last-minute offer from the [[Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland]] (the IDB). Besides taking some early [[seed capital]] from Hollywood stars [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] and [[Johnny Carson]], DeLorean Motor Company relied on the British Government for about $120 million of its $200 million startup costs according to the newspaper ''[[The Times]]''.  The British Government was very keen to create jobs in [[Northern Ireland]] to reduce [[sectarian violence]] by reducing unemployment. As part of this offer, DeLorean was apparently under the impression that the British Government would provide his company with [[Export Credit Agencies|Export Credit]] financing. This would provide a loan of 80% of the wholesale cost of the vehicles (US$20,000) upon completion and delivery for shipping.\n\n===Manufacturing facility===\nIn October 1978, construction of the six-building, 660,000&nbsp;ft\u00b2 (61,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) manufacturing plant began in [[Northern Ireland]] and was designed and managed by Brodie and Hawthorn Architects based in Belfast and constructed in 16 months by Farrans McLaughlin & Harvey. Officially known as DMCL (DeLorean Motor Cars, Ltd.), the facility was located in The Cutts in [[Dunmurry]], a suburb on the south-western edge of [[Belfast]]. It was situated on an interface between two communities with differing political outlooks:  [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] [[Twinbrook, Belfast|Twinbrook]] and [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] Dunmurry.\n\n[[Manufacturing|Unit production]] was scheduled to begin in 1979, but engineering delays and budget overruns caused the [[assembly line]]s to start only in early 1981. Workers at the factory were generally inexperienced; many never had jobs before joining DMC. This may have contributed to the reported [[quality assurance|quality issues]] attributed to the early production vehicles and the subsequent establishment of Quality Assurance Centers (QAC) located at various delivery locations. QACs were set up in [[California]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Michigan]] where some of the quality issues were to be addressed and resolved before delivery to [[Car dealership|dealership]]s. Some of the issues related to the fitting of body panels, higher-output [[Alternator (automotive)|alternators]], and [[gullwing door]] adjustments.\n\nThe combined efforts of quality assurance improvements at the factory and the post-production [[quality assurance]] done at the QACs were generally successful, although workmanship complaints would still occasionally arise; the 1981 DeLoreans were delivered with a 12-month, {{convert|12000|mi|km|abbr=on}} [[warranty]]. By 1982, improvements in components and the more experienced workforce meant that production quality was vastly improved. Disputes between dealerships and customers arose later because many dealerships refused to do warranty work because they were not reimbursed.\n\n===Downturn and bankruptcy===\nThe lack of demand, [[cost overrun]]s, and unfavorable exchange rates began to take their toll on DMC's cash flow in late 1981. The company had estimated its break-even point to be between 10,000 and 12,000 units, but sales were only around 6,000. In response to the income shortfall, a restructuring plan was devised where a new \"DeLorean Motors Holding Company\" would be formed, which in turn would have become corporate parent to DMC and each of its subsidiaries: DeLorean Motor Cars Limited (manufacturer), DeLorean Motor Cars of America (distributor in the U.S.) and DeLorean Research Partnership (a research and development company). In January 1982, due to [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] questions about the company's viability, the company was forced to cancel the stock issue for the holding company that DeLorean had hoped would raise about $27 million.\n\nJohn DeLorean then lobbied the British government for aid, but was refused unless he was able to find a matching amount from other investors. What followed is a matter of debate between the British government, the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], DeLorean, his investors, and the US court system. At some point in 1982, John DeLorean became the target of an FBI [[sting operation]] designed to arrest drug traffickers. He was arrested in October 1982 and charged with conspiring to smuggle $24 million worth of cocaine into the US. The key element of evidence for the prosecution was a videotape showing DeLorean discussing the drugs deal with undercover FBI agents Benedict (Ben) Tisa and West, although DeLorean's attorney [[Howard Weitzman]] successfully demonstrated to the court that he was coerced into participation in the deal by the agents who initially approached him as legitimate investors. He was acquitted of all charges, but his reputation was forever tarnished. After his trial and subsequent acquittal, DeLorean quipped, \"Would you buy a used car from me?\"\n\nIn the end, sufficient funds could not be raised to keep the company alive. DMC went bankrupt in 1982, taking with it 2,500 jobs and over $100 million in investments. The British government attempted to revive some usable remnants of the manufacturing facility without success, and the Dunmurry factory was closed. DeLorean himself retired in [[New Jersey]], and the dream with which he had mesmerized Britain's Labour government, of industry rising out of the ashes of [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], was shattered. He claimed that the DMCL was deliberately closed for political reasons, and at the time of closing was a solidly viable company with millions of dollars in the bank and two years of dealer orders on the books.\n\nApproximately 9,000 cars were made between January 1981 and December 1982, although actual production figures are unclear and estimates differ. Some of the cars manufactured in 1982, but not shipped to the states (as the US arm of DMC had no money to 'buy' the cars from the factory in Northern Ireland), with 15XXX and 16XXX Vehicle Identification Numbers are actually 1982 models that were given later VINs, dated 1983, by Consolidated International (now known as [[Big Lots]]), a company that had a buyback program with DMC and had bought out the remaining unsold cars and also the inventory of unused parts left in the factory after the bankruptcy.\n\nThe DeLorean assembly plant was eventually occupied by the French firm Montupet, which began to manufacture cast aluminium cylinder heads automobile engines at the Dunmurry facility in 1989.<ref>[https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/montupet-set-for-expansion-as-company-is-sold-for-629m-34648105.html]{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nAlthough he was cleared of all drug trafficking charges, John DeLorean still had to battle many legal cases (stemming from the company's bankruptcy) well into the 1990s.  He declared bankruptcy in September 1999, and was evicted from his {{convert|434|acre|km2|abbr=on}} New Jersey estate in March 2000.  He died of stroke complications at 80 years of age on March 19, 2005.\n\n==Vehicles==\n\n===Production vehicles===\n\n====DeLorean====\n{{Main|DMC DeLorean}}\n[[Image:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|DeLorean with gull-wing doors open.]]\n\nThe ''DeLorean'' was the only car put into production by DMC. Reception by the car-buying public and automotive magazines was mixed. Although the early vehicles had impressive waiting lists of anxious consumers, the MSRP of $25,000; this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}  was cost-prohibitive for the majority of the market \u2014 especially for what many considered to be an under-powered and impractical plaything. \"It's not a barn burner,\" observed ''Road & Track'', \"(with) a 0-60&nbsp;mph time of 10.5 seconds. Frankly, that's not quick for a sports/GT car in this price category.\" The stainless steel body panels were an attractive design concept and impervious to corrosion, but in practice the sheen surface tended to show fingerprints. It also meant that the car could not be easily painted; every factory original DeLorean looked virtually identical. Some dealerships painted their cars on delivery to help make theirs more distinctive. DMC was testing the use of translucent paint to help provide different color options on the cars while also allowing the stainless steel grain to show through, but no cars were sold with factory painted body panels. The only factory option initially available was an automatic transmission. A grey interior was offered later in 1981 as an alternative to the standard black interior. Several accessories including pinstriping and luggage racks helped provide further individuality.<ref>[http://www.babbtechnology.com/thecar/misc.htm Misc.

Co. to produce railway and logging equipment at its plant in West Seattle. In February 1908, the Seattle Car Manufacturing Co. opened a modern railcar manufacturing plant in Renton. The destruction of Seattle Car's Youngstown plant by fire, coupled with the repercussions of the national financial panic of 1907, had placed the company in voluntary receivership. The new plant gave the business new momentum and company president William Pigott (1860-1929) and in particular the company vice president Oliver D. Colvin successfully shepherded the company through this difficult period. The company later with Twohy Brothers of Portland in 1915 to become '''Pacific Car and Foundry Company''', a name it retained for the next 55 years. In 1924, William Pigott sold control of the company to [[American Car & Foundry]] Company.\n\nPaul Pigott, son of the founder, acquired a major interest in the company from American Car in 1934. Under his leadership, the company expanded its products and introduced the Carco line of power winches for use on crawler tractors in the logging industry. This product line later became the basis for PACCAR Winch, located in [[Oklahoma]], which now includes Braden, Carco and Gearmatic.\n\nThe company entered the heavy-duty truck market in 1945 with its first major acquisition, [[Kenworth|Kenworth Motor Truck Company]] of [[Seattle]]. Pacific Car and Foundry greatly expanded its heavy-duty truck capability with the purchase of [[Peterbilt|Peterbilt Motors Company]] in 1958. That same year, the acquisition of Dart Truck Company permitted its entry into the entirely new market of mining vehicles.\n\nThe company's Structural Steel division fabricated the steel for the construction of the Space Needle for the [[Century 21 Exposition|1962 Seattle World Fair]]. Later, it played a major part in the construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]'s third powerhouse as well as the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City|New York]].\n\nIn 1960, Kenworth expanded into Mexico, with 49 percent participation in an affiliate company, Kenworth Mexicana S.A. de C.V. In 1966 PACCAR entered the Australian truck market with the establishment of a Kenworth truck assembly plant near [[Melbourne]].\n\nAlso in 1960, Carco Acceptance Corporation, currently PACCAR Financial Corp, was launched to facilitate domestic sales of trucks.\n\nIn 1968 the Dynacraft division was formed to provide belts, hoses, adapters, and other accessories for Kenworth and Peterbilt truck plants. \n\nKenworth Australia purchased 28&nbsp;acres (11&nbsp;ha) of land at suburban [[Bayswater, Victoria|Bayswater]] \u2013 18&nbsp;miles (30&nbsp;km) east of Melbourne, in 1969, to build a factory and office complex. By the end of 1970, the 56,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (5,200&nbsp;m\u00b2) complex was completed. Initially, trucks were produced on a [[Knock-down kit|completely knocked down]] basis. During Kenworth Australia's subsequent history, it become a major force in the local, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea markets.\n\nBelieving \"Pacific Car and Foundry Company\" no longer accurately reflected the company's products and activities, directors and shareholders voted to adopt PACCAR Inc as its new name in 1972.\n\nIn 1972, PACCAR International was formed in [[Bellevue, Washington]] to consolidate the sales and service of company products abroad. PACCAR Parts was established in [[Renton, Washington|Renton]] a year later to supply aftermarket parts.\n\nIn 1975 PACCAR purchased International Car Company of [[Kenton, Ohio]], North America's leading [[caboose]] manufacturer.\n\nPACCAR Leasing Corporation was formed in 1980 to offer full-service leasing and rental programs through PACCAR's dealer network. A year later, PACCAR became a European truck manufacturer with the acquisition of [[Foden Trucks]] in England.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/27th-september-1980/5/saviour-for-fodens Saviour for Fodens] ''[[Commercial Motor]]'' September 27, 1980 page 5</ref><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/18th-october-1980/5/fodens-takeover-1600-jobs-lost Fodens takeover: 1,600 jobs lost] ''Commercial Motor'' October 18, 1980 page 5</ref>\n\nPACCAR's new Technical Center opened in July 1982. Located approximately 65 miles north of Seattle, the multimillion-dollar center underscored the company's commitment to technical excellence, quality and value in the products it manufactures.\n\nIn 1986, PACCAR acquired Trico Industries, manufacturing oil field pumps and accessories. In December 1997 Trico was sold to EVI of [[Houston]].\n\nIn 1987, PACCAR acquired Washington-based Al's Auto Supply, an aftermarket retailer and wholesale distributor of auto parts and accessories. In 1988, PACCAR expanded its subsidiary PACCAR Automotive. when it purchased Grand Auto, a [[California]] based retailer of auto parts and accessories. In October 1999, PACCAR Automotive was sold to CSK Auto.\n\nPACCAR solidified its place in the Mexican heavy-duty truck market by purchasing the remaining portion of its Mexican operation, VILPAC, S.A. in 1995.\n\nThe acquisition of [[DAF Trucks]] in 1996 and [[Leyland Trucks]] in 1998 established PACCAR as one of the major truck manufacturers in the world.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/10th-october-1996/6/paccar-set-to-take-over-daf-trucks Paccar set to rake over Daf Trucks] ''Commercial Motor'' October 10, 1996</ref><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/7th-may-1998/26/paccar-aims-to-cut-queue-by-charles-young-paccars Paccar aims to cut queue] ''Commercial Motor'' May 7, 1998</ref><ref>[http://europe.autonews.com/article/19980511/ANE/805110836/paccar-acquires-leyland-trucks Paccar acquires Leyland Trucks] ''Automotive News Europe'' May 11, 1998</ref> DAF Trucks is a Netherlands-based truck company with production facilities in [[Eindhoven]], The Netherlands and [[Westerlo]], Belgium.

Co. to produce railway and logging equipment at its plant in West Seattle. In February 1908, the Seattle Car Manufacturing Co. opened a modern railcar manufacturing plant in Renton. The destruction of Seattle Car's Youngstown plant by fire, coupled with the repercussions of the national financial panic of 1907, had placed the company in voluntary receivership. The new plant gave the business new momentum and company president William Pigott (1860-1929) and in particular the company vice president Oliver D. Colvin successfully shepherded the company through this difficult period. The company later with Twohy Brothers of Portland in 1915 to become '''Pacific Car and Foundry Company''', a name it retained for the next 55 years. In 1924, William Pigott sold control of the company to [[American Car & Foundry]] Company.\n\nPaul Pigott, son of the founder, acquired a major interest in the company from American Car in 1934. Under his leadership, the company expanded its products and introduced the Carco line of power winches for use on crawler tractors in the logging industry. This product line later became the basis for PACCAR Winch, located in [[Oklahoma]], which now includes Braden, Carco and Gearmatic.\n\nThe company entered the heavy-duty truck market in 1945 with its first major acquisition, [[Kenworth|Kenworth Motor Truck Company]] of [[Seattle]]. Pacific Car and Foundry greatly expanded its heavy-duty truck capability with the purchase of [[Peterbilt|Peterbilt Motors Company]] in 1958. That same year, the acquisition of Dart Truck Company permitted its entry into the entirely new market of mining vehicles.\n\nThe company's Structural Steel division fabricated the steel for the construction of the Space Needle for the [[Century 21 Exposition|1962 Seattle World Fair]]. Later, it played a major part in the construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]'s third powerhouse as well as the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York]].\n\nIn 1960, Kenworth expanded into Mexico, with 49 percent participation in an affiliate company, Kenworth Mexicana S.A. de C.V. In 1966 PACCAR entered the Australian truck market with the establishment of a Kenworth truck assembly plant near [[Melbourne]].\n\nAlso in 1960, Carco Acceptance Corporation, currently PACCAR Financial Corp, was launched to facilitate domestic sales of trucks.\n\nIn 1968 the Dynacraft division was formed to provide belts, hoses, adapters, and other accessories for Kenworth and Peterbilt truck plants. \n\nKenworth Australia purchased 28&nbsp;acres (11&nbsp;ha) of land at suburban [[Bayswater, Victoria|Bayswater]] \u2013 18&nbsp;miles (30&nbsp;km) east of Melbourne, in 1969, to build a factory and office complex. By the end of 1970, the 56,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (5,200&nbsp;m\u00b2) complex was completed. Initially, trucks were produced on a [[Knock-down kit|completely knocked down]] basis. During Kenworth Australia's subsequent history, it become a major force in the local, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea markets.\n\nBelieving \"Pacific Car and Foundry Company\" no longer accurately reflected the company's products and activities, directors and shareholders voted to adopt PACCAR Inc as its new name in 1972.\n\nIn 1972, PACCAR International was formed in [[Bellevue, Washington]] to consolidate the sales and service of company products abroad. PACCAR Parts was established in [[Renton, Washington|Renton]] a year later to supply aftermarket parts.\n\nIn 1975 PACCAR purchased International Car Company of [[Kenton, Ohio]], North America's leading [[caboose]] manufacturer.\n\nPACCAR Leasing Corporation was formed in 1980 to offer full-service leasing and rental programs through PACCAR's dealer network. A year later, PACCAR became a European truck manufacturer with the acquisition of [[Foden Trucks]] in England.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/27th-september-1980/5/saviour-for-fodens Saviour for Fodens] ''[[Commercial Motor]]'' September 27, 1980 page 5</ref><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/18th-october-1980/5/fodens-takeover-1600-jobs-lost Fodens takeover: 1,600 jobs lost] ''Commercial Motor'' October 18, 1980 page 5</ref>\n\nPACCAR's new Technical Center opened in July 1982. Located approximately 65 miles north of Seattle, the multimillion-dollar center underscored the company's commitment to technical excellence, quality and value in the products it manufactures.\n\nIn 1986, PACCAR acquired Trico Industries, manufacturing oil field pumps and accessories. In December 1997 Trico was sold to EVI of [[Houston]].\n\nIn 1987, PACCAR acquired Washington-based Al's Auto Supply, an aftermarket retailer and wholesale distributor of auto parts and accessories. In 1988, PACCAR expanded its subsidiary PACCAR Automotive. when it purchased Grand Auto, a [[California]] based retailer of auto parts and accessories. In October 1999, PACCAR Automotive was sold to CSK Auto.\n\nPACCAR solidified its place in the Mexican heavy-duty truck market by purchasing the remaining portion of its Mexican operation, VILPAC, S.A. in 1995.\n\nThe acquisition of [[DAF Trucks]] in 1996 and [[Leyland Trucks]] in 1998 established PACCAR as one of the major truck manufacturers in the world.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/10th-october-1996/6/paccar-set-to-take-over-daf-trucks Paccar set to rake over Daf Trucks] ''Commercial Motor'' October 10, 1996</ref><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/7th-may-1998/26/paccar-aims-to-cut-queue-by-charles-young-paccars Paccar aims to cut queue] ''Commercial Motor'' May 7, 1998</ref><ref>[http://europe.autonews.com/article/19980511/ANE/805110836/paccar-acquires-leyland-trucks Paccar acquires Leyland Trucks] ''Automotive News Europe'' May 11, 1998</ref> DAF Trucks is a Netherlands-based truck company with production facilities in [[Eindhoven]], The Netherlands and [[Westerlo]], Belgium.

PACCAR invested $400 million in the PACCAR Engine factory and technology center in Columbus, Mississippi, to manufacture the proprietary engines.\n\nIn 2013, PACCAR expanded its global operations with the opening of a new DAF factory in [[Ponta Grossa]], Brasil.

[[Juguang, Lienchiang]] and [[Dongyin, Lienchiang]] are a little more than ninety miles from the closest point. The main islands Greater Kinmen (Quemoy) and [[Nangan, Lienchiang|Nangan]] (Matsu) are over one hundred miles from Taiwan Island.}} from Formosa. We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it is attacked. We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa, but it is extremely difficult to make that judgment.<br/>Now, Mr. [[Christian Herter|Herter]], in 1958, when he was [[United States Under Secretary of State|Under Secretary of State]], said they were strategically indefensible. Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance|Spruance]] and [[J. Lawton Collins|Collins]] in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands in their conference on the Far East. General [[Matthew Ridgway|Ridgway]] has said the same thing. I believe that when you get into a war, if you're going to get into a war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked. I believe that we should defend Formosa, we should come to its defense. It leaves this rather in the air that we will defend it under some conditions but not under others, I think it is a mistake.<br/>Secondly, I would not suggest a withdrawal at the point of the Communist guns. It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the Island of Formosa. It leaves 100 miles{{efn|The island of Taiwan is separated from the southeast coast of [[China]] by the [[Taiwan Strait]], which ranges from {{convert|220|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} at its widest point to {{convert|130|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} at its narrowest.}} between the sea. But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it is unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.<br/>I think that we should protect our commitments. I believe strongly we should do so in [[West Berlin|Berlin]]. I believe strongly we should do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed. But I do not believe that that line, in case of a war, should be drawn on those islands, but instead on the island of Formosa. And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it has been my judgement ever since 1954, at the time of the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]] for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.}}\n\nThen-Vice President Nixon retorted:\n{{quotation|I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.<br/>I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well. Generals testified to that, and Secretary [[Dean Acheson|Acheson]] made a very famous speech at the [[National Press Club (United States)|Press Club]] early in the year that the Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States. I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war, but it didn't mean that. We had to go in when they came in.<br/>Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate- they are unimportant. It isn't the few people who live on them- they are not too important. It's the principle involved. These two islands are in the area of freedom. The Nationalists have these two islands. We should not force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists. If we do that, we start a chain reaction, because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're after Formosa. In my opinion, this is the same kind of woolly thinking that lead to disaster for America in Korea, I'm against it, I would never tolerate it as President of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.}}\n[[File:Commemorative NT$10 Coin in Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of Taiwan's Retrocession.png|thumb|Kinmen in the map on the obverse of the Commemorative NT$10 Coin in Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of Taiwan's Retrocession (1995)]]\nAfter the third debate on October 13, 1960, Kennedy's advisers spoke with then Secretary of State Herter and said Kennedy was willing to revise his position on the Quemoy and Matsu issue so as not to give the Communists the impression that the USA would not stand united against aggression.

Shortly after the third debate I learned that one of Kennedy's top foreign policy advisers had telephoned Secretary of State Herter to say that Kennedy did not want to give the Communists the impression that America would not stand united against aggression and was therefore prepared to revise his position in order not to appear to oppose the administration on this issue. I saw this as Kennedy's way of trying to slide away from an unpopular position, and my immediate inclination was not to let him get away with it. But the Quemoy-Matsu situation was so tense, and the importance of America's role in discouraging Communist aggression was so great, that I decided not to press the point if Kennedy modified his stand. I pointed out how his changed attitude reflected his lack of experience, and then let the issue drop.}}</ref> Nixon's polls among Republicans and Democrats showed overwhelming support for Nixon's position on the issue.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/jfkmanmyth00lask|page=[https://archive.org/details/jfkmanmyth00lask/page/444 444]|date=1963|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Macmillan Company]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|author=[[Victor Lasky]]|title=J.F.K. : the man and the myth|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nKinmen was originally a military reserve, which eventually led to the [[1987 Lieyu massacre]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mypaper.pchome.com.tw/kuan0416/post/1304293327 |script-title=zh:\u300a\u570b\u8ecd\u5c60\u6bba\u8d8a\u5357\u96e3\u6c11\u7684\u4e09\u4e03\u4e8b\u4ef6\u300b\u4f60\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u53f0\u7063 |website=pchome.com.tw |date=2008-03-07 |access-date=2015-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908002445/http://mypaper.pchome.com.tw/kuan0416/post/1304293327 |archive-date=2015-09-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> The island was returned to the civilian government in the mid-1990s, after which travel to and from it was allowed.

Residents of the island have broadly opposed such measures, fearing the consequences of the PRC government's policies on their standard of living and political freedom.\n\nThe [[Democratic Progressive Party]] has a minor presence on the island and typically does not present candidates to stand in local elections, although it does hold a single seat in [[Kinmen County Council]] from both of the [[2009 Taiwanese local elections|2009]] and [[2014 Taiwanese local elections|2014 local elections]]. However, the party occasionally lends support to liberal or center-left candidates.\n\nOn 29 November 2014 however, independent candidate [[Chen Fu-hai]] won the [[2014 Taiwanese local elections|county magistrate election]] and took office as the [[List of county magistrates of Kinmen|Magistrate of Kinmen County]] on 25 December 2014, the first independent candidate to win the office.

Therefore, Kinmen often overuses its groundwater, causing rising tidal flood and [[soil salinity]].\n \nIn early September 2013, the  [[People's Republic of China]] government agreed to supply Kinmen with water from [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang City]] in [[Fujian]] due to the ongoing [[water shortage]] problem in Kinmen. Kinmen draws more than 8,000 tonnes of [[groundwater]] every day and water from its reservoir is barely enough to support the residents during the dry season. The shortage problem will heavily hit the local economy by 2016 if no mitigation plan is enacted.

In the past, due to constant [[artillery]] shelling from the Chinese mainland, an underground port was used to supply the island in times of conflict at the [[Jhaishan Tunnel]]s on the South-Western tip of the island but this has been decommissioned and turned into a tourist attraction.\n\nGreatly used as a transit route between the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan Island, buses also connect to the ferry terminal to allow for quick transfer to the [[Xiamen]].\n\n===Road===\nA {{convert|5.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} bridge, [[Kinmen Bridge]], connecting Kinmen Island (Greater Kinmen) and [[Lieyu, Kinmen|Lieyu]] is planned to be completed by 2020, estimated to cost NT$7.5 billion (US$250 million).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201101090019|title=Construction of Kinmen Bridge begins|publisher=Focus Taiwan News Channel|date=2011-01-09|accessdate=2011-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928120403/http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201101090019|archive-date=2011-09-28|url-status=live}}</ref> It is expected to increase local tourism; the bridge's {{convert|1.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} main body will have the largest span in the world when completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kinmen.gov.tw/Layout/sub_F/News_NewsContent.aspx?NewsID=103862&frame=86&LanguageType=2 |title=Construction for Kinmen Bridge Begins and President Ma Hopes It Becomes a New Landmark for Kinmen |publisher=Kinmen.gov.tw |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621122142/http://www.kinmen.gov.tw/Layout/sub_F/News_NewsContent.aspx?NewsID=103862&frame=86&LanguageType=2 |archive-date=2015-06-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, Mainland China announced a plan to build a bridge linking [[Xiamen]] to Kinmen.

Senator Kennedy stated that these islands - as little as 9 kilometres (5.5&nbsp;mi) off the coast of China and as much as 170 kilometres (106&nbsp;mi) from Taiwan - were strategically indefensible and were not essential to the defense of Taiwan.

I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa. These islands are a few miles, five or six miles{{efn|The northern coast of Greater Kinmen (Quemoy) is about five or six miles from the nearest point on mainland Asia in places. In the Matsu Islands, [[Gaodeng Island]] is 5.75 miles from the Beijiao Peninsula. Some ROC-controlled areas are closer than five miles from PRC-controlled areas. For instance, Jiaoyu in [[Dadeng Subdistrict]] is a little more than one mile from the tip of Greater Kinmen in [[Jinsha, Kinmen|Jinsha Township]].}} off the coast of Red China within a general harbor area, and more than a hundred miles{{efn|[[Wuqiu, Kinmen]] is about eighty miles from the closest point on the main island of Taiwan (Formosa). [[Juguang, Lienchiang]] and [[Dongyin, Lienchiang]] are a little more than ninety miles from the closest point. The main islands Greater Kinmen (Quemoy) and [[Nangan, Lienchiang|Nangan]] (Matsu) are over one hundred miles from Taiwan Island.}} from Formosa. We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it is attacked. We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa, but it is extremely difficult to make that judgment.<br/>Now, Mr. [[Christian Herter|Herter]], in 1958, when he was [[United States Under Secretary of State|Under Secretary of State]], said they were strategically indefensible. Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance|Spruance]] and [[J. Lawton Collins|Collins]] in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands in their conference on the Far East. General [[Matthew Ridgway|Ridgway]] has said the same thing. I believe that when you get into a war, if you're going to get into a war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked. I believe that we should defend Formosa, we should come to its defense. It leaves this rather in the air that we will defend it under some conditions but not under others, I think it is a mistake.<br/>Secondly, I would not suggest a withdrawal at the point of the Communist guns. It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the Island of Formosa. It leaves 100 miles{{efn|The island of Taiwan is separated from the southeast coast of [[China]] by the [[Taiwan Strait]], which ranges from {{convert|220|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} at its widest point to {{convert|130|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} at its narrowest.}} between the sea. But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it is unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.<br/>I think that we should protect our commitments. I believe strongly we should do so in [[West Berlin|Berlin]]. I believe strongly we should do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed. But I do not believe that that line, in case of a war, should be drawn on those islands, but instead on the island of Formosa. And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it has been my judgement ever since 1954, at the time of the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]] for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.}}\n\nThen-Vice President Nixon retorted:\n{{quotation|I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.<br/>I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well. Generals testified to that, and Secretary [[Dean Acheson|Acheson]] made a very famous speech at the [[National Press Club (United States)|Press Club]] early in the year that the Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States. I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war, but it didn't mean that. We had to go in when they came in.<br/>Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate- they are unimportant. It isn't the few people who live on them- they are not too important. It's the principle involved. These two islands are in the area of freedom. The Nationalists have these two islands. We should not force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists. If we do that, we start a chain reaction, because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're after Formosa. In my opinion, this is the same kind of woolly thinking that lead to disaster for America in Korea, I'm against it, I would never tolerate it as President of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.}}\n[[File:Commemorative NT$10 Coin in Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of Taiwan's Retrocession.png|thumb|Kinmen in the map on the obverse of the Commemorative NT$10 Coin in Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of Taiwan's Retrocession (1995)]]\nAfter the third debate on October 13, 1960, Kennedy's advisers spoke with then Secretary of State Herter and said Kennedy was willing to revise his position on the Quemoy and Matsu issue so as not to give the Communists the impression that the USA would not stand united against aggression. Nixon pointed out the change in Kennedy's position but decided not to press the point due to the importance of the USA's role in what was an extremely tense situation.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsofrichard00nixo|page=[https://archive.org/details/memoirsofrichard00nixo/page/272 272]|publisher=Simon & Schuster|ISBN=0-446-93259-0|title=RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon|author=[[Richard Nixon]]|date=1978|via=[[Internet Archive]]|url-access=registration|quote=Once again I hit hard on the Quemoy-Matsu issue, stating that Kennedy's willingness to surrender the islands to the Communists under threat of war was no different from submitting to blackmail. Shortly after the third debate I learned that one of Kennedy's top foreign policy advisers had telephoned Secretary of State Herter to say that Kennedy did not want to give the Communists the impression that America would not stand united against aggression and was therefore prepared to revise his position in order not to appear to oppose the administration on this issue. I saw this as Kennedy's way of trying to slide away from an unpopular position, and my immediate inclination was not to let him get away with it. But the Quemoy-Matsu situation was so tense, and the importance of America's role in discouraging Communist aggression was so great, that I decided not to press the point if Kennedy modified his stand. I pointed out how his changed attitude reflected his lack of experience, and then let the issue drop.}}</ref> Nixon's polls among Republicans and Democrats showed overwhelming support for Nixon's position on the issue.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/jfkmanmyth00lask|page=[https://archive.org/details/jfkmanmyth00lask/page/444 444]|date=1963|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Macmillan Company]]|location=[[New York]]|author=[[Victor Lasky]]|title=J.F.K. : the man and the myth|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nKinmen was originally a military reserve, which eventually led to the [[1987 Lieyu massacre]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mypaper.pchome.com.tw/kuan0416/post/1304293327 |script-title=zh:\u300a\u570b\u8ecd\u5c60\u6bba\u8d8a\u5357\u96e3\u6c11\u7684\u4e09\u4e03\u4e8b\u4ef6\u300b\u4f60\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u53f0\u7063 |website=pchome.com.tw |date=2008-03-07 |access-date=2015-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908002445/http://mypaper.pchome.com.tw/kuan0416/post/1304293327 |archive-date=2015-09-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> The island was returned to the civilian government in the mid-1990s, after which travel to and from it was allowed.

The residents of Wuchiu Township speak [[Pu-Xian Min]], as opposed to Hokkien for the rest of Kinmen.\n\n===Others===\nKinmen is notable for a number of cultural products. Due to the extensive shelling by the [[People's Liberation Army]] in the 1950s, Kinmen is famous for its [[Kinmen knife|artillery shell knives]]. Local artisans would collect the vast amounts of exploded ordnance and make high-quality knives which are still sought after by chefs and connoisseurs.  Kinmen is also home of the regionally famous [[Kinmen Kaoliang]] liquor, a spirit ranging between 38 and 63 percent alcohol, which is highly appreciated by the Taiwanese.

Traditional industries are also being kept and improved, ranging from agriculture, fishery and livestock. It has a good fishery industry also due to its nature being surrounded by unpolluted sea.\n\nKinmen also produces its unique [[Kinmen knife]], in which the raw material used to produce it is taken from the remaining of shells fired by the [[People's Liberation Army]] in 1958-1978. The knife was made as gift to the visiting Head of [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] [[Zhang Zhijun]] to Kinmen on 23\u201324 May 2015 to symbolize mutual peace between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and to bury the hatchet left from [[Chinese Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.investkinmen.com/eng/about/main.php?mainId=1&proId=2 |title=Invest in Kinmen |publisher=Investkinmen.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518135205/http://www.investkinmen.com/eng/about/main.php?mainId=1&proId=2 |archive-date=2014-05-18 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/acs/201505240010.aspx|title=Kinmen knives symbolize cross-strait peace: Chinese official|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104921/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/acs/201505240010.aspx|archive-date=13 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Imported goods===\nKinmen often import more goods from Mainland China than Taiwan Island because of lower costs due to the proximity of the county to the mainland despite lower quality.

Until the early 1990s, proponents of [[Taiwan independence]] argued that they would consider handing Kinmen over to the PRC in any negotiated settlement. Residents of the island have broadly opposed such measures, fearing the consequences of the PRC government's policies on their standard of living and political freedom.\n\nThe [[Democratic Progressive Party]] has a minor presence on the island and typically does not present candidates to stand in local elections, although it does hold a single seat in [[Kinmen County Council]] from both of the [[2009 Taiwanese local elections|2009]] and [[2014 Taiwanese local elections|2014 local elections]].

Since 1992, the ROC central government approved the power company to authorize [[Taiwan Power Company]] (Taipower) for five-year management.

In extreme drought condition, water shipment from Taiwan Island may cost as much as NT$200 per tonne.

Therefore, Kinmen often overuses its groundwater, causing rising tidal flood and [[soil salinity]].\n \nIn early September 2013, the  [[People's Republic of China]] government agreed to supply Kinmen with water from [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang City]] in [[Fujian]] due to the ongoing [[water shortage]] problem in Kinmen. Kinmen draws more than 8,000 tonnes of [[groundwater]] every day and water from its reservoir is barely enough to support the residents during the dry season. The shortage problem will heavily hit the local economy by 2016 if no mitigation plan is enacted.

In the past, due to constant [[artillery]] shelling from the Chinese mainland, an underground port was used to supply the island in times of conflict at the [[Jhaishan Tunnel]]s on the South-Western tip of the island but this has been decommissioned and turned into a tourist attraction.\n\nGreatly used as a transit route between the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan Island, buses also connect to the ferry terminal to allow for quick transfer to the [[Xiamen]].\n\n===Road===\nA {{convert|5.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} bridge, [[Kinmen Bridge]], connecting Kinmen Island (Greater Kinmen) and [[Lieyu, Kinmen|Lieyu]] is planned to be completed by 2020, estimated to cost NT$7.5 billion (US$250 million).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201101090019|title=Construction of Kinmen Bridge begins|publisher=Focus Taiwan News Channel|date=2011-01-09|accessdate=2011-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928120403/http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201101090019|archive-date=2011-09-28|url-status=live}}</ref> It is expected to increase local tourism; the bridge's {{convert|1.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} main body will have the largest span in the world when completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kinmen.gov.tw/Layout/sub_F/News_NewsContent.aspx?NewsID=103862&frame=86&LanguageType=2 |title=Construction for Kinmen Bridge Begins and President Ma Hopes It Becomes a New Landmark for Kinmen |publisher=Kinmen.gov.tw |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621122142/http://www.kinmen.gov.tw/Layout/sub_F/News_NewsContent.aspx?NewsID=103862&frame=86&LanguageType=2 |archive-date=2015-06-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, Mainland China announced a plan to build a bridge linking [[Xiamen]] to Kinmen.

It was founded in 1917 by [[Maria Dickin]] to provide care for sick and injured animals of the poor. It is the UK's leading veterinary charity, carrying out more than one million free veterinary consultations a year, and  was up to 2009 the largest private employer of fully qualified [[veterinary surgeon]]s and [[Paraveterinary workers|veterinary nurse]]s in the UK, only those living within the PDSA's catchment areas can use their services.\n\n== Foundation and development ==\n\nDuring [[World War I]], animal welfare pioneer Maria Dickin worked to improve the dreadful state of animal health in the [[Whitechapel]] area of [[London]]. She wanted to open a clinic where [[East End]]ers living in poverty could receive free treatment for their sick and injured animals.   Despite widespread scepticism, she opened her free \"dispensary\" in a Whitechapel basement on Saturday 17 November 1917. It was an immediate success and she was soon forced to find larger premises.\n\nWithin six years, Maria Dickin had designed and equipped her first horse-drawn clinic, and soon a fleet of mobile dispensaries was established. PDSA vehicles soon became a common sight throughout the country. Eventually, PDSA's role was defined by two [[Acts of Parliament]], in 1949 and 1956, that continue to govern its activities today.\n\n== PDSA Dickin Medal ==\n\n[[Maria Dickin]] instituted the [[Dickin Medal]] in 1943 to acknowledge outstanding acts of bravery by animals serving with the Armed Forces or Civil Defence units.  It has become recognised as the animals' [[Victoria Cross]], and is administered by PDSA.  The PDSA created a second animal bravery award, the [[PDSA Gold Medal]], in 2002, which is now recognised as the animal equivalent of the [[George Cross]].\n\n== Eligibility requirements ==\n\nToday, treatment is only available to the pets of those in receipt of [[Housing Benefit]] or [[Council Tax#Council Tax Benefit|Council Tax Benefit]] and who live in one of the charity's 'catchment areas'.  For those eligible, treatment for sick and injured animals is free of charge. Recently, the PDSA started providing eligible pet owners with preventive services such as [[neutering]], [[vaccinations]] and [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchipping]].  These services are the only treatments that are '''not''' free; however, they are offered at cost price.\n\nAlthough there is no cost for all treatments except for those of a preventive nature, PDSA asks clients to make a donation of whatever they can afford towards the treatment of their animal.\n\nCurrently, PDSA is able to offer its services to 75% of eligible people, and has plans to increase this to 80% over the coming year.<ref name=Stat1>{{cite web | url=http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts%5CEnds17%5C0000208217_ac_20051231_e_c.pdf |format=PDF| title = Annual Report, 2005 | publisher= PDSA | accessdate=2007-04-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2009 the PDSA began requesting a donation on checking the animal in for treatment.\n\n== Areas of operation ==\n\n[[File:Mothers, Erdington, Birmingham, England - 2019-04-27 - Andy Mabbett - 17 (cropped).jpg|thumb| A PDSA [[charity shop]] in Birmingham, England, seen in April 2019]]\n\nPDSA operates throughout [[Great Britain]] through animal hospitals and practices; a vast network of [[charity shop]]s support the organisation.  It has one animal hospital in [[Northern Ireland]], the catchment area of which covers much of the area East of the [[River Bann|Bann]].  Although further hospitals are not currently planned for that region, some services through private clinics may be offered, and a charity shop is due to open in March 2007 in [[Lisburn]].  The charity's Head Office is based in [[Telford]], [[Shropshire]].\n\nIn 1937, a branch of the PDSA was founded in [[District Six]], [[South Africa]], which at the time was a poverty-stricken area of [[Cape Town]].

It was founded in 1917 by [[Maria Dickin]] to provide care for sick and injured animals of the poor. It is the UK's leading veterinary charity, carrying out more than one million free veterinary consultations a year, and  was up to 2009 the largest private employer of fully qualified [[veterinary surgeon]]s and [[Paraveterinary workers|veterinary nurse]]s in the UK, only those living within the PDSA's catchment areas can use their services.\n\n== Foundation and development ==\n\nDuring [[World War I]], animal welfare pioneer Maria Dickin worked to improve the dreadful state of animal health in the [[Whitechapel]] area of [[London]]. She wanted to open a clinic where [[East End]]ers living in poverty could receive free treatment for their sick and injured animals.   Despite widespread scepticism, she opened her free \"dispensary\" in a Whitechapel basement on Saturday 17 November 1917. It was an immediate success and she was soon forced to find larger premises.\n\nWithin six years, Maria Dickin had designed and equipped her first horse-drawn clinic, and soon a fleet of mobile dispensaries was established. PDSA vehicles soon became a common sight throughout the country. Eventually, PDSA's role was defined by two [[Acts of Parliament]], in 1949 and 1956, that continue to govern its activities today.\n\n== PDSA Dickin Medal ==\n\n[[Maria Dickin]] instituted the [[Dickin Medal]] in 1943 to acknowledge outstanding acts of bravery by animals serving with the Armed Forces or Civil Defence units.  It has become recognised as the animals' [[Victoria Cross]], and is administered by PDSA.  The PDSA created a second animal bravery award, the [[PDSA Gold Medal]], in 2002, which is now recognised as the animal equivalent of the [[George Cross]].\n\n== Eligibility requirements ==\n\nToday, treatment is only available to the pets of those in receipt of [[Housing Benefit]] or [[Council Tax#Council Tax Benefit|Council Tax Benefit]] and who live in one of the charity's 'catchment areas'.  For those eligible, treatment for sick and injured animals is free of charge. Recently, the PDSA started providing eligible pet owners with preventive services such as [[neutering]], [[vaccinations]] and [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchipping]].  These services are the only treatments that are '''not''' free; however, they are offered at cost price.\n\nAlthough there is no cost for all treatments except for those of a preventive nature, PDSA asks clients to make a donation of whatever they can afford towards the treatment of their animal.\n\nCurrently, PDSA is able to offer its services to 75% of eligible people, and has plans to increase this to 80% over the coming year.<ref name=Stat1>{{cite web | url=http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts%5CEnds17%5C0000208217_ac_20051231_e_c.pdf |format=PDF| title = Annual Report, 2005 | publisher= PDSA | accessdate=2007-04-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2009 the PDSA began requesting a donation on checking the animal in for treatment.\n\n== Areas of operation ==\n\n[[File:Mothers, Erdington, Birmingham, England - 2019-04-27 - Andy Mabbett - 17 (cropped).jpg|thumb| A PDSA [[charity shop]] in Birmingham, England, seen in April 2019]]\n\nPDSA operates throughout [[Great Britain]] through animal hospitals and practices; a vast network of [[charity shop]]s support the organisation.  It has one animal hospital in [[Northern Ireland]], the catchment area of which covers much of the area East of the [[River Bann|Bann]].  Although further hospitals are not currently planned for that region, some services through private clinics may be offered, and a charity shop is due to open in March 2007 in [[Lisburn]].  The charity's Head Office is based in [[Telford]], [[Shropshire]].\n\nIn 1937, a branch of the PDSA was founded in [[District Six]], [[South Africa]], which at the time was a poverty-stricken area of [[Cape Town]]. In 1988, the organization became autonomous but maintains a strong link with the mother society in the United Kingdom and a great deal of information is exchanged between them.<ref>[http://www.pdsa.org.za PDSA South Africa]</ref>\n\nIn October 1938 the PDSA held a Twenty-First Birthday Dinner at the Holborn Restaurant in London, attended by Mrs Dickin.
