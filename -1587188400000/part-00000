However, another matchup between DePauw and Purdue had also been scheduled in the city for the same day and time, which angered all 4 parties, considering the attendance and profit for both games would essentially be split in half.  Purdue argued that IIAA rules mandated they play the Thanksgiving Day game against DePauw as they were the two best teams in the league<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322164309/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football&match=18|title=20 Nov 1894, 2 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>, while Butler and the ILA argued that there was no rule specifying that another matchup could not be played by another member of the IIAA on the same day as the league championship<ref name=\"auto1\"/>.  With neither party willing to back down, the two games went on despite the financial losses.  The ILA's game against Butler would be played at 2:30 in the afternoon at the baseball park, with reserved room coming at 50 cents a seat. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322167802/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=27 Nov 1894, 5 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>.  The Indianapolis Light Artillery would lose a close contest to the Bulldogs, 4\u20136, in their final game of the season.  In early 1896, after more heating argument in the IIAA's president's meeting over whether or not to allow Athletic Clubs on the schedule any longer, Purdue backed out of the league, which led to its subsequent dissolution before the 1896 season.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 19\n| time = 2pm\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = Chicago AC<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n| site_stadium = Indianapolis Baseball Park<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322141533/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=19 Oct 1895, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n| site_cityst = [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis, IN]]\n| score = 0-16\n| attend = >400\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 24\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Indiana Hoosiers football team|Indiana]]<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n| site_stadium = Jordan Field\n| site_cityst = [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington, IN]]\n| score = 16-8\n| attend = ~500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 2\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Noblesville AC<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = Indianapolis, IN\n| score = 22-4\n| attend =\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 17\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Louisville AC<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]]\n| score = 20-12\n| attend = ~800\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 22\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Notre Dame football team|Notre Dame]]<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n| site_stadium = Cartier Field\n| site_cityst = [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend, IN]]\n| score = 18-0\n| attend =\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 23\n| time =\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = Chicago AC<ref name=\"auto5\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago, IL]]\n| score = 0-4\n| attend = ~500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 28\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[Butler Bulldogs football|Butler]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322132717/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=1 Oct 1895, 8 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/322144488/?</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322160527/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=27 Nov 1895, 6 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n| site_stadium = East Ohio-Street grounds\n| site_cityst = Indianapolis, IN\n| score = 28-0\n| attend = 2000-3000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Post season==\n\nWilliam (Winchester) Osgood would not coach the Light Artillery again, as he would join the [[Cuban War of Independence]] (1895-98, also a part of the greater [[Spanish American War]]), and reportedly died in March 1896<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322002792/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=18 Mar 1896, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>.

Chicago AC was considered, according to the Indianapolis Journal, one of the best teams of the west (more specifically Midwest) besides Michigan University.  The contest was 50 minutes long, with two 25 minute halves.  Chicago AC (Also known as Chicago Athletic Association, or C.A.A) scored all of there 16 points against the Light Artillerymen in the first half.  Not more than 400 people were said to have braved the icy cold wind to spectate the contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322142438/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=20 Oct 1895, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\n===October 24- Indiana===\n\nOn October 23rd the Indianapolis Light Artillery football team set out for Bloomington for there first collegiate contest of the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322143756/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=23 Oct 1895, 8 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  Coming into the game, Indiana was 2\u20130, having won easy contests against the Louisville and Noblesville Athletic clubs, by scores of 36-0 and 30-0 respectively (two teams the Light Artillery would beat later in the season).  The weather was cool and cloudy.  The game was an hour long, with 60 minute halves.  The halftime score was 10\u20134, and the final was 16\u20138.  One of the touchdowns scored for Indiana was by player-coach William Osgood<ref name=\"auto\"/>, who would go on to assist the Light Artillery in the remainder of their football season<ref name=\"auto7\"/>, presumably when Robert Wrenn was hired as the new head coach for Indiana.  Indiana would finish with a casual 4-3-1, although they did manage to secure their first intercollegiate win since the program was established in 1887 by beating Rose Polytechnic 8\u20134.<ref>https://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/active/i/indiana/1895-1899_yearly_results.php</ref>\n\n===November 1st- Knightstown Club===\n\nThis unofficial matchup was played between a handful of players from Butler and Indianapolis Light Artillery against the Knightstown Club on the first day of November.  Heralded as the most exciting and interesting game of football seen in  Indianapolis for the 1895 season, 1500 spectators showed up for the exhibition.  Knightstown scored first, going up 6\u20130, before they were tied 6-6 right before the half.  The club would ultimately prevail though, beating the mix of college and semi-professional football players 12\u20136.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 2nd- Noblesville AC===\n\nThe game was played in Indianapolis, in the same ball park as the one against Chicago AC.  Noblesville came in with at least one loss to Indiana, and that is all that is known about the rather obscure program.  Surrounded by an apparently riotous crowd, the Indianapolis Light Artillery eleven met the Athletic Club's eleven on the afternoon of November 2nd.  by halftime, the score was a tight 6\u20134 in favor of the Artillerymen, but the military team blew away the athletic club in the 2nd half, securing their 3rd official victory, 22\u20134.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 17th- Louisville AC===\n\nA good matchup between the ILA and the Louisville AC was played in Louisville in front of a sizeable crowd of 800 on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The contest was 70 minutes long, with two 35 minute halves.  The Artillery men scored early points in the first half to go up 10\u20130, before Louisville rallied with two field goals to usurp the military team, 12\u201310 at the half in favor of the AC.  This was the first time since Chicago AC that the Light Artillery had faced a halftime deficit.  The military team came out of the 2nd half with 10 unanswered points by left halfback Thompson and kicker Scott to win 20\u201312.  <ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n===November 22nd- Notre Dame===\n\nIn a minor upset, The Indianapolis Light Artillery beat Notre Dame college 18\u20130, on their own Cartier Field in South Bend.  This game is famous because of HG Haddon, coach of the 1895 Notre Dame football team, who inserted himself into the line-up as a left tackle, gaining considerable ground on the semi-professionals before the end of the game through a returned kickoff, recovering a fumble, and a number of other carries.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nyg3NJ4VVuAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title = Fighting Irish: Legends, Lists, and Lore|isbn = 9781582617527|last1 = Heisler|first1 = Karen Croake|year = 2006}}</ref>  Immediately after the game, the ILA left for Chicago for a rematch with the Chicago Athletic Association's football team.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===November 23rd- Chicago AC===\n\nIn the 2nd contest between the two teams, Chicago AC won by a narrow margin of 4 to 0.  The day was cold and icy, with only 500 spectators coming to watch the event in Chicago.  The game was 40 minutes long, with two 20 minute halves.  After a scoreless half, Chicago scored a controversial touchdown that awarded them the 4 points they needed to win.  The Light Artillery blamed the Linesman for bad officiating and bias towards the Chicago team, as one of the Linesman was a brother of a Chicago AC player.  <ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Thanksgiving Day Game- Butler===\n\nThe Indianapolis Light Artillery destroyed Butler to close out the 1895 season at the East Ohio-Street grounds in Indianapolis.  The game was over from the start, with the Butler players apparently unable to move the ball without penalties, and a 22-0 ILA lead by the half.  The game was 70 minutes long, with two 35 minute halves.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/1894-schedule.html |title = 1894 Schedule and Results}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [[1895 Notre Dame football team]]\n* [[1895 Indiana Hoosiers football team]]\n[[:Category:1895 college football season]]\n[[:Category: Indianapolis Light Artillery football seasons]]\n[[:Category:1895 in sports in Indiana|1895 in sports in Indiana]]\n\n== I cited all of my sources. ==\n\n{{AFC submission|||ts=20200408131130|u=Murphanian777|ns=118}}\n", "text_old": "{{AFC submission|d|v|u=Murphanian777|ns=118|decliner=Sulfurboy|declinets=20200406201027|ts=20200406200457}} <!-- Do not remove this line! -->\n{{short description|American military football team}}\n{{Infobox NCAA team season\n| year = 1895\n| team = Indianapolis Light Artillery\n| sport = football\n| image = \n| image_size = \n| conference = Independent\n| record = 5-2\n| head_coach = [[Winchester Osgood]]\n| gm = [[Robert Navin]]\n| hc_year = 1st\n| stadium = \n| captain = Harold Joss (Right Tackle)\n}}\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe '''1895 Indianapolis Light Artillery football team''' was an [[American football]] team that represented the [[Indianapolis Light Artillery]] in the [[1895 college football season]].<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/search/|title=Newspapers.com search|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  The team compiled a 5\u20132 record and outscored its opponents, 108 to 46.

The contest with Butler was also, according to a November 29th article in the Indianapolis Journal, a \"best two out of three\" event, as in the prior 1894 season, the two teams had played one another twice, with Indianapolis Light Artillery winning the first and Butler winning the second, 6\u20134 on Thanksgiving Day.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n==Previous Season==\n\nThe ''Indianapolis Light Artillery football team'' of 1894 was born out of a $4500 debt on the regiment's armory, which the organization decided to gather through entertainment.

However, another matchup between DePauw and Purdue had also been scheduled in the city for the same day and time, which angered all 4 parties, considering the attendance and profit for both games would essentially be split in half.  Purdue argued that IIAA rules mandated they play the Thanksgiving Day game against DePauw as they were the two best teams in the league<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322164309/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football&match=18|title=20 Nov 1894, 2 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>, while Butler and the ILA argued that there was no rule specifying that another matchup could not be played by another member of the IIAA on the same day as the league championship<ref name=\"auto1\"/>.  With neither party willing to back down, the two games went on despite the financial losses.  The ILA's game against Butler would be played at 2:30 in the afternoon at the baseball park, with reserved room coming at 50 cents a seat. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322167802/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=27 Nov 1894, 5 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>.  The Indianapolis Light Artillery would lose a close contest to the Bulldogs, 4\u20136, in their final game of the season.  In early 1896, after more heating argument in the IIAA's president's meeting over whether or not to allow Athletic Clubs on the schedule any longer, Purdue backed out of the league, which led to its subsequent dissolution before the 1896 season.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 19\n| time = 2pm\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = Chicago AC<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n| site_stadium = Indianapolis Baseball Park<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322141533/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=19 Oct 1895, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n| site_cityst = [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis, IN]]\n| score = 0-16\n| attend = >400\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 24\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Indiana Hoosiers football team|Indiana]]<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n| site_stadium = Jordan Field\n| site_cityst = [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington, IN]]\n| score = 16-8\n| attend = ~500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 2\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Noblesville AC<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = Indianapolis, IN\n| score = 22-4\n| attend =\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 17\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Louisville AC<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]]\n| score = 20-12\n| attend = ~800\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 22\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Notre Dame football team|Notre Dame]]<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n| site_stadium = Cartier Field\n| site_cityst = [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend, IN]]\n| score = 18-0\n| attend =\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 23\n| time =\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = Chicago AC<ref name=\"auto5\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago, IL]]\n| score = 0-4\n| attend = ~500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 28\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[Butler Bulldogs football|Butler]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322132717/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=1 Oct 1895, 8 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/322144488/?</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322160527/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=27 Nov 1895, 6 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n| site_stadium = East Ohio-Street grounds\n| site_cityst = Indianapolis, IN\n| score = 28-0\n| attend = 2000-3000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Post season==\n\nWilliam (Winchester) Osgood would not coach the Light Artillery again, as he would join the [[Cuban War of Independence]] (1895-98, also a part of the greater [[Spanish American War]]), and reportedly died in March 1896<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322002792/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=18 Mar 1896, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>.

Chicago AC was considered, according to the Indianapolis Journal, one of the best teams of the west (more specifically Midwest) besides Michigan University.  The contest was 50 minutes long, with two 25 minute halves.  Chicago AC (Also known as Chicago Athletic Association, or C.A.A) scored all of there 16 points against the Light Artillerymen in the first half.  Not more than 400 people were said to have braved the icy cold wind to spectate the contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322142438/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=20 Oct 1895, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\n===October 24- Indiana===\n\nOn October 23rd the Indianapolis Light Artillery football team set out for Bloomington for there first collegiate contest of the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322143756/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=23 Oct 1895, 8 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  Coming into the game, Indiana was 2\u20130, having won easy contests against the Louisville and Noblesville Athletic clubs, by scores of 36-0 and 30-0 respectively (two teams the Light Artillery would beat later in the season).  The weather was cool and cloudy.  The game was an hour long, with 60 minute halves.  The halftime score was 10\u20134, and the final was 16\u20138.  One of the touchdowns scored for Indiana was by player-coach William Osgood<ref name=\"auto\"/>, who would go on to assist the Light Artillery in the remainder of their football season<ref name=\"auto7\"/>, presumably when Robert Wrenn was hired as the new head coach for Indiana.  Indiana would finish with a casual 4-3-1, although they did manage to secure their first intercollegiate win since the program was established in 1887 by beating Rose Polytechnic 8\u20134.<ref>https://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/active/i/indiana/1895-1899_yearly_results.php</ref>\n\n===November 1st- Knightstown Club===\n\nThis unofficial matchup was played between a handful of players from Butler and Indianapolis Light Artillery against the Knightstown Club on the first day of November.  Heralded as the most exciting and interesting game of football seen in  Indianapolis for the 1895 season, 1500 spectators showed up for the exhibition.  Knightstown scored first, going up 6\u20130, before they were tied 6-6 right before the half.  The club would ultimately prevail though, beating the mix of college and semi-professional football players 12\u20136.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 2nd- Noblesville AC===\n\nThe game was played in Indianapolis, in the same ball park as the one against Chicago AC.  Noblesville came in with at least one loss to Indiana, and that is all that is known about the rather obscure program.  Surrounded by an apparently riotous crowd, the Indianapolis Light Artillery eleven met the Athletic Club's eleven on the afternoon of November 2nd.  by halftime, the score was a tight 6\u20134 in favor of the Artillerymen, but the military team blew away the athletic club in the 2nd half, securing their 3rd official victory, 22\u20134.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 17th- Louisville AC===\n\nA good matchup between the ILA and the Louisville AC was played in Louisville in front of a sizeable crowd of 800 on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The contest was 70 minutes long, with two 35 minute halves.  The Artillery men scored early points in the first half to go up 10\u20130, before Louisville rallied with two field goals to usurp the military team, 12\u201310 at the half in favor of the AC.  This was the first time since Chicago AC that the Light Artillery had faced a halftime deficit.  The military team came out of the 2nd half with 10 unanswered points by left halfback Thompson and kicker Scott to win 20\u201312.  <ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n===November 22nd- Notre Dame===\n\nIn a minor upset, The Indianapolis Light Artillery beat Notre Dame college 18\u20130, on their own Cartier Field in South Bend.  This game is famous because of HG Haddon, coach of the 1895 Notre Dame football team, who inserted himself into the line-up as a left tackle, gaining considerable ground on the semi-professionals before the end of the game through a returned kickoff, recovering a fumble, and a number of other carries.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nyg3NJ4VVuAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title = Fighting Irish: Legends, Lists, and Lore|isbn = 9781582617527|last1 = Heisler|first1 = Karen Croake|year = 2006}}</ref>  Immediately after the game, the ILA left for Chicago for a rematch with the Chicago Athletic Association's football team.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===November 23rd- Chicago AC===\n\nIn the 2nd contest between the two teams, Chicago AC won by a narrow margin of 4 to 0.  The day was cold and icy, with only 500 spectators coming to watch the event in Chicago.  The game was 40 minutes long, with two 20 minute halves.  After a scoreless half, Chicago scored a controversial touchdown that awarded them the 4 points they needed to win.  The Light Artillery blamed the Linesman for bad officiating and bias towards the Chicago team, as one of the Linesman was a brother of a Chicago AC player.  <ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Thanksgiving Day Game- Butler===\n\nThe Indianapolis Light Artillery destroyed Butler to close out the 1895 season at the East Ohio-Street grounds in Indianapolis.  The game was over from the start, with the Butler players apparently unable to move the ball without penalties, and a 22-0 ILA lead by the half.

The play is widely considered to be his ''[[magnum opus]]'' and one of the finest American plays of the 20th century. It premiered in Sweden in February 1956 and then opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in November 1956, winning the [[Tony Award]] for Best Play.\n\nO'Neill posthumously received the 1957 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for ''Long Day's Journey into Night''. The work concerns the Tyrone family, consisting of parents James and Mary and their sons Edmund and Jamie. The \"Long Day\" refers to the setting of the play, which takes place during one day. The play is semi-autobiographical.\n\n==Summary==\nThe play takes place on a single day in August 1912, from around 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to midnight. The setting is the seaside [[Connecticut]] home of the Tyrones' [[Monte Cristo Cottage]]. The four main characters are the semi-autobiographical representations of O'Neill himself, his older brother, and their parents.\n\nThis play portrays a family in a ferociously negative light as the parents and two sons express accusations, blame, and resentments\u2014qualities that are often paired with pathetic and self-defeating attempts at affection, encouragement, tenderness, and yearnings for things to be otherwise. The pain of this family is made worse by their depth of self-understanding and self-analysis, combined with a brutal honesty, as they see it, and an ability to boldly express themselves. The story deals with the mother's [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] to morphine, the family's addiction to whiskey, the father's [[miser]]liness, the older brother's licentiousness, and younger brother's illness.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\n:''Living-room of the Tyrones' summer home, 8:30 am on a day in August, 1912''\nJames Tyrone is a 65-year-old actor who had long ago bought a \"vehicle\" play for himself and had established his reputation based on this one role with which he had toured for years. Although that \"vehicle\" had served him well financially, he is now resentful that his having become so identified with this character has limited his scope and opportunities as a classical actor. He is a wealthy though somewhat miserly man. His money is all tied up in property which he hangs onto in spite of impending financial hardship. His dress and appearance are showing signs of his strained financial circumstances, but he retains many of the mixed affectations of a classical actor in spite of his shabby attire.\n\nHis wife Mary has recently returned from treatment for [[morphine]] addiction and has put on some much-needed weight as a result. She is looking much healthier than the family has been accustomed to, and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from [[insomnia]], which is not made any easier by her husband and children's loud snoring. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, because this is the room where, in the past, she would satisfy her addiction. He questions her about it indirectly. She reassures him that she just went there to get away from her husband's snoring.\n\nIn addition to Mary's problems, the family is worried about Edmund's coughing; they fear that he might have [[tuberculosis]], and are anxiously awaiting a doctor's diagnosis. Edmund is more concerned about the effect a positive diagnosis might have on his mother than on himself. The constant possibility that she might [[relapse]] worries him still further. Once again, he indirectly speaks to his mother about her addiction. He asks her to \"promise not to worry yourself sick and to take care of yourself.\" \"Of course I promise you,\" she protests, but then adds ('with a sad bitterness'), \"But I suppose you're remembering I've promised before on my word of honor.\"\n\n===Act II===\n:''The same, around 12:45 pm; and about a half-hour later''\nJamie and Edmund taunt each other about stealing their father's alcohol and watering it down so he won't notice. They speak about Mary's conduct. Jamie berates Edmund for leaving their mother unsupervised. Edmund berates Jamie for being suspicious. Both, however, are deeply worried that their mother's addiction may have resurfaced. Jamie points out to Edmund that they had concealed their mother's addiction from him for ten years, explaining that his naivet\u00e9 about the nature of the disease was understandable but deluded. They discuss the upcoming results of Edmund's tests for tuberculosis, and Jamie tells him to prepare for the worst.\n\nMary appears. She is distraught about Edmund's coughing, which he tries to suppress so as not to alarm her, fearing anything that might trigger her addiction again. When Edmund accepts his mother's excuse that she had been upstairs so long because she had been \"lying down\", Jamie looks at them both contemptuously. Mary notices and starts becoming defensive and belligerent, berating Jamie for his cynicism and disrespect for his parents. Jamie is quick to point out that the only reason he has survived as an actor is through his father's influence in the business.\n\nMary speaks of her frustration with their summer home, its impermanence and shabbiness, and her husband's indifference to his surroundings. With irony, she alludes to her belief that this air of detachment might be the very reason he has tolerated her addiction for so long. This frightens Edmund, who is trying desperately to hang on to his belief in normality while faced with two emotionally horrific problems at once. Finally, unable to tolerate the way Jamie is looking at her, she asks him angrily why he is doing it. \"You know!\", he shoots back, and tells her to take a look at her glazed eyes in the mirror.\n\n===Act III===\n:''The same, around 6:30 that evening''\nMary and Cathleen return home from their drive to the drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to purchase her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen to go to the kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn, and her husband's obvious obsession with money. Mary has already taken some of her \"prescription\". She talks about her past in a Catholic [[convent]] and the promise she once had as a pianist and the fact that it was once thought that she might become a [[nun]]. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her [[arthritis|arthritic]] hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain is why she needs her prescription \u2013 an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.\n\nWhen Mary dozes off under the influence of the morphine, Cathleen exits to prepare dinner. Mary awakes and begins to have bitter memories about how much she loved her life before she met her husband. She also decides that her prayers as an addict are not being heard by the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] and decides to go upstairs to get more drugs, but before she can Edmund and James Sr. return home.\n\nAlthough both men are drunk, they both realize that Mary is back on morphine, although she attempts to act as if she is not. Jamie has not returned home, but has elected instead to continue drinking and to visit the local whorehouse. After calling Jamie a \"hopeless failure\" Mary warns that his bad influence will drag his brother down as well. After seeing the condition that his wife is in, James expresses the regret that he bothered to come home, and he attempts to ignore her as she continues her remarks, which include blaming him for Jamie's drinking. Then, as often happens in the play, Mary and James try to get over their animosity and attempt to express their love for one another by remembering happier days. When James goes to the basement to get another bottle of whiskey, Mary continues to talk with Edmund.\n\nWhen Edmund reveals that he has consumption, Mary refuses to believe it, and attempts to discredit Dr. Hardy, due to her inability to face the reality and severity of the situation. She accuses Edmund of attempting to get more attention by blowing everything out of proportion. In retaliation, Edmund reminds his mother that her own father died of consumption, and then, before exiting, he adds how difficult it is to have a \"dope fiend for a mother.\" Alone, Mary admits that she needs more morphine and hopes that someday she will \"accidentally\" [[drug overdose|overdose]], because she knows that if she did so on purpose, the Virgin would never forgive her. When James comes back with more alcohol he notes that there was evidence that Jamie had attempted to pick the locks to the whiskey cabinet in the cellar, as he has done before. Mary ignores this and bursts out that she is afraid that Edmund is going to die. She also confides to James that Edmund does not love her because of her drug problem. When James attempts to console her, Mary again rues having given birth to Edmund, who appears to have been conceived to replace a baby they had lost before Edmund's birth. When Cathleen announces dinner, Mary indicates that she is not hungry and is going to bed. James goes in to dinner all alone, knowing that Mary is really going upstairs to get more drugs.\n\n===Act IV===\n:''The same, around midnight''\nEdmund returns home to find his father playing [[solitaire]]. While the two argue and drink, they also have an intimate, tender conversation. James explains his stinginess, and also reveals that he ruined his career by staying in an acting job for money. After so many years playing the same part, he lost his talent for versatility. Edmund talks to his father about sailing and of his aspiration to become a great writer one day. They hear Jamie coming home drunk, and James leaves to avoid fighting. Jamie and Edmund converse, and Jamie confesses that although he loves Edmund more than anyone else, he wants him to fail. Jamie passes out. When James returns, Jamie wakes up, and they quarrel anew. Mary, lost in her drug-laden dreams of the past, comes downstairs. Holding her wedding gown, she talks about her convent days and how she lost her [[vocation]] by falling in love with James, while her husband and sons silently watch her.\n\n==Characters==\n* James Tyrone Sr. \u2013 65 years old. He looks ten years younger and is about five feet eight inches tall but appears taller due to his military-like posture and bearing. He is broad-shouldered and deep-chested and remarkably good-looking for his age with light brown eyes. His speech and movement are those of a classical actor with a studied technique, but he is unpretentious and not temperamental at all with \"inclinations still close to his humble beginnings and Irish farmer forebears\". His attire is somewhat threadbare and shabby. He wears his clothing to the limit of usefulness. He has been a healthy man his entire life and is free of hang ups and anxieties except for fear of \"dying in the poorhouse\" and obsession with having money. He has \"streaks of sentimental melancholy and rare flashes of intuitive sensibility\". He smokes cigars and dislikes being referred to as the \"Old Man\" by his sons.\n* Mary Cavan Tyrone \u2013 54 years old, the wife and mother of the family who lapses between self-delusion and the haze of her morphine addiction. She is medium height with a young graceful figure, a trifle plump with distinctly Irish facial features. She was once extremely pretty and is still striking. She wears no make-up and her hair is thick, white and perfectly coiffed. She has large, dark, almost black, eyes. She has a soft and attractive voice with a \"touch of Irish lilt when she is merry\". Mary has been addicted to morphine since the difficult birth of her youngest son Edmund. The doctor who treated her simply gave her painkillers, which led to a longtime morphine addiction that continues to plague her.\n* James \"Jamie\" Jr. \u2013 33 years old, the older son. He has thinning hair, an aquiline nose and shows signs of premature disintegration. He has a habitual expression of cynicism. He resembles his father. \"On the rare occasions when he smiles without sneering, his personality possesses the remnant of a humorous, romantic, irresponsible Irish charm \u2013 the beguiling ne'er-do-well, with a strain of the sentimentally poetic\". He is attractive to women and popular with men. He is an actor like his father but has difficulty finding work due to a reputation for being an irresponsible, womanizing alcoholic. He and his father argue a great deal about this. Jamie often refers to his father as \"Old Gaspard\", a character from the opera ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', who is also a miser.\n* Edmund \u2013 23 years old, the younger and more intellectually and poetically inclined son. He is thin and wiry. He looks like both his parents but more like his mother. He has her big dark eyes and hypersensitive mouth in a long narrow Irish face with dark brown hair and red highlights from the sun. Like his mother, he is extremely nervous. He is in bad health and his cheeks are sunken. Later he is diagnosed with tuberculosis. He is politically inclined to have socialist leanings. He traveled the world by working in the merchant navy and caught tuberculosis while abroad.\n* Cathleen \u2013 \"The second girl\", she is the summer maid. She is a \"buxom Irish peasant\", in her early twenties with red cheeks, black hair and blue eyes. She is \"amiable, ignorant, clumsy with a well-meaning stupidity\".\n\nSeveral characters are referenced in the play but do not appear on stage:\n\n* Eugene Tyrone \u2013 A son born before Edmund who died of measles at the age of two. He was infected by Jamie who was seven at the time and had been told not to enter his room but disobeyed. Mary believes that Jamie had the intent of hurting Eugene.\n* Bridget \u2013 A cook.\n* McGuire \u2013 A real estate agent who has swindled James Tyrone in the past.\n* Shaughnessy \u2013 A tenant on a farm owned by the Tyrones.\n* Harker \u2013 A friend of James Tyrone, \"the Standard Oil millionaire\", owns a neighboring farm to Shaughnessy with whom he gets into conflicts, often postulated to be based on [[Edward Harkness]], Standard Oil heir, who had a summer home nearby in Waterford, Connecticut.\n* Doctor Hardy \u2013 The Tyrones' physician, whom the other family members don't think much of.\n* Captain Turner \u2013 The Tyrones' neighbor.\n* Smythe \u2013 A garage assistant whom James hired as a chauffeur for Mary. Mary suspects he is intentionally damaging the car to provide work for the garage.\n* The mistress \u2013 A woman with whom James had had an affair before his marriage, who had later sued him causing Mary to be shunned by her friends as someone with undesirable social connections.\n* Mary's father \u2013 Died of tuberculosis.\n* James's parents and siblings \u2013 The family immigrated to the United States when James was 8 years old. Two years later the father abandoned the family and returned to Ireland where he died after ingesting rat poison. It was suspected suicide but James refuses to believe that. He had two older brothers and three sisters.\n\n==History of the play==\nO'Neill finished revising the manuscript into its final version in March 1941.<ref name=Gelb>{{cite book|last1=Gelb|first1=Arthur|authorlink1=Arthur Gelb|last2=Gelb|first2=Barbara|authorlink2=Barbara Gelb|title=O'Neill: Life with Monte Cristo|date=2000|publisher=Applause Books|location=New York|isbn=0-399-14609-1|url=https://archive.org/details/oneilllifewithmo0000gelb|accessdate=13 October 2016|ref=Gelb|url-access=registration}}</ref> He did not want it ever produced as a play, and did not even want it published during his lifetime, writing to his friend, the critic [[George Jean Nathan]]: \"There are good reasons in the play itself... why I'm keeping this one very much to myself, as you will appreciate when you read it.\"<ref name=Gelb />\n\nO'Neill did not copyright the play. In 1945 he had a sealed copy of the manuscript placed in the document vault of publisher [[Random House]], instructing that it not be published until 25 years after his death. He sent a second sealed copy to the O'Neill collection at [[Yale University]].<ref name=Gelb />\n\nSoon after O'Neill's death, his widow [[Carlotta Monterey]] demanded that Random House contravene O'Neill's explicit wishes and publish the play at once. \"We refused, of course,\" wrote publisher [[Bennett Cerf]] in his memoirs, \"but then were horrified to learn that legally all the cards were in her hand. \u2026 I do not regret that we took the stand we did, because I still think we were right.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Cerf |first=Bennett |date=1977 |title=At Random |url=https://archive.org/details/atrandomreminisc00cerf/page/89 |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page=[https://archive.org/details/atrandomreminisc00cerf/page/89 89] |isbn=0-394-47877-0 |author-link=Bennett Cerf |url-access=registration }}</ref> Monterey had the play published by the [[Yale University Press]] in 1956, with the bulk of the proceeds deeded to Yale's Eugene O'Neill Collection and for scholarships at its drama school.<ref name=Gelb />\n\n==Autobiographical content==\n[[File:Montecristocotage.jpg|thumb|Monte Cristo Cottage, boyhood home of O'Neill and the setting for two of his works, ''Long Day's Journey into Night'', and ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'']]\nIn key aspects, the play closely parallels Eugene O'Neill's own life. The location, a summer home in Connecticut, corresponds to the family home, [[Monte Cristo Cottage]], in [[New London, Connecticut]] (the small town of the play). The actual cottage, today owned and operated by the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]], is made up as it may appear in the play. The family in the script corresponds to the O'Neill family, which was Irish-American, with three name changes: The family name \"O'Neill\" is changed to \"Tyrone,\" which is the name of the earldom granted to [[Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone|Conn O'Neill]] by Henry VIII. The names of the second and third sons are reversed, \"Eugene\" with \"Edmund\". In fact, Eugene, the playwright, was the third and the youngest child, and he corresponds to the character of \"Edmund\" in the play. O'Neill's mother, [[Ella O'Neill|Mary Ellen \"Ella\" Quinlan]], corresponds to the character Mary ''Cavan.'' The ages are all the actual ages of the O'Neill family in August 1912.\n\nEugene O'Neill's father, [[James O'Neill (actor, born 1847)|James O'Neill]], was a promising young actor in his youth, as was the father in the play. He also shared the stage with [[Edwin Booth]], who is mentioned in the play. James O'Neill achieved commercial success in the title role of [[Alexandre Dumas|Dumas]]' ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', playing the title role about 6,000 times; he was criticized for \"[[selling out]]\" for commercial success at the expense of artistic merit.<ref>Eaton, Walter Prichard (1910). ''The American Stage of Today''. New York, New York: P.F. Collier & Son.</ref>\n\nEugene's mother Mary did attend a Catholic school in the Midwest, [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College]], of [[Notre Dame, Indiana]]. Subsequent to the date when the play is set (1912), but prior to the play's writing (1941\u201342), Eugene's older brother Jamie did drink himself to death (c. 1923).\n\nRegarding O'Neill himself, by 1912 he had attended a renowned university (Princeton), spent several years at sea, and suffered from depression and alcoholism, and did contribute to the local newspaper, the ''New London Telegraph,'' writing poetry as well as reporting. He did go to a sanatorium in 1912\u201313 due to suffering from [[tuberculosis]] (consumption), whereupon he devoted himself to playwriting. The events in the play are thus set immediately prior to O'Neill beginning his career in earnest.\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Premiere productions===\n[[File:Long Day's Journey into Night 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|Window card for the 1956 Broadway production of ''Long Day's Journey into Night'' starring [[Fredric March]] and [[Florence Eldridge]]]]\n''Long Day's Journey into Night'' was first performed by the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' | url=http://www.eoneill.com/artifacts/Long_Days_Journey.htm | publisher=eOneill.com | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-06-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124033637/http://www.eoneill.com/artifacts/Long_Days_Journey.htm | archive-date=2011-01-24 | url-status=dead }}</ref> During O'Neill's lifetime, the Swedish people had embraced his work to a far greater extent than had any other nation, including his own. Thus, the play had its world premiere in Stockholm on February 2, 1956, in Swedish (as ''L\u00e5ng dags f\u00e4rd mot natt''), in a production directed by [[Bengt Ekerot]], with the cast of [[Lars Hanson]] (James Tyrone), [[Inga Tidblad]] (Mary Tyrone), [[Ulf Palme]] (James Tyrone Jr.), [[Jarl Kulle]] (Edmund Tyrone) and [[Catrin Westerlund]] (Cathleen, the serving-maid or \"second girl\" as O'Neill's script dubs her).

The play is widely considered to be his ''[[magnum opus]]'' and one of the finest American plays of the 20th century. It premiered in Sweden in February 1956 and then opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in November 1956, winning the [[Tony Award]] for Best Play.\n\nO'Neill posthumously received the 1957 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for ''Long Day's Journey into Night''. The work concerns the Tyrone family, consisting of parents James and Mary and their sons Edmund and Jamie. The \"Long Day\" refers to the setting of the play, which takes place during one day. The play is semi-autobiographical.\n\n==Summary==\nThe play takes place on a single day in August 1912, from around 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to midnight. The setting is the seaside [[Connecticut]] home of the Tyrones' [[Monte Cristo Cottage]]. The four main characters are the semi-autobiographical representations of O'Neill himself, his older brother, and their parents.\n\nThis play portrays a family in a ferociously negative light as the parents and two sons express accusations, blame, and resentments\u2014qualities that are often paired with pathetic and self-defeating attempts at affection, encouragement, tenderness, and yearnings for things to be otherwise. The pain of this family is made worse by their depth of self-understanding and self-analysis, combined with a brutal honesty, as they see it, and an ability to boldly express themselves. The story deals with the mother's [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] to morphine, the family's addiction to whiskey, the father's [[miser]]liness, the older brother's licentiousness, and younger brother's illness.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\n:''Living-room of the Tyrones' summer home, 8:30 am on a day in August, 1912''\nJames Tyrone is a 65-year-old actor who had long ago bought a \"vehicle\" play for himself and had established his reputation based on this one role with which he had toured for years. Although that \"vehicle\" had served him well financially, he is now resentful that his having become so identified with this character has limited his scope and opportunities as a classical actor. He is a wealthy though somewhat miserly man. His money is all tied up in property which he hangs onto in spite of impending financial hardship. His dress and appearance are showing signs of his strained financial circumstances, but he retains many of the mixed affectations of a classical actor in spite of his shabby attire.\n\nHis wife Mary has recently returned from treatment for [[morphine]] addiction and has put on some much-needed weight as a result. She is looking much healthier than the family has been accustomed to, and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from [[insomnia]], which is not made any easier by her husband and children's loud snoring. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, because this is the room where, in the past, she would satisfy her addiction. He questions her about it indirectly. She reassures him that she just went there to get away from her husband's snoring.\n\nIn addition to Mary's problems, the family is worried about Edmund's coughing; they fear that he might have [[tuberculosis]], and are anxiously awaiting a doctor's diagnosis. Edmund is more concerned about the effect a positive diagnosis might have on his mother than on himself. The constant possibility that she might [[relapse]] worries him still further. Once again, he indirectly speaks to his mother about her addiction. He asks her to \"promise not to worry yourself sick and to take care of yourself.\" \"Of course I promise you,\" she protests, but then adds ('with a sad bitterness'), \"But I suppose you're remembering I've promised before on my word of honor.\"\n\n===Act II===\n:''The same, around 12:45 pm; and about a half-hour later''\nJamie and Edmund taunt each other about stealing their father's alcohol and watering it down so he won't notice. They speak about Mary's conduct. Jamie berates Edmund for leaving their mother unsupervised. Edmund berates Jamie for being suspicious. Both, however, are deeply worried that their mother's addiction may have resurfaced. Jamie points out to Edmund that they had concealed their mother's addiction from him for ten years, explaining that his naivet\u00e9 about the nature of the disease was understandable but deluded. They discuss the upcoming results of Edmund's tests for tuberculosis, and Jamie tells him to prepare for the worst.\n\nMary appears. She is distraught about Edmund's coughing, which he tries to suppress so as not to alarm her, fearing anything that might trigger her addiction again. When Edmund accepts his mother's excuse that she had been upstairs so long because she had been \"lying down\", Jamie looks at them both contemptuously. Mary notices and starts becoming defensive and belligerent, berating Jamie for his cynicism and disrespect for his parents. Jamie is quick to point out that the only reason he has survived as an actor is through his father's influence in the business.\n\nMary speaks of her frustration with their summer home, its impermanence and shabbiness, and her husband's indifference to his surroundings. With irony, she alludes to her belief that this air of detachment might be the very reason he has tolerated her addiction for so long. This frightens Edmund, who is trying desperately to hang on to his belief in normality while faced with two emotionally horrific problems at once. Finally, unable to tolerate the way Jamie is looking at her, she asks him angrily why he is doing it. \"You know!\", he shoots back, and tells her to take a look at her glazed eyes in the mirror.\n\n===Act III===\n:''The same, around 6:30 that evening''\nMary and Cathleen return home from their drive to the drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to purchase her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen to go to the kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn, and her husband's obvious obsession with money. Mary has already taken some of her \"prescription\". She talks about her past in a Catholic [[convent]] and the promise she once had as a pianist and the fact that it was once thought that she might become a [[nun]]. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her [[arthritis|arthritic]] hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain is why she needs her prescription \u2013 an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.\n\nWhen Mary dozes off under the influence of the morphine, Cathleen exits to prepare dinner. Mary awakes and begins to have bitter memories about how much she loved her life before she met her husband. She also decides that her prayers as an addict are not being heard by the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] and decides to go upstairs to get more drugs, but before she can Edmund and James Sr. return home.\n\nAlthough both men are drunk, they both realize that Mary is back on morphine, although she attempts to act as if she is not. Jamie has not returned home, but has elected instead to continue drinking and to visit the local whorehouse. After calling Jamie a \"hopeless failure\" Mary warns that his bad influence will drag his brother down as well. After seeing the condition that his wife is in, James expresses the regret that he bothered to come home, and he attempts to ignore her as she continues her remarks, which include blaming him for Jamie's drinking. Then, as often happens in the play, Mary and James try to get over their animosity and attempt to express their love for one another by remembering happier days. When James goes to the basement to get another bottle of whiskey, Mary continues to talk with Edmund.\n\nWhen Edmund reveals that he has consumption, Mary refuses to believe it, and attempts to discredit Dr. Hardy, due to her inability to face the reality and severity of the situation. She accuses Edmund of attempting to get more attention by blowing everything out of proportion. In retaliation, Edmund reminds his mother that her own father died of consumption, and then, before exiting, he adds how difficult it is to have a \"dope fiend for a mother.\" Alone, Mary admits that she needs more morphine and hopes that someday she will \"accidentally\" [[drug overdose|overdose]], because she knows that if she did so on purpose, the Virgin would never forgive her. When James comes back with more alcohol he notes that there was evidence that Jamie had attempted to pick the locks to the whiskey cabinet in the cellar, as he has done before. Mary ignores this and bursts out that she is afraid that Edmund is going to die. She also confides to James that Edmund does not love her because of her drug problem. When James attempts to console her, Mary again rues having given birth to Edmund, who appears to have been conceived to replace a baby they had lost before Edmund's birth. When Cathleen announces dinner, Mary indicates that she is not hungry and is going to bed. James goes in to dinner all alone, knowing that Mary is really going upstairs to get more drugs.\n\n===Act IV===\n:''The same, around midnight''\nEdmund returns home to find his father playing [[solitaire]]. While the two argue and drink, they also have an intimate, tender conversation. James explains his stinginess, and also reveals that he ruined his career by staying in an acting job for money. After so many years playing the same part, he lost his talent for versatility. Edmund talks to his father about sailing and of his aspiration to become a great writer one day. They hear Jamie coming home drunk, and James leaves to avoid fighting. Jamie and Edmund converse, and Jamie confesses that although he loves Edmund more than anyone else, he wants him to fail. Jamie passes out. When James returns, Jamie wakes up, and they quarrel anew. Mary, lost in her drug-laden dreams of the past, comes downstairs. Holding her wedding gown, she talks about her convent days and how she lost her [[vocation]] by falling in love with James, while her husband and sons silently watch her.\n\n==Characters==\n* James Tyrone Sr. \u2013 65 years old. He looks ten years younger and is about five feet eight inches tall but appears taller due to his military-like posture and bearing. He is broad-shouldered and deep-chested and remarkably good-looking for his age with light brown eyes. His speech and movement are those of a classical actor with a studied technique, but he is unpretentious and not temperamental at all with \"inclinations still close to his humble beginnings and Irish farmer forebears\". His attire is somewhat threadbare and shabby. He wears his clothing to the limit of usefulness. He has been a healthy man his entire life and is free of hang ups and anxieties except for fear of \"dying in the poorhouse\" and obsession with having money. He has \"streaks of sentimental melancholy and rare flashes of intuitive sensibility\". He smokes cigars and dislikes being referred to as the \"Old Man\" by his sons.\n* Mary Cavan Tyrone \u2013 54 years old, the wife and mother of the family who lapses between self-delusion and the haze of her morphine addiction. She is medium height with a young graceful figure, a trifle plump with distinctly Irish facial features. She was once extremely pretty and is still striking. She wears no make-up and her hair is thick, white and perfectly coiffed. She has large, dark, almost black, eyes. She has a soft and attractive voice with a \"touch of Irish lilt when she is merry\". Mary has been addicted to morphine since the difficult birth of her youngest son Edmund. The doctor who treated her simply gave her painkillers, which led to a longtime morphine addiction that continues to plague her.\n* James \"Jamie\" Jr. \u2013 33 years old, the older son. He has thinning hair, an aquiline nose and shows signs of premature disintegration. He has a habitual expression of cynicism. He resembles his father. \"On the rare occasions when he smiles without sneering, his personality possesses the remnant of a humorous, romantic, irresponsible Irish charm \u2013 the beguiling ne'er-do-well, with a strain of the sentimentally poetic\". He is attractive to women and popular with men. He is an actor like his father but has difficulty finding work due to a reputation for being an irresponsible, womanizing alcoholic. He and his father argue a great deal about this. Jamie often refers to his father as \"Old Gaspard\", a character from the opera ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', who is also a miser.\n* Edmund \u2013 23 years old, the younger and more intellectually and poetically inclined son. He is thin and wiry. He looks like both his parents but more like his mother. He has her big dark eyes and hypersensitive mouth in a long narrow Irish face with dark brown hair and red highlights from the sun. Like his mother, he is extremely nervous. He is in bad health and his cheeks are sunken. Later he is diagnosed with tuberculosis. He is politically inclined to have socialist leanings. He traveled the world by working in the merchant navy and caught tuberculosis while abroad.\n* Cathleen \u2013 \"The second girl\", she is the summer maid. She is a \"buxom Irish peasant\", in her early twenties with red cheeks, black hair and blue eyes. She is \"amiable, ignorant, clumsy with a well-meaning stupidity\".\n\nSeveral characters are referenced in the play but do not appear on stage:\n\n* Eugene Tyrone \u2013 A son born before Edmund who died of measles at the age of two. He was infected by Jamie who was seven at the time and had been told not to enter his room but disobeyed. Mary believes that Jamie had the intent of hurting Eugene.\n* Bridget \u2013 A cook.\n* McGuire \u2013 A real estate agent who has swindled James Tyrone in the past.\n* Shaughnessy \u2013 A tenant on a farm owned by the Tyrones.\n* Harker \u2013 A friend of James Tyrone, \"the Standard Oil millionaire\", owns a neighboring farm to Shaughnessy with whom he gets into conflicts, often postulated to be based on [[Edward Harkness]], Standard Oil heir, who had a summer home nearby in Waterford, Connecticut.\n* Doctor Hardy \u2013 The Tyrones' physician, whom the other family members don't think much of.\n* Captain Turner \u2013 The Tyrones' neighbor.\n* Smythe \u2013 A garage assistant whom James hired as a chauffeur for Mary. Mary suspects he is intentionally damaging the car to provide work for the garage.\n* The mistress \u2013 A woman with whom James had had an affair before his marriage, who had later sued him causing Mary to be shunned by her friends as someone with undesirable social connections.\n* Mary's father \u2013 Died of tuberculosis.\n* James's parents and siblings \u2013 The family immigrated to the United States when James was 8 years old. Two years later the father abandoned the family and returned to Ireland where he died after ingesting rat poison. It was suspected suicide but James refuses to believe that. He had two older brothers and three sisters.\n\n==History of the play==\nO'Neill finished revising the manuscript into its final version in March 1941.<ref name=Gelb>{{cite book|last1=Gelb|first1=Arthur|authorlink1=Arthur Gelb|last2=Gelb|first2=Barbara|authorlink2=Barbara Gelb|title=O'Neill: Life with Monte Cristo|date=2000|publisher=Applause Books|location=New York|isbn=0-399-14609-1|url=https://archive.org/details/oneilllifewithmo0000gelb|accessdate=13 October 2016|ref=Gelb|url-access=registration}}</ref> He did not want it ever produced as a play, and did not even want it published during his lifetime, writing to his friend, the critic [[George Jean Nathan]]: \"There are good reasons in the play itself... why I'm keeping this one very much to myself, as you will appreciate when you read it.\"<ref name=Gelb />\n\nO'Neill did not copyright the play. In 1945 he had a sealed copy of the manuscript placed in the document vault of publisher [[Random House]], instructing that it not be published until 25 years after his death. He sent a second sealed copy to the O'Neill collection at [[Yale University]].<ref name=Gelb />\n\nSoon after O'Neill's death, his widow [[Carlotta Monterey]] demanded that Random House contravene O'Neill's explicit wishes and publish the play at once. \"We refused, of course,\" wrote publisher [[Bennett Cerf]] in his memoirs, \"but then were horrified to learn that legally all the cards were in her hand. \u2026 I do not regret that we took the stand we did, because I still think we were right.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Cerf |first=Bennett |date=1977 |title=At Random |url=https://archive.org/details/atrandomreminisc00cerf/page/89 |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page=[https://archive.org/details/atrandomreminisc00cerf/page/89 89] |isbn=0-394-47877-0 |author-link=Bennett Cerf |url-access=registration }}</ref> Monterey had the play published by the [[Yale University Press]] in 1956, with the bulk of the proceeds deeded to Yale's Eugene O'Neill Collection and for scholarships at its drama school.<ref name=Gelb />\n\n==Autobiographical content==\n[[File:Montecristocotage.jpg|thumb|Monte Cristo Cottage, boyhood home of O'Neill and the setting for two of his works, ''Long Day's Journey into Night'', and ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'']]\nIn key aspects, the play closely parallels Eugene O'Neill's own life. The location, a summer home in Connecticut, corresponds to the family home, [[Monte Cristo Cottage]], in [[New London, Connecticut]] (the small town of the play). The actual cottage, today owned and operated by the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]], is made up as it may appear in the play. The family in the script corresponds to the O'Neill family, which was Irish-American, with three name changes: The family name \"O'Neill\" is changed to \"Tyrone,\" which is the name of the earldom granted to [[Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone|Conn O'Neill]] by Henry VIII. The names of the second and third sons are reversed, \"Eugene\" with \"Edmund\". In fact, Eugene, the playwright, was the third and the youngest child, and he corresponds to the character of \"Edmund\" in the play. O'Neill's mother, [[Ella O'Neill|Mary Ellen \"Ella\" Quinlan]], corresponds to the character Mary ''Cavan.'' The ages are all the actual ages of the O'Neill family in August 1912.\n\nEugene O'Neill's father, [[James O'Neill (actor, born 1847)|James O'Neill]], was a promising young actor in his youth, as was the father in the play. He also shared the stage with [[Edwin Booth]], who is mentioned in the play. James O'Neill achieved commercial success in the title role of [[Alexandre Dumas|Dumas]]' ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', playing the title role about 6,000 times; he was criticized for \"[[selling out]]\" for commercial success at the expense of artistic merit.<ref>Eaton, Walter Prichard (1910). ''The American Stage of Today''. New York, New York: P.F. Collier & Son.</ref>\n\nEugene's mother Mary did attend a Catholic school in the Midwest, [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College]], of [[Notre Dame, Indiana]]. Subsequent to the date when the play is set (1912), but prior to the play's writing (1941\u201342), Eugene's older brother Jamie did drink himself to death (c. 1923).\n\nRegarding O'Neill himself, by 1912 he had attended a renowned university (Princeton), spent several years at sea, and suffered from depression and alcoholism, and did contribute to the local newspaper, the ''New London Telegraph,'' writing poetry as well as reporting. He did go to a sanatorium in 1912\u201313 due to suffering from [[tuberculosis]] (consumption), whereupon he devoted himself to playwriting. The events in the play are thus set immediately prior to O'Neill beginning his career in earnest.\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Premiere productions===\n[[File:Long Day's Journey into Night 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|Window card for the 1956 Broadway production of ''Long Day's Journey into Night'' starring [[Fredric March]] and [[Florence Eldridge]]]]\n''Long Day's Journey into Night'' was first performed by the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' | url=http://www.eoneill.com/artifacts/Long_Days_Journey.htm | publisher=eOneill.com | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-06-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124033637/http://www.eoneill.com/artifacts/Long_Days_Journey.htm | archive-date=2011-01-24 | url-status=dead }}</ref> During O'Neill's lifetime, the Swedish people had embraced his work to a far greater extent than had any other nation, including his own. Thus, the play had its world premiere in Stockholm on February 2, 1956, in Swedish (as ''L\u00e5ng dags f\u00e4rd mot natt''), in a production directed by [[Bengt Ekerot]], with the cast of [[Lars Hanson]] (James Tyrone), [[Inga Tidblad]] (Mary Tyrone), [[Ulf Palme]] (James Tyrone Jr.), [[Jarl Kulle]] (Edmund Tyrone) and [[Catrin Westerlund]] (Cathleen, the serving-maid or \"second girl\" as O'Neill's script dubs her).

Owned and administered by the Kaohsiung-based shoe-producing La New Corporation and then the Japan-based [[electronic commerce]] and online retailing company [[Rakuten]], the Bears qualified for the [[Chinese Professional Baseball League Playoffs (2006)|playoffs in 2006]] for the first time in team history, and by finishing with the best record for the whole season, gained an automatic berth in the [[Taiwan Series]].\n\nThe team played their home games at [[Chengcing Lake Baseball Field]] in [[Kaohsiung County]] (now part of [[Kaohsiung City]]) from 2004 to 2010. In the 2011 season, their home stadium was moved to [[Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium]]. Accordingly, the team's name was changed to the Lamigo Monkeys, and the current owner Rakuten maintains the \"Monkeys\" name.\n\n==History==\n\n===First Financial Holdings Agan===\nFirst known as the '''First Securities Agan''', the team was owned by the First Financial Holding Corporation, a government-funded financial holding service institute. Its then-chairman Chen Chien-lung was a keen political supporter of President [[Chen Shui-bian]], and, upon the president's request, immediately agreed to take over one of the two former [[Taiwan Major League|TML]] teams after TML was merged into CPBL in January 2003. Since Macoto Bank had already decided to take-over the [[Macoto Gida]], Chen Chien-lung took over the Agan as promised. The majority of Agan's player came from [[Taipei Gida]] and [[Kaohsiung-Pingtung Fala]], and not from the [[Taichung Agan]], which carried the same mascot and were the champions of the final season of TML. Agan played its home games at [[Chengcing Lake Baseball Field]].\n\nAfter Chen Chien-lung's sudden resignation due to allegation of [[insider trading]] in August 2003, the First Financial Holding Corporation no longer showed willingness in running the team. The Agan finished the 2003 season placing fifth overall, and did not win any of the 20 games against [[Brother Elephants]], the [[Taiwan Series]] champions of that season.\n\n===La New Bears===\nJust before the 2004 season, Kaohsiung County Magistrate [[Yang Chiu-hsing]] invited the La New Corporation, a footwear manufacturer to sponsor the then-vacant [[Chengcing Lake Baseball Field]], which was under the management of Kaohsiung County after the disbandment of [[Taiwan Major League]]. La New Corporation eventually agreed and, in addition, offered to buy the First Financial Holdings Agan, whose management had been struggling in the past season. On December 16, 2003, La New completed the process with First Financial Holdings and renamed the team La New Bears. In the first two years of their existence, the Bears did not perform well. But after several additions to the roster through drafts and the minor league, the Bears turned the team around, eventually winning the [[2006 Chinese Professional Baseball League playoffs|2006 Taiwan Series]] title.\n\n===Lamigo Monkeys===\n[[File:Lamigo Monkeys 2017.png|thumb|Lamigo Monkeys' logo in 2017.]]\nAfter several years of futile effort to manage the Kaohsiung market, the team relocated to [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan County]] (now Taoyuan City) and changed its name to Lamigo Monkeys in January 2011. Lamigo is a subsidiary of La New Corporation that operates a wellness center, restaurants as well as a travel agency in northern Taiwan.

Owned and administered by the Kaohsiung-based shoe-producing La New Corporation and then the Japan-based [[electronic commerce]] and online retailing company [[Rakuten]], the Bears qualified for the [[Chinese Professional Baseball League Playoffs (2006)|playoffs in 2006]] for the first time in team history, and by finishing with the best record for the whole season, gained an automatic berth in the [[Taiwan Series]].\n\nThe team played their home games at [[Chengcing Lake Baseball Field]] in [[Kaohsiung County]] (now part of [[Kaohsiung City]]) from 2004 to 2010. In the 2011 season, their home stadium was moved to [[Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium]]. Accordingly, the team's name was changed to the Lamigo Monkeys, and the current owner Rakuten maintains the \"Monkeys\" name.\n\n==History==\n\n===First Financial Holdings Agan===\nFirst known as the '''First Securities Agan''', the team was owned by the First Financial Holding Corporation, a government-funded financial holding service institute. Its then-chairman Chen Chien-lung was a keen political supporter of President [[Chen Shui-bian]], and, upon the president's request, immediately agreed to take over one of the two former [[Taiwan Major League|TML]] teams after TML was merged into CPBL in January 2003. Since Macoto Bank had already decided to take-over the [[Macoto Gida]], Chen Chien-lung took over the Agan as promised. The majority of Agan's player came from [[Taipei Gida]] and [[Kaohsiung-Pingtung Fala]], and not from the [[Taichung Agan]], which carried the same mascot and were the champions of the final season of TML. Agan played its home games at [[Chengcing Lake Baseball Field]].\n\nAfter Chen Chien-lung's sudden resignation due to allegation of [[insider trading]] in August 2003, the First Financial Holding Corporation no longer showed willingness in running the team. The Agan finished the 2003 season placing fifth overall, and did not win any of the 20 games against [[Brother Elephants]], the [[Taiwan Series]] champions of that season.\n\n===La New Bears===\nJust before the 2004 season, Kaohsiung County Magistrate [[Yang Chiu-hsing]] invited the La New Corporation, a footwear manufacturer to sponsor the then-vacant [[Chengcing Lake Baseball Field]], which was under the management of Kaohsiung County after the disbandment of [[Taiwan Major League]]. La New Corporation eventually agreed and, in addition, offered to buy the First Financial Holdings Agan, whose management had been struggling in the past season. On December 16, 2003, La New completed the process with First Financial Holdings and renamed the team La New Bears. In the first two years of their existence, the Bears did not perform well. But after several additions to the roster through drafts and the minor league, the Bears turned the team around, eventually winning the [[2006 Chinese Professional Baseball League playoffs|2006 Taiwan Series]] title.\n\n===Lamigo Monkeys===\n[[File:Lamigo Monkeys 2017.png|thumb|Lamigo Monkeys' logo in 2017.]]\nAfter several years of futile effort to manage the Kaohsiung market, the team relocated to [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan County]] (now Taoyuan City) and changed its name to Lamigo Monkeys in January 2011. Lamigo is a subsidiary of La New Corporation that operates a wellness center, restaurants as well as a travel agency in northern Taiwan. Since Lamigo is based in northern Taiwan, the team was moved to Taoyuan County and play their home games at [[Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium]].

The theoretical values of the Tafel equation constants are different for the cathodic and anodic processes.

First is the rate of the chemical reaction at the electrode, which consumes reactants and produces products. This is known as the ''charge transfer'' rate. The second is the rate at which reactants are provided, and products removed, from the electrode region by various processes including diffusion, migration, and convection. The latter is known as the ''[[mass transfer|mass-transfer]]'' rate{{refn|group=Note|For example, if the mass transfer rate is due to diffusion alone, there is a maximum rate at which reactants can be provided to the electrode, and therefore a maximum current possible, known as the [[limiting current]]. The limiting current, when the electrode process is highly [[mass transfer|mass-transfer]] controlled, the value of the current density is:\n:<math>j_{\\text{limiting}} = \\frac {zFD_{\\rm eff}} {\\delta} c^*</math>\nwhere: \n* D<sub>eff</sub> is the effective [[diffusion coefficient]] (taking [[tortuosity]] into account, if any);\n* \u03b4 is the diffusion layer thickness;\n* c<sup>*</sup> is the concentration of the electroactive (limiting) species in the bulk of the electrolyte.}}\n. These two rates determine the concentrations of the reactants and products at the electrode, which are in turn determined by them. The slowest of these rates will determine the overall rate of the process.\n\nThe simple Butler-Volmer equation assumes that the concentrations at the electrode are practically equal to the concentrations in the bulk electrolyte, allowing the current to be expressed as a function of potential only. In other words, it assumes that the mass transfer rate is much greater than the reaction rate, and that the reaction is dominated by the slower chemical reaction rate. Despite this limitation, the utility of the Butler\u2013Volmer equation in electrochemistry is wide, and it is often considered to be \"central in the phenomenological electrode kinetics\".<ref>J. O'M. Bockris, A.K.N.Reddy, and M. Gamboa-Aldeco, \"Modern Electrochemistry 2A. Fundamentals of Electrodics.\", Second Edition, Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, p.1083, 2000.</ref>\n\nThe extended Butler-Volmer equation does not make this assumption, but rather takes the concentrations at the electrode as given, yielding a relationship in which the current is expressed as a function not only of potential, but of the given concentrations as well. The mass-transfer rate may be relatively small, but its only effect on the chemical reaction is through the altered (given) concentrations. In effect, the concentrations are a function of the potential as well. A full treatment, which yields the current as a function of potential only, will be expressed by the extended Butler-Volmer equation, but will require explicit inclusion of mass transfer effects in order to express the concentrations as functions of the potential.\n\n=== Derivation ===\n\n==== General expression ====\n\n[[File:ButlerVolmerGibbsPlot.png|thumb|512 px|right|A plot of various Gibbs energies as a function of reaction coordinate.

The theoretical values of the Tafel equation constants are different for the cathodic and anodic processes. However, the Tafel slope <math>b</math> can be defined as:\n:<math>b = \\left ( \\frac{ \\partial E}{\\partial \\ln |I_{\\rm F}|} \\right)_{c_i,T,p}</math>\nwhere <math>I_{\\rm F}</math> is the faradaic current, expressed as <math>I_{\\rm F} = I_{\\rm c} + I_{\\rm a}</math>, being <math>I_{\\rm c}</math> and <math>I_{\\rm a}</math> the cathodic and anodic partial currents, respectively.\n\n== The extended Butler-Volmer equation ==\n\nThe more general form of the Butler\u2013Volmer equation, applicable to the mass transfer-influenced conditions, can be written as:<ref name=\"Bard2001\">{{cite book |last1=Bard |first1=Allen|last2=Faulkner |first2=Larry |date=2001 |title=Electrochemical Methods.

First is the rate of the chemical reaction at the electrode, which consumes reactants and produces products. This is known as the ''charge transfer'' rate. The second is the rate at which reactants are provided, and products removed, from the electrode region by various processes including diffusion, migration, and convection. The latter is known as the ''[[mass transfer|mass-transfer]]'' rate{{refn|group=Note|For example, if the mass transfer rate is due to diffusion alone, there is a maximum rate at which reactants can be provided to the electrode, and therefore a maximum current possible, known as the [[limiting current]]. The limiting current, when the electrode process is highly [[mass transfer|mass-transfer]] controlled, the value of the current density is:\n:<math>j_{\\text{limiting}} = \\frac {zFD_{\\rm eff}} {\\delta} c^*</math>\nwhere: \n* D<sub>eff</sub> is the effective [[diffusion coefficient]] (taking [[tortuosity]] into account, if any);\n* \u03b4 is the diffusion layer thickness;\n* c<sup>*</sup> is the concentration of the electroactive (limiting) species in the bulk of the electrolyte.}}\n. These two rates determine the concentrations of the reactants and products at the electrode, which are in turn determined by them. The slowest of these rates will determine the overall rate of the process.\n\nThe simple Butler-Volmer equation assumes that the concentrations at the electrode are practically equal to the concentrations in the bulk electrolyte, allowing the current to be expressed as a function of potential only. In other words, it assumes that the mass transfer rate is much greater than the reaction rate, and that the reaction is dominated by the slower chemical reaction rate. Despite this limitation, the utility of the Butler\u2013Volmer equation in electrochemistry is wide, and it is often considered to be \"central in the phenomenological electrode kinetics\".<ref>J. O'M. Bockris, A.K.N.Reddy, and M. Gamboa-Aldeco, \"Modern Electrochemistry 2A. Fundamentals of Electrodics.\", Second Edition, Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, p.1083, 2000.</ref>\n\nThe extended Butler-Volmer equation does not make this assumption, but rather takes the concentrations at the electrode as given, yielding a relationship in which the current is expressed as a function not only of potential, but of the given concentrations as well. The mass-transfer rate may be relatively small, but its only effect on the chemical reaction is through the altered (given) concentrations. In effect, the concentrations are a function of the potential as well. A full treatment, which yields the current as a function of potential only, will be expressed by the extended Butler-Volmer equation, but will require explicit inclusion of mass transfer effects in order to express the concentrations as functions of the potential.\n\n=== Derivation ===\n\n==== General expression ====\n\n[[File:ButlerVolmerGibbsPlot.png|thumb|512 px|right|A plot of various Gibbs energies as a function of reaction coordinate.

They are able to fly after six months, but continue to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and a wide variety of vocalizations, even though the condor has no voice box.\n\nOn the wing the movements of the condor are graceful. The lack of a large sternum to anchor correspondingly large flight muscles identifies it physiologically as a primary soarer. The birds flap their wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation they seem to sail on the air.\n\nWild condors inhabit large territories, often traveling {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} a day in search of carrion. They prefer large carcasses such as deer or cattle which they spot by looking for other scavengers, which cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of the larger condor. In the wild they are intermittent eaters, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several kilograms (pounds) at once, sometimes to the point of being unable to lift off the ground.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Other==\n{{See also|Andean condor#Role in culture}}\nThe [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of ancient [[Peru]] worshiped nature.<ref>Benson, Elizabeth.

The skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[File:Condor flying over the Colca canyon in Peru.jpg|thumb|right|Andean condor soars over southern [[Peru]]'s [[Colca Canyon]]]]\n[[File:California-condor.jpg|thumb|right|Immature California condor]]\nThe middle toe is greatly elongated, and the hinder one but slightly developed, while the talons of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt.

They are able to fly after six months, but continue to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and a wide variety of vocalizations, even though the condor has no voice box.\n\nOn the wing the movements of the condor are graceful. The lack of a large sternum to anchor correspondingly large flight muscles identifies it physiologically as a primary soarer. The birds flap their wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation they seem to sail on the air.\n\nWild condors inhabit large territories, often traveling {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} a day in search of carrion. They prefer large carcasses such as deer or cattle which they spot by looking for other scavengers, which cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of the larger condor. In the wild they are intermittent eaters, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several kilograms (pounds) at once, sometimes to the point of being unable to lift off the ground.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Other==\n{{See also|Andean condor#Role in culture}}\nThe [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of ancient [[Peru]] worshiped nature.<ref>Benson, Elizabeth.

He chose to focus on Australian rules football and began playing Australian rules football for the [[Southern Districts Football Club|Southern Districts]] club in the [[Northern Territory Football League]].\n\nFrancis moved to [[Adelaide]] in 1992 to play for Port Adelaide in the [[South Australian National Football League]].  Although he did not play a senior game for Port, Francis sufficiently impressed [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) club [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] to draft him.\n\n==AFL career==\nFrancis made his AFL debut with Melbourne in 1993.  \n\nFrancis did not enjoy living in Melbourne and after one season returned to Darwin to play rugby league.  \n\n[[Brisbane Bears Football Club|Brisbane]] coach [[Robert Walls]] convinced Francis to return to Australian rules with the [[Brisbane Bears]] and Francis played for Brisbane from 1994-95.

He returned to Port Adelaide for the 1996 season, where he played in Port's premiership winning [[1996 SANFL Grand Final]] side and was runner-up in the [[Magarey Medal]].

Soon after being appointed coach of the [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]] for the 2002 season, [[Chris Connolly]] suggested that Francis could be drafted by the Dockers with their number one selection at the upcoming preseason draft. A deal was soon struck between Fremantle and Francis, that he would be drafted, and he moved from [[Adelaide]] to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], with his family, and began training with the Dockers. Shortly before the preseason draft, the AFL informed Fremantle that they had exceeded Total Player Payments (TPP) for season 2001 - despite finishing last with only two wins for the year, and they would be barred from the upcoming draft, preventing them from selecting Francis. It is understood that the breach of TPP occurred due to an excess of injury payments - several regular players had been injured and a greater than expected number of players on match payments had needed to be played.\n\nFremantle then struck a deal with a clearly upset and disillusioned Francis, that he play the 2002 season in the [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] for [[South Fremantle Football Club|South Fremantle]], and then be guaranteed to be drafted by Fremantle in the 2002 AFL draft.<ref>Wilson, C.
