Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of [[robot]]s. The goal of robotics is to design intelligent machines that can help and assist humans in their day-to-day lives and keep everyone safe. Robotics draws on the achievement of [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[computer engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electronic engineering]] and others.\n\nRobotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations and for lots of purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, [[bomb detection]] and [[bomb disposal|deactivation]]), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of [[bio-inspired robotics]].\n\nThe concept of creating machines that can operate [[Autonomous robot|autonomously]] dates back to [[classical times]], but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians  that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether [[domestic robot|domestically]], [[industrial robot|commercially]], or [[military robot|militarily]]. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks. Robotics is also used in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] (science, [[technology]], engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Nocks | first1 = Lisa | title = The robot : the life story of a technology | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2007 | location = Westport, CT}}</ref> The advent of nanorobots, microscopic robots that can be injected into the human body, could revolutionize medicine and human health.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/technology/researchers-make-a-million-tiny-robots|title=Researchers make a million tiny robots|last=Carne|first=Nick|date=March 8, 2019|magazine=[[Cosmos Magazine]]|accessdate=March 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRobotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots.

(Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'', which was published in 1920.<ref name=\"KapekWebsite\">{{cite web|url=http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123023343/http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html|archive-date=2013-01-23|url-status=dead|first=Dominik| last=Zunt|title=Who did actually invent the word \"robot\" and what does it mean?|publisher=The Karel \u010capek website|accessdate=2017-02-05}}</ref> The word ''robot'' comes from the Slavic word ''robota'', which means slave/servant. The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called ''robots'', creatures who can be mistaken for humans \u2013 very similar to the modern ideas of [[Android (robot)|androids]]. Karel \u010capek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an [[etymology]] in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in which he named his brother [[Josef Capek|Josef \u010capek]] as its actual originator.<ref name=\"KapekWebsite\"/>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word ''robotics'' was first used in print by [[Isaac Asimov]], in his [[science fiction]] short story ''[[Liar! (short story)|\"Liar!\"]]'', published in May 1941 in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]''. Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term; since the science and technology of electrical devices is ''electronics'', he assumed ''robotics'' already referred to the science and technology of robots. In some of Asimov's other works, he states that the first use of the word ''robotics'' was in his short story ''[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]'' ([[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]], March 1942),<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Asimov\n  | first = Isaac\n  | authorlink = Isaac Asimov\n  | title = Gold\n  | publisher =Voyager <!-- was Eos -->\n  | year =1996 <!-- was 2003 --> |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-648202-4 |pages=224\u2013225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Counting the Eons |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |year=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented \u2026 the word |title-link=Counting the Eons |bibcode=1983coeo.book.....A }}</ref> where he introduced his concept of [[Three Laws of Robotics|The Three Laws of Robotics]]. However, the original publication of \"Liar!\" predates that of \"Runaround\" by ten months, so the former is generally cited as the word's origin.\n\n==History{{anchor|History_of_robotics}}==\n{{see also|History of robots}}\nIn 1948, [[Norbert Wiener]] formulated the principles of [[cybernetics]], the basis of practical robotics.\n\nFully [[autonomous]] only appeared in the second half of the 20th century. The first digitally operated and programmable robot, the [[Unimate]], was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a [[Die casting|die casting machine]] and stack them. Commercial and [[industrial robot]]s are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply, more accurately and more reliably, than humans. They are also employed in some jobs which are too dirty, dangerous, or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in [[manufacturing]], assembly, packing and packaging, mining, transport, earth and [[space exploration]], surgery, weaponry, [[Laboratory|laboratory research]], safety, and the [[mass production]] of [[consumer goods|consumer]] and [[Industrial marketing|industrial goods]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/robotics/universal/index.html\n |title       = Robotics: About the Exhibition\n |publisher   = The Tech Museum of Innovation\n |accessdate  = 2008-09-15\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080913160743/http://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/robotics/universal/index.html\n |archivedate = 2008-09-13\n |df          =\n}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Although being very diverse in application and form, they all share three basic similarities when it comes to their construction:\n# Robots all have some kind of mechanical construction, a frame, form or shape designed to achieve a particular task. For example, a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud, might use [[caterpillar tracks]]. The mechanical aspect is mostly the creator's solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it. Form follows function.\n# Robots have electrical components which power and control the machinery. For example, the robot with [[caterpillar tracks]] would need some kind of power to move the tracker treads. That power comes in the form of electricity, which will have to travel through a wire and originate from a battery, a basic [[electrical circuit]]. Even petrol powered [[machines]] that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol powered machines like cars, have batteries. The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound, position, and energy status) and operation (robots need some level of [[electrical energy]] supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations)\n# All robots contain some level of [[computer programming]] code. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly constructed its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence and hybrid. A robot with [[remote control]] programing has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with a remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use [[artificial intelligence]] interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. Hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions.\n\n== Applications ==\nAs more and more robots are designed for specific tasks this method of classification becomes more relevant. For example, many robots are designed for assembly work, which may not be readily adaptable for other applications. They are termed as \"assembly robots\". For seam welding, some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot i.e. the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables, etc. as an integrated unit. Such an integrated robotic system is called a \"welding robot\" even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks. Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation, and are labeled as \"heavy-duty robots\".<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpXbBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA141|chapter=Smart Robots|title=Smart Robots: A Handbook of Intelligent Robotic Systems|last=Hunt|first=V.

Many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots. They range from lead\u2013acid batteries, which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver\u2013cadmium batteries that are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive. Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime and [[weight]]. Generators, often some type of [[internal combustion engine]], can also be used. However, such designs are often mechanically complex and need a fuel, require heat dissipation and are relatively heavy. A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely. This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere. However, this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot, which can be difficult to manage.<ref name=\"Robot Power supply Sources\">{{cite web|last=Dowling|first=Kevin|title=Power Sources for Small Robots|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/motionplanning/papers/sbp_papers/integrated1/dowling_power_sources.pdf|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> Potential power sources could be:\n* [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] (compressed gases)\n* [[Solar power]] (using the sun's energy and converting it into electrical power)\n* [[hydraulic]]s (liquids)\n* [[flywheel energy storage]]\n* organic garbage (through [[anaerobic digestion]])\n* [[nuclear power|nuclear]]\n\n===Actuation===\n{{Main|Actuator}}\n[[File:2005-11-14 ShadowLeg Finished medium.jpg|thumb|A [[robot leg|robotic leg]] powered by [[Pneumatic artificial muscles|air muscles]] ]]\n\nActuators are the \"[[muscle]]s\" of a robot, the parts which convert [[potential energy|stored energy]] into movement.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Design Optimisation and Control of Compliant Actuation Arrangements in Articulated Robots for Improved Energy Efficiency|journal= IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters|volume = 1|issue=2|pages = 1110\u20131117|last1 = Roozing|first1 = Wesley|last2 = Li|first2 = Zhibin|last3 =Tsagarakis|first3 = Nikos| last4=Caldwell |first4 = Darwin| year = 2016| doi=10.1109/LRA.2016.2521926 }}</ref> By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear, and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories. There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators, powered by electricity, chemicals, or compressed air.\n\n==== Electric motors ====\n{{Main|Electric motor}}\nThe vast majority of robots use electric motors, often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and [[numerical control|CNC]] machines. These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational.\n\n==== Linear actuators ====\n{{Main|Linear actuator}}\nVarious types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning, and often have quicker direction changes, particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics. They are typically powered by compressed and oxidized air ([[pneumatic actuator]]) or an oil ([[Hydraulic drive system|hydraulic actuator]]) Linear actuators can also be powered by electricity which usually consists of a motor and a leadscrew. Another common type is a mechanical linear actuator that is turned by hand, such as a rack and pinion on a car.\n\n==== Series elastic actuators ====\nA flexure is designed as part of the motor actuator, to improve safety and provide robust force control, energy efficiency, shock absorption (mechanical filtering) while reducing excessive wear on the transmission and other mechanical components.

As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences and views from cameras.\n\nIn most practical computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common.\n\nComputer vision systems rely on image sensors which detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] or [[infra-red light]]. The sensors are designed using [[solid-state physics]]. The process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained using [[optics]]. Sophisticated image sensors even require [[quantum mechanics]] to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Robots can also be equipped with multiple vision sensors to be better able to compute the sense of depth in the environment. Like human eyes, robots' \"eyes\" must also be able to focus on a particular area of interest, and also adjust to variations in light intensities.\n\nThere is a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of [[biological system]], at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision have their background in biology.\n\n====Other====\nOther common forms of sensing in robotics use [[lidar]], [[radar]], and [[sonar]]<ref name=\"Automation and Robotics\">{{cite book | last1=Arreguin | first1= Juan | title = Automation and Robotics | url=https://archive.org/details/ost-engineering-automation-and-robotics | publisher = I-Tech and Publishing | year= 2008 | location= Vienna, Austria}}</ref>.

Several robots have been made which can walk reliably on two legs, however, none have yet been made which are as robust as a human. There has been much study on human inspired walking, such as AMBER lab which was established in 2008 by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bipedalrobotics.com|title=AMBER Lab}}</ref> Many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs, due to these robots being significantly easier to construct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hexapodrobot.com/index.html|title=Micromagic Systems Robotics Lab}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mecatron.rma.ac.be/pub/2005/ISMCR05_verlinden.pdf|title=AMRU-5 hexapod robot}}</ref> Walking robots can be used for uneven terrains, which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods. Typically, robots on two legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up [[stairway|stairs]]. None can walk over rocky, uneven terrain. Some of the methods which have been tried are:\n\n===== ZMP technique =====\n{{Main|Zero moment point}}\nThe zero moment point (ZMP) is the algorithm used by robots such as [[Honda]]'s [[ASIMO]]. The robot's onboard computer tries to keep the total [[inertia|inertial forces]] (the combination of [[Earth]]'s [[gravitation|gravity]] and the [[acceleration]] and deceleration of walking), exactly opposed by the floor [[reaction (physics)|reaction force]] (the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot). In this way, the two forces cancel out, leaving no [[moment (physics)|moment]] (force causing the robot to rotate and fall over).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.honda.com/ASIMO/history/technology2.html|publisher=Honda Worldwide|title=Achieving Stable Walking|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> However, this is not exactly how a human walks, and the difference is obvious to human observers, some of whom have pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs the [[toilet|lavatory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pootergeek.com/2004/12/funny-walk/|title=Funny Walk|publisher=Pooter Geek|date=2004-12-28|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://popsci.typepad.com/ces2007/2007/01/asimos_pimp_shu.html |title=ASIMO's Pimp Shuffle|magazine=Popular Science|date=2007-01-09|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://motegi.vtec.net/forums/one-message?message_id=131434&news_item_id=129834|title=The Temple of VTEC \u2013 Honda and Acura Enthusiasts Online Forums > Robot Shows Prime Minister How to Loosen Up > > A drunk robot?}}</ref> ASIMO's walking algorithm is not static, and some dynamic balancing is used (see below). However, it still requires a smooth surface to walk on.\n\n===== Hopping =====\nSeveral robots, built in the 1980s by [[Marc Raibert]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Leg Laboratory, successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking. Initially, a robot with only one leg, and a very small foot could stay upright simply by [[wikt:hop|hopping]]. The movement is the same as that of a person on a [[pogo stick]]. As the robot falls to one side, it would jump slightly in that direction, in order to catch itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/3D_hopper/3D_hopper.html|publisher=MIT Leg Laboratory|title=3D One-Leg Hopper (1983\u20131984)|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> Soon, the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs.

It has been shown that totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using only [[gravitation|gravity]] to propel themselves. Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a [[hill]]. This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Steve|last=Collins|author2=Wisse, Martijn |author3=Ruina, Andy |author4= Tedrake, Russ |title=Efficient bipedal robots based on passive-dynamic Walkers|journal=Science|issue= 5712|pages=1082\u20131085|date=2005-02-11|url=http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/papers/efficient_bipedal_robots/efficient_bipedal_robots.pdf\n|accessdate=2007-09-11|doi=10.1126/science.1107799|volume=307|pmid=15718465 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622225310/http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/papers/efficient_bipedal_robots/efficient_bipedal_robots.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-22|bibcode=2005Sci...307.1082C}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference|first=Steve|last=Collins|author2=Ruina, Andy |url=http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/papers/efficient_bipedal_robots/bipedal_walking_robot_cornell.pdf\n|title=A bipedal walking robot with efficient and human-like gait|booktitle=Proc.

An example of this is Capuchin,<ref>{{YouTube|JzHasc4Vhm8|Capuchin}}</ref> built by Dr. Ruixiang Zhang at Stanford University, California. Another approach uses the specialized toe pad method of wall-climbing [[gecko]]es, which can run on smooth surfaces such as vertical glass. Examples of this approach include Wallbot<ref>{{YouTube|Tq8Yw19bn7Q|Wallbot}}</ref> and Stickybot.<ref>{{YouTube|k2kZk6riGWU|Stanford University: Stickybot}}</ref> China's ''Technology Daily'' reported on November 15, 2008, that Dr. Li Hiu Yeung and his research group of New Concept Aircraft ([[Zhuhai]]) Co., Ltd. had successfully developed a bionic gecko robot named \"[[Mechanical Gecko|Speedy Freelander]]\". According to Dr. Li, the gecko robot could rapidly climb up and down a variety of building walls, navigate through ground and wall fissures, and walk upside-down on the ceiling. It was also able to adapt to the surfaces of smooth glass, rough, sticky or dusty walls as well as various types of metallic materials. It could also identify and circumvent obstacles automatically.

A typical sailboat robot is ''[[Vaimos]]''<ref>\n{{cite journal|last1=Jaulin|first1=L.|last2=Le Bars|first2=F.|\nyear=2012|title=An interval approach for stability analysis; Application to sailboat robotics|journal=IEEE Transactions on Robotics|volume=27|issue=5|url=http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/paper_checking.pdf}}</ref> built by IFREMER and ENSTA-Bretagne. Since the propulsion of sailboat robots uses the wind, the energy of the batteries is only used for the computer, for the communication and for the actuators (to tune the rudder and the sail). If the robot is equipped with solar panels, the robot could theoretically navigate forever. The two main competitions of sailboat robots are [[WRSC (World Robotic Sailing Championship)|WRSC]], which takes place every year in Europe, and [http://www.sailbot.org/ Sailbot].\n\n===Environmental interaction and navigation===\n{{Main|Robotic mapping|Robotic navigation}}\n[[File:ElementBlack2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Radar, [[GPS]], and [[lidar]], are all combined to provide proper navigation and [[obstacle avoidance]] (vehicle developed for 2007 [[DARPA Urban Challenge]])]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\nThough a significant percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment, there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. These robots require some combination of [[Robotic mapping|navigation hardware and software]] in order to traverse their environment. In particular, unforeseen events (e.g. people and other obstacles that are not stationary) can cause problems or collisions. Some highly advanced robots such as [[ASIMO]] and [[Mein\u00fc robot]] have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software. Also, [[Intelligent car|self-controlled cars]], [[Ernst Dickmanns]]' [[driverless car]], and the entries in the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]], are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information, including by a swarm of autonomous robots.<ref name=\"Search and foraging\"/> Most of these robots employ a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] navigation device with waypoints, along with [[radar]], sometimes combined with other sensory data such as [[lidar]], [[video camera]]s, and [[inertial guidance system]]s for better navigation between waypoints.\n\n===Human-robot interaction===\n{{main|Human-robot interaction}}\n[[File:Kismet-IMG 6007-gradient.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] can produce a range of facial expressions.]]\nThe state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through [[speech]], [[gesture]]s, and [[facial expression]]s, rather than a [[command-line interface]]. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably be a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional [[C-3PO]], or [[Star Trek|Data of Star Trek, Next Generation]].\n\n==== Speech recognition ====\n{{Main|Speech recognition}}\nInterpreting the continuous flow of [[sound]]s coming from a human, in [[real-time computing|real time]], is a difficult task for a computer, mostly because of the great variability of [[Manner of articulation|speech]].<ref>J.

In both of these cases, making hand [[gesture]]s would aid the verbal descriptions. In the first case, the robot would be recognizing gestures made by the human, and perhaps repeating them for confirmation. In the second case, the robot police officer would gesture to indicate \"down the road, then turn right\". It is likely that gestures will make up a part of the interaction between humans and robots.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/waldherr.gestures-journal.pdf|title=A Gesture Based Interface for Human-Robot Interaction|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|author=Waldherr, Romero & Thrun|year=2000| accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> A great many systems have been developed to recognize human hand gestures.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ls7-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de:81/research/gesture/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711151910/http://ls7-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de:81/research/gesture/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-11|title=Vision Based Hand Gesture Recognition Systems|journal=Applied Mechanics and Materials|volume=263-266|pages=2422\u20132425|author=Markus Kohler|publisher=University of Dortmund|accessdate=2007-10-28|bibcode=2012AMM...263.2422L|year=2012|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.263-266.2422}}</ref>\n\n==== Facial expression ====\n{{Further|Emotion recognition}}\nFacial expressions can provide rapid feedback on the progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may be able to do the same for humans and robots. Robotic faces have been constructed by [[David Hanson (robotics designer)|Hanson Robotics]] using their elastic polymer called [[Frubber]], allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors ([[servomechanism|servos]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hansonrobotics.com/innovations.html|title=Frubber facial expressions|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207121306/http://hansonrobotics.com/innovations.html|archivedate=2009-02-07|df=}}</ref> The coating and servos are built on a metal [[human skull|skull]]. A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression and [[body language]]. Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot. Likewise, robots like [[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] and the more recent addition, Nexi<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854195_1854135,00.html|title=Best Inventions of 2008 \u2013 TIME|journal=Time|date=29 October 2008|via=www.time.com}}</ref> can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samogden.com/Kismet.html|title=Kismet: Robot at MIT's AI Lab Interacts With Humans|publisher=Sam Ogden|accessdate=2007-10-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012035539/http://samogden.com/Kismet.html|archivedate=2007-10-12|df=}}</ref>\n\n==== Artificial emotions ====\nArtificial emotions can also be generated, composed of a sequence of facial expressions and/or gestures. As can be seen from the movie [[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]], the programming of these artificial emotions is complex and requires a large amount of human observation. To simplify this programming in the movie, presets were created together with a special software program. This decreased the amount of time needed to make the film. These presets could possibly be transferred for use in real-life robots.\n\n==== Personality ====\nMany of the robots of science fiction have a [[Personality psychology|personality]], something which may or may not be desirable in the commercial robots of the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/GI2005/Posters/GI_abstract.pdf|title=(Park et al. 2005) Synthetic Personality in Robots and its Effect on Human-Robot Relationship}}</ref> Nevertheless, researchers are trying to create robots which appear to have a personality:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5067678|title=Robot Receptionist Dishes Directions and Attitude}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://viterbi.usc.edu/tools/download/?asset=/assets/023/49186.pdf&name=nsmaja.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060929205205/http://viterbi.usc.edu/tools/download/?asset=/assets/023/49186.pdf&name=nsmaja.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-09-29|title=New Scientist: A good robot has personality but not looks}}</ref> i.e. they use sounds, facial expressions, and body language to try to convey an internal state, which may be joy, sadness, or fear. One commercial example is [[Pleo]], a toy robot dinosaur, which can exhibit several apparent emotions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/caleb_chung_plays_with_pleo#t-17244|title=Playtime with Pleo, your robotic dinosaur friend}}</ref>\n\n==== Social Intelligence ====\nThe Socially Intelligent Machines Lab of the  [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] researches new concepts of guided teaching interaction with robots. The aim of the projects is a social robot that learns task and goals from human demonstrations without prior knowledge of high-level concepts. These new concepts are grounded from low-level continuous sensor data through [[unsupervised machine learning|unsupervised learning]], and task goals are subsequently learned using a Bayesian approach. These concepts can be used to transfer knowledge to future tasks, resulting in faster learning of those tasks. The results are demonstrated by the robot ''Curi'' who can scoop some pasta from a pot onto a plate and serve the sauce on top.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/meet-woman-who-trains-robots-living|title=Meet a woman who trains robots for a living|date=October 31, 2014|author=Jennifer Bogo}}</ref>\n\n==Control==\n[[File:Magnus B. Egerstedt puppet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Puppet Magnus]], a robot-manipulated marionette with complex control systems.]]\n[[File:RuBot II.jpg|thumb|right|[[RuBot II]] can manually resolve Rubik's cubes.]]\n{{Further|Control system}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\n\nThe [[machine|mechanical]] structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. The control of a robot involves three distinct phases \u2013 perception, processing, and action ([[robotic paradigms]]). [[Sensor]]s give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its end effector). This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators ([[Electric motor|motors]]) which move the mechanical.\n\nThe processing phase can range in complexity. At a reactive level, it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands. [[Sensor fusion]] may first be used to estimate parameters of interest (e.g. the position of the robot's gripper) from noisy sensor data. An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction) is inferred from these estimates. Techniques from [[control theory]] convert the task into commands that drive the actuators.\n\nAt longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a \"cognitive\" model. Cognitive models try to represent the robot, the world, and how they interact. Pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects. [[Simultaneous localization and mapping|Mapping]] techniques can be used to build maps of the world. Finally, [[motion planning]] and other [[artificial intelligence]] techniques may be used to figure out how to act. For example, a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles, falling over, etc.\n\n===Autonomy levels===\n[[File:TOPIO 3.jpg|thumb|[[TOPIO]], a [[humanoid robot]], played [[ping pong]] at Tokyo IREX 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-02/ping-pong-playing-terminator|title=A Ping-Pong-Playing Terminator|magazine=Popular Science}}</ref>]]\nControl systems may also have varying levels of autonomy.\n# Direct interaction is used for [[haptic technology|haptic]] or teleoperated devices, and the human has nearly complete control over the robot's motion.\n# Operator-assist modes have the operator commanding medium-to-high-level tasks, with the robot automatically figuring out how to achieve them.\n# An autonomous robot may go without human interaction for extended periods of time . Higher levels of autonomy do not necessarily require more complex cognitive capabilities. For example, robots in assembly plants are completely autonomous but operate in a fixed pattern.\n\nAnother classification takes into account the interaction between human control and the machine motions.\n# [[Teleoperation]]. A human controls each movement, each machine actuator change is specified by the operator.\n# Supervisory. A human specifies general moves or position changes and the machine decides specific movements of its actuators.\n# Task-level autonomy. The operator specifies only the task and the robot manages itself to complete it.\n# Full autonomy. The machine will create and complete all its tasks without human interaction.\n\n==Research==\n{{Further|Open-source robotics|Evolutionary robotics|Areas of robotics|Robotics simulator}}\n[[File:PIA15279 3rovers-stand D2011 1215 D521.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Two [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] engineers stand with three vehicles, providing a size comparison of three generations of Mars rovers.

Other investigations, such as MIT's [[cyberflora]] project, are almost wholly academic.\n\nA first particular new innovation in robot design is the open sourcing of robot-projects. To describe the level of advancement of a robot, the term \"Generation Robots\" can be used. This term is coined by Professor [[Hans Moravec]], Principal Research Scientist at the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] [[Robotics Institute]] in describing the near future evolution of robot technology. ''First generation'' robots, Moravec predicted in 1997, should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps a [[lizard]] and should become available by 2010. Because the ''first generation'' robot would be incapable of [[learning]], however, Moravec predicts that the ''second generation'' robot would be an improvement over the ''first'' and become available by 2020, with the intelligence maybe comparable to that of a [[mouse]]. The ''third generation'' robot should have the intelligence comparable to that of a [[monkey]]. Though ''fourth generation'' robots, robots with [[human]] intelligence, professor Moravec predicts, would become possible, he does not predict this happening before around 2040 or 2050.<ref>[[Nova (American TV series)|NOVA]] conversation with Professor Moravec, October, 1997. ''[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/robots/moravec.html NOVA Online]''</ref>\n\nThe second is [[Evolutionary robotics|evolutionary robots]]. This is a [[methodology]] that uses [[evolutionary computation]] to help design robots, especially the body form, or motion and behavior [[controller (control theory)|controllers]]. In a similar way to [[evolution|natural evolution]], a large population of robots is allowed to compete in some way, or their ability to perform a task is measured using a [[fitness function]]. Those that perform worst are removed from the population and replaced by a new set, which have new behaviors based on those of the winners. Over time the population improves, and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear. This happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers. Researchers use this method both to create better robots,<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/09/54900|publisher=Wired Magazine|title=A Theory of Evolution, for Robots|journal=Wired|first=Lakshmi|last=Sandhana|date=2002-09-05|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> and to explore the nature of evolution.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070222155713.htm|publisher=Science Daily|title=Experimental Evolution In Robots Probes The Emergence Of Biological Communication|date=2007-02-24|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> Because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated,<ref>{{cite journal|first=Leon|last=\u017dlajpah|title=Simulation in robotics|journal=Mathematics and Computers in Simulation|issue=4|pages=879\u2013897|date=2008-12-15|doi=10.1016/j.matcom.2008.02.017|volume=79}}</ref> this technique may be run entirely or mostly in [[simulation]], using a [[robot simulator]] software package, then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/2004/051904/Evolution_trains_robot_teams_051904.html|title=Evolution trains robot teams TRN 051904|first=Technology Research|last=News|website=www.trnmag.com}}</ref> Currently, there are about 10 million industrial robots toiling around the world, and Japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industry.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Dynamics and kinematics===\n{{further|Kinematics|Dynamics (mechanics)}}\n{{externalvideo|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FHtcR78GA0 How the BB-8 Sphero Toy Works]}}\nThe study of motion can be divided into [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]].<ref>{{cite book|first=P.K.|last=Agarwal|title=Elements of Physics XI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEVnsSy0yF8C&pg=SA2-PA3|publisher=Rastogi Publications|isbn=978-81-7133-911-2|page=2}}</ref> Direct kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, [[velocity]], and [[acceleration]] when the corresponding joint values are known. [[Inverse kinematics]] refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), [[collision]] avoidance, and [[Mechanical singularity|singularity]] avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using [[kinematics]], methods from the field of [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] are used to study the effect of [[force]]s upon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used in [[computer simulation]]s of the robot. [[Inverse dynamics]] refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end-effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.\n\nIn each area mentioned above, researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies, improve existing ones, and improve the interaction between these areas. To do this, criteria for \"optimal\" performance and ways to optimize design, structure, and control of robots must be developed and implemented.\n\n=== Bionics and biomimetics ===\n[[Bionics]] and [[biomimetics]] apply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots.  For example, the design of [[BionicKangaroo]] was based on the way kangaroos jump.\n\n===Quantum computing===\nThere has been some research into whether robotics algorithms can be run more quickly on [[quantum computers]] than they can be run on [[digital computers]]. This area has been referred to as quantum robotics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Quantum Robotics|last=Tandon|first=Prateek|publisher=Morgan & Claypool Publishers|year=2017|isbn=978-1627059138|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Education and training==\n{{Main|Educational robotics}}\n[[File:ER4u.jpg|thumb|The [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]] educational robot]]\nRobotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=139 | title = Career: Robotics Engineer | accessdate = 2012-01-27 | year = 2012 | work = Princeton Review}}</ref> Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, particularly in parts of the [[United States of America|USA]],<ref name=ACM-SE12>{{cite conference  |title=Hands-on Learning of Programming Concepts Using Robotics for Middle and High School Students |first1=Ashraf |last1=Saad |first2=Ryan |last2=Kroutil |conference=Proceedings of the 50th Annual Southeast Regional Conference of the Association for Computer Machinery |publisher=ACM |pages=361\u2013362 |doi=10.1145/2184512.2184605 |date=2012 }}</ref> as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence, and robotics among students.\n\n===Career training===\n[[University|Universities]] offer [[Bachelor's degree|bachelors]], [[Master's degree|masters]], and [[Doctorate|doctoral degrees]] in the field of robotics.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wpi.edu/academics/robotics/ | title = Robotics Degree Programs at Worcester Polytechnic Institute | accessdate = 2013-04-12 | year = 2013 | work = Worcester Polytechnic Institute}}</ref> [[Vocational school]]s offer robotics training aimed at careers in robotics.\n\n===Certification===\nThe [[Robotics Certification Standards Alliance|Robotics Certification Standards Alliance (RCSA)]] is an international robotics certification authority that confers various industry- and educational-related robotics certifications.\n\n===Summer robotics camp===\nSeveral national summer camp programs include robotics as part of their core curriculum. In addition, youth summer robotics programs are frequently offered by celebrated museums and institutions.\n\n=== Robotics competitions ===\n{{Main|Robot competition}}\nThere are lots of competitions all around the globe. The [[SeaPerch]] curriculum is aimed as students of all ages.  This is a short list of competition examples; for a more complete list see [[Robot competition]].\n\n====Competitions for Younger Children====\nThe FIRST organization offers the [[FIRST Lego League Jr.]] competitions for younger children.  This competition's goal is to offer younger children an opportunity to start learning about science and technology.  Children in this competition build Lego models and have the option of using the Lego WeDo robotics kit.\n\n====Competitions for Children Ages 9-14====\nOne of the most important competitions is the FLL or [[FIRST Lego League]]. The idea of this specific competition is that kids start developing knowledge and getting into robotics while playing with [[Lego]] since they are 9 years old. This competition is associated with [[National Instruments]]. Children use [[Lego Mindstorms]] to solve autonomous robotics challenges in this competition.\n\n====Competitions for Teenagers====\n{{Main|FIRST}}\nThe [[FIRST Tech Challenge]] is designed for intermediate students, as a transition from the [[FIRST Lego League]] to the [[FIRST Robotics Competition]].\n\nThe [[FIRST Robotics Competition]] focuses more on mechanical design, with a specific game being played each year. Robots are built specifically for that year's game. In match play, the robot moves autonomously during the first 15 seconds of the game (although certain years such as 2019's Deep Space change this rule), and is manually operated for the rest of the match.\n\n====Competitions for Older Students====\nThe various [[RoboCup]] competitions include teams of teenagers and university students.  These competitions focus on soccer competitions with different types of robots, dance competitions, and urban search and rescue competitions.  All of the robots in these competitions must be autonomous.  Some of these competitions focus on simulated robots.\n\nAUVSI runs competitions for [[International Aerial Robotics Competition|flying robots]], [[Unmanned surface vehicle|robot boats]], and [[RoboSub|underwater robots]].\n\nThe Student AUV Competition Europe <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sauc-europe.org/|title=Student AUV Competition Europe}}</ref> (SAUC-E) mainly attracts undergraduate and graduate student teams.  As in the AUVSI competitions, the robots must be fully autonomous while they are participating in the competition.\n\n[[The Microtransat Challenge]] is a competition to sail a boat across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n====Competitions Open to Anyone====\n[[RoboGames]] is open to anyone wishing to compete in their over 50 categories of robot competitions.\n\n[[Federation of International Robot-soccer Association]] holds the FIRA World Cup competitions.  There are flying robot competitions, robot soccer competitions, and other challenges, including weightlifting barbells made from dowels and CDs.\n\n===Robotics afterschool programs===\nMany schools across the country are beginning to add robotics programs to their after school curriculum. Some major programs for afterschool robotics include [[FIRST Robotics Competition]], [[Botball]] and B.E.S.T. Robotics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestinc.org/|title=B.E.S.T.

In space, defence, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance, and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers' exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, ergonomic and psychosocial risks. For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres. In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services.<ref>{{cite news|title=Robotics: Redefining crime prevention, public safety and security|url=http://www.sourcesecurity.com/news/articles/robotics-redefining-crime-prevention-public-safety-security-co-12903-ga-co-14203-ga.21083.html|publisher=SourceSecurity.com}}</ref>\n\nDespite these advances, there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility, and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in [[collaborative robots]] and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the \"man-robot merger\". Some European countries are including robotics in their national programmes and trying to promote a safe and flexible co-operation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity. For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ([[BAuA]]) organises annual workshops on the topic \"human-robot collaboration\".\n\nIn the future, co-operation between robots and humans will be diversified, with robots increasing their autonomy and human-robot collaboration reaching completely new forms.

Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of [[robot]]s. The goal of robotics is to design intelligent machines that can help and assist humans in their day-to-day lives and keep everyone safe. Robotics draws on the achievement of [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[computer engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electronic engineering]] and others.\n\nRobotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations and for lots of purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, [[bomb detection]] and [[bomb disposal|deactivation]]), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of [[bio-inspired robotics]].\n\nThe concept of creating machines that can operate [[Autonomous robot|autonomously]] dates back to [[classical times]], but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians  that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether [[domestic robot|domestically]], [[industrial robot|commercially]], or [[military robot|militarily]]. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks. Robotics is also used in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] (science, [[technology]], engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Nocks | first1 = Lisa | title = The robot : the life story of a technology | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2007 | location = Westport, CT}}</ref> The advent of nanorobots, microscopic robots that can be injected into the human body, could revolutionize medicine and human health.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/technology/researchers-make-a-million-tiny-robots|title=Researchers make a million tiny robots|last=Carne|first=Nick|date=March 8, 2019|magazine=[[Cosmos Magazine]]|accessdate=March 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRobotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots.

(Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'', which was published in 1920.<ref name=\"KapekWebsite\">{{cite web|url=http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123023343/http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html|archive-date=2013-01-23|url-status=dead|first=Dominik| last=Zunt|title=Who did actually invent the word \"robot\" and what does it mean?|publisher=The Karel \u010capek website|accessdate=2017-02-05}}</ref> The word ''robot'' comes from the Slavic word ''robota'', which means slave/servant. The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called ''robots'', creatures who can be mistaken for humans \u2013 very similar to the modern ideas of [[Android (robot)|androids]]. Karel \u010capek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an [[etymology]] in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in which he named his brother [[Josef Capek|Josef \u010capek]] as its actual originator.<ref name=\"KapekWebsite\"/>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word ''robotics'' was first used in print by [[Isaac Asimov]], in his [[science fiction]] short story ''[[Liar! (short story)|\"Liar!\"]]'', published in May 1941 in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]''. Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term; since the science and technology of electrical devices is ''electronics'', he assumed ''robotics'' already referred to the science and technology of robots. In some of Asimov's other works, he states that the first use of the word ''robotics'' was in his short story ''[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]'' ([[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]], March 1942),<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Asimov\n  | first = Isaac\n  | authorlink = Isaac Asimov\n  | title = Gold\n  | publisher =Voyager <!-- was Eos -->\n  | year =1996 <!-- was 2003 --> |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-648202-4 |pages=224\u2013225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Counting the Eons |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |year=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented \u2026 the word |title-link=Counting the Eons |bibcode=1983coeo.book.....A }}</ref> where he introduced his concept of [[Three Laws of Robotics|The Three Laws of Robotics]]. However, the original publication of \"Liar!\" predates that of \"Runaround\" by ten months, so the former is generally cited as the word's origin.\n\n==History{{anchor|History_of_robotics}}==\n{{see also|History of robots}}\nIn 1948, [[Norbert Wiener]] formulated the principles of [[cybernetics]], the basis of practical robotics.\n\nFully [[autonomous]] only appeared in the second half of the 20th century. The first digitally operated and programmable robot, the [[Unimate]], was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a [[Die casting|die casting machine]] and stack them. Commercial and [[industrial robot]]s are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply, more accurately and more reliably, than humans. They are also employed in some jobs which are too dirty, dangerous, or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in [[manufacturing]], assembly, packing and packaging, mining, transport, earth and [[space exploration]], surgery, weaponry, [[Laboratory|laboratory research]], safety, and the [[mass production]] of [[consumer goods|consumer]] and [[Industrial marketing|industrial goods]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/robotics/universal/index.html\n |title       = Robotics: About the Exhibition\n |publisher   = The Tech Museum of Innovation\n |accessdate  = 2008-09-15\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080913160743/http://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/robotics/universal/index.html\n |archivedate = 2008-09-13\n |df          =\n}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Although being very diverse in application and form, they all share three basic similarities when it comes to their construction:\n# Robots all have some kind of mechanical construction, a frame, form or shape designed to achieve a particular task. For example, a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud, might use [[caterpillar tracks]]. The mechanical aspect is mostly the creator's solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it. Form follows function.\n# Robots have electrical components which power and control the machinery. For example, the robot with [[caterpillar tracks]] would need some kind of power to move the tracker treads. That power comes in the form of electricity, which will have to travel through a wire and originate from a battery, a basic [[electrical circuit]]. Even petrol powered [[machines]] that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol powered machines like cars, have batteries. The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound, position, and energy status) and operation (robots need some level of [[electrical energy]] supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations)\n# All robots contain some level of [[computer programming]] code. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly constructed its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence and hybrid. A robot with [[remote control]] programing has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with a remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use [[artificial intelligence]] interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. Hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions.\n\n== Applications ==\nAs more and more robots are designed for specific tasks this method of classification becomes more relevant. For example, many robots are designed for assembly work, which may not be readily adaptable for other applications. They are termed as \"assembly robots\". For seam welding, some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot i.e. the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables, etc. as an integrated unit. Such an integrated robotic system is called a \"welding robot\" even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks. Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation, and are labeled as \"heavy-duty robots\".<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpXbBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA141|chapter=Smart Robots|title=Smart Robots: A Handbook of Intelligent Robotic Systems|last=Hunt|first=V.

Many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots. They range from lead\u2013acid batteries, which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver\u2013cadmium batteries that are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive. Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime and [[weight]]. Generators, often some type of [[internal combustion engine]], can also be used. However, such designs are often mechanically complex and need a fuel, require heat dissipation and are relatively heavy. A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely. This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere. However, this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot, which can be difficult to manage.<ref name=\"Robot Power supply Sources\">{{cite web|last=Dowling|first=Kevin|title=Power Sources for Small Robots|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/motionplanning/papers/sbp_papers/integrated1/dowling_power_sources.pdf|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> Potential power sources could be:\n* [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] (compressed gases)\n* [[Solar power]] (using the sun's energy and converting it into electrical power)\n* [[hydraulic]]s (liquids)\n* [[flywheel energy storage]]\n* organic garbage (through [[anaerobic digestion]])\n* [[nuclear power|nuclear]]\n\n===Actuation===\n{{Main|Actuator}}\n[[File:2005-11-14 ShadowLeg Finished medium.jpg|thumb|A [[robot leg|robotic leg]] powered by [[Pneumatic artificial muscles|air muscles]] ]]\n\nActuators are the \"[[muscle]]s\" of a robot, the parts which convert [[potential energy|stored energy]] into movement.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Design Optimisation and Control of Compliant Actuation Arrangements in Articulated Robots for Improved Energy Efficiency|journal= IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters|volume = 1|issue=2|pages = 1110\u20131117|last1 = Roozing|first1 = Wesley|last2 = Li|first2 = Zhibin|last3 =Tsagarakis|first3 = Nikos| last4=Caldwell |first4 = Darwin| year = 2016| doi=10.1109/LRA.2016.2521926 }}</ref> By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear, and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories. There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators, powered by electricity, chemicals, or compressed air.\n\n==== Electric motors ====\n{{Main|Electric motor}}\nThe vast majority of robots use electric motors, often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and [[numerical control|CNC]] machines. These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational.\n\n==== Linear actuators ====\n{{Main|Linear actuator}}\nVarious types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning, and often have quicker direction changes, particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics. They are typically powered by compressed and oxidized air ([[pneumatic actuator]]) or an oil ([[Hydraulic drive system|hydraulic actuator]]) Linear actuators can also be powered by electricity which usually consists of a motor and a leadscrew. Another common type is a mechanical linear actuator that is turned by hand, such as a rack and pinion on a car.\n\n==== Series elastic actuators ====\nA flexure is designed as part of the motor actuator, to improve safety and provide robust force control, energy efficiency, shock absorption (mechanical filtering) while reducing excessive wear on the transmission and other mechanical components.

As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences and views from cameras.\n\nIn most practical computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common.\n\nComputer vision systems rely on image sensors which detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] or [[infra-red light]]. The sensors are designed using [[solid-state physics]]. The process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained using [[optics]]. Sophisticated image sensors even require [[quantum mechanics]] to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Robots can also be equipped with multiple vision sensors to be better able to compute the sense of depth in the environment. Like human eyes, robots' \"eyes\" must also be able to focus on a particular area of interest, and also adjust to variations in light intensities.\n\nThere is a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of [[biological system]], at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision have their background in biology.\n\n====Other====\nOther common forms of sensing in robotics use [[lidar]], [[radar]], and [[sonar]]<ref name=\"Automation and Robotics\">{{cite book | last1=Arreguin | first1= Juan | title = Automation and Robotics | url=https://archive.org/details/ost-engineering-automation-and-robotics | publisher = I-Tech and Publishing | year= 2008 | location= Vienna, Austria}}</ref>.

Several robots have been made which can walk reliably on two legs, however, none have yet been made which are as robust as a human. There has been much study on human inspired walking, such as AMBER lab which was established in 2008 by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bipedalrobotics.com|title=AMBER Lab}}</ref> Many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs, due to these robots being significantly easier to construct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hexapodrobot.com/index.html|title=Micromagic Systems Robotics Lab}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mecatron.rma.ac.be/pub/2005/ISMCR05_verlinden.pdf|title=AMRU-5 hexapod robot}}</ref> Walking robots can be used for uneven terrains, which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods. Typically, robots on two legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up [[stairway|stairs]]. None can walk over rocky, uneven terrain. Some of the methods which have been tried are:\n\n===== ZMP technique =====\n{{Main|Zero moment point}}\nThe zero moment point (ZMP) is the algorithm used by robots such as [[Honda]]'s [[ASIMO]]. The robot's onboard computer tries to keep the total [[inertia|inertial forces]] (the combination of [[Earth]]'s [[gravitation|gravity]] and the [[acceleration]] and deceleration of walking), exactly opposed by the floor [[reaction (physics)|reaction force]] (the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot). In this way, the two forces cancel out, leaving no [[moment (physics)|moment]] (force causing the robot to rotate and fall over).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.honda.com/ASIMO/history/technology2.html|publisher=Honda Worldwide|title=Achieving Stable Walking|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> However, this is not exactly how a human walks, and the difference is obvious to human observers, some of whom have pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs the [[toilet|lavatory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pootergeek.com/2004/12/funny-walk/|title=Funny Walk|publisher=Pooter Geek|date=2004-12-28|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://popsci.typepad.com/ces2007/2007/01/asimos_pimp_shu.html |title=ASIMO's Pimp Shuffle|magazine=Popular Science|date=2007-01-09|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://motegi.vtec.net/forums/one-message?message_id=131434&news_item_id=129834|title=The Temple of VTEC \u2013 Honda and Acura Enthusiasts Online Forums > Robot Shows Prime Minister How to Loosen Up > > A drunk robot?}}</ref> ASIMO's walking algorithm is not static, and some dynamic balancing is used (see below). However, it still requires a smooth surface to walk on.\n\n===== Hopping =====\nSeveral robots, built in the 1980s by [[Marc Raibert]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Leg Laboratory, successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking. Initially, a robot with only one leg, and a very small foot could stay upright simply by [[wikt:hop|hopping]]. The movement is the same as that of a person on a [[pogo stick]]. As the robot falls to one side, it would jump slightly in that direction, in order to catch itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/3D_hopper/3D_hopper.html|publisher=MIT Leg Laboratory|title=3D One-Leg Hopper (1983\u20131984)|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> Soon, the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs.

It has been shown that totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using only [[gravitation|gravity]] to propel themselves. Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a [[hill]]. This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Steve|last=Collins|author2=Wisse, Martijn |author3=Ruina, Andy |author4= Tedrake, Russ |title=Efficient bipedal robots based on passive-dynamic Walkers|journal=Science|issue= 5712|pages=1082\u20131085|date=2005-02-11|url=http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/papers/efficient_bipedal_robots/efficient_bipedal_robots.pdf\n|accessdate=2007-09-11|doi=10.1126/science.1107799|volume=307|pmid=15718465 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622225310/http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/papers/efficient_bipedal_robots/efficient_bipedal_robots.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-22|bibcode=2005Sci...307.1082C}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference|first=Steve|last=Collins|author2=Ruina, Andy |url=http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/papers/efficient_bipedal_robots/bipedal_walking_robot_cornell.pdf\n|title=A bipedal walking robot with efficient and human-like gait|booktitle=Proc.

An example of this is Capuchin,<ref>{{YouTube|JzHasc4Vhm8|Capuchin}}</ref> built by Dr. Ruixiang Zhang at Stanford University, California. Another approach uses the specialized toe pad method of wall-climbing [[gecko]]es, which can run on smooth surfaces such as vertical glass. Examples of this approach include Wallbot<ref>{{YouTube|Tq8Yw19bn7Q|Wallbot}}</ref> and Stickybot.<ref>{{YouTube|k2kZk6riGWU|Stanford University: Stickybot}}</ref> China's ''Technology Daily'' reported on November 15, 2008, that Dr. Li Hiu Yeung and his research group of New Concept Aircraft ([[Zhuhai]]) Co., Ltd. had successfully developed a bionic gecko robot named \"[[Mechanical Gecko|Speedy Freelander]]\". According to Dr. Li, the gecko robot could rapidly climb up and down a variety of building walls, navigate through ground and wall fissures, and walk upside-down on the ceiling. It was also able to adapt to the surfaces of smooth glass, rough, sticky or dusty walls as well as various types of metallic materials. It could also identify and circumvent obstacles automatically.

A typical sailboat robot is ''[[Vaimos]]''<ref>\n{{cite journal|last1=Jaulin|first1=L.|last2=Le Bars|first2=F.|\nyear=2012|title=An interval approach for stability analysis; Application to sailboat robotics|journal=IEEE Transactions on Robotics|volume=27|issue=5|url=http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/paper_checking.pdf}}</ref> built by IFREMER and ENSTA-Bretagne. Since the propulsion of sailboat robots uses the wind, the energy of the batteries is only used for the computer, for the communication and for the actuators (to tune the rudder and the sail). If the robot is equipped with solar panels, the robot could theoretically navigate forever. The two main competitions of sailboat robots are [[WRSC (World Robotic Sailing Championship)|WRSC]], which takes place every year in Europe, and [http://www.sailbot.org/ Sailbot].\n\n===Environmental interaction and navigation===\n{{Main|Robotic mapping|Robotic navigation}}\n[[File:ElementBlack2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Radar, [[GPS]], and [[lidar]], are all combined to provide proper navigation and [[obstacle avoidance]] (vehicle developed for 2007 [[DARPA Urban Challenge]])]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\nThough a significant percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment, there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. These robots require some combination of [[Robotic mapping|navigation hardware and software]] in order to traverse their environment. In particular, unforeseen events (e.g. people and other obstacles that are not stationary) can cause problems or collisions. Some highly advanced robots such as [[ASIMO]] and [[Mein\u00fc robot]] have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software. Also, [[Intelligent car|self-controlled cars]], [[Ernst Dickmanns]]' [[driverless car]], and the entries in the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]], are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information, including by a swarm of autonomous robots.<ref name=\"Search and foraging\"/> Most of these robots employ a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] navigation device with waypoints, along with [[radar]], sometimes combined with other sensory data such as [[lidar]], [[video camera]]s, and [[inertial guidance system]]s for better navigation between waypoints.\n\n===Human-robot interaction===\n{{main|Human-robot interaction}}\n[[File:Kismet-IMG 6007-gradient.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] can produce a range of facial expressions.]]\nThe state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through [[speech]], [[gesture]]s, and [[facial expression]]s, rather than a [[command-line interface]]. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably be a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional [[C-3PO]], or [[Star Trek|Data of Star Trek, Next Generation]].\n\n==== Speech recognition ====\n{{Main|Speech recognition}}\nInterpreting the continuous flow of [[sound]]s coming from a human, in [[real-time computing|real time]], is a difficult task for a computer, mostly because of the great variability of [[Manner of articulation|speech]].<ref>J.

In both of these cases, making hand [[gesture]]s would aid the verbal descriptions. In the first case, the robot would be recognizing gestures made by the human, and perhaps repeating them for confirmation. In the second case, the robot police officer would gesture to indicate \"down the road, then turn right\". It is likely that gestures will make up a part of the interaction between humans and robots.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/waldherr.gestures-journal.pdf|title=A Gesture Based Interface for Human-Robot Interaction|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|author=Waldherr, Romero & Thrun|year=2000| accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> A great many systems have been developed to recognize human hand gestures.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ls7-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de:81/research/gesture/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711151910/http://ls7-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de:81/research/gesture/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-11|title=Vision Based Hand Gesture Recognition Systems|journal=Applied Mechanics and Materials|volume=263-266|pages=2422\u20132425|author=Markus Kohler|publisher=University of Dortmund|accessdate=2007-10-28|bibcode=2012AMM...263.2422L|year=2012|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.263-266.2422}}</ref>\n\n==== Facial expression ====\n{{Further|Emotion recognition}}\nFacial expressions can provide rapid feedback on the progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may be able to do the same for humans and robots. Robotic faces have been constructed by [[David Hanson (robotics designer)|Hanson Robotics]] using their elastic polymer called [[Frubber]], allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors ([[servomechanism|servos]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hansonrobotics.com/innovations.html|title=Frubber facial expressions|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207121306/http://hansonrobotics.com/innovations.html|archivedate=2009-02-07|df=}}</ref> The coating and servos are built on a metal [[human skull|skull]]. A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression and [[body language]]. Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot. Likewise, robots like [[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] and the more recent addition, Nexi<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854195_1854135,00.html|title=Best Inventions of 2008 \u2013 TIME|journal=Time|date=29 October 2008|via=www.time.com}}</ref> can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samogden.com/Kismet.html|title=Kismet: Robot at MIT's AI Lab Interacts With Humans|publisher=Sam Ogden|accessdate=2007-10-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012035539/http://samogden.com/Kismet.html|archivedate=2007-10-12|df=}}</ref>\n\n==== Artificial emotions ====\nArtificial emotions can also be generated, composed of a sequence of facial expressions and/or gestures. As can be seen from the movie [[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]], the programming of these artificial emotions is complex and requires a large amount of human observation. To simplify this programming in the movie, presets were created together with a special software program. This decreased the amount of time needed to make the film. These presets could possibly be transferred for use in real-life robots.\n\n==== Personality ====\nMany of the robots of science fiction have a [[Personality psychology|personality]], something which may or may not be desirable in the commercial robots of the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/GI2005/Posters/GI_abstract.pdf|title=(Park et al. 2005) Synthetic Personality in Robots and its Effect on Human-Robot Relationship}}</ref> Nevertheless, researchers are trying to create robots which appear to have a personality:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5067678|title=Robot Receptionist Dishes Directions and Attitude}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://viterbi.usc.edu/tools/download/?asset=/assets/023/49186.pdf&name=nsmaja.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060929205205/http://viterbi.usc.edu/tools/download/?asset=/assets/023/49186.pdf&name=nsmaja.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-09-29|title=New Scientist: A good robot has personality but not looks}}</ref> i.e. they use sounds, facial expressions, and body language to try to convey an internal state, which may be joy, sadness, or fear. One commercial example is [[Pleo]], a toy robot dinosaur, which can exhibit several apparent emotions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/caleb_chung_plays_with_pleo#t-17244|title=Playtime with Pleo, your robotic dinosaur friend}}</ref>\n\n==== Social Intelligence ====\nThe Socially Intelligent Machines Lab of the  [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] researches new concepts of guided teaching interaction with robots. The aim of the projects is a social robot that learns task and goals from human demonstrations without prior knowledge of high-level concepts. These new concepts are grounded from low-level continuous sensor data through [[unsupervised machine learning|unsupervised learning]], and task goals are subsequently learned using a Bayesian approach. These concepts can be used to transfer knowledge to future tasks, resulting in faster learning of those tasks. The results are demonstrated by the robot ''Curi'' who can scoop some pasta from a pot onto a plate and serve the sauce on top.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/meet-woman-who-trains-robots-living|title=Meet a woman who trains robots for a living|date=October 31, 2014|author=Jennifer Bogo}}</ref>\n\n==Control==\n[[File:Magnus B. Egerstedt puppet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Puppet Magnus]], a robot-manipulated marionette with complex control systems.]]\n[[File:RuBot II.jpg|thumb|right|[[RuBot II]] can manually resolve Rubik's cubes.]]\n{{Further|Control system}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\n\nThe [[machine|mechanical]] structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. The control of a robot involves three distinct phases \u2013 perception, processing, and action ([[robotic paradigms]]). [[Sensor]]s give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its end effector). This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators ([[Electric motor|motors]]) which move the mechanical.\n\nThe processing phase can range in complexity. At a reactive level, it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands. [[Sensor fusion]] may first be used to estimate parameters of interest (e.g. the position of the robot's gripper) from noisy sensor data. An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction) is inferred from these estimates. Techniques from [[control theory]] convert the task into commands that drive the actuators.\n\nAt longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a \"cognitive\" model. Cognitive models try to represent the robot, the world, and how they interact. Pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects. [[Simultaneous localization and mapping|Mapping]] techniques can be used to build maps of the world. Finally, [[motion planning]] and other [[artificial intelligence]] techniques may be used to figure out how to act. For example, a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles, falling over, etc.\n\n===Autonomy levels===\n[[File:TOPIO 3.jpg|thumb|[[TOPIO]], a [[humanoid robot]], played [[ping pong]] at Tokyo IREX 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-02/ping-pong-playing-terminator|title=A Ping-Pong-Playing Terminator|magazine=Popular Science}}</ref>]]\nControl systems may also have varying levels of autonomy.\n# Direct interaction is used for [[haptic technology|haptic]] or teleoperated devices, and the human has nearly complete control over the robot's motion.\n# Operator-assist modes have the operator commanding medium-to-high-level tasks, with the robot automatically figuring out how to achieve them.\n# An autonomous robot may go without human interaction for extended periods of time . Higher levels of autonomy do not necessarily require more complex cognitive capabilities. For example, robots in assembly plants are completely autonomous but operate in a fixed pattern.\n\nAnother classification takes into account the interaction between human control and the machine motions.\n# [[Teleoperation]]. A human controls each movement, each machine actuator change is specified by the operator.\n# Supervisory. A human specifies general moves or position changes and the machine decides specific movements of its actuators.\n# Task-level autonomy. The operator specifies only the task and the robot manages itself to complete it.\n# Full autonomy. The machine will create and complete all its tasks without human interaction.\n\n==Research==\n{{Further|Open-source robotics|Evolutionary robotics|Areas of robotics|Robotics simulator}}\n[[File:PIA15279 3rovers-stand D2011 1215 D521.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Two [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] engineers stand with three vehicles, providing a size comparison of three generations of Mars rovers.

Other investigations, such as MIT's [[cyberflora]] project, are almost wholly academic.\n\nA first particular new innovation in robot design is the open sourcing of robot-projects. To describe the level of advancement of a robot, the term \"Generation Robots\" can be used. This term is coined by Professor [[Hans Moravec]], Principal Research Scientist at the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] [[Robotics Institute]] in describing the near future evolution of robot technology. ''First generation'' robots, Moravec predicted in 1997, should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps a [[lizard]] and should become available by 2010. Because the ''first generation'' robot would be incapable of [[learning]], however, Moravec predicts that the ''second generation'' robot would be an improvement over the ''first'' and become available by 2020, with the intelligence maybe comparable to that of a [[mouse]]. The ''third generation'' robot should have the intelligence comparable to that of a [[monkey]]. Though ''fourth generation'' robots, robots with [[human]] intelligence, professor Moravec predicts, would become possible, he does not predict this happening before around 2040 or 2050.<ref>[[Nova (American TV series)|NOVA]] conversation with Professor Moravec, October, 1997. ''[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/robots/moravec.html NOVA Online]''</ref>\n\nThe second is [[Evolutionary robotics|evolutionary robots]]. This is a [[methodology]] that uses [[evolutionary computation]] to help design robots, especially the body form, or motion and behavior [[controller (control theory)|controllers]]. In a similar way to [[evolution|natural evolution]], a large population of robots is allowed to compete in some way, or their ability to perform a task is measured using a [[fitness function]]. Those that perform worst are removed from the population and replaced by a new set, which have new behaviors based on those of the winners. Over time the population improves, and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear. This happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers. Researchers use this method both to create better robots,<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/09/54900|publisher=Wired Magazine|title=A Theory of Evolution, for Robots|journal=Wired|first=Lakshmi|last=Sandhana|date=2002-09-05|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> and to explore the nature of evolution.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070222155713.htm|publisher=Science Daily|title=Experimental Evolution In Robots Probes The Emergence Of Biological Communication|date=2007-02-24|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> Because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated,<ref>{{cite journal|first=Leon|last=\u017dlajpah|title=Simulation in robotics|journal=Mathematics and Computers in Simulation|issue=4|pages=879\u2013897|date=2008-12-15|doi=10.1016/j.matcom.2008.02.017|volume=79}}</ref> this technique may be run entirely or mostly in [[simulation]], using a [[robot simulator]] software package, then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/2004/051904/Evolution_trains_robot_teams_051904.html|title=Evolution trains robot teams TRN 051904|first=Technology Research|last=News|website=www.trnmag.com}}</ref> Currently, there are about 10 million industrial robots toiling around the world, and Japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industry.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Dynamics and kinematics===\n{{further|Kinematics|Dynamics (mechanics)}}\n{{externalvideo|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FHtcR78GA0 How the BB-8 Sphero Toy Works]}}\nThe study of motion can be divided into [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]].<ref>{{cite book|first=P.K.|last=Agarwal|title=Elements of Physics XI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEVnsSy0yF8C&pg=SA2-PA3|publisher=Rastogi Publications|isbn=978-81-7133-911-2|page=2}}</ref> Direct kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, [[velocity]], and [[acceleration]] when the corresponding joint values are known. [[Inverse kinematics]] refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), [[collision]] avoidance, and [[Mechanical singularity|singularity]] avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using [[kinematics]], methods from the field of [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] are used to study the effect of [[force]]s upon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used in [[computer simulation]]s of the robot. [[Inverse dynamics]] refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end-effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.\n\nIn each area mentioned above, researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies, improve existing ones, and improve the interaction between these areas. To do this, criteria for \"optimal\" performance and ways to optimize design, structure, and control of robots must be developed and implemented.\n\n=== Bionics and biomimetics ===\n[[Bionics]] and [[biomimetics]] apply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots.  For example, the design of [[BionicKangaroo]] was based on the way kangaroos jump.\n\n===Quantum computing===\nThere has been some research into whether robotics algorithms can be run more quickly on [[quantum computers]] than they can be run on [[digital computers]].

In addition, youth summer robotics programs are frequently offered by celebrated museums and institutions.\n\n=== Robotics competitions ===\n{{Main|Robot competition}}\nThere are lots of competitions all around the globe. The [[SeaPerch]] curriculum is aimed as students of all ages.  This is a short list of competition examples; for a more complete list see [[Robot competition]].\n\n====Competitions for Younger Children====\nThe FIRST organization offers the [[FIRST Lego League Jr.]] competitions for younger children.  This competition's goal is to offer younger children an opportunity to start learning about science and technology.  Children in this competition build Lego models and have the option of using the Lego WeDo robotics kit.\n\n====Competitions for Children Ages 9-14====\nOne of the most important competitions is the FLL or [[FIRST Lego League]]. The idea of this specific competition is that kids start developing knowledge and getting into robotics while playing with [[Lego]] since they are 9 years old. This competition is associated with [[National Instruments]]. Children use [[Lego Mindstorms]] to solve autonomous robotics challenges in this competition.\n\n====Competitions for Teenagers====\n{{Main|FIRST}}\nThe [[FIRST Tech Challenge]] is designed for intermediate students, as a transition from the [[FIRST Lego League]] to the [[FIRST Robotics Competition]].\n\nThe [[FIRST Robotics Competition]] focuses more on mechanical design, with a specific game being played each year. Robots are built specifically for that year's game. In match play, the robot moves autonomously during the first 15 seconds of the game (although certain years such as 2019's Deep Space change this rule), and is manually operated for the rest of the match.\n\n====Competitions for Older Students====\nThe various [[RoboCup]] competitions include teams of teenagers and university students.  These competitions focus on soccer competitions with different types of robots, dance competitions, and urban search and rescue competitions.  All of the robots in these competitions must be autonomous.  Some of these competitions focus on simulated robots.\n\nAUVSI runs competitions for [[International Aerial Robotics Competition|flying robots]], [[Unmanned surface vehicle|robot boats]], and [[RoboSub|underwater robots]].\n\nThe Student AUV Competition Europe <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sauc-europe.org/|title=Student AUV Competition Europe}}</ref> (SAUC-E) mainly attracts undergraduate and graduate student teams.  As in the AUVSI competitions, the robots must be fully autonomous while they are participating in the competition.\n\n[[The Microtransat Challenge]] is a competition to sail a boat across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n====Competitions Open to Anyone====\n[[RoboGames]] is open to anyone wishing to compete in their over 50 categories of robot competitions.\n\n[[Federation of International Robot-soccer Association]] holds the FIRA World Cup competitions.  There are flying robot competitions, robot soccer competitions, and other challenges, including weightlifting barbells made from dowels and CDs.\n\n===Robotics afterschool programs===\nMany schools across the country are beginning to add robotics programs to their after school curriculum. Some major programs for afterschool robotics include [[FIRST Robotics Competition]], [[Botball]] and B.E.S.T. Robotics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestinc.org/|title=B.E.S.T. Robotics}}</ref> Robotics competitions often include aspects of business and marketing as well as engineering and design.\n\nThe [[The Lego Group|Lego company]] began a program for children to learn and get excited about robotics at a young age.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://carobotfactory.com/classes/|accessdate=5 November 2014|title=LEGO\u00ae Building & Robotics After School Programs}}</ref>\n\n== Employment ==\n[[File:MobileRobotsPioneerAT.jpg|thumb|A robot technician builds small all-terrain robots.

In space, defence, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance, and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers' exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, ergonomic and psychosocial risks. For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres. In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services.<ref>{{cite news|title=Robotics: Redefining crime prevention, public safety and security|url=http://www.sourcesecurity.com/news/articles/robotics-redefining-crime-prevention-public-safety-security-co-12903-ga-co-14203-ga.21083.html|publisher=SourceSecurity.com}}</ref>\n\nDespite these advances, there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility, and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in [[collaborative robots]] and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the \"man-robot merger\". Some European countries are including robotics in their national programmes and trying to promote a safe and flexible co-operation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity. For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ([[BAuA]]) organises annual workshops on the topic \"human-robot collaboration\".\n\nIn the future, co-operation between robots and humans will be diversified, with robots increasing their autonomy and human-robot collaboration reaching completely new forms.

They agreed on three conditions: They would make fewer than nine movies a year, they would be free to work for other studios if they chose, and they would go home in time for dinner.
