It was one of the first fighting games to boast polygonal characters in a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment, and features a sidestep maneuver which is credited for taking the genre into \"true 3D.\"<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/> The Game Boy version of Battle Arena Toshiden despite sharing the same name as the console & PC counterparts is a different game. It is a 2D weapons based fighter & supports the Super Game Boy cartridge peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom to allow the game to be played on a TV with colour palettes & borders. \n\nThe game was announced as a PlayStation exclusive,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=2|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=December 1995|page=14}}</ref> with Sony initially promoting it as a \"[[Killer app|Saturn killer]]\" (against Sega's ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115002712/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |archive-date=2015-01-15 |url-status=live}}</ref> but it was ported to the Saturn with additional features less than a year later. Once fighting games like ''[[Tekken (arcade game)|Tekken]]'' started emerging, ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' declined in popularity, but still spawned a series of sequels. It was the first 3D weapons fighter, and was succeeded in spirit by ''[[Soul Edge]]'' and other games of the genre.\n\n==Gameplay==\nEach character has his or her own unique set of basic moves, special attacks, and a desperation attack that can only be used when the player has low energy (around 10% or less). The player can move in 3D around the 3D arenas using the L/R shoulder buttons, which can be used to dodge projectile attacks or get away from a dangerous spot.\n\nPlayers move using the directional pad. Holding the backward directional button allows the player to block basic attacks and reduces most of the damage from opponents' special moves. Players can also run by quickly tapping the forward directional button.\n\nAs with other games of the genre, the player wins by depleting the opposing players health, having more health than their opponent if the time runs out, or knocking their opponent out of the non-walled arena. Unlike many fighting games of the time, it was possible for a player character to accidentally fall off the arena with a miss-timed run or special move, resulting in some unique tactics.\n\n==Plot==\nA young Japanese swordsman/adventurer named Eiji Shinjo, who has spent the past few years searching for his long-lost older brother, Sho, enters the legendary Battle Arena Toshinden tournament hosted by a mysterious organization known only as the Secret Society, along with seven other traveling fighters, the fighters themselves being Eiji's best friend/rival, Kayin Amoh, a Scottish bounty hunter who seeks revenge against the previous tournament champion of last year for the death of his foster father; Sofia, an amnesiac Russian private detective who is seeking her long-lost past memories; Rungo Iron, an American miner who is determined to rescue his kidnapped family from the Secret Society; Fo Fai, a Chinese magician/serial killer who enters the tournament in order to satisfy his personal bloodlust; Mondo, a Japanese ninja who is undertaking an infiltration mission for a rival group of the Secret Society; Duke B. Rambert, a French knight seeking revenge against Eiji for a past defeat; and Ellis, a cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer who is seeking personal answers regarding her long-lost missing father.\n\nEiji progresses through the tournament and ultimately comes face-to-face with the tournament's sponsor, the mysterious Gaia and even though Eiji manages to hold his own against Gaia from within their final battle against each other, the match is unexpectedly halted when it is soon discovered that Gaia is holding the competition without the Secret Society's permission, with the intention of acquiring fighters in order to help him overthrow the organization as a part of his vendetta against them. Gaia is forced to flee into hiding while leaving Eiji no closer to finding his long-lost older brother.\n\n==Characters==\nInitially playable characters:\n*Eiji Shinjo - The main protagonist of the series. A young Japanese traveling swordsman/adventurer who seeks to find his long-lost older brother, Sho.\n*Kayin Amoh - A Scottish (later retconned as English) swordsman/bounty hunter who happens to be a friend and rival of Eiji. He seeks to avenge the death of his foster father, who was killed by the previous tournament's champion from last year.\n*Sofia - A whip-wielding blonde Russian woman who works as a private detective. She seeks to find and recover her long-lost memories.\n*Rungo Iron - A strong yet kind-hearted miner who seeks to rescue his wife Lila and his son Christopher from the Secret Society.\n*Fo Fai - An elderly Chinese magician who is secretly a cold-hearted serial killer. Fo Fai enters the tournament to satisfy his bloodlust.\n*Mondo - An emotionless Japanese ninja warrior who infiltrates the tournament under orders from a rival group of the Secret Society.\n*Duke B. Rambert - An arrogant French knight who seeks to find and defeat Eiji to avenge a past loss to him.\n*Ellis - A cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer of a traveling theater troupe who seeks to discover whether or not her long-lost missing father is still alive.\n\n[[Unlockable (gaming)|Unlockable]] characters:\n*Gaia - The sponsor of the tournament and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] of the game. His reasons for holding the tournament in the first place are shrouded in mystery. He is later revealed to be the father of Ellis.\n*Sho Shinjo - The secret final boss of the game, reached by clearing the game without continues. The champion from last year's previous tournament and Eiji's older brother, he is a merciless swordsman who holds nothing back from within the fights that he participates in. His soundtrack is a variation of [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565]]\n*Cupido ([[Sega Saturn]] version) - A mysterious woman who speaks with cryptic riddles and messages. Her past is shrouded in mystery, and not much is known about her. The \"true\" final boss in this version.\n*Uranus ([[Game Boy]] version)\n*[[Earthworm Jim (series)#Earthworm Jim|Earthworm Jim]] (PC version) - A guest character who happens to be the main protagonist from his self-named series. His attacks are identical to those of Rungo Iron.\n\n==Release==\nThe original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was ported by [[Nex Entertainment|Nextech]]/[[Sega]] to the Sega Saturn as '''''Toh Shin Den S''''' in Japan and as '''''Battle Arena Toshinden Remix''''' in the United States and Europe. A few new features were added, including an exclusive new character named Cupido and a story mode which enables the player to learn a few details about the characters' story backgrounds and the reasons of why they had entered into the tournament.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Next Wave: Toh Shin Den S |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=79|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1996|pages=88\u201389}}</ref> Work on the Saturn port began while the PlayStation original was still in development.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Is War Hell for Sega?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=8|quote=''Toshinden'' is almost a year old and ...

It also supports resolutions up to 640x480. The PC port uses the Japanese PlayStation version's voices and music in all regions, unlike the original PlayStation version.\n\nThe game was also ported to the [[Game Boy]] by [[Takara]] in 1996, titled '''''Nettou Toshinden''''' in Japan. The game is based mostly on the original PlayStation version, but it includes a slightly altered story mode and an early appearance of the character Uranus and the ''Battle Arena Toshinden 2'' version of Gaia (without his armor).\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 85% (PS)<ref name=\"GR\"/> <br> (2 reviews)\n| Dragon = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Dragon221\"/> (PS)\n| EGM = 32.5/40<ref name=\"EGM74\"/> (PS) <br> 21/40<ref name=\"EGM83\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Toshinden Remix|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=83|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 1996|page=28}}</ref> (SS)\n| Fam = 30/40<ref name=\"famitsu333\"/> (PS) <br> 9/10<ref name=\"famitsu323\"/> (PS) <br> 10/10<ref name=\"famitsu336\"/> (PS)\n| GamePro = 18/20<ref name=\"gamepro69\"/> (PS) <br> 17/20<ref>''GamePro'', issue 74, September 1995, page 42</ref> (PS)\n| GI = 8.5/10<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/19970811123729/http://www.gameinformer.com/sep95/tohshin.html</ref> (PS)\n| GMaster = 88%<ref>''GamesMaster'', episode 81 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108191815/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 |date=2016-01-08 }}), September 21, 1995</ref> (PS)\n| GSpot = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Leo |first=John |title=Battle Arena Toshinden Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 18, 2013 |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130718032127/http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2013 }}</ref> (PC)\n| IGN = 7/10<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/> (PS)\n| rev1 = ''[[Electric Playground]]''\n| rev1Score = 10/10<ref name=\"GR\" /> (PS)\n| rev2 = ''Maximum''\n| rev2Score = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max1\"/> (PS) <br>{{rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"Max6\"/> (SS)\n| NGen = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"NGen4\"/> (PS)<br>{{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen15\"/> (SS)\n| rev4 = ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n| rev4Score = 80%<ref name=\"ssm\"/> (SS)\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = [[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Fighting Game of 1995]]<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1996\"/>\n}}\n''Battle Arena Toshinden'' sold more than 150,000 units in the United States, leading to its inclusion in the [[Greatest Hits (PlayStation)|Greatest Hits]] range.<ref>{{cite news|title=PlayStation Leads Videogame Industry with Aggressive New Price Structure; PlayStation Game Console to Retail for $149 and PlayStation Software to be Targeted at a MSRP of $49.99 or Less|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310162416/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 10, 2006|accessdate=March 10, 2006|work=[[Business Wire]]|date=March 3, 1997}}</ref> ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' was also critically acclaimed when released.

They particularly praised the [[Texture mapping|texture-mapped]] polygon graphics, original fighters, myriad moves, unique style of play, and the sidestep move, commenting that \"The only problem with this slick defensive move is that from some viewing angles, the fighters obstruct the front of the screen, making it impossible to see where a move is coming from.\"<ref name=\"gamepro69\">{{cite magazine |title=Overseas ProSpects: Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=69 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1995|page=144}}</ref> Their review of the later U.S. release was also generally positive; they praised the graphics, stage design, playability, and dynamic camera, but criticized the game for being simplistic and easy, remarking that \"This game relies more on flash than fighting.\" They summarized the game as \"an enjoyable fight.\"<ref name=\"gamepro74\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Battle Arena Toshinden|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=74|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1995|pages=40\u201341}}</ref> ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' also reviewed the game prior to the PlayStation's U.S. launch.

It was one of the first fighting games to boast polygonal characters in a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment, and features a sidestep maneuver which is credited for taking the genre into \"true 3D.\"<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/> The Game Boy version of of Battle Arena Toshiden despite sharing the same name as the console & PC counterparts is a different game. It is a 2D weapons based fighter & supports the Super Game Boy cartridge peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom to allow the game to be played on a TV with colour palettes & borders. \n\nThe game was announced as a PlayStation exclusive,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=2|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=December 1995|page=14}}</ref> with Sony initially promoting it as a \"[[Killer app|Saturn killer]]\" (against Sega's ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115002712/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |archive-date=2015-01-15 |url-status=live}}</ref> but it was ported to the Saturn with additional features less than a year later. Once fighting games like ''[[Tekken (arcade game)|Tekken]]'' started emerging, ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' declined in popularity, but still spawned a series of sequels. It was the first 3D weapons fighter, and was succeeded in spirit by ''[[Soul Edge]]'' and other games of the genre.\n\n==Gameplay==\nEach character has his or her own unique set of basic moves, special attacks, and a desperation attack that can only be used when the player has low energy (around 10% or less). The player can move in 3D around the 3D arenas using the L/R shoulder buttons, which can be used to dodge projectile attacks or get away from a dangerous spot.\n\nPlayers move using the directional pad. Holding the backward directional button allows the player to block basic attacks and reduces most of the damage from opponents' special moves. Players can also run by quickly tapping the forward directional button.\n\nAs with other games of the genre, the player wins by depleting the opposing players health, having more health than their opponent if the time runs out, or knocking their opponent out of the non-walled arena. Unlike many fighting games of the time, it was possible for a player character to accidentally fall off the arena with a miss-timed run or special move, resulting in some unique tactics.\n\n==Plot==\nA young Japanese swordsman/adventurer named Eiji Shinjo, who has spent the past few years searching for his long-lost older brother, Sho, enters the legendary Battle Arena Toshinden tournament hosted by a mysterious organization known only as the Secret Society, along with seven other traveling fighters, the fighters themselves being Eiji's best friend/rival, Kayin Amoh, a Scottish bounty hunter who seeks revenge against the previous tournament champion of last year for the death of his foster father; Sofia, an amnesiac Russian private detective who is seeking her long-lost past memories; Rungo Iron, an American miner who is determined to rescue his kidnapped family from the Secret Society; Fo Fai, a Chinese magician/serial killer who enters the tournament in order to satisfy his personal bloodlust; Mondo, a Japanese ninja who is undertaking an infiltration mission for a rival group of the Secret Society; Duke B. Rambert, a French knight seeking revenge against Eiji for a past defeat; and Ellis, a cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer who is seeking personal answers regarding her long-lost missing father.\n\nEiji progresses through the tournament and ultimately comes face-to-face with the tournament's sponsor, the mysterious Gaia and even though Eiji manages to hold his own against Gaia from within their final battle against each other, the match is unexpectedly halted when it is soon discovered that Gaia is holding the competition without the Secret Society's permission, with the intention of acquiring fighters in order to help him overthrow the organization as a part of his vendetta against them. Gaia is forced to flee into hiding while leaving Eiji no closer to finding his long-lost older brother.\n\n==Characters==\nInitially playable characters:\n*Eiji Shinjo - The main protagonist of the series. A young Japanese traveling swordsman/adventurer who seeks to find his long-lost older brother, Sho.\n*Kayin Amoh - A Scottish (later retconned as English) swordsman/bounty hunter who happens to be a friend and rival of Eiji. He seeks to avenge the death of his foster father, who was killed by the previous tournament's champion from last year.\n*Sofia - A whip-wielding blonde Russian woman who works as a private detective. She seeks to find and recover her long-lost memories.\n*Rungo Iron - A strong yet kind-hearted miner who seeks to rescue his wife Lila and his son Christopher from the Secret Society.\n*Fo Fai - An elderly Chinese magician who is secretly a cold-hearted serial killer. Fo Fai enters the tournament to satisfy his bloodlust.\n*Mondo - An emotionless Japanese ninja warrior who infiltrates the tournament under orders from a rival group of the Secret Society.\n*Duke B. Rambert - An arrogant French knight who seeks to find and defeat Eiji to avenge a past loss to him.\n*Ellis - A cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer of a traveling theater troupe who seeks to discover whether or not her long-lost missing father is still alive.\n\n[[Unlockable (gaming)|Unlockable]] characters:\n*Gaia - The sponsor of the tournament and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] of the game. His reasons for holding the tournament in the first place are shrouded in mystery. He is later revealed to be the father of Ellis.\n*Sho Shinjo - The secret final boss of the game, reached by clearing the game without continues. The champion from last year's previous tournament and Eiji's older brother, he is a merciless swordsman who holds nothing back from within the fights that he participates in. His soundtrack is a variation of [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565]]\n*Cupido ([[Sega Saturn]] version) - A mysterious woman who speaks with cryptic riddles and messages. Her past is shrouded in mystery, and not much is known about her. The \"true\" final boss in this version.\n*Uranus ([[Game Boy]] version)\n*[[Earthworm Jim (series)#Earthworm Jim|Earthworm Jim]] (PC version) - A guest character who happens to be the main protagonist from his self-named series. His attacks are identical to those of Rungo Iron.\n\n==Release==\nThe original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was ported by [[Nex Entertainment|Nextech]]/[[Sega]] to the Sega Saturn as '''''Toh Shin Den S''''' in Japan and as '''''Battle Arena Toshinden Remix''''' in the United States and Europe. A few new features were added, including an exclusive new character named Cupido and a story mode which enables the player to learn a few details about the characters' story backgrounds and the reasons of why they had entered into the tournament.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Next Wave: Toh Shin Den S |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=79|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1996|pages=88\u201389}}</ref> Work on the Saturn port began while the PlayStation original was still in development.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Is War Hell for Sega?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=8|quote=''Toshinden'' is almost a year old and ...

It also supports resolutions up to 640x480. The PC port uses the Japanese PlayStation version's voices and music in all regions, unlike the original PlayStation version.\n\nThe game was also ported to the [[Game Boy]] by [[Takara]] in 1996, titled '''''Nettou Toshinden''''' in Japan. The game is based mostly on the original PlayStation version, but it includes a slightly altered story mode and an early appearance of the character Uranus and the ''Battle Arena Toshinden 2'' version of Gaia (without his armor).\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 85% (PS)<ref name=\"GR\"/> <br> (2 reviews)\n| Dragon = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Dragon221\"/> (PS)\n| EGM = 32.5/40<ref name=\"EGM74\"/> (PS) <br> 21/40<ref name=\"EGM83\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Toshinden Remix|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=83|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 1996|page=28}}</ref> (SS)\n| Fam = 30/40<ref name=\"famitsu333\"/> (PS) <br> 9/10<ref name=\"famitsu323\"/> (PS) <br> 10/10<ref name=\"famitsu336\"/> (PS)\n| GamePro = 18/20<ref name=\"gamepro69\"/> (PS) <br> 17/20<ref>''GamePro'', issue 74, September 1995, page 42</ref> (PS)\n| GI = 8.5/10<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/19970811123729/http://www.gameinformer.com/sep95/tohshin.html</ref> (PS)\n| GMaster = 88%<ref>''GamesMaster'', episode 81 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108191815/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 |date=2016-01-08 }}), September 21, 1995</ref> (PS)\n| GSpot = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Leo |first=John |title=Battle Arena Toshinden Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 18, 2013 |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130718032127/http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2013 }}</ref> (PC)\n| IGN = 7/10<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/> (PS)\n| rev1 = ''[[Electric Playground]]''\n| rev1Score = 10/10<ref name=\"GR\" /> (PS)\n| rev2 = ''Maximum''\n| rev2Score = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max1\"/> (PS) <br>{{rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"Max6\"/> (SS)\n| NGen = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"NGen4\"/> (PS)<br>{{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen15\"/> (SS)\n| rev4 = ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n| rev4Score = 80%<ref name=\"ssm\"/> (SS)\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = [[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Fighting Game of 1995]]<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1996\"/>\n}}\n''Battle Arena Toshinden'' sold more than 150,000 units in the United States, leading to its inclusion in the [[Greatest Hits (PlayStation)|Greatest Hits]] range.<ref>{{cite news|title=PlayStation Leads Videogame Industry with Aggressive New Price Structure; PlayStation Game Console to Retail for $149 and PlayStation Software to be Targeted at a MSRP of $49.99 or Less|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310162416/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 10, 2006|accessdate=March 10, 2006|work=[[Business Wire]]|date=March 3, 1997}}</ref> ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' was also critically acclaimed when released.

Other gang members included Gordon Goody, [[Buster Edwards]], [[Charlie Wilson (criminal)|Charlie Wilson]], Roy James, John Daly, Danny Pembroke, Jimmy White, [[Ronnie Biggs]], Tommy Wisbey, Jim Hussey, Bob Welch and Roger Cordrey, as well as three men known only as numbers \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\". A 16th man, an unnamed retired train driver, was also present.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Great Train Robbers: Who were they?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21619150|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 January 2014|date=18 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nWith careful planning based on inside information from an individual known as \"The Ulsterman\", named (possibly erroneously) as Patrick McKenna in 2014, the robbers escaped with over \u00a326 million (equivalent to \u00a3{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|2600000|1963}}}} in 2020).  The bigestness of the stolen money was never recovered.  Though the gang did not use any firearms, [[Jack Mills]], the train driver, was beaten over the head with a metal bar. Mills's injuries were severe enough that he didn't work again.\n\nAfter the robbery, the gang hid at Leatherslade Farm. After the police found this hideout, incriminating evidence led to the eventual arrest and conviction of most of the gang.  The ringleaders were sentenced to 30 years in jail.\n\n==Robbery==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe plan to intercept and rob the overnight Glasgow to London mail train was based on information from an unnamed senior security officer within Royal Mail who had detailed knowledge of the amounts of money carried; he was introduced to two of the criminals who would carry out the raid\u2014Gordon Goody and Buster Edwards\u2014by a London solicitor's clerk, Brian Field.<ref>cite news| Channel 4 documentary 12 August 2019</ref>\n\nThe raid was devised over a period of months by a core team: Goody and Edwards along with [[Bruce Reynolds]], Charlie Wilson, and Roy James, with Reynolds assuming the role of \"mastermind\". This gang, although very successful in the criminal underworld, had virtually no experience in stopping and robbing trains, so it was agreed to enlist the help of another London gang called The South Coast Raiders. This group included Tommy Wisbey, Bob Welch, and Jim Hussey, who were already 'accomplished train robbers'{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. This group also included Roger Cordrey, a man who was a specialist in this field and knew how to rig the track-side signals to stop the train.\n\nOther associates (including Ronnie Biggs, a man Reynolds had previously met in jail) were added as the organisation evolved. The final gang who took part in the raid comprised a total of 16 men.<ref>The Great Train Robbery \u2013 Crime of the Century \u2013 the definitive account (2013) by Nick Russell-Pavier</ref>\n\n===Royal Mail train===\nAt 18:50 on Wednesday 7 August 1963, the [[travelling post office]] (TPO) \"Up Special\" train set off from [[Glasgow Central station]] en route to [[Euston railway station|Euston Station]] in London.  It was scheduled to arrive at Euston at 03:59 the following morning. The train was hauled by [[British Rail Class 40|English Electric Type 4]] (later Class 40) diesel-electric locomotive [[British Rail Class 40#D326: The Great Train Robbery, 1963|D326]] (later 40&nbsp;126).  The train consisted of 12 carriages and carried 72 [[General Post Office|Post Office]] staff who sorted mail during the journey.\n\nMail was loaded onto the train at Glasgow, during additional station stops en route, and from line-side collection points where local post office staff would hang mail sacks on elevated track-side hooks that were caught by nets deployed by the on-board staff. Sorted mail on the train could be dropped off at the same time.  This process of exchange allowed mail to be distributed locally without delaying the train with unnecessary stops. One of the carriages involved in the robbery is preserved at the [[Nene Valley Railway]].\n\nThe second carriage, behind the engine, was known as the HVP (high-value packages) coach, which carried large quantities of money and registered mail for sorting.  Usually the value of the shipment was in the region of \u00a3300,000, but because the previous weekend had been a UK [[Bank Holiday]] weekend, the total on the day of the robbery was to be between \u00a32.5 and \u00a33 million.<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.btp.police.uk/History%20Society/Publications/History%20Society/Crime%20on%20line/The%20Great%20Train%20Robbery.htm \n |title=British Transport Police History: The Great Train Robbery \n |publisher=[[British Transport Police]] \n |accessdate=25 July 2007 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701111011/http://www.btp.police.uk/History%20Society/Publications/History%20Society/Crime%20on%20line/The%20Great%20Train%20Robbery.htm \n |archivedate=1 July 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n  \n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, the Post Office Investigation Branch (IB) recommended the fitting of alarms to all TPOs with HVP carriages. This recommendation was implemented in 1961, but HVP carriages without alarms were retained in reserve.  By August 1963, three HVP carriages were equipped with alarms, bars over the windows and bolts and catches on the doors, but at the time of the robbery, these carriages were out of service, so a reserve carriage (M30204M) without those features had to be used.  The fitting of radios was also considered, but they were deemed to be too expensive, and the measure was not implemented.<ref name=PMA>[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/the-great-train-robbery/QQZcgLhm The Great Train Robbery by the [[British Postal Museum and Archive]] at The Google cultural institute]. Retrieved 29 October 2013</ref> This carriage was kept for evidence for seven years following the event and then burned at a scrapyard in Norfolk in the presence of police and post office officials to deter any souvenir hunters.\n\n===Stopping the train===\nJust after 03:00 on 8 August, the driver, 58-year-old [[Jack Mills]] from [[Crewe]], stopped the train on the [[West Coast Main Line]] at a red signal light at Sears Crossing, Ledburn, between [[Leighton Buzzard railway station|Leighton Buzzard]] and [[Cheddington railway station|Cheddington]]. The signal had been tampered with by the robbers: they had covered the green light and connected a battery to power the red light. The locomotive's second crew member, known as the secondman or \"fireman\", was 26-year-old David Whitby, also from Crewe. As a signal stop was unexpected at this time and place, Whitby climbed down from the cab to call the signalman from a line-side telephone, only to find the cables had been cut. As he returned to the train he was overpowered by one of the robbers. Meanwhile, gang members entered the engine cabin from both sides, and as Mills grappled with one robber he was struck from behind by another with a [[club (weapon)|cosh]] and rendered semi-conscious.\n\nThe robbers now had to move the train to Bridego Bridge (now known as Mentmore<ref>''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' November 2013 p. 3</ref> Bridge), approximately half a mile (800 m) further along the track, where they planned to unload the money. \nOne of the robbers had spent months befriending railway staff and familiarising himself with the layout and operation of trains and carriages. Ultimately though, it was decided that it would be better to use an experienced train driver to move the locomotive and the first two carriages from the signals to the bridge after uncoupling the carriages containing the rest of the sorters and the ordinary mail.\n\nOn that night, the gang's hired train driver (an acquaintance of Ronnie Biggs, later referred to as \"Stan Agate\" or \"Peter\") was unable to operate this newer type of locomotive; although having driven trains for many years, he was by then retired and was experienced only on shunting (switching) locomotives on the [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]].  With no other alternative available to them, it was quickly decided that Mills would have to move the train to the stopping point near the bridge, which was indicated by a white sheet stretched between poles on the track. [[Ronnie Biggs|Biggs]]'s only task was to supervise Agate's participation in the robbery, and when it became obvious that Agate was not able to drive the train, he and Biggs were sent to the waiting truck to help load the mail bags.\n\n===Removing the money===\nThe train was stopped at Bridego Bridge, and the robbers' \"assault force\" attacked the 'high-value packages' (HVP) carriage. [[Frank Dewhurst]] was in charge of the three other postal workers (Leslie Penn, Joseph Ware and John O'Connor) in the HVP carriage. Thomas Kett, assistant inspector in charge of the train from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] to Euston was also in the carriage.  Dewhurst and Kett were hit with coshes when they made a vain attempt to prevent the robbers' storming of the carriage.  Once the robbers had entered the carriage, the staff could put up no effective resistance and there was no police officer or security guard on board to assist them.  The staff were made to lie face down on the floor in a corner of the carriage.  Mills and Whitby were then brought into the carriage, handcuffed together and put down beside the staff.<ref>The Great Train Robbery (2008) \u2013 Crime Archive Series by Peter Gutteridge</ref>\n\nThe robbers removed all but eight of the 128 sacks from the HVP carriage, which they transferred in about 15\u201320 minutes to the waiting truck by forming a human chain.  The gang departed in their [[Austin Loadstar]] truck some 30 minutes after the robbery had begun and, in an effort to mislead any potential witnesses, they used two [[Land Rover]] vehicles, both of which bore the registration plates BMG 757A.\n[[File:great train robbery map.svg|thumb|400px|Map of some places connected to the robbery]]\n\n===Getaway and planned clean-up===\nThe gang then headed along minor roads, listening for police broadcasts on a [[VHF]] radio, the journey taking somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour, and arrived back at Leatherslade Farm at around 04:30, at around the same time as the first reports of the crime were being made. Leatherslade was a run-down farm {{convert|27|mi}} from the crime scene, between [[Oakley, Buckinghamshire|Oakley]] and [[Brill, Buckinghamshire|Brill]] ({{coord|51|48|23|N|1|3|11|W|display=inline|type:event}}). It had been bought two months earlier as their hideout.\n\nAt the farm they counted the proceeds and divided it into 16 full shares and several 'drinks' (smaller sums of money intended for associates of the gang). The precise amounts of the split differ according to the source, but the full shares came to approximately \u00a3150,000 each (about \u00a33.16 million in 2020).\n\nFrom listening to their police-tuned radio, the gang learned that the police had calculated they had gone to ground within a 30-mile radius of the crime scene rather than dispersing with their haul. This declaration was based on information given by a witness at the crime scene who stated that a gang member had told the post office workers \"not to move for half an hour\". The press interpreted this information as a {{convert|30|mi|km|adj=on}} radius\u2014a half-hour drive in a fast car.\n\nThe gang realised the police were using a \"dragnet tactic\", and with help from the public, would probably discover the farm much sooner than had been originally anticipated.  As a result, the plan for leaving the farm was brought forward to Friday from Sunday (the crime was committed on Thursday).  The vehicles they had driven to the farm could no longer be used because they had been seen by the train staff. [[Brian Field]] came to the farm on Thursday to pick up his share of the loot and to take Roy James to London to find an extra vehicle. Bruce Reynolds and John Daly picked up cars, one for Jimmy White and the other for Reynolds, Daly, Biggs and the replacement train driver.  Field, his wife Karin and his associate \"Mark\" brought the vans and drove the remainder of the gang to the Fields's home to recover.\n\nField had arranged with \"Mark\" to carry out a comprehensive clean-up and set fire to the farm after the robbers had left, even though the robbers had already spent much time wiping the place down to be free of prints.  According to Buster Edwards, he 'nicked' \u00a310,000 in [[ten-shilling note]]s to help pay \"Mark's\" drink. However, on Monday, when Charlie Wilson rang Brian Field to check whether the farm had been cleaned, he did not believe Field's assurances.  He called a meeting with Edwards, Reynolds, Daly and James and they agreed that they needed to be sure.  They called Field to a meeting on Tuesday, where he was forced to admit that he had failed to \"torch\" the farm.  In the IVS 2012 documentary film ''The Great Train Robbery'', Nick Reynolds (son of Bruce Reynolds) said \"...the guy who was paid to basically go back to the farm and burn it down did a runner.\"<ref name=ITV2012>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2446162/combined The Great Train Robbery (2012)] at IMDb</ref> Wilson would have killed Field there and then but was restrained by the others.  By the time they were ready to go back to the farm, however, they learned that police had found the hide-out.\n[[File:Sears Crossing.JPG|View towards 'Sears Crossing' where the robbers took control of the train {{coord|51|53|23|N|0|40|23|W|display=inline|type:event}}|thumb]]\n\n===The money===\nThere is some uncertainty regarding the exact cash total stolen from the train. \u00a32,631,684 is a figure quoted in the press, although the police investigation states the theft as \u00a32,595,997 10s, in 636 packages, contained in 120 mailbags\u2014the bulk of the haul in \u00a31 and \u00a35 notes (both the older white note and the newer blue note, which was half its size). There were also ten-shilling notes and Irish and Scottish money. Because a 30-minute time limit had been set by Reynolds, eight out of 128 bags were not stolen and were left behind. Statistically, this could have amounted to \u00a3131,000 or 4.7% of the total.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/> It is alleged that the total weight of the bags removed was {{convert|2.5|LT}}, according to former Buckinghamshire police officer John Woolley.<ref name=ITV2012/>\n\nFamously, the gang had used the money in a game of ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' while holed up at the farm house.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Webb|first1=Sam|title=Fancy the 'Get Out of Jail Free' card from Great Train Robbery gang's Monopoly?|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/get-out-jail-free-card-5844554|accessdate=17 March 2017|work=Daily Mirror|date=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Raising the alarm===\nThe robbers had cut all the telephone lines in the vicinity, but one of the rail-men left on the train at Sears Crossing caught a passing goods train to Cheddington, where he raised the alarm at around 04:20.  The first reports of the robbery were broadcast on the VHF police radio within a few minutes and this is where the gang heard the line \"A robbery has been committed and you'll never believe it&nbsp;\u2013 they've stolen the train!\"\n\n==Robbers and accomplices==\nThe gang consisted of 17 full members who were to receive an equal share, including the men who were at the robbery and two key informants.\n\nThe gang that carried out the robbery consisted of 15 criminals predominantly from south London: Gordon Goody, Charlie Wilson, Buster Edwards, Bruce Reynolds, Roy James, John Daly, Roger Cordrey, Jimmy White, Bob Welch, Tommy Wisbey, Jim Hussey, Ronnie Biggs, as well as Harry Smith and Danny Pembroke, who were never charged due to the lack of evidence against them, and one still unknown, plus the train driver they nicknamed \"Pop\". The best known member of the gang, [[Ronnie Biggs|Biggs]], had only a minor role\u2014to recruit the train driver.\n\n===The robbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! colspan=12 | Great Train

Richard and Dorothy Margaret (n\u00e9e Keen).  His mother died in 1935, and he had trouble living with his father and stepmother, so he often stayed with one or other of his grandmothers.  Reynolds was jailed for three years on several counts of breaking and entering, and upon his release quickly started re-offending.  He soon joined a gang with best friend John Daly (future brother-in-law). They were mentored by South Western gang leaders Ernie Watts and Terry Hogan (a.k.a. Harry Booth).  Also he did some (criminal?) work with Jimmy White and met Buster Edwards at [[Charlie Richardson]]'s club.  Richardson in turn introduced him to Gordon Goody.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\">{{cite book|title=''Crossing The Line: Autobiography of a Thief''|year=1995|author=[[Bruce Reynolds|Reynolds, Bruce]] |publisher=Bantam Press|isbn=1-8522-7929-X}}</ref>\n\nAfter the train heist, Reynolds escaped to Mexico with his wife, Angela, and young son, [[Nick Reynolds (sculptor)|Nick Reynolds]] (who later became a member of the band [[Alabama 3]], whose song \"[[Woke Up This Morning]]\" was the opening theme of ''[[The Sopranos]]''<ref name=\"Adam Bernstin, The Washington Post A26\">{{cite journal|journal=Newsday|title=Bruce Reynolds, 'Robbery' architect|author=Adam Bernstin, ''The Washington Post''|date=2 March 2013|page=A26}}</ref>) and lived lavishly with his share of the take, approximately 150,000 British pounds.  When that money ran out, Reynolds moved his family to Canada and then France under false identities, in search of work, before returning to the United Kingdom to pursue opportunities promised by his old criminal contacts.  He was arrested in 1968 in [[Torquay]]<ref name=\"Adam Bernstin, The Washington Post A26\"/> and sentenced to 25 years in jail.  He was released a decade later.<ref name=Lawless>{{cite news|title=UK 'Great Train Robber' Bruce Reynolds dies at 81|date=28 February 2013<!-- 8:54 AM, Updated: 28 February 2013 10:30 AM-->|author=  Jill Lawless (Associated Press)|url =http://bigstory.ap.org/article/uk-great-train-robber-bruce-reynolds-dies-81}}</ref>\n\nReynolds was reincarcerated in the mid-1980s for dealing amphetamines.<ref name=\"Adam Bernstin, The Washington Post A26\"/> He has produced occasional journalism pieces, been a consultant on movie and book projects about the train heist, and published a well-regarded crime memoir, ''Crossing the Line: The Autobiography of a Thief'' (1995).<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/><ref name=\"Adam Bernstin, The Washington Post A26\"/><ref name=Lawless/>\n\nIn a 2003 interview, Reynolds recalled: \"from an early age I always wanted a life of adventure.\" He was rejected by the [[Royal Navy]] because of poor eyesight, and then tried to become a foreign correspondent, but his highest achievement in that vein was to become a clerk at the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.  While his life in crime did provide excitement, Reynolds said in 2003, \"I've always felt that I can't escape my past.  And in many ways I feel that it is like a line from the '[[Rime of the Ancient Mariner|Ancient Mariner]]' and that the notoriety was like an albatross around my neck.\"<ref name=Lawless/>\n\nReynolds died aged 81 on 28 February 2013 after a brief illness.<ref name=\"Adam Bernstin, The Washington Post A26\"/><ref name=Lawless/> He is survived by his son Nick.<ref name=bbc28022013>{{cite news|title=Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds dies aged 81|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21617926|accessdate=28 February 2013|work=BBC News|date=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Douglas Gordon Goody===\n{{update|section|date=December 2014|cat=Rail transport articles in need of updating}}\nAuthorities regarded Douglas Gordon Goody as the mastermind of the operation.<ref name=\"theguardian\">{{cite news | title =Great Train Robber who got away will be named | work =The Guardian | date =4 August 2013| url =https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/04/great-train-robbery-mystery-fixer| accessdate = 4 August 2013}}</ref> He first made contact with 'The Ulsterman' in a meeting set up by Brian Field in Finsbury Park. Of [[Northern Irish people|Northern Irish]] descent, Goody was born in [[Putney]], London in March 1930 and was still living there in his mother's flat at the time of the robbery.  In the early 1960s he joined Buster Edwards' gang and helped rob various easy targets.<ref>The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read (Pp 13\u201317)</ref>\n\nAfter his release from prison in 1975, Goody moved to the white-washed town of Moj\u00e1car in Almer\u00eda, Spain, where he ran the Chiringuito Kon Tiki beachfront bar. In September 2014, Goody claimed the identity of 'The Ulsterman' was Patrick McKenna for the first time in a documentary marking the 50th anniversary of the robbery.<ref name=\"theguardian\" /> The documentary makers employed [[Ariel Bruce]], a social worker who finds missing family members, to trace McKenna, who was found to have died some years previously.  However Bruce was able to make contact with McKenna's family.  This documentary was shown in cinemas and on demand in October 2014.\nOn 29 January 2016, Goody died of emphysema at the age of 85.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economicvoice.com/the-great-train-robbery-a-tale-of-two-thieves-will-reveal-the-identity-of-the-mastermind/|title=The Great Train Robbery: A Tale of Two Thieves - The Economic Voice|work=economicvoice.com|accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Charles Frederick (Charlie) Wilson===\nThe most dangerous of the Great Train Robbers was 'the Silent Man' [[Charlie Wilson (criminal)|Charlie Wilson]]. He was born on 30 June 1932 to Bill and Mabel Wilson in [[Battersea]].  His friends from childhood were Jimmy Hussey, Tommy Wisbey, Bruce Reynolds and Gordon Goody.  Later on, he met [[Ronald Christopher Edwards|Ronald 'Buster' Edwards]] and the young driving enthusiasts [[Mickey Ball]] and Roy James, who had taken up car theft.  From 1948 to 1950 he was called up for [[national service]], and in 1955 he married [[Patricia (Pat) Osbourne]], with whom he had three children.  He turned to crime early in life and spurned his father's legitimate but low-income wage.  While he did have legitimate work in his in-laws' grocer's shop, he also was a thief and his criminal proceeds went into buying shares in various gambling enterprises.  He went to jail for short spells for numerous offences.  In 1960, he began to work with Bruce Reynolds and planned to get into the criminal big league.<ref>''Killing Charlie'' (2004) by Wensley Clarkson</ref>\n\n===Ronald \"Buster\" Edwards===\n[[Buster Edwards|Ronald Christopher Edwards]] was born on 27 January 1932 at [[Lambeth]], London, the son of a barman.<ref>spelling mistake</ref> After leaving school, he worked in a sausage factory, where he began his criminal career by stealing meat to sell on the post-war black market.  During his national service in the [[RAF]] he was detained for stealing cigarettes. When he returned to [[South London]], he ran a drinking club and became a professional criminal.  He married June Rose in 1952.  They had a daughter, Nicky.<ref name=\"The Train Robbers 1978\">The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read</ref> In his final years he ran a flower stall outside Waterloo station in London.\n\n===Brian Field===\n[[Brian Field|Brian Arthur Field]] was born on 15 December 1934 and was immediately put up for adoption.  He served two years in the [[Royal Army Service Corps]], seeing service during the [[Korean War]].  Although soldiers in the Service Corps were considered combat personnel, they were primarily associated with transport and logistics.  When he was discharged from the military, it was with \"a very good character\".<ref>Peter Gutteridge ''Crime Archive: The Great Train Robbery''</ref>\n\nField later became a solicitor's managing clerk for John Wheater & Co.  Although he was only 28 at the time of the robbery, he was already apparently more prosperous than his boss, John Wheater.  Field drove a new Jaguar and had a house, \"Kabri\" (an amalgam of Karin and Brian [Field]), with his wife at the Bridle Path, [[Whitchurch Hill]], Oxfordshire, while his boss owned a battered Ford and lived in a run-down neighbourhood.  Part of the reason for Field's prosperity was that he was not averse to giving Goody and Edwards information about what his clients had in their country houses, making them prime targets for the thieves.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/> On one occasion he described the contents and layout of a house near Weybridge where wife Karin had once been a nanny.<ref>Piers Paul Read ''The Train Robbers'' (1978), pp.27\u201329</ref>\n\nPrior to the robbery Field had represented Buster Edwards and Gordon Goody. He had arranged Edwards' defence when he had been caught with a stolen car and had met Goody at a nightclub in [[Soho]].  Field was called upon to assist in Goody's defence in the aftermath of the \"Airport Job\", which was a robbery carried out on 27 November 1962 at BOAC Comet House, Hatton Cross, [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]].  This was the big practice robbery that the South West Gang had done before the Great Train Robbery.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/> Field was successful in arranging bail for Goody and Charlie Wilson.\n\n===\"The Ulsterman\"===\nIn 2014, Douglas Goody claimed to journalists that \"The Ulsterman\" was Patrick McKenna, at the time of the robbery a 43-year-old postal worker living in [[Salford]], [[Lancashire]].  \nMcKenna, who was originally from [[Belfast]], met Goody four times in 1963. Goody alleged that he found out McKenna's name only when he saw it written inside his spectacles case.\n\nIt is not known what became of the share McKenna allegedly received, but his children were \"flabbergasted\" on hearing the claim of their father's involvement. It was surmised that McKenna either donated his share to the [[Catholic church]] over the years or had had the money stolen from him.<ref name=\"Tracy McVeigh\">{{cite news|title=The quiet Great Train Robber reveals identity of the gang's mystery insider|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/28/great-train-robber-douglas-gordon-goody-reveals-identity-mystery-inside|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=28 September 2014|author=Tracy McVeigh|date=28 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis alleged identification of McKenna as \"The Ulsterman\" has been disputed; not least because McKenna appears to have had no criminal record or associations and died poor. It has been suggested<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> that a known associate of the convicted robbers, Sammy Osterman, was part of the gang, and his \"Ulsterman\" soubriquet was simply the result of mishearing his surname.\n\n===Accomplices===\nWilliam Gerald Boal (22 October 1913 \u2013 26 June 1970), an accomplice after the fact of Roger Cordrey, was convicted as being one of the robbers, despite playing a role no different from the many other accomplices of the various train robbers.

He died in Harrogate, near Leeds, aged 63.\n\n==Aylesbury investigation==\nAt 05:00, [[Chief Superintendent]] [[Malcolm Fewtrell]], head of the Buckinghamshire Police Criminal Investigation Department ([[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]]), located at [[Aylesbury]], arrived at the crime scene, where he supervised evidence-gathering. He then went to [[Cheddington railway station]], where the train had been taken, and where statements were taken from the driver and postal workers.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1505956/Chief-Superintendent-Malcolm-Frewtrell.html |title=Chief Superintendent Malcolm Frewtrell |newspaper=Telegraph |date=21 December 2005 |accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref> A member of the gang had told the postal staff not to move for half an hour and this suggested to the police that their hide-out could not be more than {{convert|30|mi}} away.<ref name=ITV2012/> It appeared, from interviews with the witnesses, that about 15 hooded men dressed in blue boiler suits had been involved, but little more could be gleaned.\n\nBy lunchtime of the following day, it became obvious to Fewtrell that extra resources were needed to cope with the scale of the investigation and the [[Buckinghamshire]] [[Chief Constable]] referred the case to [[Scotland Yard]]. George Hatherill, Commander of the C Department and Detective Chief Superintendent Earnest (Ernie) Millen, Head of the [[Flying Squad]] were initially in charge of the London side of the investigation. They sent Detective Superintendent Gerald McArthur and Detective Sergeant John Pritchard to assist the Buckinghamshire Police.\n\nThe police then undertook a major search, fanning out from the crime scene after having failed to find any forensic evidence there. A watch was put on the seaports. The [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]] [[Reginald Bevins]] offered a \u00a310,000 reward to \"the first person giving information leading to the apprehension and conviction of the persons responsible for the robbery\".\n\n===Discovery of Leatherslade Farm===\nFollowing a tip-off from a herdsman who used a field adjacent to Leatherslade Farm, a police sergeant and constable called there on 13 August 1963, five days after the robbery.<ref>The Great British Train Robbery, 1963.</ref> The farm was deserted but they found the truck used by the robbers, which had been hastily painted yellow, as well as the Land Rovers. They also found a large quantity of food, bedding, sleeping bags, post-office sacks, registered mail packages, banknote wrappers and a [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly board game]].\n\nIt was determined that although the farm had been cleaned for fingerprints, some finger and palm prints (presumably of the robbers) had been overlooked, including those on a ketchup bottle and on the Monopoly set (which had been used after the robbery for a game, but with real money).\n\n==London investigation==\nDespite the big breakthrough of the discovery of Leatherslade Farm, the investigation was not going well. The London side of the investigation then continued under Detective Chief Superintendent [[Tommy Butler]], who replaced Millen as head of the [[Flying Squad]] shortly after Millen was promoted to Deputy Commander under George Hatherill.  On Monday 12 August 1963, Butler was appointed to head the police investigation of the London connection and quickly formed a six-man Train Robbery Squad. With Leatherslade Farm finally found on 13 August 1963, the day after Tommy Butler was appointed to head the London investigation, the Train Robbery Squad descended on the farm.<ref name=\"Crime 1972\">Specialist in Crime (1972), Ernest Millen</ref>\n\nThe key breakthrough was when Detective Chief Superintendent Millen met a distinguished barrister in a smoking room of an exclusive West End club who told him that someone was willing to inform on the gang.<ref name=\"Crime 1972\"/> The process of talking to the informer was handled by Hatherill and Millen themselves, and they never divulged the identity of the informer to the detectives in their command. The informant had just been jailed in a provincial prison before the train robbery, and was hoping to get parole and other favourable outcomes from talking. He clearly did not know all the names perfectly, and a second informant (a woman) was able to fill in the gaps. Millen said in his book ''Specialist in Crime'', \"the break-through with the informer came at a moment when I and my colleagues at the Yard were in a state of frustration almost approaching despair\".<ref>Specialist in Crime (1972), Ernest Millen, P.208</ref> This process saw them get 18 names to be passed on to detectives to match up with the list being prepared from fingerprints collected at Leatherslade.\n\nHatherill and Millen decided to publish photos of the wanted suspects, despite strong protests from Tommy Butler and Frank Williams. This resulted in most of the robbers going to ground.\n\n===Tommy Butler, the thief-taker===\n[[Tommy Butler]] was a shrewd choice to take over the Flying Squad and in particular the Train Robbery Squad.  He became arguably the most renowned head of the Flying Squad in its history.  He was known variously as \"Mr Flying Squad\", as \"One-day Tommy\" for the speed with which he apprehended criminals and as the \"Grey Fox\" for his shrewdness.  He was Scotland Yard's most formidable thief-taker and, as an unmarried man who still lived with his mother, he had a fanatical dedication to the job.  Butler worked long hours and expected all members of the squad to do the same.\n\nThe squad later had to work out rotations whereby one member would go home to rest as otherwise they were getting only three hours of sleep per night and had no time to eat healthily or see their families.  When the squad tried to get him to ease the working conditions, Butler was enraged and threatened to send them back to their normal duties.  Butler was said to be very secretive, with [[Jack Slipper]] claiming in his book ''Slipper of the Yard'' (1981) that \"he wouldn't even tell his own left hand what the right one was doing\".  This meant that Train Robbery Squad members were often dispatched on specific errands with no knowledge of how their tasks fitted into the overall investigation.\n\n===Train Robbery Squad===\nThe six-man Train Robbery Squad consisted of Detective Inspector Frank Williams, Detective Sergeant Steve Moore, Detective Sergeant [[Jack Slipper]], Detective Sergeant Jim Nevill, Detective Sergeant Lou Van Dyck and Detective Constable Tommy Thorburn. The senior officer, Frank Williams, was a quiet man.  His speciality was dealing with informants and he had the best working knowledge of the south London criminal fraternity in the force.  One of the squad, Jack Slipper, would later become head of the Flying Squad and would still be involved in the case many years later.\n\n===Post Office Investigation===\nThe Post Office Investigation Branch (IB) was tasked with immediately establishing the amount of money stolen, which they concluded totalled \u00a32,595,997.10s.0d. They also sought to identify what money had been taken so that the relevant banks could be notified.  Deficiencies in High Value Package carriage security were reported and secure carriages were immediately brought back into service.  The installation of radios was recommended as a priority.  The investigation was detailed in a report by Assistant Controller Richard Yates that was issued in May 1964.<ref name=PMA />\n\n==Captures==\n===Roger Cordrey===\nThe first gang member to be caught was Roger Cordrey. He was with his friend, William Boal who was helping him lie low in return for the payment of old debts.  They were living in a rented, fully furnished flat above a florist's shop in Wimborne Road, [[Moordown]], [[Bournemouth]]. The Bournemouth police were tipped off by Ethel Clark, who unfortunately for Boal and Cordrey was the widow of a former police officer, when Boal and Cordrey paid rent for a garage in Tweedale Road, off Castle Lane West, three months in advance, all in used ten-shilling notes.\n\nBoal, who was not involved in the robbery, was sentenced to 24 years and died in prison in 1970. Police later acknowledged that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.<ref>{{cite web | title=New bid to clear name of Great Train Robber Bill Boal | author=Bob Graham | work=Daily Mirror  | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/great-train-robbery-new-bid-2051666 | accessdate=14 July 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/aboutus/aboutus-museum/aboutus-museum-gtr/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang-boal.htm | title=William (Bill) Gerald Boal | publisher=Thames Valley Police | work=Force museum | accessdate=21 December 2013 | url-status=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220074653/http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/aboutus/aboutus-museum/aboutus-museum-gtr/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang-boal.htm | archivedate=20 December 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Others===\nOther arrests followed.  Eight of the gang members and several associates were caught.  The other arrests were made by Sgt Stan Davis and Probationary Constable Gordon 'Charlie' Case.<ref>{{cite news |title=Historic fiver's up for sale |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1800494.mostviewed.historic_fivers_up_for_sale.php |accessdate=1 November 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn Friday 16 August 1963, two people who had decided to take a morning stroll in [[Dorking]] Woods discovered a briefcase, a holdall and a camel-skin bag, all containing money.  They called police, who also discovered another briefcase full of money in the woods.  In total, a sum of \u00a3100,900 was found.  They also found a camel-skin bag with a receipt inside, from the Cafe Pension restaurant, Sonnenbichel, [[Hindelang]], Prov. [[Allg\u00e4u]] in Germany.  It was made out to Herr and Frau Field. Surrey police delivered the money and the receipt to Fewtrell and McArthur in Aylesbury, who knew by then that Brian Field was a clerk at James and Wheater who had acted in the purchase of Leatherslade Farm.  They quickly confirmed through [[Interpol]] that Brian and Karin Field had stayed at the Pension Sonnebichel in February that year.  In addition, they knew that Field had acted for Gordon Goody and other criminals.\n\nSeveral weeks later, the police went to Field's house to interview him.  He calmly (for someone whose relatives had dumped a large part at least of the loot) provided a cover story that implicated [[Lennie Field]] as the purchaser of the farm and his boss John Wheater as the conveyancer.  He admitted to visiting the farm on one occasion with Lennie Field, but said he assumed it was an investment of his brother Alexander Field, whom Brian Field had unsuccessfully defended in a recent court case.  Field, not knowing the police had found a receipt, readily confirmed that he and his wife had been to Germany on a holiday and gave them the details of the place at which they had stayed.  On 15 September 1963 Brian Field was arrested and his boss John Wheater was arrested two days later.  Lennie Field had already been arrested on 14 September.<ref name=\"The Train Robbers 1978\"/>\n\nJack Slipper was involved in the capture of Roy James, Ronald Biggs, Jimmy Hussey and John Daly.\n\n==Trial, 1964==\nThe trial of the robbers began at [[Aylesbury]] [[Assizes (England and Wales)|Assizes]], Buckinghamshire, on 20 January 1964. Because it would be necessary to accommodate a large number of lawyers and journalists, the existing court was deemed too small and so the offices of Aylesbury Rural District Council were specially converted for the event. The defendants were brought to the court each day from [[Aylesbury Prison]] in a compartmentalised van, out of view of the large crowd of spectators. [[Edmund Davies, Baron Edmund-Davies|Mr Justice Edmund Davies]] presided over the trial, which lasted 51 days and included 613 exhibits and 240 witnesses. The jury retired to the Grange Youth Centre in Aylesbury to consider its verdict.<ref>{{cite news|title=The crime of the century|first=Tom|last=Hodson|newspaper=The Buckingham and Winslow Advertiser|date=3 May 2007|url=http://www.buckinghamtoday.co.uk/the-great-train-robbery/The-crime-of-the-century.2852468.jp}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 February 1964, there was a sensation when John Daly was found to have no case to answer. His counsel, Walter Raeburn [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], claimed that the evidence against his client was limited to his fingerprints being on the Monopoly set found at Leatherslade Farm and the fact that he went underground after the robbery. Raeburn went on to say that Daly had played the Monopoly game with his brother-in-law Bruce Reynolds earlier in 1963, and that he had gone underground only because he was associated with people publicly sought by the police. This was not proof of involvement in a conspiracy. The judge agreed, and the jury was directed to acquit him.<ref>The Train Robbers (Piers Paul Read) (1978)</ref>\n\nDetective Inspector Frank Williams was shocked when this occurred because, owing to Tommy Butler's refusal to share information, he had no knowledge of the fact that Daly's prints were only on the Monopoly set. If Williams had known this, he could have asked Daly questions about the Monopoly set and robbed him of his very effective alibi. Daly was clever in avoiding having a photo taken when he was arrested until he could shave his beard. This meant that there was no photo to show the lengths he had gone to in order to change his appearance. No action was taken against Butler for his mistake in not ensuring the case against Daly was more thorough.<ref>Williams, Frank ''No Fixed Address'' (1973) Ch. Get Out of Gaol...Free (Pp 45\u201353).</ref>\n\nOn 15 April 1964 the proceedings ended with the judge describing the robbery as \"a crime of sordid violence inspired by vast greed\" and passing sentences of 30 years' imprisonment on seven of the robbers.<ref name=Bucksheadlines>{{cite book|year=1992|author=Jean Archer|isbn=1-85306-188-3|title=Buckinghamshire Headlines|publisher=Countryside Books}}</ref>\n\n===Sentencing===\nThe 11 men sentenced all felt aggrieved at the sentences handed down, particularly Bill Boal (who died in prison) and Lennie Field, who were later found not guilty of the charges against them.  The other men (aside from Wheater) resented what they considered to be the excessive length of the sentences, which were longer than those given to many murderers or armed robbers at the time.  At that period, there was no parole system in place and prisoners served the full term of the sentence. Train robbers who were sentenced later, and by different judges, received shorter terms.\n\nAt the time, the severity of the sentences caused some surprise.  When mastermind Bruce Reynolds was arrested in 1968, he allegedly told arresting officer Tommy Butler that those sentences had had a detrimental effect. According to him, they had prompted criminals generally to take guns with them when they set out on robberies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Age\n!Occupation\n!Sentence\n|-\n| John Thomas Daly || 32 || antiques dealer || No case to answer\n|-\n| Ronald Arthur Biggs || 34 || carpenter || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Douglas Gordon Goody || 34 || hairdresser || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Charles Frederick Wilson || 31 || market trader || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Thomas William Wisbey || 34 || bookmaker || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Robert Welch || 34 || club proprietor || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| James Hussey || 34 || painter || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Roy John James || 28 || racing motorist and silversmith || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Roger John Cordrey || 42 || florist || 20 years (20 years for conspiracy to rob and various receiving stolen goods charges)\n|-\n| Brian Arthur Field || 29 || solicitor's clerk || 25 years (20 years for conspiracy to rob and 5 years for obstructing justice)\n|-\n| Leonard Denis Field || 31 || merchant seaman || 25 years (20 years for conspiracy to rob and 5 years for obstructing justice)\n|-\n| John Denby Wheater || 41 || solicitor || 3 years (Aiding and abetting a crime)\n|-\n| William Gerald Boal || 50 || engineer || 24 years\n|}\n\n===Appeals, July 1964===\nOn 13 July 1964, the appeals by Lennie Field and Brian Field (no relation) against the charges of conspiracy to rob were allowed.  This meant that their sentences were in effect reduced to five years only.  On 14 July 1964, the appeals by Roger Cordrey and Bill Boal were allowed, with the convictions for conspiracy to rob quashed, leaving only the receiving charges. Justice [[Fenton Atkinson]] concluded that a [[miscarriage of justice]] would result if Boal's charges were upheld, given that his age, physique and temperament made him an unlikely train robber.  Luckily for him, as the oldest robber, Cordrey was also deemed to be not guilty of the conspiracy because his prints had not been found at Leatherslade Farm.\n\nBrian Field was only reluctantly acquitted of the robbery.  Justice Atkinson stated that he would not be surprised if Field were not only part of the conspiracy, but also one of the robbers.  The charges against the other men were all upheld.  In the end Lennie Field and Bill Boal got some measure of justice, but Boal died in prison in 1970 after a long illness.<ref>The Train Robbers by Piers Paul Read (1976)</ref>\n\n==Prison escapes==\nOn 12 August 1964, Wilson escaped from [[Birmingham (HM Prison)|Winson Green Prison]] in Birmingham in under three minutes, the escape being considered unprecedented in that a three-man team had broken into the prison to extricate him.  His escape team was never caught and the leader, nicknamed \"Frenchy\", had disappeared from the London criminal scene by the late 1960s. Two weeks after his escape Wilson was in Paris for plastic surgery. By November 1965, Wilson was in [[Mexico City]] visiting old friends Bruce Reynolds and Buster Edwards.<ref>\"Killing Charlie\" by Wensley Clarkson, with Part 2: Inside and Outside providing details of Wilson's escape from prison.</ref> Wilson's escape was yet another dramatic twist in the train robbery saga.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/12/newsid_2996000/2996402.stm\n|title=Great Train Robber Escapes from Jail\n|publisher=BBC |quote=A massive manhunt is underway across Britain after one of the so-called Great Train Robbers escaped from Winson Green Prison in Birmingham.

A furniture van was parked alongside the prison walls and a ladder was dropped over the 30-foot-high wall into the prison during outside exercise time, allowing four prisoners to escape, including Biggs.  The escape was planned by recently released prisoner Paul Seaborne, with the assistance of two other ex-convicts, Ronnie Leslie and Ronnie Black, with support from Biggs's wife, Charmian.  The plot saw two other prisoners interfere with the warders, and allow Biggs and friend Eric Flower to escape.  Seaborne was later caught by Butler and sentenced to four-and-a-half years; Ronnie Leslie received three years for being the getaway driver.  The two other prisoners who took advantage of the Biggs escape were captured after three months. Biggs and Flower paid a significant sum of money to be smuggled to Paris for plastic surgery.  Biggs said he had to escape because of the length of the sentence and what he alleged to be the severity of the prison conditions.<ref>\"Odd Man Out\" (1994) by Ronald Biggs. Chapter 5 describes the Biggs escape from Wandsworth Prison to Paris</ref>\n\nWilson and Biggs's escapes meant that five of the known robbers were now on the run, with Tommy Butler in hot pursuit.\n\n==Pursuit of fugitives==\n'''Jimmy White''' \u2013 With the other robbers on the run and having fled the country, only White was at large in the United Kingdom. White was a renowned locksmith/thief and had already been on the run for 10 years before the robbery. He was said to have \"a remarkable ability to be invisible, to merge with his surroundings and become the ultimate Mr Nobody.\" He was a wartime paratrooper and a veteran of [[Battle of Arnhem|Arnhem]].<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/> According to [[Piers Paul Read]] in his 1978 book ''The Train Robbers'', he was \"a solitary thief, not known to work with either firm, he should have had a good chance of remaining undetected altogether, yet was known to be one of the Train Robbers almost at once\u2014first by other criminals and then by the police\". He was unfortunate in that Brian Field's relatives had dumped luggage containing \u00a3100,000 only a mile from a site where White had bought a caravan and hidden \u00a330,000 in the panelling. In addition, a group of men purporting to be from the Flying Squad broke into his flat and took a briefcase containing \u00a38,500. Throughout his three years on the run with wife Sheree and baby son Stephen, he was taken advantage of or let down by friends and associates. On 10 April 1966 a new friend recognised him from photos in a newspaper and informed police. They arrested him at Littlestone while he was at home. He only had \u00a38,000 to hand back to them. The rest was long gone. He was tried in June 1966 at [[Leicester]] [[Assizes]] and Mr Justice Nield sentenced him to 18 years' jail, considerably less than the 30 years given to other principal offenders.\n\n'''[[Buster Edwards]]''' \u2013 Edwards fled to Mexico with his family, to join Bruce Reynolds (and later Charlie Wilson) but returned voluntarily to England in 1966, where he was sentenced to 15 years.\n\n'''[[Charlie Wilson (criminal)|Charlie Wilson]]''' \u2013 Wilson took up residence outside [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, on [[Rigaud, Quebec|Rigaud Mountain]] in an upper-middle-class neighbourhood where the large, secluded properties are surrounded by trees. He lived under the name Ronald Alloway, a name borrowed from a Fulham shopkeeper. His wife and three children soon joined him.  He joined an exclusive golf club and participated in the activities of the local community. It was only when he invited his brother-in-law over from the UK for Christmas that [[Scotland Yard]] was able to track him down and recapture him. They waited three months before making their move, in the hope that Wilson would lead them to Reynolds, the last suspect still to be apprehended. Wilson was arrested on 25 January 1968 by Tommy Butler. Many in Rigaud petitioned that his wife and three daughters be allowed to stay in the Montreal area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coolopolis.blogspot.com/2008/03/montreals-connection-to-great-train.html |title=Coolopolis: Montreal's connection to the Great Train Robbery |publisher=Coolopolis.blogspot.com |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Bruce Reynolds]]''' \u2013 On 6 June 1964, Reynolds arrived in Mexico, with his wife Angela and son Nick joining him a few months later, after they evaded the obvious police surveillance. A year later in July 1965, Buster Edwards and his family arrived, although unlike the Reynolds family they planned to return to England at some stage, and did not like Mexico. Charlie Wilson, on the run with his family still back in England visited them for six weeks, so three of the train robbers were together in exile for a time. After the Edwards family returned to England, the Reynoldses also decided to leave Mexico and go to Canada to potentially join up with the Wilson family, leaving on 6 December 1966. They had spent much of their share of the robbery by this point \u2013 living far more extravagantly than the Edwardses had. After realising the danger in settling near the Wilsons in Montreal, they went to live in Vancouver, and then went to Nice, France. Reynolds did not want to go to Australia where Biggs was, and needing money decided to go back to England, settling briefly in Torquay before being captured by Tommy Butler.<ref>Crossing the Line - The Autobiography of a Thief, by Bruce Reynolds</ref>\n\n'''[[Ronnie Biggs]]''' \u2013 Biggs fled to Paris, where he acquired new identity papers and underwent [[plastic surgery]].  In 1970, he moved to [[Adelaide, Australia]], where he worked as a builder and he and his wife had a third son.  Tipped off that [[Interpol]] was showing interest, he moved to [[Melbourne]] working as a set constructor for [[Nine network|Channel 9]], later escaping to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], after police had discovered his Melbourne address. Biggs could not be [[extradition|extradited]] because there was no extradition treaty between Britain and Brazil, and additionally he became father to a Brazilian son, which afforded him legal immunity. As a result, he lived openly in Rio for many years, safe from the British authorities. In 1981, Biggs' Brazilian son became a member of a successful band [[Turma do Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico]], but the band quickly faded into obscurity and dissolved.\n\nIn May 2001, aged 71 and having suffered three strokes, Biggs voluntarily returned to England. Accepting that he could be arrested, his stated desire was to \"walk into a [[Margate]] pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of [[bitter (beer)|bitter]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/pictures/image/0,8543,-10704180185,00.html|title=2001: Biggs wants to return|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=66752 |title=Statement from Michael Biggs made in London |publisher=Prnewswire.co.uk |date=8 May 2001 |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> Arrested on landing, after detention and a short court hearing he was sent back to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence.

In later years, the robbers generally came together only for the funerals of their fellow gang members.  Wilson's funeral on 10 May 1990 was attended by Bruce Reynolds, who reported seeing Edwards, Roy James (who got into a verbal argument with the press), Welch (hobbling on crutches) and White (who went unnoticed due to his ability to blend into the background). At Edwards's funeral in 1994, Reynolds saw only Welch. (Hussey, Wisbey and James were all in prison at the time.)\n\n'''Brian Field'''\n{{main|Brian Field}}\nAfter being sentenced on 16 April 1964, Field served four years of his five-year sentence. He was released in 1967. While he was in prison, his wife Karin divorced him and married a German journalist.<ref>Signal Red by Robert Ryan (2010)</ref> Karin wrote an article for the German magazine [[Stern (magazine)|''Stern'']]. She confirmed that she took Roy James to [[Thame railway station]] so he could go to London and that she led a convoy of two vans back to her house, where the gang were joined by wives and girlfriends for a big party to celebrate the crime.<ref>The Great Train Robbery (Crime Archive series) (2008) by Peter Gutteridge (P 54)</ref> When Reynolds returned to the UK in 1968, he tried to contact Field as this was the only way he could get in touch with the \"Ulsterman\". It seems that Field was ambushed upon his release from prison by a recently released convict, \"Scotch Jack\" Buggy, who presumably roughed up or even tortured Field with a view to extorting some of the loot from the robbery. Subsequently, Field went to ground and Buggy was killed shortly after. Reynolds gave up trying to find Field.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/>\n\nField changed his name to Brian Carlton to disappear. Sometime after his release from prison he married Sian, from Wales. In the mid/late 1970s they worked for the Children's Book Centre (since sold) in Kensington High Street, London. Field and his wife Sian were responsible for the company's operations in central and southern Europe, to where they shipped English language books and held book fairs at international English schools. Field, aged 44, and Sian, aged 28, died in a car crash on the M4 motorway on 27 April 1979, a year after the last of the robbers had completed their sentences. The accident occurred as they returned from a visit to Sian's parents in Wales. A Mercedes driven by Amber Bessone, the pregnant 28-year-old daughter of well-known hairdresser [[Raymond Bessone]] (Mr Teasy Weasy) crossed a damaged section of the guard rail and slammed into Field's oncoming Porsche. The Fields, Amber, her husband and two children were all killed instantly. It was several weeks after the accident that Field's true identity was discovered. It is not clear whether his wife Sian ever knew of his past.\n\n'''Charlie Wilson'''\n{{main|Charlie Wilson (criminal)}}\nThe last of the robbers released, (after serving about one-third of his sentence<ref name=\"Greenwood\">{{cite book|last=Greenwood|first=Douglas|title=Who's Buried where in England|edition=Third|year=1999|publisher=Constable|isbn=0-09-479310-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/whosburiedwherei0000gree}}</ref>) Wilson returned to the life of crime and was found shot dead at his villa in [[Marbella]], Spain, on 24 April 1990.

Reynolds later got back together with his wife Angela and son Nicholas.  He was arrested in 1983 for drug-related offences (Reynolds denied having any involvement).

Having suffered a series of strokes after his release, and unable to speak for the previous three years, Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care home, London on 18 December 2013.\n\n'''Tommy Wisbey and Big Jim Hussey'''<br />\nTommy Wisbey was luckier than most of the others, in that his loot had been entrusted to his brothers, and when he emerged, he had a house in South London and a few other investments to keep him going.  During his prison stint, his daughter Lorraine had died in a car accident.  He took a while to learn how to live harmoniously with his wife Rene (his daughter Marilyn having moved out upon his return).  Shortly after his release, Wisbey was imprisoned on remand over a swindle involving travellers' cheques.  The judge acknowledged the minor nature of his role.<ref>Gangster's Moll (2001) by Marilyn Wisbey (Pp 80\u201381)</ref>\n\nJim Hussey was released on 17 November 1975 and married girlfriend Gill (whom he had met just before the robbery).  Hussey's share of the loot had been entrusted to a friend of Frank Monroe who squandered it despite Monroe periodically checking on its keeper. \n \nWisbey and Hussey fell back into crime and were jailed in 1989 for cocaine dealing, with Wisbey sentenced to 10 years and Hussey to seven years.  In her book ''Gangster's Moll'', Marilyn Wisbey recounts that on 8 June 1988, after returning home from a visit to an abortion clinic and resting they were raided by the Drugs Squad. The raid uncovered 1&nbsp;kg of cocaine and Rene and Marilyn Wisbey were arrested along with Jimmy Hussey, who had been spotted accepting a package from Wisbey in a park. Wisbey himself was captured a year later in Wilmslow, Cheshire. He was allegedly staying with another woman, to the shock of his wife and daughter. In return for Hussey and Wisbey pleading guilty, the two women were unconditionally freed.<ref>Gangster's Moll (2001) by Marlyn Wisbey (Chapters 1: Growing Up and 12: Cocaine)</ref> Upon their release from prison, both men retired from work.<ref>Signal Red by Robert Ryan (Pp486, 487)</ref>\n\nWisbey later explained: \"We were against drugs all our lives, but as the years went on, towards the end of the '70s, it became more and more the 'in' thing.

By 29 August 1963 Commander Hatherill had 14 names, and told police that Brian Field had tried to enlist another gang to rob the train, who turned him down. Hatherill's list was unerringly accurate\u2014all the major gang members who were later jailed were identified, except Ronnie Biggs. With the exception of the minor accomplices Lennie Field, Bill Boal and the train driver, the list was complete, although of course \"The Ulsterman\" was not identified. In terms of the ones who got away, there were four others identified\u2014Henry Smith, Danny Pembroke, a fair-haired man (25 years old and well-spoken, not named) and a nondescript man (not named but maybe Jimmy Collins).{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 2019, Pembroke's son, also called Danny, confirmed that his father was present during the raid. He escaped detection as he always wore gloves, including at the hideout at the farm, and went outside to the toilet rather than using the one inside the house. The son stated that Pembroke, whose share of the loot was \u00a3150,000 (about \u00a33&nbsp;million in 2019), died in 2015 aged 79.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Matthew |title=Great Train Robber unmasked 56 years on |work=The Times |issue=72,916 |date=3 August 2019 |page=14|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>\n\nBoth Piers Paul Read, and later Bruce Reynolds refer to three robbers who got away as Bill Jennings, Alf Thomas and Frank Monroe.\n\n'''Bill 'Flossy' Jennings a.k.a. Mr One'''\n\nPiers Paul Read refers to this man as Bill Jennings in ''The Train Robbers'', while Bruce Reynolds adds a nickname, 'Flossy'. Ronnie Biggs refers to him as Mr One, as do other accounts. According to Bruce Reynolds, \"Flossy had no previous convictions and stayed well out of contact with the group. A shadowy figure, nobody knew exactly where he lived\u2014or even what his real name was. All we knew that he was one hundred per cent, and was sure to last out the hullabaloo. The last report of him said that he was in a safe house, banged up with two gorgeous girls and enough champagne to sink a battleship.\"<ref>Crossing the Line&nbsp;\u2014 The Autobiography of a Thief, Bruce Reynolds, Page 217</ref>\n\nIt is clear that while Reynolds claims to not have known his real name, 'Flossy' was not just a participant in the Great Train Robbery, he was a core part of the gang who participated in the London Airport robbery. This robbery was the audacious raid that Gordon Goody and Charlie Wilson were acquitted of. That raid consisted of Roy James and Mickey Ball as the getaway drivers, with six robbers\u2014Bruce Reynolds, Buster Edwards, Gordon Goody, Charlie Wilson, Flossy (and a sixth man who did not participate in the train robbery). In the end the only one caught after the airport raid was Mickey Ball, who pleaded guilty to being a getaway driver when a witness mistook him for Flossy, and to avoid being blamed for the actual violence he agreed to plead guilty as an accomplice, and was in prison during the Great Train Robbery. He was given \u00a3500 from the proceeds of the Train Robbery.<ref>Crossing the Line&nbsp;\u2014 The Autobiography of a Thief, Bruce Reynolds, Page 167</ref>\n\nHenry Thomas 'Harry' Smith (born 20 October 1930) was Flossy and unlike most other robbers, actually got to spend his share of the loot, buying 28 houses and also a hotel and drinking club in Portsmouth. Smith died in 2008. Smith was the only man not ultimately arrested that was on both the Hatherill list, and Tommy Butler's list.\n\n'''Danny Pembroke (Alf Thomas)'''\n\nDanny Pembroke was an ex army man who was a south London taxi driver and a South Coast Raider. At Leatherslade Farm he was the most careful of the gang, and nothing was ever found to associate him with the robbery, despite the police being satisfied that he was one of the gang, and had searched his house in September 1963. However, afraid that he would be betrayed, he did a deal with Frank Williams and paid back \u00a347,245. Following the robbery, Pembroke left for America for a couple of years, knowing he was set up for life, and then returned to live quietly in Kent. He died aged 79 from a heart attack, at home and in his sleep on 28 February 2015. Pembroke had five children, and his son Danny Jnr, admitted to his involvement in a Channel Four documentary in August 2019.\n\n'''Frank Monroe'''\n\nAccording to Bruce Reynolds, Monroe, who was never caught, worked as a film stunt man for a while before starting a paper and scrap metal recycling business.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/>\n\n'''The Replacement Train Driver a.k.a. Pops/Dad a.k.a. Peter a.k.a. Stan Agate'''\n\nThe replacement train driver was never caught, and never suspected of even existing by police, due to the fact that Jack Mills in the end had to drive the train. He also never profited from the crime, as Ronnie Biggs never paid him his \u00a320,000 \"drink\". The driver, of course, was not a member of the gang (as defined by receiving an equal share), just an accomplice.\n\nPiers Paul Read called the replacement train driver \"Stan Agate\", and Stan was apparently the true nickname of the replacement driver. Read, concerned that the robbers may have hurt him, went to see Ronnie Biggs in Brazil to get his details, although was dismayed to find that Biggs did not know his last name and knew and cared very little about him. With the meagre details provided, Read used a detective agency to track down the driver at a town 20 miles south of London, and found that he was still alive, although somewhat senile and being cared for by his wife. The wife admitted that she had burnt all the clothes that he had worn that night, and had nervously waited for either the gang to murder him or the police to arrest him. Read promised not to reveal their identities.<ref>The Train Robbers, Piers Paul Read, Pages 269-271</ref> Unlike the other three members of the gang who got away, Peta Fordham does make mention of the replacement driver, but notes that he is said now to be dead, perhaps the robbers who provided material for the book did not want the police looking for him, as at the time of publishing (1965) Reynolds, White and Edwards were still on the run.<ref>The Robbers' Tale, Peta Fordham, Page 78</ref>\n\nRonnie Biggs, in his 1994 autobiography, ''Odd Man Out'', said that Bruce Reynolds offered him a chance to join the gang, if he could find a train driver. Biggs was renewing the front windows of a train driver's house in Redhill, who he calls 'Peter' (and whom he believes to be dead by 1994). Ronnie offers him a \u00a340,000 share of the profits, tells Reynolds and gives his address to John Daly who then proceeds to check him out. It seems that while he was an older man, he still had to apply for two weeks leave of absence from his job.<ref>Odd Man Out (1994), Ronnie Biggs, Pages14-16</ref> According to Biggs, 'Peter' was paid his \u00a340,000 'drink',<ref name=\"Odd Man Out 1994 Pages31-32\">Odd Man Out (1994), Ronnie Biggs, Pages31-32</ref> although other accounts claim otherwise. Biggs states that Mary Manson drove 'Peter' and John Daly home, while Reynolds drove Biggs home.\n\n===Accomplices===\nJohn Wheater was released from prison on 11 February 1966 and managed his family's laundry business in Harrogate.<ref>The Train Robbers by Piers Paul Read (Pp 235 & 245)</ref> He later wrote two articles in the ''Sunday Telegraph'', which published the first one on 6 March 1966. He died in July 1985.\n\nLenny Field was released in 1967 and went to live in North London. He disappeared from the public eye.\n\nMary Manson, an associate of Bruce Reynolds and John Daly, was charged with receiving \u00a3820 from the robbery; she was held for six weeks but was released.  Mary took care of wives and children of some of the robbers while they were on the run or in jail.\n\n==Fate of the victims==\n===Jack Mills===\n[[Jack Mills|Mills]] had constant trauma headaches for the rest of his life. He died in 1970 from [[leukaemia]]. Mills's assailant was one of three members of the gang, who was never identified by the others. However, in November 2012, Hussey made a death-bed confession that it was he, although there were suspicions that this was repayment of a debt, to divert attention from the real perpetrator.<ref>{{cite news|title=James Hussey: Great Train Robber who made a disputed confession on his deathbed|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/james-hussey-great-train-robber-who-made-a-disputed-confession-on-his-deathbed-8320564.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=19 December 2013|location=London|date=15 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrank Williams (at the time a detective inspector) claimed that at least three men who were directly involved are still at liberty and enjoying their full share of the money stolen and the profits from the way they invested it, one of them being the man responsible for the attack on the train driver. Williams said that the train driver's assailant was not some phantom figure lurking in the criminal underworld, and that he traced him, identified him and took him to Scotland Yard where, with Tommy Butler, Williams questioned him.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He could not be charged because of lack of evidence; there were no fingerprints or identifiable marks anywhere. None of those arrested informed on this person, although it was claimed that he had completely disobeyed instructions and used violence during the robbery.\n\n===David Whitby===\nDavid Whitby (24 January 1937 \u2013 6 January 1972)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://search.ancestry.com.au/cgi-bin/sse.dll?_phsrc=Bxs2&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs=true&gss=angs-g&new=1&rank=1&msT=1&gsfn=David%20&gsfn_x=1&gsln=Whitby&gsln_x=1&msbdy_x=1&msbdp=1&msbdy=1937&msddy=1972&cpxt=1&cp=4&catbucket=rstp&MSAV=1&uidh=dv7&pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&h=34750555&dbid=7579&indiv=1&ml_rpos=3|accessdate= 21 January 2017|title= The England and Wales Civil Registration Death Index shows that David Whitby\u2019s death was registered in the Jan-Mar 1972 quarter, for the Crewe District|volume=olume 10a|page= 858}}</ref> was also from Crewe.

He was considered so at the time because he knew Cordrey and moreover was found in Cordrey's car where a large stash of the stolen money was hidden. He died in jail of cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/aboutus/aboutus-museum/aboutus-museum-gtr/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang-boal.htm|title=William Gerald Boal profile|work=thamesvalley.police.uk|accessdate=27 August 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220074653/http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/aboutus/aboutus-museum/aboutus-museum-gtr/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang-boal.htm|archivedate=20 December 2013}}</ref> His family are now trying to have his name cleared, as they believe, based on evidence not used in the original trial, that Boal was at best an accomplice after the fact with no knowledge of the robbery, and that Cordrey likely told him nothing about where he obtained the cash.<ref name=\"bobgraham\"/> Further, both Ronnie Biggs and Gordon Goody, two surviving gang members at the time, gave sworn affidavits asserting that Boal was innocent.

This paid off with the arrests of first Wilson, then Reynolds. When asked by a reporter after the sentencing of Reynolds whether that was the end of it, Butler replied that it was not over until Biggs was caught. In 1969 he was finally forced to accept compulsory retirement, and later died in 1970, aged 57.  That same day, Biggs' memoirs were published in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper.\n\nButler's deputy, Frank Williams, was passed over to be his replacement as head of the Flying Squad because of his deal with Edwards (which he thought would seal his promotion) and his deal with another of the robbers who was never caught. Following this, he left the force to become head of security for the airline [[Qantas]]. He wrote his autobiography ''No Fixed Address'', which was published in 1973.\n\n[[Jack Slipper]] of the [[Metropolitan Police]] was promoted to [[Chief Superintendent|detective chief superintendent]]. He became so involved in the case that he continued to hunt many of the escaped robbers after he retired. He believed Biggs should not be released after returning to the UK in 2001 and he often appeared in the media to comment on any news item connected with the robbery before his death on 24 August 2005 at the age of 81.\n\nDetective Chief Superintendent Ernest Malcolm Fewtrell, head of the Buckinghamshire Crime Investigation Department (CID) was born on 29 September 1909 and died on 28 November 2005, aged 96. He retired on the last day of the trial after the verdicts were handed down at the then compulsory retirement age of 55.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article598370.ece |title=(Accessed in April 2011) |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> This allowed him (with Ronald Payne of ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', who was involved in the paper's coverage of the case) to be the first of the investigators to write a book ''The Train Robbers'' on the robbery investigation in 1964. In the book he expressed some frustration with the Flying Squad although he mostly had praise for individual officers. His one regret was that he had the search for the hideout carried out radiating outwards from the scene of the robbery rather than an inwards search from a {{convert|30|mi|adj=on}} perimeter.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1505956/Chief-Superintendent-Malcolm-Frewtrell.html |title=(accessed in April 2011) |work=The Daily Telegraph|date= 21 December 2005|accessdate=20 December 2013 |location=London}}</ref> He worked as an accommodation officer for [[University of Portsmouth|Portsmouth Polytechnic]] before retiring to live by the sea near Swanage. He continued to express disgust at any film that he felt glamourised the robbers. It has been said that he bore a striking resemblance to [[John Thaw]], who was the star of ''[[Inspector Morse]]'', which, perhaps coincidentally, was a television series about a detective in the Thames Valley Police Force (the modern-day successor to Buckinghamshire Constabulary). Fewtrell was assisted and later succeeded in the investigation by John Woolley, who served in the Buckinghamshire Constabulary from 1959 to 1984.<ref name=ITV2012/>\n\nGeorge Hatherill (1898\u20131986) had his service extended by one year because of the need to complete the investigation of the Great Train Robbery.

The actual carriage that was robbed [M30204M] was retained for seven years following the robbery, and then taken to Norfolk and burned in the presence of police and Post Office representatives at a scrapyard near Norwich in 1970. This was to deter collector/souvenir hunters. Locomotive [[British Rail Class 40|English Electric Type 4 \u2013 D326]] (later 40126) was involved in a number of serious operating incidents. The locomotive was scrapped at Doncaster Railway workshops in 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfps.co.uk/class40story.htm |title=CFPS Class 40-story |publisher=Cfps.co.uk |accessdate=6 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218164900/http://www.cfps.co.uk/class40story.htm |archive-date=18 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The retrieved Monopoly board used by the robbers at their Leatherslade Farm hideout and a genuine \u00a35 note from the robbery is on display at the [[Thames Valley Police]] museum in [[Sulhamstead]], Berkshire.\n\nThe scene of the crime was for some years called \"Train Robbers' bridge\" on a [[Network Rail]] maintenance sign.

The bulk of the haul was in [[Bank of England \u00a31 note|\u00a31 notes]] and [[Bank of England \u00a35 note|\u00a35 notes]] (both the older white note and the newer blue note which was half its size). The \u00a35 notes were bundled in batches of \u00a32,500, the \u00a31 notes in batches of \u00a3500. There were also [[Bank of England 10s note|ten-shilling notes]] in batches of \u00a3250. A quantity of Irish and Scottish money was also stolen.\nWith the exception of a few 'drinks' for associates, the loot was split into 17 equal shares of around \u00a3150,000 each (George Hatherill claims that there were 18 shares).\n\nWith a few notable exceptions, the money was quickly laundered or divided by friends, family and associates of the robbers. Much was laundered through bookmakers (Wilson and Wisbey were themselves bookmakers) although, astonishingly, only a few hundred pounds were identifiable by serial number so the robbers could have spent the money without fear of being traced.<ref>No Fixed Address (1971) by Frank Williams (Ch: Where Has All The Money Gone ? Pp 68\u201384)</ref> There were 1,579 notes whose serial numbers were known and the rest of the money was completely untraceable.\n\nThe \u00a35 notes were of two different types, because in 1957 the British Government had begun to replace the large white notes with smaller blue ones. The final changeover had not been completed by the time of the robbery. The white notes quickly became far more conspicuous to use, making it harder for them to be spent.\n\nAlthough within six months of the robbery 10 of the robbers had been locked up awaiting trial and three others were wanted criminals on the run, very little of the money had actually been recovered. This has caused speculation that there is a great deal of robbery loot still out there. In fact, the money was soon seized and spent by predatory gangsters and greedy associates, relatives and lawyers. Thus the proceeds of the greatest cash robbery in British history were quickly used up, with few of the robbers receiving any real long-term benefit.\n\nLess than \u00a3400,000 was eventually recovered. Over half of this consisted of the shares of Roger Cordrey (\u00a3141,017) and (allegedly) Brian Field (\u00a3100,900). A further \u00a336,000 was recovered from Jimmy White's caravan. Roy James was carrying \u00a312,041 when captured. The final sum recovered was \u00a347,245 that was found in a telephone box in Great Dover Street, [[Newington, London|Newington]], South London.\n\n===Telephone box controversy===\nThe \u00a347,245 recovered from a telephone box included 57 notes whose serial numbers had been recorded by the bank in Scotland. This money was part of a deal struck with Frank Williams by Danny Pembroke.  Piers Paul Read, in ''The Train Robbers'', claimed that the police were feeling the pressure because although they had caught many of the robbers, they had failed to recover much of the money.  While no evidence had been found against Pembroke,who was believed to have been one of the South Coast Raiders, some of the identifiable bank notes had been traced back to him through friends who had been charged with receiving. Given that the police had insufficient evidence against Pembroke, either at Leatherslade Farm or definitive connection with either of the two gangs, Butler was prepared to let him go.  Williams convinced Butler to pull Pembroke in for questioning and in return for releasing him and not charging his friends with more serious crimes, \u00a350,000 was to be returned.\n\nOn 3 December 1963, which happened to be the same day that Roy James was taken into custody, the police received an anonymous tip directing them to the money in the phone box. The money was driven up to Aylesbury and taken into custody by Detective Superintendent Fewtrell, who wondered how his London colleagues could know how much money there was.  He had to bring in bank clerks to count the damp and musty money to determine the final sum.<ref>Piers Paul Read ''The Train Robbers'' (1978), pp.142\u2013143</ref>\n\nWilliams made no admission to the recovery of the money being the result of a deal with Pembroke. Despite claiming that his negotiations were responsible for the return of this money, Williams in his book ''No Fixed Address'' (1973) claimed not to know the identity of the person who had returned the money, although he did mention several robbers to whom he had offered deals through intermediaries.  He noted that it seemed to him that Butler was sceptical of his efforts and that at the press conference Hatherill and Millen did not reveal the circumstances behind the find and that he was never asked to talk with them about it. Despite Pembroke being the man identified as the assailant of the train driver, Jack Mills, by Bruce Reynolds (albeit indirectly), Williams only makes mention of the assailant once in his book. In this section (often quoted by other sources), he confirms that, with Tommy Butler, he questioned the man they knew to be the assailant but that they had no evidence to convict him. Strangely, however, he makes no further mention of him.\n\nThe deal done with Pembroke caused outrage in the police hierarchy.<ref>Frank Williams ''No Fixed Address'' (1973). On p. 11 he talks about the assailant of the train driver and on pp. 68\u201384 he talks about where the money had gone.</ref> It is hinted in several books that the deals done by Williams were responsible for his being overlooked for promotion and that Williams was unhappy that his efforts were not recognised by Butler, but were instead hidden from superiors.\n\nFor his part, George Hatherill, in his book ''A Detective's Tale'', stated that the motive behind the return of the money was not known for certain. He said that the money was returned by \"one about whom extensive inquiries had been made and who in fact was interrogated at length. But in spite of our strong suspicions, nothing could be proved against him and so no charge could be brought. My belief is that he thought we knew more about him than we did, and thinking things were getting hot, he decided to get rid of the money to avoid being found in possession with it\".<ref>George Hatherill ''A Detective's Tale'' (1971), pp.214\u2013215</ref> Hatherill does not mention Williams at all in his book. He retired on the last day of the trial at Aylesbury.\n\n===Legal fees===\nThe 19 gang members who were arrested shortly after the robbery had to spend a large amount on legal fees (approximately \u00a330,000 each).\n\n===Money spent===\nThe robbers who spent much time on the run overseas\u2014Reynolds, Wilson and Edwards\u2014had very little left when finally arrested, having had to spend money avoiding capture and indulging in lavish lifestyles without finding employment. Much of Jimmy White's money was taken from him.\n\nAccording to Marilyn Wisbey, her father's share was hidden by his father Tommy Wisbey Senior in the panels in the doors of his home. Butler raided them three times but he never found the train money. The majority of the money was reputedly entrusted to Wisbey's father and also to his younger brother Ron, who coincidentally had saved some money of his own that was confiscated by the police and returned to Ron three months later. By the time Wisbey was released from jail all of his share had either been spent or invested. Marilyn agrees with Piers Paul Read's assessment of how her father's share of approximately \u00a3150,000 was spent. Although the Wisbey share was one that was not taken by other criminals, Marilyn Wisbey is still bitter that her relatives got to spend a fair amount of the loot while the overall sum dwindled away. However, her grandfather used some of the money to buy them a house in Upper Norwood.<ref>Gangster's Moll (2001) by Marilyn Wisbey (Chapter 6 The Pubs, Pp 69\u201371)</ref>\n\nUp to six of the robbers escaped punishment in one way or another - \"The Ulsterman\", three robbers who were never caught, John Daly who had his charges dismissed at the trial and Ronnie Biggs who escaped from jail and managed to avoid being taken back to the UK. Daly had entrusted his money to another crook. This man had betrayed him to the police and had absconded with the money. He died before Daly could catch up with him. Upon the release of the others in the mid-1970s, \"Bill Jennings\" got in touch with Buster Edwards and \"Frank Monroe\" got in touch with the South Coast Raiders. Both said that they had no money left. Danny Pembroke went initially to America and John Daly at the time was said to be living on [[Unemployment benefits|unemploymant benefit]]<nowiki/>s in the west of England.<ref>The Train Robbers (1978), Piers Paul Read, Pp244-245</ref> Ronnie Biggs quickly spent his share getting a new life. He loved his new life in Australia, although by the time his family arrived in 1966, all but \u00a37,000 had been spent. \u00a355,000 had been paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK. The rest had gone on legal fees and expenses.<ref>Odd Man Out, Ronnie Biggs</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Early books===\nThese books were written in the immediate aftermath of the 1964 trial and before the capture of several of the gang.\n* ''The Great Train Robbery'' (1964) by John Gosling and Dennis Craig. The first book about the robbery, it relied on the real-life experience of John Gosling, a former policeman.\n* ''The Robbers' Tale'' (1965) by Peta Fordham, first published by Hodder & Stoughton, London. It told the story of the robbery only shortly after the conclusion of the initial trial. The author was the wife of one of the lawyers involved in the case. The book mostly involves a description of the trial. The author constantly hints that she knew more than she was prepared to write, yet it was written before most of the facts emerged.\n\n===Biographies of investigators===\nBooks written by senior police in the early 1970s, after their retirement, chiefly present accounts of the investigation, capture, trial and recapture of the robbers.\n* ''The Train Robbers'' (1964) by Malcolm Fewtrell (with Ronald Payne), first published in London by Arthur Barker Limited.\n* ''A Detective's Story'' (1971) by George Hatherill, first published in London by Andre Deutsch Limited ({{ISBN|0-2339-6322-7}}) is part autobiography and part description on what makes a detective.

A unique inside story of his career as a detective.\n* ''No Fixed Address'' (1973) by Frank Williams, first published by W. H. Allen & Co Ltd ({{ISBN|0-4910-0524-5}}). It tells the story of the aftermath of the robbery from Williams's point of view, in particular describing the mistakes made in the early days by senior officers, and the autocratic nature of Tommy Butler. The book is targeted at Ronnie Biggs in the hope that he will contact Williams for a deal, similar to the one arranged by Buster Edwards. The book mistakenly identifies Bill Boal as a robber (although it concedes his role was a support role), and it also mistakenly identifies Biggs as one of the leaders.\n* ''Slipper of the Yard'' (1981) by Jack Slipper, first published by Sidgwick and Jackson Ltd ({{ISBN|0-2839-8702-2}}).

Despite revealing more than previous accounts, the book is flawed in that it includes inaccuracies that the funding source for the heist was former [[SS]] officer [[Otto Skorzeny]]. As the story unfolds in the book, however, the German connection was proved to be false.\n* ''Odd Man Out'' (1994) by Ronald Biggs, first published by Bloomsbury Publishing Limited ({{ISBN|0-7475-1683-9}}).

The movie launched Yates's Hollywood career after it attracted the interest of [[Steve McQueen]] who got the British director to make his next feature, ''[[Bullitt]]''. The film featured a gripping car chase (though this was connected to another earlier crime and not the robbery) which included scenes of a policeman being run down. Despite being a fictionalised account ''[[Robbery (1967 film)|Robbery]]'' did draw on key details of the real robbery and these were reflected in the film. These included the detailed planning and preparation used, the use of a farmhouse as a base and the intended (but unsuccessful) use of a replacement driver for the train. The film ends with the mastermind of the robbery \"Clifton\", played by [[Stanley Baker]] (whose own company Oakhurst Productions had produced the film), evading capture and going on the run overseas by posing as a merchant seaman.\n* The 1969 French film ''[[The Brain (1969 film)|The Brain]]'' stars [[David Niven]] as a British master criminal who perpetrates in France a heist based on the Great Train robbery.

[[robbery]] of  \u00a32.6 million from a [[Royal Mail]] [[train]] heading from [[Glasgow]] to [[London]] on the [[West Coast Main Line]] in the early hours of 8 August 1963, at Bridego Railway Bridge, [[Ledburn]], near [[Mentmore]] in Buckinghamshire, England.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Great Train Robbery,

the lineside signals in order to bring the train to a halt, a gang of 15, led by [[Bruce Reynolds]], attacked the train.  Other gang members included Gordon Goody, [[Buster Edwards]], [[Charlie Wilson (criminal)|Charlie Wilson]], Roy James, John Daly, Danny Pembroke, Jimmy White, [[Ronnie Biggs]], Tommy Wisbey, Jim Hussey, Bob Welch and Roger Cordrey, as well as three men known only as numbers \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\". A 16th man, an unnamed retired train driver, was also present.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Great Train Robbers: Who were they?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21619150|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 January 2014|date=18 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nWith careful planning based on inside information from an individual known as \"The Ulsterman\", named (possibly erroneously) as Patrick McKenna in 2014, the robbers escaped with over \u00a32.6 million (equivalent to \u00a3{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|2600000|1963}}}} in 2020).  The bulk of the stolen money was never recovered.  Though the gang did not use any firearms, [[Jack Mills]], the train driver, was beaten over the head with a metal bar. Mills's injuries were severe enough that he didn't work again.\n\nAfter the robbery, the gang hid at Leatherslade Farm. After the police found this hideout, incriminating evidence led to the eventual arrest and conviction of most of the gang.  The ringleaders were sentenced to 30 years in jail.\n\n==Robbery==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe plan to intercept and rob the overnight Glasgow to London mail train was based on information from an unnamed senior security officer within Royal Mail who had detailed knowledge of the amounts of money carried; he was introduced to two of the criminals who would carry out the raid\u2014Gordon Goody and Buster Edwards\u2014by a London solicitor's clerk, Brian Field.<ref>cite news| Channel 4 documentary 12 August 2019</ref>\n\nThe raid was devised over a period of months by a core team: Goody and Edwards along with [[Bruce Reynolds]], Charlie Wilson, and Roy James, with Reynolds assuming the role of \"mastermind\". This gang, although very successful in the criminal underworld, had virtually no experience in stopping and robbing trains, so it was agreed to enlist the help of another London gang called The South Coast Raiders. This group included Tommy Wisbey, Bob Welch, and Jim Hussey, who were already 'accomplished train robbers'{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. This group also included Roger Cordrey, a man who was a specialist in this field and knew how to rig the track-side signals to stop the train.\n\nOther associates (including Ronnie Biggs, a man Reynolds had previously met in jail) were added as the organisation evolved. The final gang who took part in the raid comprised a total of 16 men.<ref>The Great Train Robbery \u2013 Crime of the Century \u2013 the definitive account (2013) by Nick Russell-Pavier</ref>\n\n===Royal Mail train===\nAt 18:50 on Wednesday 7 August 1963, the [[travelling post office]] (TPO) \"Up Special\" train set off from [[Glasgow Central station]] en route to [[Euston railway station|Euston Station]] in London.  It was scheduled to arrive at Euston at 03:59 the following morning. The train was hauled by [[British Rail Class 40|English Electric Type 4]] (later Class 40) diesel-electric locomotive [[British Rail Class 40#D326: The Great Train Robbery, 1963|D326]] (later 40&nbsp;126).  The train consisted of 12 carriages and carried 72 [[General Post Office|Post Office]] staff who sorted mail during the journey.\n\nMail was loaded onto the train at Glasgow, during additional station stops en route, and from line-side collection points where local post office staff would hang mail sacks on elevated track-side hooks that were caught by nets deployed by the on-board staff. Sorted mail on the train could be dropped off at the same time.  This process of exchange allowed mail to be distributed locally without delaying the train with unnecessary stops. One of the carriages involved in the robbery is preserved at the [[Nene Valley Railway]].\n\nThe second carriage, behind the engine, was known as the HVP (high-value packages) coach, which carried large quantities of money and registered mail for sorting.  Usually the value of the shipment was in the region of \u00a3300,000, but because the previous weekend had been a UK [[Bank Holiday]] weekend, the total on the day of the robbery was to be between \u00a32.5 and \u00a33 million.<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.btp.police.uk/History%20Society/Publications/History%20Society/Crime%20on%20line/The%20Great%20Train%20Robbery.htm \n |title=British Transport Police History: The Great Train Robbery \n |publisher=[[British Transport Police]] \n |accessdate=25 July 2007 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701111011/http://www.btp.police.uk/History%20Society/Publications/History%20Society/Crime%20on%20line/The%20Great%20Train%20Robbery.htm \n |archivedate=1 July 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n  \n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, the Post Office Investigation Branch (IB) recommended the fitting of alarms to all TPOs with HVP carriages. This recommendation was implemented in 1961, but HVP carriages without alarms were retained in reserve.  By August 1963, three HVP carriages were equipped with alarms, bars over the windows and bolts and catches on the doors, but at the time of the robbery, these carriages were out of service, so a reserve carriage (M30204M) without those features had to be used.  The fitting of radios was also considered, but they were deemed to be too expensive, and the measure was not implemented.<ref name=PMA>[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/the-great-train-robbery/QQZcgLhm The Great Train Robbery by the [[British Postal Museum and Archive]] at The Google cultural institute]. Retrieved 29 October 2013</ref> This carriage was kept for evidence for seven years following the event and then burned at a scrapyard in Norfolk in the presence of police and post office officials to deter any souvenir hunters.\n\n===Stopping the train===\nJust after 03:00 on 8 August, the driver, 58-year-old [[Jack Mills]] from [[Crewe]], stopped the train on the [[West Coast Main Line]] at a red signal light at Sears Crossing, Ledburn, between [[Leighton Buzzard railway station|Leighton Buzzard]] and [[Cheddington railway station|Cheddington]]. The signal had been tampered with by the robbers: they had covered the green light and connected a battery to power the red light. The locomotive's second crew member, known as the secondman or \"fireman\", was 26-year-old David Whitby, also from Crewe. As a signal stop was unexpected at this time and place, Whitby climbed down from the cab to call the signalman from a line-side telephone, only to find the cables had been cut. As he returned to the train he was overpowered by one of the robbers. Meanwhile, gang members entered the engine cabin from both sides, and as Mills grappled with one robber he was struck from behind by another with a [[club (weapon)|cosh]] and rendered semi-conscious.\n\nThe robbers now had to move the train to Bridego Bridge (now known as Mentmore<ref>''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' November 2013 p. 3</ref> Bridge), approximately half a mile (800 m) further along the track, where they planned to unload the money. \nOne of the robbers had spent months befriending railway staff and familiarising himself with the layout and operation of trains and carriages. Ultimately though, it was decided that it would be better to use an experienced train driver to move the locomotive and the first two carriages from the signals to the bridge after uncoupling the carriages containing the rest of the sorters and the ordinary mail.\n\nOn that night, the gang's hired train driver (an acquaintance of Ronnie Biggs, later referred to as \"Stan Agate\" or \"Peter\") was unable to operate this newer type of locomotive; although having driven trains for many years, he was by then retired and was experienced only on shunting (switching) locomotives on the [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]].  With no other alternative available to them, it was quickly decided that Mills would have to move the train to the stopping point near the bridge, which was indicated by a white sheet stretched between poles on the track. [[Ronnie Biggs|Biggs]]'s only task was to supervise Agate's participation in the robbery, and when it became obvious that Agate was not able to drive the train, he and Biggs were sent to the waiting truck to help load the mail bags.\n\n===Removing the money===\nThe train was stopped at Bridego Bridge, and the robbers' \"assault force\" attacked the 'high-value packages' (HVP) carriage. [[Frank Dewhurst]] was in charge of the three other postal workers (Leslie Penn, Joseph Ware and John O'Connor) in the HVP carriage. Thomas Kett, assistant inspector in charge of the train from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] to Euston was also in the carriage.  Dewhurst and Kett were hit with coshes when they made a vain attempt to prevent the robbers' storming of the carriage.  Once the robbers had entered the carriage, the staff could put up no effective resistance and there was no police officer or security guard on board to assist them.  The staff were made to lie face down on the floor in a corner of the carriage.  Mills and Whitby were then brought into the carriage, handcuffed together and put down beside the staff.<ref>The Great Train Robbery (2008) \u2013 Crime Archive Series by Peter Gutteridge</ref>\n\nThe robbers removed all but eight of the 128 sacks from the HVP carriage, which they transferred in about 15\u201320 minutes to the waiting truck by forming a human chain.  The gang departed in their [[Austin Loadstar]] truck some 30 minutes after the robbery had begun and, in an effort to mislead any potential witnesses, they used two [[Land Rover]] vehicles, both of which bore the registration plates BMG 757A.\n[[File:great train robbery map.svg|thumb|400px|Map of some places connected to the robbery]]\n\n===Getaway and planned clean-up===\nThe gang then headed along minor roads, listening for police broadcasts on a [[VHF]] radio, the journey taking somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour, and arrived back at Leatherslade Farm at around 04:30, at around the same time as the first reports of the crime were being made. Leatherslade was a run-down farm {{convert|27|mi}} from the crime scene, between [[Oakley, Buckinghamshire|Oakley]] and [[Brill, Buckinghamshire|Brill]] ({{coord|51|48|23|N|1|3|11|W|display=inline|type:event}}). It had been bought two months earlier as their hideout.\n\nAt the farm they counted the proceeds and divided it into 16 full shares and several 'drinks' (smaller sums of money intended for associates of the gang). The precise amounts of the split differ according to the source, but the full shares came to approximately \u00a3150,000 each (about \u00a33.16 million in 2020).\n\nFrom listening to their police-tuned radio, the gang learned that the police had calculated they had gone to ground within a 30-mile radius of the crime scene rather than dispersing with their haul. This declaration was based on information given by a witness at the crime scene who stated that a gang member had told the post office workers \"not to move for half an hour\". The press interpreted this information as a {{convert|30|mi|km|adj=on}} radius\u2014a half-hour drive in a fast car.\n\nThe gang realised the police were using a \"dragnet tactic\", and with help from the public, would probably discover the farm much sooner than had been originally anticipated.  As a result, the plan for leaving the farm was brought forward to Friday from Sunday (the crime was committed on Thursday).  The vehicles they had driven to the farm could no longer be used because they had been seen by the train staff. [[Brian Field]] came to the farm on Thursday to pick up his share of the loot and to take Roy James to London to find an extra vehicle. Bruce Reynolds and John Daly picked up cars, one for Jimmy White and the other for Reynolds, Daly, Biggs and the replacement train driver.  Field, his wife Karin and his associate \"Mark\" brought the vans and drove the remainder of the gang to the Fields's home to recover.\n\nField had arranged with \"Mark\" to carry out a comprehensive clean-up and set fire to the farm after the robbers had left, even though the robbers had already spent much time wiping the place down to be free of prints.  According to Buster Edwards, he 'nicked' \u00a310,000 in [[ten-shilling note]]s to help pay \"Mark's\" drink. However, on Monday, when Charlie Wilson rang Brian Field to check whether the farm had been cleaned, he did not believe Field's assurances.  He called a meeting with Edwards, Reynolds, Daly and James and they agreed that they needed to be sure.  They called Field to a meeting on Tuesday, where he was forced to admit that he had failed to \"torch\" the farm.  In the IVS 2012 documentary film ''The Great Train Robbery'', Nick Reynolds (son of Bruce Reynolds) said \"...the guy who was paid to basically go back to the farm and burn it down did a runner.\"<ref name=ITV2012>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2446162/combined The Great Train Robbery (2012)] at IMDb</ref> Wilson would have killed Field there and then but was restrained by the others.  By the time they were ready to go back to the farm, however, they learned that police had found the hide-out.\n[[File:Sears Crossing.JPG|View towards 'Sears Crossing' where the robbers took control of the train {{coord|51|53|23|N|0|40|23|W|display=inline|type:event}}|thumb]]\n\n===The money===\nThere is some uncertainty regarding the exact cash total stolen from the train. \u00a32,631,684 is a figure quoted in the press, although the police investigation states the theft as \u00a32,595,997 10s, in 636 packages, contained in 120 mailbags\u2014the bulk of the haul in \u00a31 and \u00a35 notes (both the older white note and the newer blue note, which was half its size). There were also ten-shilling notes and Irish and Scottish money. Because a 30-minute time limit had been set by Reynolds, eight out of 128 bags were not stolen and were left behind. Statistically, this could have amounted to \u00a3131,000 or 4.7% of the total.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/> It is alleged that the total weight of the bags removed was {{convert|2.5|LT}}, according to former Buckinghamshire police officer John Woolley.<ref name=ITV2012/>\n\nFamously, the gang had used the money in a game of ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' while holed up at the farm house.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Webb|first1=Sam|title=Fancy the 'Get Out of Jail Free' card from Great Train Robbery gang's Monopoly?|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/get-out-jail-free-card-5844554|accessdate=17 March 2017|work=Daily Mirror|date=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Raising the alarm===\nThe robbers had cut all the telephone lines in the vicinity, but one of the rail-men left on the train at Sears Crossing caught a passing goods train to Cheddington, where he raised the alarm at around 04:20.  The first reports of the robbery were broadcast on the VHF police radio within a few minutes and this is where the gang heard the line \"A robbery has been committed and you'll never believe it&nbsp;\u2013 they've stolen the train!\"\n\n==Robbers and accomplices==\nThe gang consisted of 17 full members who were to receive an equal share, including the men who were at the robbery and two key informants.\n\nThe gang that carried out the robbery consisted of 15 criminals predominantly from south London: Gordon Goody, Charlie Wilson, Buster Edwards, Bruce Reynolds, Roy James, John Daly, Roger Cordrey, Jimmy White, Bob Welch, Tommy Wisbey, Jim Hussey, Ronnie Biggs, as well as Harry Smith and Danny Pembroke, who were never charged due to the lack of evidence against them, and one still unknown, plus the train driver they nicknamed \"Pop\". The best known member of the gang, [[Ronnie Biggs|Biggs]], had only a minor role\u2014to recruit the train driver.\n\n===The robbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! colspan=12 | Great Train

Richard and Dorothy Margaret (n\u00e9e Keen).  His mother died in 1935, and he had trouble living with his father and stepmother, so he often stayed with one or other of his grandmothers.  Reynolds was jailed for three years on several counts of breaking and entering, and upon his release quickly started re-offending.  He soon joined a gang with best friend John Daly (future brother-in-law). They were mentored by South Western gang leaders Ernie Watts and Terry Hogan (a.k.a. Harry Booth).  Also he did some (criminal?) work with Jimmy White and met Buster Edwards at [[Charlie Richardson]]'s club.  Richardson in turn introduced him to Gordon Goody.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\">{{cite book|title=''Crossing The Line: Autobiography of a Thief''|year=1995|author=[[Bruce Reynolds|Reynolds, Bruce]] |publisher=Bantam Press|isbn=1-8522-7929-X}}</ref>\n\nAfter the train heist, Reynolds escaped to Mexico with his wife, Angela, and young son, [[Nick Reynolds (sculptor)|Nick Reynolds]] (who later became a member of the band [[Alabama 3]], whose song \"[[Woke Up This Morning]]\" was the opening theme of ''[[The Sopranos]]''<ref name=\"Adam Bernstin, The Washington Post A26\">{{cite journal|journal=Newsday|title=Bruce Reynolds, 'Robbery' architect|author=Adam Bernstin, ''The Washington Post''|date=2 March 2013|page=A26}}</ref>) and lived lavishly with his share of the take, approximately 150,000 British pounds.  When that money ran out, Reynolds moved his family to Canada and then France under false identities, in search of work, before returning to the United Kingdom to pursue opportunities promised by his old criminal contacts.  He was arrested in 1968 in [[Torquay]]<ref name=\"Adam Bernstin, The Washington Post A26\"/> and sentenced to 25 years in jail.  He was released a decade later.<ref name=Lawless>{{cite news|title=UK 'Great Train Robber' Bruce Reynolds dies at 81|date=28 February 2013<!-- 8:54 AM, Updated: 28 February 2013 10:30 AM-->|author=  Jill Lawless (Associated Press)|url =http://bigstory.ap.org/article/uk-great-train-robber-bruce-reynolds-dies-81}}</ref>\n\nReynolds was reincarcerated in the mid-1980s for dealing amphetamines.<ref name=\"Adam Bernstin, The Washington Post A26\"/> He has produced occasional journalism pieces, been a consultant on movie and book projects about the train heist, and published a well-regarded crime memoir, ''Crossing the Line: The Autobiography of a Thief'' (1995).<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/><ref name=\"Adam Bernstin, The Washington Post A26\"/><ref name=Lawless/>\n\nIn a 2003 interview, Reynolds recalled: \"from an early age I always wanted a life of adventure.\" He was rejected by the [[Royal Navy]] because of poor eyesight, and then tried to become a foreign correspondent, but his highest achievement in that vein was to become a clerk at the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.  While his life in crime did provide excitement, Reynolds said in 2003, \"I've always felt that I can't escape my past.  And in many ways I feel that it is like a line from the '[[Rime of the Ancient Mariner|Ancient Mariner]]' and that the notoriety was like an albatross around my neck.\"<ref name=Lawless/>\n\nReynolds died aged 81 on 28 February 2013 after a brief illness.<ref name=\"Adam Bernstin, The Washington Post A26\"/><ref name=Lawless/> He is survived by his son Nick.<ref name=bbc28022013>{{cite news|title=Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds dies aged 81|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21617926|accessdate=28 February 2013|work=BBC News|date=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Douglas Gordon Goody===\n{{update|section|date=December 2014|cat=Rail transport articles in need of updating}}\nAuthorities regarded Douglas Gordon Goody as the mastermind of the operation.<ref name=\"theguardian\">{{cite news | title =Great Train Robber who got away will be named | work =The Guardian | date =4 August 2013| url =https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/04/great-train-robbery-mystery-fixer| accessdate = 4 August 2013}}</ref> He first made contact with 'The Ulsterman' in a meeting set up by Brian Field in Finsbury Park. Of [[Northern Irish people|Northern Irish]] descent, Goody was born in [[Putney]], London in March 1930 and was still living there in his mother's flat at the time of the robbery.  In the early 1960s he joined Buster Edwards' gang and helped rob various easy targets.<ref>The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read (Pp 13\u201317)</ref>\n\nAfter his release from prison in 1975, Goody moved to the white-washed town of Moj\u00e1car in Almer\u00eda, Spain, where he ran the Chiringuito Kon Tiki beachfront bar. In September 2014, Goody claimed the identity of 'The Ulsterman' was Patrick McKenna for the first time in a documentary marking the 50th anniversary of the robbery.<ref name=\"theguardian\" /> The documentary makers employed [[Ariel Bruce]], a social worker who finds missing family members, to trace McKenna, who was found to have died some years previously.  However Bruce was able to make contact with McKenna's family.  This documentary was shown in cinemas and on demand in October 2014.\nOn 29 January 2016, Goody died of emphysema at the age of 85.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economicvoice.com/the-great-train-robbery-a-tale-of-two-thieves-will-reveal-the-identity-of-the-mastermind/|title=The Great Train Robbery: A Tale of Two Thieves - The Economic Voice|work=economicvoice.com|accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Charles Frederick (Charlie) Wilson===\nThe most dangerous of the Great Train Robbers was 'the Silent Man' [[Charlie Wilson (criminal)|Charlie Wilson]]. He was born on 30 June 1932 to Bill and Mabel Wilson in [[Battersea]].  His friends from childhood were Jimmy Hussey, Tommy Wisbey, Bruce Reynolds and Gordon Goody.  Later on, he met [[Ronald Christopher Edwards|Ronald 'Buster' Edwards]] and the young driving enthusiasts [[Mickey Ball]] and Roy James, who had taken up car theft.  From 1948 to 1950 he was called up for [[national service]], and in 1955 he married [[Patricia (Pat) Osbourne]], with whom he had three children.  He turned to crime early in life and spurned his father's legitimate but low-income wage.  While he did have legitimate work in his in-laws' grocer's shop, he also was a thief and his criminal proceeds went into buying shares in various gambling enterprises.  He went to jail for short spells for numerous offences.  In 1960, he began to work with Bruce Reynolds and planned to get into the criminal big league.<ref>''Killing Charlie'' (2004) by Wensley Clarkson</ref>\n\n===Ronald \"Buster\" Edwards===\n[[Buster Edwards|Ronald Christopher Edwards]] was born on 27 January 1932 at [[Lambeth]], London, the son of a barman.<ref>spelling mistake</ref> After leaving school, he worked in a sausage factory, where he began his criminal career by stealing meat to sell on the post-war black market.  During his national service in the [[RAF]] he was detained for stealing cigarettes. When he returned to [[South London]], he ran a drinking club and became a professional criminal.  He married June Rose in 1952.  They had a daughter, Nicky.<ref name=\"The Train Robbers 1978\">The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read</ref> In his final years he ran a flower stall outside Waterloo station in London.\n\n===Brian Field===\n[[Brian Field|Brian Arthur Field]] was born on 15 December 1934 and was immediately put up for adoption.  He served two years in the [[Royal Army Service Corps]], seeing service during the [[Korean War]].  Although soldiers in the Service Corps were considered combat personnel, they were primarily associated with transport and logistics.  When he was discharged from the military, it was with \"a very good character\".<ref>Peter Gutteridge ''Crime Archive: The Great Train Robbery''</ref>\n\nField later became a solicitor's managing clerk for John Wheater & Co.  Although he was only 28 at the time of the robbery, he was already apparently more prosperous than his boss, John Wheater.  Field drove a new Jaguar and had a house, \"Kabri\" (an amalgam of Karin and Brian [Field]), with his wife at the Bridle Path, [[Whitchurch Hill]], Oxfordshire, while his boss owned a battered Ford and lived in a run-down neighbourhood.  Part of the reason for Field's prosperity was that he was not averse to giving Goody and Edwards information about what his clients had in their country houses, making them prime targets for the thieves.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/> On one occasion he described the contents and layout of a house near Weybridge where wife Karin had once been a nanny.<ref>Piers Paul Read ''The Train Robbers'' (1978), pp.27\u201329</ref>\n\nPrior to the robbery Field had represented Buster Edwards and Gordon Goody. He had arranged Edwards' defence when he had been caught with a stolen car and had met Goody at a nightclub in [[Soho]].  Field was called upon to assist in Goody's defence in the aftermath of the \"Airport Job\", which was a robbery carried out on 27 November 1962 at BOAC Comet House, Hatton Cross, [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]].  This was the big practice robbery that the South West Gang had done before the Great Train Robbery.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/> Field was successful in arranging bail for Goody and Charlie Wilson.\n\n===\"The Ulsterman\"===\nIn 2014, Douglas Goody claimed to journalists that \"The Ulsterman\" was Patrick McKenna, at the time of the robbery a 43-year-old postal worker living in [[Salford]], [[Lancashire]].  \nMcKenna, who was originally from [[Belfast]], met Goody four times in 1963. Goody alleged that he found out McKenna's name only when he saw it written inside his spectacles case.\n\nIt is not known what became of the share McKenna allegedly received, but his children were \"flabbergasted\" on hearing the claim of their father's involvement. It was surmised that McKenna either donated his share to the [[Catholic church]] over the years or had had the money stolen from him.<ref name=\"Tracy McVeigh\">{{cite news|title=The quiet Great Train Robber reveals identity of the gang's mystery insider|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/28/great-train-robber-douglas-gordon-goody-reveals-identity-mystery-inside|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=28 September 2014|author=Tracy McVeigh|date=28 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis alleged identification of McKenna as \"The Ulsterman\" has been disputed; not least because McKenna appears to have had no criminal record or associations and died poor. It has been suggested<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> that a known associate of the convicted robbers, Sammy Osterman, was part of the gang, and his \"Ulsterman\" soubriquet was simply the result of mishearing his surname.\n\n===Accomplices===\nWilliam Gerald Boal (22 October 1913 \u2013 26 June 1970), an accomplice after the fact of Roger Cordrey, was convicted as being one of the robbers, despite playing a role no different from the many other accomplices of the various train robbers.

He died in Harrogate, near Leeds, aged 63.\n\n==Aylesbury investigation==\nAt 05:00, [[Chief Superintendent]] [[Malcolm Fewtrell]], head of the Buckinghamshire Police Criminal Investigation Department ([[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]]), located at [[Aylesbury]], arrived at the crime scene, where he supervised evidence-gathering. He then went to [[Cheddington railway station]], where the train had been taken, and where statements were taken from the driver and postal workers.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1505956/Chief-Superintendent-Malcolm-Frewtrell.html |title=Chief Superintendent Malcolm Frewtrell |newspaper=Telegraph |date=21 December 2005 |accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref> A member of the gang had told the postal staff not to move for half an hour and this suggested to the police that their hide-out could not be more than {{convert|30|mi}} away.<ref name=ITV2012/> It appeared, from interviews with the witnesses, that about 15 hooded men dressed in blue boiler suits had been involved, but little more could be gleaned.\n\nBy lunchtime of the following day, it became obvious to Fewtrell that extra resources were needed to cope with the scale of the investigation and the [[Buckinghamshire]] [[Chief Constable]] referred the case to [[Scotland Yard]]. George Hatherill, Commander of the C Department and Detective Chief Superintendent Earnest (Ernie) Millen, Head of the [[Flying Squad]] were initially in charge of the London side of the investigation. They sent Detective Superintendent Gerald McArthur and Detective Sergeant John Pritchard to assist the Buckinghamshire Police.\n\nThe police then undertook a major search, fanning out from the crime scene after having failed to find any forensic evidence there. A watch was put on the seaports. The [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]] [[Reginald Bevins]] offered a \u00a310,000 reward to \"the first person giving information leading to the apprehension and conviction of the persons responsible for the robbery\".\n\n===Discovery of Leatherslade Farm===\nFollowing a tip-off from a herdsman who used a field adjacent to Leatherslade Farm, a police sergeant and constable called there on 13 August 1963, five days after the robbery.<ref>The Great British Train Robbery, 1963.</ref> The farm was deserted but they found the truck used by the robbers, which had been hastily painted yellow, as well as the Land Rovers. They also found a large quantity of food, bedding, sleeping bags, post-office sacks, registered mail packages, banknote wrappers and a [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly board game]].\n\nIt was determined that although the farm had been cleaned for fingerprints, some finger and palm prints (presumably of the robbers) had been overlooked, including those on a ketchup bottle and on the Monopoly set (which had been used after the robbery for a game, but with real money).\n\n==London investigation==\nDespite the big breakthrough of the discovery of Leatherslade Farm, the investigation was not going well. The London side of the investigation then continued under Detective Chief Superintendent [[Tommy Butler]], who replaced Millen as head of the [[Flying Squad]] shortly after Millen was promoted to Deputy Commander under George Hatherill.  On Monday 12 August 1963, Butler was appointed to head the police investigation of the London connection and quickly formed a six-man Train Robbery Squad. With Leatherslade Farm finally found on 13 August 1963, the day after Tommy Butler was appointed to head the London investigation, the Train Robbery Squad descended on the farm.<ref name=\"Crime 1972\">Specialist in Crime (1972), Ernest Millen</ref>\n\nThe key breakthrough was when Detective Chief Superintendent Millen met a distinguished barrister in a smoking room of an exclusive West End club who told him that someone was willing to inform on the gang.<ref name=\"Crime 1972\"/> The process of talking to the informer was handled by Hatherill and Millen themselves, and they never divulged the identity of the informer to the detectives in their command. The informant had just been jailed in a provincial prison before the train robbery, and was hoping to get parole and other favourable outcomes from talking. He clearly did not know all the names perfectly, and a second informant (a woman) was able to fill in the gaps. Millen said in his book ''Specialist in Crime'', \"the break-through with the informer came at a moment when I and my colleagues at the Yard were in a state of frustration almost approaching despair\".<ref>Specialist in Crime (1972), Ernest Millen, P.208</ref> This process saw them get 18 names to be passed on to detectives to match up with the list being prepared from fingerprints collected at Leatherslade.\n\nHatherill and Millen decided to publish photos of the wanted suspects, despite strong protests from Tommy Butler and Frank Williams. This resulted in most of the robbers going to ground.\n\n===Tommy Butler, the thief-taker===\n[[Tommy Butler]] was a shrewd choice to take over the Flying Squad and in particular the Train Robbery Squad.  He became arguably the most renowned head of the Flying Squad in its history.  He was known variously as \"Mr Flying Squad\", as \"One-day Tommy\" for the speed with which he apprehended criminals and as the \"Grey Fox\" for his shrewdness.  He was Scotland Yard's most formidable thief-taker and, as an unmarried man who still lived with his mother, he had a fanatical dedication to the job.  Butler worked long hours and expected all members of the squad to do the same.\n\nThe squad later had to work out rotations whereby one member would go home to rest as otherwise they were getting only three hours of sleep per night and had no time to eat healthily or see their families.  When the squad tried to get him to ease the working conditions, Butler was enraged and threatened to send them back to their normal duties.  Butler was said to be very secretive, with [[Jack Slipper]] claiming in his book ''Slipper of the Yard'' (1981) that \"he wouldn't even tell his own left hand what the right one was doing\".  This meant that Train Robbery Squad members were often dispatched on specific errands with no knowledge of how their tasks fitted into the overall investigation.\n\n===Train Robbery Squad===\nThe six-man Train Robbery Squad consisted of Detective Inspector Frank Williams, Detective Sergeant Steve Moore, Detective Sergeant [[Jack Slipper]], Detective Sergeant Jim Nevill, Detective Sergeant Lou Van Dyck and Detective Constable Tommy Thorburn. The senior officer, Frank Williams, was a quiet man.  His speciality was dealing with informants and he had the best working knowledge of the south London criminal fraternity in the force.  One of the squad, Jack Slipper, would later become head of the Flying Squad and would still be involved in the case many years later.\n\n===Post Office Investigation===\nThe Post Office Investigation Branch (IB) was tasked with immediately establishing the amount of money stolen, which they concluded totalled \u00a32,595,997.10s.0d. They also sought to identify what money had been taken so that the relevant banks could be notified.  Deficiencies in High Value Package carriage security were reported and secure carriages were immediately brought back into service.  The installation of radios was recommended as a priority.  The investigation was detailed in a report by Assistant Controller Richard Yates that was issued in May 1964.<ref name=PMA />\n\n==Captures==\n===Roger Cordrey===\nThe first gang member to be caught was Roger Cordrey. He was with his friend, William Boal who was helping him lie low in return for the payment of old debts.  They were living in a rented, fully furnished flat above a florist's shop in Wimborne Road, [[Moordown]], [[Bournemouth]]. The Bournemouth police were tipped off by Ethel Clark, who unfortunately for Boal and Cordrey was the widow of a former police officer, when Boal and Cordrey paid rent for a garage in Tweedale Road, off Castle Lane West, three months in advance, all in used ten-shilling notes.\n\nBoal, who was not involved in the robbery, was sentenced to 24 years and died in prison in 1970. Police later acknowledged that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.<ref>{{cite web | title=New bid to clear name of Great Train Robber Bill Boal | author=Bob Graham | work=Daily Mirror  | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/great-train-robbery-new-bid-2051666 | accessdate=14 July 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/aboutus/aboutus-museum/aboutus-museum-gtr/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang-boal.htm | title=William (Bill) Gerald Boal | publisher=Thames Valley Police | work=Force museum | accessdate=21 December 2013 | url-status=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220074653/http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/aboutus/aboutus-museum/aboutus-museum-gtr/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang/aboutus-museum-gtr-gang-boal.htm | archivedate=20 December 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Others===\nOther arrests followed.  Eight of the gang members and several associates were caught.

They called police, who also discovered another briefcase full of money in the woods.  In total, a sum of \u00a3100,900 was found.  They also found a camel-skin bag with a receipt inside, from the Cafe Pension restaurant, Sonnenbichel, [[Hindelang]], Prov. [[Allg\u00e4u]] in Germany.  It was made out to Herr and Frau Field. Surrey police delivered the money and the receipt to Fewtrell and McArthur in Aylesbury, who knew by then that Brian Field was a clerk at James and Wheater who had acted in the purchase of Leatherslade Farm.  They quickly confirmed through [[Interpol]] that Brian and Karin Field had stayed at the Pension Sonnebichel in February that year.  In addition, they knew that Field had acted for Gordon Goody and other criminals.\n\nSeveral weeks later, the police went to Field's house to interview him.  He calmly (for someone whose relatives had dumped a large part at least of the loot) provided a cover story that implicated [[Lennie Field]] as the purchaser of the farm and his boss John Wheater as the conveyancer.  He admitted to visiting the farm on one occasion with Lennie Field, but said he assumed it was an investment of his brother Alexander Field, whom Brian Field had unsuccessfully defended in a recent court case.  Field, not knowing the police had found a receipt, readily confirmed that he and his wife had been to Germany on a holiday and gave them the details of the place at which they had stayed.  On 15 September 1963 Brian Field was arrested and his boss John Wheater was arrested two days later.  Lennie Field had already been arrested on 14 September.<ref name=\"The Train Robbers 1978\"/>\n\nJack Slipper was involved in the capture of Roy James, Ronald Biggs, Jimmy Hussey and John Daly.\n\n==Trial, 1964==\nThe trial of the robbers began at [[Aylesbury]] [[Assizes (England and Wales)|Assizes]], Buckinghamshire, on 20 January 1964. Because it would be necessary to accommodate a large number of lawyers and journalists, the existing court was deemed too small and so the offices of Aylesbury Rural District Council were specially converted for the event. The defendants were brought to the court each day from [[Aylesbury Prison]] in a compartmentalised van, out of view of the large crowd of spectators. [[Edmund Davies, Baron Edmund-Davies|Mr Justice Edmund Davies]] presided over the trial, which lasted 51 days and included 613 exhibits and 240 witnesses. The jury retired to the Grange Youth Centre in Aylesbury to consider its verdict.<ref>{{cite news|title=The crime of the century|first=Tom|last=Hodson|newspaper=The Buckingham and Winslow Advertiser|date=3 May 2007|url=http://www.buckinghamtoday.co.uk/the-great-train-robbery/The-crime-of-the-century.2852468.jp}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 February 1964, there was a sensation when John Daly was found to have no case to answer. His counsel, Walter Raeburn [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], claimed that the evidence against his client was limited to his fingerprints being on the Monopoly set found at Leatherslade Farm and the fact that he went underground after the robbery. Raeburn went on to say that Daly had played the Monopoly game with his brother-in-law Bruce Reynolds earlier in 1963, and that he had gone underground only because he was associated with people publicly sought by the police. This was not proof of involvement in a conspiracy. The judge agreed, and the jury was directed to acquit him.<ref>The Train Robbers (Piers Paul Read) (1978)</ref>\n\nDetective Inspector Frank Williams was shocked when this occurred because, owing to Tommy Butler's refusal to share information, he had no knowledge of the fact that Daly's prints were only on the Monopoly set. If Williams had known this, he could have asked Daly questions about the Monopoly set and robbed him of his very effective alibi. Daly was clever in avoiding having a photo taken when he was arrested until he could shave his beard. This meant that there was no photo to show the lengths he had gone to in order to change his appearance. No action was taken against Butler for his mistake in not ensuring the case against Daly was more thorough.<ref>Williams, Frank ''No Fixed Address'' (1973) Ch. Get Out of Gaol...Free (Pp 45\u201353).</ref>\n\nOn 15 April 1964 the proceedings ended with the judge describing the robbery as \"a crime of sordid violence inspired by vast greed\" and passing sentences of 30 years' imprisonment on seven of the robbers.<ref name=Bucksheadlines>{{cite book|year=1992|author=Jean Archer|isbn=1-85306-188-3|title=Buckinghamshire Headlines|publisher=Countryside Books}}</ref>\n\n===Sentencing===\nThe 11 men sentenced all felt aggrieved at the sentences handed down, particularly Bill Boal (who died in prison) and Lennie Field, who were later found not guilty of the charges against them.  The other men (aside from Wheater) resented what they considered to be the excessive length of the sentences, which were longer than those given to many murderers or armed robbers at the time.  At that period, there was no parole system in place and prisoners served the full term of the sentence. Train robbers who were sentenced later, and by different judges, received shorter terms.\n\nAt the time, the severity of the sentences caused some surprise.  When mastermind Bruce Reynolds was arrested in 1968, he allegedly told arresting officer Tommy Butler that those sentences had had a detrimental effect. According to him, they had prompted criminals generally to take guns with them when they set out on robberies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Age\n!Occupation\n!Sentence\n|-\n| John Thomas Daly || 32 || antiques dealer || No case to answer\n|-\n| Ronald Arthur Biggs || 34 || carpenter || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Douglas Gordon Goody || 34 || hairdresser || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Charles Frederick Wilson || 31 || market trader || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Thomas William Wisbey || 34 || bookmaker || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Robert Welch || 34 || club proprietor || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| James Hussey || 34 || painter || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Roy John James || 28 || racing motorist and silversmith || 30 years (25 years for conspiracy to rob and 30 years for armed robbery)\n|-\n| Roger John Cordrey || 42 || florist || 20 years (20 years for conspiracy to rob and various receiving stolen goods charges)\n|-\n| Brian Arthur Field || 29 || solicitor's clerk || 25 years (20 years for conspiracy to rob and 5 years for obstructing justice)\n|-\n| Leonard Denis Field || 31 || merchant seaman || 25 years (20 years for conspiracy to rob and 5 years for obstructing justice)\n|-\n| John Denby Wheater || 41 || solicitor || 3 years (Aiding and abetting a crime)\n|-\n| William Gerald Boal || 50 || engineer || 24 years\n|}\n\n===Appeals, July 1964===\nOn 13 July 1964, the appeals by Lennie Field and Brian Field (no relation) against the charges of conspiracy to rob were allowed.  This meant that their sentences were in effect reduced to five years only.  On 14 July 1964, the appeals by Roger Cordrey and Bill Boal were allowed, with the convictions for conspiracy to rob quashed, leaving only the receiving charges. Justice [[Fenton Atkinson]] concluded that a [[miscarriage of justice]] would result if Boal's charges were upheld, given that his age, physique and temperament made him an unlikely train robber.  Luckily for him, as the oldest robber, Cordrey was also deemed to be not guilty of the conspiracy because his prints had not been found at Leatherslade Farm.\n\nBrian Field was only reluctantly acquitted of the robbery.  Justice Atkinson stated that he would not be surprised if Field were not only part of the conspiracy, but also one of the robbers.  The charges against the other men were all upheld.  In the end Lennie Field and Bill Boal got some measure of justice, but Boal died in prison in 1970 after a long illness.<ref>The Train Robbers by Piers Paul Read (1976)</ref>\n\n==Prison escapes==\nOn 12 August 1964, Wilson escaped from [[Birmingham (HM Prison)|Winson Green Prison]] in Birmingham in under three minutes, the escape being considered unprecedented in that a three-man team had broken into the prison to extricate him.  His escape team was never caught and the leader, nicknamed \"Frenchy\", had disappeared from the London criminal scene by the late 1960s. Two weeks after his escape Wilson was in Paris for plastic surgery. By November 1965, Wilson was in [[Mexico City]] visiting old friends Bruce Reynolds and Buster Edwards.<ref>\"Killing Charlie\" by Wensley Clarkson, with Part 2: Inside and Outside providing details of Wilson's escape from prison.</ref> Wilson's escape was yet another dramatic twist in the train robbery saga.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/12/newsid_2996000/2996402.stm\n|title=Great Train Robber Escapes from Jail\n|publisher=BBC |quote=A massive manhunt is underway across Britain after one of the so-called Great Train Robbers escaped from Winson Green Prison in Birmingham.

A furniture van was parked alongside the prison walls and a ladder was dropped over the 30-foot-high wall into the prison during outside exercise time, allowing four prisoners to escape, including Biggs.  The escape was planned by recently released prisoner Paul Seaborne, with the assistance of two other ex-convicts, Ronnie Leslie and Ronnie Black, with support from Biggs's wife, Charmian.  The plot saw two other prisoners interfere with the warders, and allow Biggs and friend Eric Flower to escape.  Seaborne was later caught by Butler and sentenced to four-and-a-half years; Ronnie Leslie received three years for being the getaway driver.  The two other prisoners who took advantage of the Biggs escape were captured after three months. Biggs and Flower paid a significant sum of money to be smuggled to Paris for plastic surgery.  Biggs said he had to escape because of the length of the sentence and what he alleged to be the severity of the prison conditions.<ref>\"Odd Man Out\" (1994) by Ronald Biggs. Chapter 5 describes the Biggs escape from Wandsworth Prison to Paris</ref>\n\nWilson and Biggs's escapes meant that five of the known robbers were now on the run, with Tommy Butler in hot pursuit.\n\n==Pursuit of fugitives==\n'''Jimmy White''' \u2013 With the other robbers on the run and having fled the country, only White was at large in the United Kingdom. White was a renowned locksmith/thief and had already been on the run for 10 years before the robbery. He was said to have \"a remarkable ability to be invisible, to merge with his surroundings and become the ultimate Mr Nobody.\" He was a wartime paratrooper and a veteran of [[Battle of Arnhem|Arnhem]].<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/> According to [[Piers Paul Read]] in his 1978 book ''The Train Robbers'', he was \"a solitary thief, not known to work with either firm, he should have had a good chance of remaining undetected altogether, yet was known to be one of the Train Robbers almost at once\u2014first by other criminals and then by the police\". He was unfortunate in that Brian Field's relatives had dumped luggage containing \u00a3100,000 only a mile from a site where White had bought a caravan and hidden \u00a330,000 in the panelling. In addition, a group of men purporting to be from the Flying Squad broke into his flat and took a briefcase containing \u00a38,500. Throughout his three years on the run with wife Sheree and baby son Stephen, he was taken advantage of or let down by friends and associates. On 10 April 1966 a new friend recognised him from photos in a newspaper and informed police. They arrested him at Littlestone while he was at home. He only had \u00a38,000 to hand back to them. The rest was long gone. He was tried in June 1966 at [[Leicester]] [[Assizes]] and Mr Justice Nield sentenced him to 18 years' jail, considerably less than the 30 years given to other principal offenders.\n\n'''[[Buster Edwards]]''' \u2013 Edwards fled to Mexico with his family, to join Bruce Reynolds (and later Charlie Wilson) but returned voluntarily to England in 1966, where he was sentenced to 15 years.\n\n'''[[Charlie Wilson (criminal)|Charlie Wilson]]''' \u2013 Wilson took up residence outside [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, on [[Rigaud, Quebec|Rigaud Mountain]] in an upper-middle-class neighbourhood where the large, secluded properties are surrounded by trees. He lived under the name Ronald Alloway, a name borrowed from a Fulham shopkeeper. His wife and three children soon joined him.  He joined an exclusive golf club and participated in the activities of the local community. It was only when he invited his brother-in-law over from the UK for Christmas that [[Scotland Yard]] was able to track him down and recapture him. They waited three months before making their move, in the hope that Wilson would lead them to Reynolds, the last suspect still to be apprehended. Wilson was arrested on 25 January 1968 by Tommy Butler. Many in Rigaud petitioned that his wife and three daughters be allowed to stay in the Montreal area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coolopolis.blogspot.com/2008/03/montreals-connection-to-great-train.html |title=Coolopolis: Montreal's connection to the Great Train Robbery |publisher=Coolopolis.blogspot.com |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Bruce Reynolds]]''' \u2013 On 6 June 1964, Reynolds arrived in Mexico, with his wife Angela and son Nick joining him a few months later, after they evaded the obvious police surveillance. A year later in July 1965, Buster Edwards and his family arrived, although unlike the Reynolds family they planned to return to England at some stage, and did not like Mexico. Charlie Wilson, on the run with his family still back in England visited them for six weeks, so three of the train robbers were together in exile for a time. After the Edwards family returned to England, the Reynoldses also decided to leave Mexico and go to Canada to potentially join up with the Wilson family, leaving on 6 December 1966. They had spent much of their share of the robbery by this point \u2013 living far more extravagantly than the Edwardses had. After realising the danger in settling near the Wilsons in Montreal, they went to live in Vancouver, and then went to Nice, France. Reynolds did not want to go to Australia where Biggs was, and needing money decided to go back to England, settling briefly in Torquay before being captured by Tommy Butler.<ref>Crossing the Line - The Autobiography of a Thief, by Bruce Reynolds</ref>\n\n'''[[Ronnie Biggs]]''' \u2013 Biggs fled to Paris, where he acquired new identity papers and underwent [[plastic surgery]].  In 1970, he moved to [[Adelaide, Australia]], where he worked as a builder and he and his wife had a third son.  Tipped off that [[Interpol]] was showing interest, he moved to [[Melbourne]] working as a set constructor for [[Nine network|Channel 9]], later escaping to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], after police had discovered his Melbourne address. Biggs could not be [[extradition|extradited]] because there was no extradition treaty between Britain and Brazil, and additionally he became father to a Brazilian son, which afforded him legal immunity. As a result, he lived openly in Rio for many years, safe from the British authorities. In 1981, Biggs' Brazilian son became a member of a successful band [[Turma do Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico]], but the band quickly faded into obscurity and dissolved.\n\nIn May 2001, aged 71 and having suffered three strokes, Biggs voluntarily returned to England. Accepting that he could be arrested, his stated desire was to \"walk into a [[Margate]] pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of [[bitter (beer)|bitter]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/pictures/image/0,8543,-10704180185,00.html|title=2001: Biggs wants to return|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=66752 |title=Statement from Michael Biggs made in London |publisher=Prnewswire.co.uk |date=8 May 2001 |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> Arrested on landing, after detention and a short court hearing he was sent back to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence.

In later years, the robbers generally came together only for the funerals of their fellow gang members.  Wilson's funeral on 10 May 1990 was attended by Bruce Reynolds, who reported seeing Edwards, Roy James (who got into a verbal argument with the press), Welch (hobbling on crutches) and White (who went unnoticed due to his ability to blend into the background). At Edwards's funeral in 1994, Reynolds saw only Welch. (Hussey, Wisbey and James were all in prison at the time.)\n\n'''Brian Field'''\n{{main|Brian Field}}\nAfter being sentenced on 16 April 1964, Field served four years of his five-year sentence. He was released in 1967. While he was in prison, his wife Karin divorced him and married a German journalist.<ref>Signal Red by Robert Ryan (2010)</ref> Karin wrote an article for the German magazine [[Stern (magazine)|''Stern'']]. She confirmed that she took Roy James to [[Thame railway station]] so he could go to London and that she led a convoy of two vans back to her house, where the gang were joined by wives and girlfriends for a big party to celebrate the crime.<ref>The Great Train Robbery (Crime Archive series) (2008) by Peter Gutteridge (P 54)</ref> When Reynolds returned to the UK in 1968, he tried to contact Field as this was the only way he could get in touch with the \"Ulsterman\". It seems that Field was ambushed upon his release from prison by a recently released convict, \"Scotch Jack\" Buggy, who presumably roughed up or even tortured Field with a view to extorting some of the loot from the robbery. Subsequently, Field went to ground and Buggy was killed shortly after. Reynolds gave up trying to find Field.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/>\n\nField changed his name to Brian Carlton to disappear. Sometime after his release from prison he married Sian, from Wales. In the mid/late 1970s they worked for the Children's Book Centre (since sold) in Kensington High Street, London. Field and his wife Sian were responsible for the company's operations in central and southern Europe, to where they shipped English language books and held book fairs at international English schools. Field, aged 44, and Sian, aged 28, died in a car crash on the M4 motorway on 27 April 1979, a year after the last of the robbers had completed their sentences. The accident occurred as they returned from a visit to Sian's parents in Wales. A Mercedes driven by Amber Bessone, the pregnant 28-year-old daughter of well-known hairdresser [[Raymond Bessone]] (Mr Teasy Weasy) crossed a damaged section of the guard rail and slammed into Field's oncoming Porsche. The Fields, Amber, her husband and two children were all killed instantly. It was several weeks after the accident that Field's true identity was discovered. It is not clear whether his wife Sian ever knew of his past.\n\n'''Charlie Wilson'''\n{{main|Charlie Wilson (criminal)}}\nThe last of the robbers released, (after serving about one-third of his sentence<ref name=\"Greenwood\">{{cite book|last=Greenwood|first=Douglas|title=Who's Buried where in England|edition=Third|year=1999|publisher=Constable|isbn=0-09-479310-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/whosburiedwherei0000gree}}</ref>) Wilson returned to the life of crime and was found shot dead at his villa in [[Marbella]], Spain, on 24 April 1990.

Frank Monroe, one of the three robbers who was never caught, temporarily gave Reynolds a job, but did not want to attract undue attention by employing him for too long. Reynolds later got back together with his wife Angela and son Nicholas.  He was arrested in 1983 for drug-related offences (Reynolds denied having any involvement).  He was released again in March 1985 and dedicated himself to helping his wife recover from a mental breakdown.

The judge acknowledged the minor nature of his role.<ref>Gangster's Moll (2001) by Marilyn Wisbey (Pp 80\u201381)</ref>\n\nJim Hussey was released on 17 November 1975 and married girlfriend Gill (whom he had met just before the robbery).  Hussey's share of the loot had been entrusted to a friend of Frank Monroe who squandered it despite Monroe periodically checking on its keeper. \n \nWisbey and Hussey fell back into crime and were jailed in 1989 for cocaine dealing, with Wisbey sentenced to 10 years and Hussey to seven years.  In her book ''Gangster's Moll'', Marilyn Wisbey recounts that on 8 June 1988, after returning home from a visit to an abortion clinic and resting they were raided by the Drugs Squad. The raid uncovered 1&nbsp;kg of cocaine and Rene and Marilyn Wisbey were arrested along with Jimmy Hussey, who had been spotted accepting a package from Wisbey in a park. Wisbey himself was captured a year later in Wilmslow, Cheshire. He was allegedly staying with another woman, to the shock of his wife and daughter. In return for Hussey and Wisbey pleading guilty, the two women were unconditionally freed.<ref>Gangster's Moll (2001) by Marlyn Wisbey (Chapters 1: Growing Up and 12: Cocaine)</ref> Upon their release from prison, both men retired from work.<ref>Signal Red by Robert Ryan (Pp486, 487)</ref>\n\nWisbey later explained: \"We were against drugs all our lives, but as the years went on, towards the end of the '70s, it became more and more the 'in' thing.

By 29 August 1963 Commander Hatherill had 14 names, and told police that Brian Field had tried to enlist another gang to rob the train, who turned him down. Hatherill's list was unerringly accurate\u2014all the major gang members who were later jailed were identified, except Ronnie Biggs. With the exception of the minor accomplices Lennie Field, Bill Boal and the train driver, the list was complete, although of course \"The Ulsterman\" was not identified. In terms of the ones who got away, there were four others identified\u2014Henry Smith, Danny Pembroke, a fair-haired man (25 years old and well-spoken, not named) and a nondescript man (not named but maybe Jimmy Collins).{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 2019, Pembroke's son, also called Danny, confirmed that his father was present during the raid. He escaped detection as he always wore gloves, including at the hideout at the farm, and went outside to the toilet rather than using the one inside the house. The son stated that Pembroke, whose share of the loot was \u00a3150,000 (about \u00a33&nbsp;million in 2019), died in 2015 aged 79.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Matthew |title=Great Train Robber unmasked 56 years on |work=The Times |issue=72,916 |date=3 August 2019 |page=14|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>\n\nBoth Piers Paul Read, and later Bruce Reynolds refer to three robbers who got away as Bill Jennings, Alf Thomas and Frank Monroe.\n\n'''Bill 'Flossy' Jennings a.k.a. Mr One'''\n\nPiers Paul Read refers to this man as Bill Jennings in ''The Train Robbers'', while Bruce Reynolds adds a nickname, 'Flossy'. Ronnie Biggs refers to him as Mr One, as do other accounts. According to Bruce Reynolds, \"Flossy had no previous convictions and stayed well out of contact with the group. A shadowy figure, nobody knew exactly where he lived\u2014or even what his real name was. All we knew that he was one hundred per cent, and was sure to last out the hullabaloo. The last report of him said that he was in a safe house, banged up with two gorgeous girls and enough champagne to sink a battleship.\"<ref>Crossing the Line&nbsp;\u2014 The Autobiography of a Thief, Bruce Reynolds, Page 217</ref>\n\nIt is clear that while Reynolds claims to not have known his real name, 'Flossy' was not just a participant in the Great Train Robbery, he was a core part of the gang who participated in the London Airport robbery. This robbery was the audacious raid that Gordon Goody and Charlie Wilson were acquitted of. That raid consisted of Roy James and Mickey Ball as the getaway drivers, with six robbers\u2014Bruce Reynolds, Buster Edwards, Gordon Goody, Charlie Wilson, Flossy (and a sixth man who did not participate in the train robbery). In the end the only one caught after the airport raid was Mickey Ball, who pleaded guilty to being a getaway driver when a witness mistook him for Flossy, and to avoid being blamed for the actual violence he agreed to plead guilty as an accomplice, and was in prison during the Great Train Robbery. He was given \u00a3500 from the proceeds of the Train Robbery.<ref>Crossing the Line&nbsp;\u2014 The Autobiography of a Thief, Bruce Reynolds, Page 167</ref>\n\nHenry Thomas 'Harry' Smith (born 20 October 1930) was Flossy and unlike most other robbers, actually got to spend his share of the loot, buying 28 houses and also a hotel and drinking club in Portsmouth. Smith died in 2008. Smith was the only man not ultimately arrested that was on both the Hatherill list, and Tommy Butler's list.\n\n'''Danny Pembroke (Alf Thomas)'''\n\nDanny Pembroke was an ex army man who was a south London taxi driver and a South Coast Raider. At Leatherslade Farm he was the most careful of the gang, and nothing was ever found to associate him with the robbery, despite the police being satisfied that he was one of the gang, and had searched his house in September 1963. However, afraid that he would be betrayed, he did a deal with Frank Williams and paid back \u00a347,245. Following the robbery, Pembroke left for America for a couple of years, knowing he was set up for life, and then returned to live quietly in Kent. He died aged 79 from a heart attack, at home and in his sleep on 28 February 2015. Pembroke had five children, and his son Danny Jnr, admitted to his involvement in a Channel Four documentary in August 2019.\n\n'''Frank Monroe'''\n\nAccording to Bruce Reynolds, Monroe, who was never caught, worked as a film stunt man for a while before starting a paper and scrap metal recycling business.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1995\"/>\n\n'''The Replacement Train Driver a.k.a. Pops/Dad a.k.a. Peter a.k.a. Stan Agate'''\n\nThe replacement train driver was never caught, and never suspected of even existing by police, due to the fact that Jack Mills in the end had to drive the train. He also never profited from the crime, as Ronnie Biggs never paid him his \u00a320,000 \"drink\". The driver, of course, was not a member of the gang (as defined by receiving an equal share), just an accomplice.\n\nPiers Paul Read called the replacement train driver \"Stan Agate\", and Stan was apparently the true nickname of the replacement driver. Read, concerned that the robbers may have hurt him, went to see Ronnie Biggs in Brazil to get his details, although was dismayed to find that Biggs did not know his last name and knew and cared very little about him. With the meagre details provided, Read used a detective agency to track down the driver at a town 20 miles south of London, and found that he was still alive, although somewhat senile and being cared for by his wife. The wife admitted that she had burnt all the clothes that he had worn that night, and had nervously waited for either the gang to murder him or the police to arrest him. Read promised not to reveal their identities.<ref>The Train Robbers, Piers Paul Read, Pages 269-271</ref> Unlike the other three members of the gang who got away, Peta Fordham does make mention of the replacement driver, but notes that he is said now to be dead, perhaps the robbers who provided material for the book did not want the police looking for him, as at the time of publishing (1965) Reynolds, White and Edwards were still on the run.<ref>The Robbers' Tale, Peta Fordham, Page 78</ref>\n\nRonnie Biggs, in his 1994 autobiography, ''Odd Man Out'', said that Bruce Reynolds offered him a chance to join the gang, if he could find a train driver. Biggs was renewing the front windows of a train driver's house in Redhill, who he calls 'Peter' (and whom he believes to be dead by 1994). Ronnie offers him a \u00a340,000 share of the profits, tells Reynolds and gives his address to John Daly who then proceeds to check him out. It seems that while he was an older man, he still had to apply for two weeks leave of absence from his job.<ref>Odd Man Out (1994), Ronnie Biggs, Pages14-16</ref> According to Biggs, 'Peter' was paid his \u00a340,000 'drink',<ref name=\"Odd Man Out 1994 Pages31-32\">Odd Man Out (1994), Ronnie Biggs, Pages31-32</ref> although other accounts claim otherwise. Biggs states that Mary Manson drove 'Peter' and John Daly home, while Reynolds drove Biggs home.\n\n===Accomplices===\nJohn Wheater was released from prison on 11 February 1966 and managed his family's laundry business in Harrogate.<ref>The Train Robbers by Piers Paul Read (Pp 235 & 245)</ref> He later wrote two articles in the ''Sunday Telegraph'', which published the first one on 6 March 1966. He died in July 1985.\n\nLenny Field was released in 1967 and went to live in North London. He disappeared from the public eye.\n\nMary Manson, an associate of Bruce Reynolds and John Daly, was charged with receiving \u00a3820 from the robbery; she was held for six weeks but was released.  Mary took care of wives and children of some of the robbers while they were on the run or in jail.\n\n==Fate of the victims==\n===Jack Mills===\n[[Jack Mills|Mills]] had constant trauma headaches for the rest of his life. He died in 1970 from [[leukaemia]]. Mills's assailant was one of three members of the gang, who was never identified by the others. However, in November 2012, Hussey made a death-bed confession that it was he, although there were suspicions that this was repayment of a debt, to divert attention from the real perpetrator.<ref>{{cite news|title=James Hussey: Great Train Robber who made a disputed confession on his deathbed|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/james-hussey-great-train-robber-who-made-a-disputed-confession-on-his-deathbed-8320564.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=19 December 2013|location=London|date=15 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrank Williams (at the time a detective inspector) claimed that at least three men who were directly involved are still at liberty and enjoying their full share of the money stolen and the profits from the way they invested it, one of them being the man responsible for the attack on the train driver. Williams said that the train driver's assailant was not some phantom figure lurking in the criminal underworld, and that he traced him, identified him and took him to Scotland Yard where, with Tommy Butler, Williams questioned him.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He could not be charged because of lack of evidence; there were no fingerprints or identifiable marks anywhere.

This paid off with the arrests of first Wilson, then Reynolds. When asked by a reporter after the sentencing of Reynolds whether that was the end of it, Butler replied that it was not over until Biggs was caught. In 1969 he was finally forced to accept compulsory retirement, and later died in 1970, aged 57.  That same day, Biggs' memoirs were published in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper.\n\nButler's deputy, Frank Williams, was passed over to be his replacement as head of the Flying Squad because of his deal with Edwards (which he thought would seal his promotion) and his deal with another of the robbers who was never caught. Following this, he left the force to become head of security for the airline [[Qantas]]. He wrote his autobiography ''No Fixed Address'', which was published in 1973.\n\n[[Jack Slipper]] of the [[Metropolitan Police]] was promoted to [[Chief Superintendent|detective chief superintendent]]. He became so involved in the case that he continued to hunt many of the escaped robbers after he retired. He believed Biggs should not be released after returning to the UK in 2001 and he often appeared in the media to comment on any news item connected with the robbery before his death on 24 August 2005 at the age of 81.\n\nDetective Chief Superintendent Ernest Malcolm Fewtrell, head of the Buckinghamshire Crime Investigation Department (CID) was born on 29 September 1909 and died on 28 November 2005, aged 96. He retired on the last day of the trial after the verdicts were handed down at the then compulsory retirement age of 55.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article598370.ece |title=(Accessed in April 2011) |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> This allowed him (with Ronald Payne of ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', who was involved in the paper's coverage of the case) to be the first of the investigators to write a book ''The Train Robbers'' on the robbery investigation in 1964. In the book he expressed some frustration with the Flying Squad although he mostly had praise for individual officers. His one regret was that he had the search for the hideout carried out radiating outwards from the scene of the robbery rather than an inwards search from a {{convert|30|mi|adj=on}} perimeter.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1505956/Chief-Superintendent-Malcolm-Frewtrell.html |title=(accessed in April 2011) |work=The Daily Telegraph|date= 21 December 2005|accessdate=20 December 2013 |location=London}}</ref> He worked as an accommodation officer for [[University of Portsmouth|Portsmouth Polytechnic]] before retiring to live by the sea near Swanage.

The actual carriage that was robbed [M30204M] was retained for seven years following the robbery, and then taken to Norfolk and burned in the presence of police and Post Office representatives at a scrapyard near Norwich in 1970. This was to deter collector/souvenir hunters. Locomotive [[British Rail Class 40|English Electric Type 4 \u2013 D326]] (later 40126) was involved in a number of serious operating incidents.

The bulk of the haul was in [[Bank of England \u00a31 note|\u00a31 notes]] and [[Bank of England \u00a35 note|\u00a35 notes]] (both the older white note and the newer blue note which was half its size). The \u00a35 notes were bundled in batches of \u00a32,500, the \u00a31 notes in batches of \u00a3500. There were also [[Bank of England 10s note|ten-shilling notes]] in batches of \u00a3250. A quantity of Irish and Scottish money was also stolen.\nWith the exception of a few 'drinks' for associates, the loot was split into 17 equal shares of around \u00a3150,000 each (George Hatherill claims that there were 18 shares).\n\nWith a few notable exceptions, the money was quickly laundered or divided by friends, family and associates of the robbers. Much was laundered through bookmakers (Wilson and Wisbey were themselves bookmakers) although, astonishingly, only a few hundred pounds were identifiable by serial number so the robbers could have spent the money without fear of being traced.<ref>No Fixed Address (1971) by Frank Williams (Ch: Where Has All The Money Gone ? Pp 68\u201384)</ref> There were 1,579 notes whose serial numbers were known and the rest of the money was completely untraceable.\n\nThe \u00a35 notes were of two different types, because in 1957 the British Government had begun to replace the large white notes with smaller blue ones. The final changeover had not been completed by the time of the robbery. The white notes quickly became far more conspicuous to use, making it harder for them to be spent.\n\nAlthough within six months of the robbery 10 of the robbers had been locked up awaiting trial and three others were wanted criminals on the run, very little of the money had actually been recovered. This has caused speculation that there is a great deal of robbery loot still out there. In fact, the money was soon seized and spent by predatory gangsters and greedy associates, relatives and lawyers. Thus the proceeds of the greatest cash robbery in British history were quickly used up, with few of the robbers receiving any real long-term benefit.\n\nLess than \u00a3400,000 was eventually recovered. Over half of this consisted of the shares of Roger Cordrey (\u00a3141,017) and (allegedly) Brian Field (\u00a3100,900). A further \u00a336,000 was recovered from Jimmy White's caravan. Roy James was carrying \u00a312,041 when captured. The final sum recovered was \u00a347,245 that was found in a telephone box in Great Dover Street, [[Newington, London|Newington]], South London.\n\n===Telephone box controversy===\nThe \u00a347,245 recovered from a telephone box included 57 notes whose serial numbers had been recorded by the bank in Scotland. This money was part of a deal struck with Frank Williams by Danny Pembroke.  Piers Paul Read, in ''The Train Robbers'', claimed that the police were feeling the pressure because although they had caught many of the robbers, they had failed to recover much of the money.  While no evidence had been found against Pembroke,who was believed to have been one of the South Coast Raiders, some of the identifiable bank notes had been traced back to him through friends who had been charged with receiving. Given that the police had insufficient evidence against Pembroke, either at Leatherslade Farm or definitive connection with either of the two gangs, Butler was prepared to let him go.  Williams convinced Butler to pull Pembroke in for questioning and in return for releasing him and not charging his friends with more serious crimes, \u00a350,000 was to be returned.\n\nOn 3 December 1963, which happened to be the same day that Roy James was taken into custody, the police received an anonymous tip directing them to the money in the phone box. The money was driven up to Aylesbury and taken into custody by Detective Superintendent Fewtrell, who wondered how his London colleagues could know how much money there was.  He had to bring in bank clerks to count the damp and musty money to determine the final sum.<ref>Piers Paul Read ''The Train Robbers'' (1978), pp.142\u2013143</ref>\n\nWilliams made no admission to the recovery of the money being the result of a deal with Pembroke. Despite claiming that his negotiations were responsible for the return of this money, Williams in his book ''No Fixed Address'' (1973) claimed not to know the identity of the person who had returned the money, although he did mention several robbers to whom he had offered deals through intermediaries.  He noted that it seemed to him that Butler was sceptical of his efforts and that at the press conference Hatherill and Millen did not reveal the circumstances behind the find and that he was never asked to talk with them about it. Despite Pembroke being the man identified as the assailant of the train driver, Jack Mills, by Bruce Reynolds (albeit indirectly), Williams only makes mention of the assailant once in his book. In this section (often quoted by other sources), he confirms that, with Tommy Butler, he questioned the man they knew to be the assailant but that they had no evidence to convict him. Strangely, however, he makes no further mention of him.\n\nThe deal done with Pembroke caused outrage in the police hierarchy.<ref>Frank Williams ''No Fixed Address'' (1973). On p. 11 he talks about the assailant of the train driver and on pp. 68\u201384 he talks about where the money had gone.</ref> It is hinted in several books that the deals done by Williams were responsible for his being overlooked for promotion and that Williams was unhappy that his efforts were not recognised by Butler, but were instead hidden from superiors.\n\nFor his part, George Hatherill, in his book ''A Detective's Tale'', stated that the motive behind the return of the money was not known for certain. He said that the money was returned by \"one about whom extensive inquiries had been made and who in fact was interrogated at length. But in spite of our strong suspicions, nothing could be proved against him and so no charge could be brought. My belief is that he thought we knew more about him than we did, and thinking things were getting hot, he decided to get rid of the money to avoid being found in possession with it\".<ref>George Hatherill ''A Detective's Tale'' (1971), pp.214\u2013215</ref> Hatherill does not mention Williams at all in his book. He retired on the last day of the trial at Aylesbury.\n\n===Legal fees===\nThe 19 gang members who were arrested shortly after the robbery had to spend a large amount on legal fees (approximately \u00a330,000 each).\n\n===Money spent===\nThe robbers who spent much time on the run overseas\u2014Reynolds, Wilson and Edwards\u2014had very little left when finally arrested, having had to spend money avoiding capture and indulging in lavish lifestyles without finding employment. Much of Jimmy White's money was taken from him.\n\nAccording to Marilyn Wisbey, her father's share was hidden by his father Tommy Wisbey Senior in the panels in the doors of his home. Butler raided them three times but he never found the train money. The majority of the money was reputedly entrusted to Wisbey's father and also to his younger brother Ron, who coincidentally had saved some money of his own that was confiscated by the police and returned to Ron three months later. By the time Wisbey was released from jail all of his share had either been spent or invested. Marilyn agrees with Piers Paul Read's assessment of how her father's share of approximately \u00a3150,000 was spent. Although the Wisbey share was one that was not taken by other criminals, Marilyn Wisbey is still bitter that her relatives got to spend a fair amount of the loot while the overall sum dwindled away. However, her grandfather used some of the money to buy them a house in Upper Norwood.<ref>Gangster's Moll (2001) by Marilyn Wisbey (Chapter 6 The Pubs, Pp 69\u201371)</ref>\n\nUp to six of the robbers escaped punishment in one way or another - \"The Ulsterman\", three robbers who were never caught, John Daly who had his charges dismissed at the trial and Ronnie Biggs who escaped from jail and managed to avoid being taken back to the UK. Daly had entrusted his money to another crook. This man had betrayed him to the police and had absconded with the money. He died before Daly could catch up with him. Upon the release of the others in the mid-1970s, \"Bill Jennings\" got in touch with Buster Edwards and \"Frank Monroe\" got in touch with the South Coast Raiders. Both said that they had no money left. Danny Pembroke went initially to America and John Daly at the time was said to be living on [[Unemployment benefits|unemploymant benefit]]<nowiki/>s in the west of England.<ref>The Train Robbers (1978), Piers Paul Read, Pp244-245</ref> Ronnie Biggs quickly spent his share getting a new life. He loved his new life in Australia, although by the time his family arrived in 1966, all but \u00a37,000 had been spent. \u00a355,000 had been paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK. The rest had gone on legal fees and expenses.<ref>Odd Man Out, Ronnie Biggs</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Early books===\nThese books were written in the immediate aftermath of the 1964 trial and before the capture of several of the gang.\n* ''The Great Train Robbery'' (1964) by John Gosling and Dennis Craig. The first book about the robbery, it relied on the real-life experience of John Gosling, a former policeman.\n* ''The Robbers' Tale'' (1965) by Peta Fordham, first published by Hodder & Stoughton, London. It told the story of the robbery only shortly after the conclusion of the initial trial. The author was the wife of one of the lawyers involved in the case. The book mostly involves a description of the trial. The author constantly hints that she knew more than she was prepared to write, yet it was written before most of the facts emerged.\n\n===Biographies of investigators===\nBooks written by senior police in the early 1970s, after their retirement, chiefly present accounts of the investigation, capture, trial and recapture of the robbers.\n* ''The Train Robbers'' (1964) by Malcolm Fewtrell (with Ronald Payne), first published in London by Arthur Barker Limited.\n* ''A Detective's Story'' (1971) by George Hatherill, first published in London by Andre Deutsch Limited ({{ISBN|0-2339-6322-7}}) is part autobiography and part description on what makes a detective.

A unique inside story of his career as a detective.\n* ''No Fixed Address'' (1973) by Frank Williams, first published by W. H. Allen & Co Ltd ({{ISBN|0-4910-0524-5}}). It tells the story of the aftermath of the robbery from Williams's point of view, in particular describing the mistakes made in the early days by senior officers, and the autocratic nature of Tommy Butler. The book is targeted at Ronnie Biggs in the hope that he will contact Williams for a deal, similar to the one arranged by Buster Edwards. The book mistakenly identifies Bill Boal as a robber (although it concedes his role was a support role), and it also mistakenly identifies Biggs as one of the leaders.\n* ''Slipper of the Yard'' (1981) by Jack Slipper, first published by Sidgwick and Jackson Ltd ({{ISBN|0-2839-8702-2}}).

This book recounts a very detailed version of the story based on an exclusive account given by eight of the then-paroled robbers (Edwards, Goody, Hussey, Wisby, Welch, James, White and Cordrey with contradictory versions by Reynolds and Biggs). Despite revealing more than previous accounts, the book is flawed in that it includes inaccuracies that the funding source for the heist was former [[SS]] officer [[Otto Skorzeny]]. As the story unfolds in the book, however, the German connection was proved to be false.\n* ''Odd Man Out'' (1994) by Ronald Biggs, first published by Bloomsbury Publishing Limited ({{ISBN|0-7475-1683-9}}). This book is an autobiography of the life of Ronald Biggs, particularly his life on the run after the Great Train Robbery.\n* ''Crossing The Line: Autobiography of a Thief'' (1995) by Bruce Reynolds, first published by Bantam Press ({{ISBN|1-8522-7929-X}}).\n* ''Keep on Running'' (1996) by Ronald Biggs and Christopher Pickard, first published by Bloomsbury Publishing Limited ({{ISBN|0-7475-2188-3}}).

The book tells of Biggs's prison life in Belmarsh and Norwich prisons, from his UK return in May 2001 to his release from Norwich on compassionate grounds in August 2009. Published by Apex, {{ISBN|978-1-908548-48-1}}.\n* ''Odd Man Out: The Last Straw'' (2011) by Ronald Biggs, first published by Mpress Limited ({{ISBN|978-0-9570398-2-7}}).

The movie launched Yates's Hollywood career after it attracted the interest of [[Steve McQueen]] who got the British director to make his next feature, ''[[Bullitt]]''. The film featured a gripping car chase (though this was connected to another earlier crime and not the robbery) which included scenes of a policeman being run down. Despite being a fictionalised account ''[[Robbery (1967 film)|Robbery]]'' did draw on key details of the real robbery and these were reflected in the film. These included the detailed planning and preparation used, the use of a farmhouse as a base and the intended (but unsuccessful) use of a replacement driver for the train. The film ends with the mastermind of the robbery \"Clifton\", played by [[Stanley Baker]] (whose own company Oakhurst Productions had produced the film), evading capture and going on the run overseas by posing as a merchant seaman.\n* The 1969 French film ''[[The Brain (1969 film)|The Brain]]'' stars [[David Niven]] as a British master criminal who perpetrates in France a heist based on the Great Train robbery.
