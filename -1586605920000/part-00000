Horne said a review of nationwide research on the issue showed that all-day programs appeared to reduce the achievement gap between students from poor households and those from more affluent homes. He also said that children who come to school speaking a language other than English also benefit.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tucson.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/horne-for-full-day-kindergarten/article_7b546a8b-ca8c-5e3b-98cf-2128d3338992.html|title=Horne for full-day kindergarten|last=Services|first=Howard Fischer Capitol Media|work=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en}}</ref>  \"The teachers tell me a substantial number of their students are reading, and they were not able to do that in the half-day program,\" Horne said. \"For students in poor neighborhoods to be reading is a huge step forward to eliminate the fact that when kids are behind when they start, they never catch up.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/news/outcry-over-plan-to-cut-full-day-kindergarten/article_98ce8f25-7d1f-5a7c-95ae-befacb240716.html|title=Outcry over plan to cut full-day kindergarten|last=Reese|first=Michelle|work=East Valley Tribune|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Nutritional standards===\nHe also pushed for nutritional standards that removed junk food from schools in the elementary grades and created incentives for secondary schools to do so on a voluntary basis.<ref>https://www.azed.gov/wp-content/uploads/PDF/VANSforgrades9-12.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.azed.gov/wp-content/uploads/PDF/ArizonaNutritionStandards.pdf</ref> \"Most parents want their kids to eat healthy and resent it when the schools undermine that . . .

He oversaw the development of a dual-purpose assessment that was unique in combining assessments on both state and nationally defined standards.  This cut standardized testing time in half, restoring that time to classroom instruction.\n\n===Arizona Instrument to Measure Success (AIMS) test===\nHorne also continued to implement the Arizona Instrument to Measure Success (AIMS) test, which was created by Lisa Graham Keegan<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://azdailysun.com/keegan-quits-amid-praise-criticism/article_7cc94cee-08cb-51ce-9069-b90d66c48359.html|title=Keegan quits amid praise, criticism|last=Writers|first=PAUL DAVENPORT      and GIOVANNA DELL'ORTOAssociated Press|work=Arizona Daily Sun|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en}}</ref> and approved by the legislature in the 1990s, but did not go into effect until 2006.<ref>[[Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards]]</ref>  Despite minor controversy over the requirement that students pass the test before graduating high school, the test became an accepted part of the state education system, until it was replaced in 2014.

Horne, who participated in Martin Luther King's 1963 March on Washington,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/28/school-head-fights-ethnic-chauvinism-in-arizona/|title=School head fights 'ethnic chauvinism' in Arizona|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}</ref> was alerted to an ethnic studies program ([[Mexican American Studies Department Programs, Tucson Unified School District|Mexican American Studies]]) in the [[Tucson Unified School District]] and, based on a review of the curriculum, championed a law to address what he viewed as the problems these materials presented.<ref>https://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/2011/01/03/20110103arizona-ethnic-studies-tucson-tom-horne.html</ref>  A state law was passed that prohibited curricula that either:  1) Promote the overthrow of the United States government. 2) Promote resentment toward a race or class of people. 3) Are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group. 4) Advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.<ref>Arizona Legislature; [http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/15/00112.htm&Title=15&DocType=ARS Arizona Revised Statue 15-112]</ref> Horne said, \"We think kids should be taught together. They should be taught to treat each other as individuals, that what race they happened to have been born into is irrelevant. What's relevant is what you know, what you can do, what's your character, not what race you happened to have been born into. And we teach the contributions of different groups together in a social studies class for all kids.  It's contrary, I believe, to American values to divide kids by race and teach each race only about its own contributions.

Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.]], Horne argued that Arizona's voter registration requirements were not preempted by the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]]. The case was decided against Horne and Arizona, by a 7-2 vote. The 7-2 Decision stated \"Arizona is correct that the Elections Clause empowers Congress to regulate ''how'' federal elections are held, but not ''who'' may vote in them. The latter is the province of the states.\"  However, because Horne's predecessor as Attorney General had not appealed an adverse decision by the commission, the case was sent back for a new petition to the commission to be appealed.  It was consolidated with a 10th circuit case, which ruled adversely, and the Supreme Court chose not to review a second time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-71_7l48.pdf|title=ARIZONA ET AL. v.

She collaborates with Alfon, into kidnapping Anna who is Alfon's obsession after the near encounter, while Jewel is Margarita's plan to kill after losing everything especially her inheritance.\n\n=== Book Two: Prequel ===\nAs Book 1 ends in the television series adaptation of Martha Cecilia's Kristine Book Series, Jewel and Jaime are in each other's arms once again, and Lance tries to convince Jewel who she will pick at almost any point, the one man she truly loves, or the one that is now healing her broken heart. Margarita's schemes makes it hectic and unraveling. What will Jaime and Marco uncover about Stella and Alfon's relationship as they are unaware of Stella? Meanwhile, as secrets unravel, Jewels safety is at risk as she is now in Lance's arms. Fate also brings her to the unaware truth that Stella is her mother as she runs away from her home she instantly forgives but one day she and Jaime are in each other's hands again but Alfon and Stella are over and done with and now Margarita is up to something. After an evening with Lance, Jewel finds her mother Anna and Stella in a bitter argument of a secret. But as it unravels, Jewel finds out she is not the real Fortalejo leaving her to confront her mother, and Stella who is her biological mother in her heartache. She runs back to the village where her romance with Jaime was left and now she finds himself confessing to a group of villagers his love for her as she sees him. She then says yes and agrees to marry him after she finds out the truth, but as she runs back home she tells Anna she's leaving and she and Jaime get married but are now lost in a happily ever after. As they come back to the Fortalejo manor, Stella decides to leave the manor to find a job in Taiwan but things are cut short when Alfon traps Anna and Stella. Stella thinks that she is on Alfon's side that is betrayed and later ends up being held hostage calling Jewel into a trap. When she is followed by Lance as she and Jaime arrive to the scene, Anna is begging and so is Stella for Alfon to let go and let them leave. But the plan is cut short as Anna and Stella both find Jewel arrive. Anna is still taken hostage leaving her and Stella. With the help of Lance, Jaime and Marco to the rescue, Margarita leaves Jewel and Stella being held hostage unaware she is also part of the plot. A fight leashes out leaving Jewel in the building with Stella but she gets shot and saves Jewel but. the building starts to burn. And to Margarita's extent, she thinks that her plan to eliminate and get her revenge result her to be successful but turns out as things go good for her, lives are in a living hell with the death of Jewel. Will the truth be prevailed or is there any evidence or hope that Jewel maybe alive after all? At the end, Margarita traps Jewel and plans to bomb the place she is in. But Bernard, Marco, Scarlet, and Nathaniel are there to save her. Suddenly, Margarita finds out that her son is out there because she was watching the surveillance camera. So she let Jewel out and ran for they had very little time until the bomb would burst. After they were all safe, Margarita realized she forgot her important necklace that was the key to all the gold. So she went back to find it, then the bomb burst and she is killed. At her burial, Jewel explained she was pregnant with another baby, Diana found her true love, Marco and Emerald got married, and Nathaniel and Jasmin took care of Jasmin's sister.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n<!--Official cast billing from ABS-CBN.-->\n===Main cast===\n[[Image:Kristine cast.jpg|thumb|300px|The Cast of Precious Hearts Romances Presents: Kristine]]\n*[[Cristine Reyes]]<ref name=\"abs-cbn.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/6753/EXCLUSIVE-Zanjoe-Marudo-is-ready-to-go-sexy-with-Cristine-Reyes-for-their-first-soap.aspx|title=Zanjoe-Marudo-is-ready-to-go|publisher=|access-date=2010-07-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921042744/http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/6753/EXCLUSIVE-Zanjoe-Marudo-is-ready-to-go-sexy-with-Cristine-Reyes-for-their-first-soap.aspx|archive-date=2012-09-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> as Kristine Jewel Fortalejo\n*[[Zanjoe Marudo]]<ref name=\"abs-cbn.com\"/> as Jaime Reyes/Bernard De Silva-Fortalejo\n*[[Denise Laurel]] as Kristine Emerald Fortalejo-De Silva\n*[[Rafael Rosell]] as Marco De Silva\n*[[Rayver Cruz]] as Lance Navarro\n*[[Lito Legaspi]] as Don Leon Fortalejo\n*[[Irma Adlawan]] as Margarita Fortalejo-Cervantes\n*William Lorenzo as Josef Cervantes\n*Angel Jacob as Ana Marie Soriano-Fortalejo\n*Carla Martinez as Julia De Silva\n*[[Eric Fructuoso]] as Alfon De Silva\n\n===Additional cast===\n*Arlene Tolibas as Tekla\n*Bayani Casimiro Jr. as Nonong\n*Elijah Magundayao as Buboy\n*[[JM De Guzman]] as Nathaniel Cervantes\n*[[Bangs Garcia]] as Diana Montero\n*[[Iya Villania]] as Scarlet Saavedra\n*[[Kristel Moreno]] as Jasmin Cuevo\n*[[Neri Naig]] as Rowena Guevarra\n*[[Joross Gamboa]] as Charlie\n*[[Tibo Jumalon]] as Tibo\n*Sharmaine Suarez as Stella Elarmo\n\n===Special participation===\n*[[Chin Chin Gutierrez]] as Kristine Esmeralda Lopez-Fortalejo\n*Johnny Revilla as Ernesto De Silva\n*[[Christian Vasquez]] as Romano Fortalejo\n*[[Wendy Valdez]] as Alicia De Silva\n\n===Guest cast===\n*[[Chinggoy Alonzo]] as Don Cesar Zaragoza\n*Gilette Sandico as Gemma Zaragoza\n*Tanya Gomez as Juaning Reyes\n*Arnold Reyes as Rufo\n*Cai Cortez as Keanna\n*[[Richard Yap]] as Jandy\n*[[Miles Ocampo]] as Maya\n*[[Albie Casi\u00f1o]] as Dominic Ellarmo\n*[[Josef Elizalde]] as Nathaniel's Friend\n*Princess Manzon as Prostitute\n*Cathy Remperas as Prized Girlfriend\n*Kyra Custodio as Young Margarita Fortalejo\n*Marikit Morales as Daisy\n*Mary Roldan as Cora\n*Auriette Divina as Demi Ingrid Alejo\n*[[Gee-Ann Abrahan]] as Ashley\n*Joyce So as Ruby\n*Bam Romana as GBoy\n*[[Kelly Misa]] as Mylene\n*[[Manuel Chua]] as Scarlet's ex-boyfriend\n*Jose Sarasola as Diana's new boyfriend (in a final episode)\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Music===\n* Ngayon At Kailanman - [[Vina Morales]] <small>(Official Theme Song)</small>\n* Hanggang May Kailanman - [[Carol Banawa]]\n* Sakaling Malimutan Ka - [[Carol Banawa]]\n* Di Ko Kayang Limutin - Liezel Garcia\n\n===Launch===\nKristine was launched as one of the ABS-CBN's offerings for the 60th Celebration of Filipino Soap Opera (\"Ika-60 taon ng Pinoy Soap Opera\") during the ABS-CBN Trade Launch for the first quarter of 2010, entitled \"Bagong Simula\" (New Beginning).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbn.com/Headlines/Article/1800/The-biggest-stars-descend-on-Bagong-Simula-the-ABS-CBN-Trade-Show.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305232712/http://www2.abs-cbn.com/headlines/article/1800/the-biggest-stars-descend-on-bagong-simula-the-abs-cbn-trade-show.aspx |archivedate=March 5, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Controversial leave ==\nLead star Denise Laurel, who plays Cristine Reyes' sister Emerald, took an indefinite leave during the season due to constraints regarding some scenes concerning her image.

This gene is also known as KIAA0372, MGC32587 and TPR repeat protein 37.\n\nThis gene is located on the Crick (minus) strand of the long arm of [[chromosome 5]] (5q15). The gene is 91,113 bases in length and encodes a protein of 1564 amino acid residues with twenty tetratricopeptide repeats. It has 43 exons of which exons 1, 2 and 3 are non coding.

(Courtesy of Prof. Michel Peuchmaur, H\u00f4pital Robert Debr\u00e9, Paris, France)]]\n\n===Facial features===\n\nThe typical facial features are low-set ears, prominent eyes with hypertelorism, broad flat nose, prominent forehead and large mouth.\n\n===Liver===\n\nThere may be fibrosis with bile duct proliferation, occasional giant cells and regenerative parenchymal nodules. Siderosis is common.\n\n===Small bowel===\n\n[[Histopathology|Microscopic examination]] of a biopsy of the small bowel in these patients shows [[villous atrophy]] with low or no [[mononuclear leucocyte|mononuclear cell]] infiltration of the [[lamina propria]] nor specific abnormalities involving the [[epithelium]]. The amount of villous atrophy does not explain the severity of the diarrhea.\n\nStudies of enterocyte brush-border ion transporter proteins ([[sodium-hydrogen exchanger]] 2, sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3, [[aquaporin]] 7, [[sodium iodide symporter]] and [[hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase]]) showed reduced expression or mislocalization in all patients with different profiles for each.<ref name=Hartley2010>{{cite journal | author = Hartley JL, Zachos NC, Dawood B, Donowitz M, Forman J, Pollitt RJ, Morgan NV, Tee L, Gissen P, Kahr WH, Knisely AS, Watson S, Chitayat D, Booth IW, Protheroe S, Murphy S, de Vries E, Kelly DA, Maher ER | year = 2010 | title = Mutations in TTC37 cause trichohepatoenteric syndrome (phenotypic diarrhea of infancy) | url = | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 138 | issue = 7| pages = 2388\u20132398 }}</ref>\n\n===Hair===\n\nMicroscopic analysis of the hair shows twisted hairs of unequal size and different shapes (pili torti, aniso- and poikilotrichosis), longitudinal breaks and breaks located at nodes ([[trichorrhexis nodosa]]). [[Scanning electron microscopy]] might reveal hair budding ([[trichorrhexis blastysis]]). Biochemical analysis may reveal sulfur-deficient brittle hair ([[trichothiodystrophy]]; note that [[disulfide bond]]s determine hair waviness).\n\n===Platelets===\n\n[[Platelet]]s may be enlarged. The membrane surface connected canalicular system is disrupted with prominent tubules and small membranous vesicles. Alpha granules may be missing from the platelets. Despite these abnormalities there is no increased tendency to bleed in this syndrome.\n\n===Other===\n\nImmunodeficiency is a consistent feature with low serum concentrations of immunoglobulins which may improve with age and a poor immunological response to childhood vaccination. [[T cell]] dysfunction and abnormal [[antibody]] generation have been reported.\n\n==Treatment==\nNo specific treatment or cure exists. Affected children usually need [[total parenteral nutrition]] through a [[central venous catheter]]. Further worsening of liver damage should however be avoided if possible.

A homolog has been identified in the frog (''[[Xenopus tropicalis]]''), the mouse (''[[Mus musculus]]'') and the rat (''[[Rattus norvegicus]]''). In the mouse this gene is located on chromosome 13.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[Image:Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome (1).jpg|thumb|Microscopic analysis of the hair shaft showing breaks located at nodes in the hair ([[trichorrhexis nodosa]]) and longitudinal breaks.]]\n[[Image:Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome (3).jpg|thumb|[[Small intestine]] [[biopsy]] of a patient with THE syndrome showing severe [[villous atrophy]] with intense [[mononuclear cell infiltration]] in the [[lamina propria]]. (Courtesy of Prof. Michel Peuchmaur, H\u00f4pital Robert Debr\u00e9, Paris, France)]]\n\n===Facial features===\n\nThe typical facial features are low-set ears, prominent eyes with hypertelorism, broad flat nose, prominent forehead and large mouth.\n\n===Liver===\n\nThere may be fibrosis with bile duct proliferation, occasional giant cells and regenerative parenchymal nodules. Siderosis is common.\n\n===Small bowel===\n\n[[Histopathology|Microscopic examination]] of a biopsy of the small bowel in these patients shows [[villous atrophy]] with low or no [[mononuclear leucocyte|mononuclear cell]] infiltration of the [[lamina propria]] nor specific abnormalities involving the [[epithelium]]. The amount of villous atrophy does not explain the severity of the diarrhea.\n\nStudies of enterocyte brush-border ion transporter proteins ([[sodium-hydrogen exchanger]] 2, sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3, [[aquaporin]] 7, [[sodium iodide symporter]] and [[hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase]]) showed reduced expression or mislocalization in all patients with different profiles for each.<ref name=Hartley2010>Hartley JL, Zachos NC, Dawood B, Donowitz M, Forman J, Pollitt RJ, Morgan NV, Tee L, Gissen P, Kahr WH, Knisely AS, Watson S, Chitayat D, Booth IW, Protheroe S, Murphy S, de Vries E, Kelly DA, Maher ER (2010) Mutations in TTC37 cause trichohepatoenteric syndrome (phenotypic diarrhea of infancy). Gastroenterology 138 (7) 2388-2398.e2</ref>\n\n===Hair===\n\nMicroscopic analysis of the hair shows twisted hairs of unequal size and different shapes (pili torti, aniso- and poikilotrichosis), longitudinal breaks and breaks located at nodes ([[trichorrhexis nodosa]]). [[Scanning electron microscopy]] might reveal hair budding ([[trichorrhexis blastysis]]). Biochemical analysis may reveal sulfur-deficient brittle hair ([[trichothiodystrophy]]; note that [[disulfide bond]]s determine hair waviness).\n\n===Platelets===\n\n[[Platelet]]s may be enlarged. The membrane surface connected canalicular system is disrupted with prominent tubules and small membranous vesicles. Alpha granules may be missing from the platelets. Despite these abnormalities there is no increased tendency to bleed in this syndrome.\n\n===Other===\n\nImmunodeficiency is a consistent feature with low serum concentrations of immunoglobulins which may improve with age and a poor immunological response to childhood vaccination. [[T cell]] dysfunction and abnormal [[antibody]] generation have been reported.\n\n==Treatment==\nNo specific treatment or cure exists. Affected children usually need [[total parenteral nutrition]] through a [[central venous catheter]]. Further worsening of liver damage should however be avoided if possible. Diarrhea will likely continue even though food stops passing through the [[gastrointestinal system]].<ref name=\"pmid8021782\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Girault D, Goulet O, Le Deist F, etal |title=Intractable infant diarrhea associated with phenotypic abnormalities and immunodeficiency |journal=J.

She later returned to [[ABS-CBN]] via Budoy.<ref>http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/06/19/11/janice-de-belen-returns-abs-cbn</ref> Currently, she is back with [[ABS-CBN]] to do some television series.\n\n==Early life==\nJanice Catherine Yap de Belen was born on 9 November 1968 to Philip Ilagan de Belen and Cynthia Susan Jimenez Yap. She has a younger sister [[Gelli de Belen|Gelli]] who is also an actress. On March 19, 2016, her mother died at the age of 67 due to heart attack.\n\n==Career==\nAt the age of nine, she became a newscaster for ''[[NewsWatch (Philippine TV program)#NewsWatch Kids Edition|NewsWatch Kids Edition]]''. She got her biggest break from the same channel when she got the lead role in the soap opera ''Flordeluna'' a top-rating and phenomenally successful TV soap where she played Flor from 1979 until 1984, when she momentarily quit showbiz to continue her studies. The soap continued to air a few more years after Janice left but it started going on a downward trend and never regained its popularity. (It was remade by [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]] in 2007 as ''[[Maria Flordeluna]]'' but based it more closely on the original radio serial by Marcos Navarro Sacol; it was well-received as the original show). <br>Janice re-joined showbiz after a short break, returning to TV with the soap \"Jesy\" and the early evening variety show ''The Big, Big Show'' Friday edition on City2 (reverted to BBC-2). She was considered the 80s Teen Drama Princess alongside the late [[Julie Vega]], whose soap \"[[Anna Liza]]\" provided stiff competition to \"Flordeluna.\" The two TV rivals co-starred in a number of '80s movies, mostly produced by Regal Films. In 1982, Janice was partnered with Gabby Concepcion via the movies, \"Puppy Love\" and \"Home Sweet Home\". What started as reel loveteam became real later. Janice was also known for her relationship with Aga Muhlach, which produced a love child, and her tumultuous relationship with now ex-husband [[John Estrada]]. <br>She returned to the world of TV in soap in 1985 with \"Andrea Amor\"  and \"Don Camote dela Mancha\" (produced by Inday Badiday's Loca Productions) both aired over [[GMA Network|GMA 7]]. Her transformation from a teenage star to a serious actress started in 1989 when she topbilled Mina Films' \"Rosenda\" opposite erstwhile boyfriend Gabby Concepcion. But she received her first Best Actress (Raha Sulayman Award) recognition in 1991 over Vision Films' \"Kailan ka Magiging Akin\", a Manila Film Festival entry. In 2001-2010, after her separation from Estrada, she hosted the now defunct popular morning talk show ''[[SiS (TV show)|SiS]]'' also on GMA-7 with sister Gelli De Belen and their friend [[Carmina Villarroel]]. In 2011-2012, she starred and won public admiration anew in the critically acclaimed TV series ''[[Budoy]]''. She followed it up with another noteworthy performance in the teleserye ''[[Ina, Kapatid, Anak (TV series)|Ina, Kapatid, Anak]]'' which aired on the Primetime Bida Block and worldwide through [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]] from 2012\u20132013. She co-hosted ''[[Showbiz Inside Report]]'' as well from February 2012 to October 2013 and until recently, was also doing ''[[The Buzz (talk show)|Buzz ng Bayan]]'' with Boy Abunda. In 2016, she moved back to GMA to appear in ''[[Destined to Be Yours]]'' and ''[[My Korean Jagiya]]''. In 2018, she returned to ABS-CBN and was casted in ''[[The General's Daughter (TV series)|The General's Daughter]]'' and ''[[Sino ang Maysala?: Mea Culpa]]''.\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n| '''Title''' || '''Year'''|| '''Role'''\n|-\n| ''Tropang Bulilit''\n| 1981\n| Flor\n|-\n| ''Mga Basang Sisiw''\n| 1981\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Flor de Liza]]''\n| 1981\n| Flor\n|-\n| ''Manedyer...Si Kumander''\n| 1982\n|\n|-\n| ''Puppy Love''\n| 1982\n| Florecita\n|-\n| ''Where Love Has Gone''\n| 1982\n| Crystal\n|-\n| ''To Mama with Love''\n| 1983\n| Marissa\n|-\n| ''Home Sweet Home''\n| 1983\n|\n|-\n| ''Aking Prince Charming''\n| 1983\n| Neneng\n|-\n| ''Nagalit Ang Buwan Sa Haba ng Gabi''\n| 1983\n|\n|-\n| ''I'll Wait For You: If It Takes Forever!''\n| 1983\n| Jenny\n|-\n| ''Roman Rapido''\n| 1983\n| Corazon\n|-\n| ''Always In My Heart''\n| 1983\n| Gina\n|-\n| ''Erpat Kong Forgets''\n| March 22, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''Hawakan mo at pigilan ang kahapon''\n|1984\n|\n|-\n| ''Dear Mama''\n| May 4, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''Daddy's Little Darlings''\n| June 15, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''Lovingly Yours, Helen: The Movie''\n| July 26, 1984\n| Candy (segment \"Candy\")\n|-\n| ''Bigats''\n| August 17, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''14 Going Steady''\n| September 7, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''May Daga sa Labas ng Lungga''\n| October 11, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Shake, Rattle & Roll (film)|Shake, Rattle & Roll]]''\n| December 25, 1984\n| Virgie (segment \"Pridyider\")\n|-\n| ''Super Wan-Tu-Tri''\n| December 11, 1985\n| Amor\n|-\n| ''Life Begins at 40''\n| February 7, 1985\n|\n|-\n| ''The Crazy Professor''\n| September 4, 1985\n| Katrina\n|-\n| ''Bakit Manipis ang Ulap?''\n| October 17, 1985\n|\n|-\n| ''OKS na OKS Pakner''\n| December 25, 1985\n|\n|-\n| ''Ano Ka, Hilo?''\n| April 24, 1986\n|\n|-\n| ''Super Islaw and the Flying Kids''\n| July 17, 1986\n| Juanita\n|-\n| ''Bakit Madalas ang Tibok ng Puso?''\n| December 11, 1986\n| Anna\n|-\n| ''Nasaan Ka Nang Kailangan Kita?''\n| September 17, 1986\n| Diana\n|-\n| ''Napakasakit, Kuya Eddie''\n| March 20, 1986\n| Sandra\n|-\n| ''When I Fall In Love''\n| March 14, 1986\n|\n|-\n| ''Payaso''\n| December 25, 1986\n|\n|-\n| ''Remember Me Mama''\n| May 14, 1987\n|\n|-\n| ''Menudo't Pandesal''\n| January 15, 1986\n|\n|-\n| ''Once Upon a Time''\n| January 4, 1987\n| Gwen\n|-\n| ''Nasaan Ka Inay?''\n| May 5, 1988\n| Amanda\n|-\n| ''[[Tiyanak (film0|Tiyanak]]''\n| October 27, 1988\n| Julie\n|-\n| ''Hawakan at Pigilan ang Panahon''\n| July 20, 1988\n|\n|-\n| ''Babaing Hampaslupa''\n| November 16, 1988\n| Eden\n|-\n| ''Rosenda''\n| 1989\n| Rosenda\n|-\n| ''Bakit Iisa Lamang ang Puso?''\n| 1989\n|\n|-\n| ''Mahirap ang Magmahal''\n| 1989\n|\n|-\n| ''Isang Araw Walang Diyos''\n| 1989\n| Sis.

She later returned to [[ABS-CBN]] via Budoy.<ref>http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/06/19/11/janice-de-belen-returns-abs-cbn</ref> Currently, she is back with [[ABS-CBN]] to do some television series.\n\n==Early life==\nJanice Catherine Yap de Belen was born on 9 November 1968 to Philip Ilagan de Belen and Cynthia Susan Jimenez Yap. She has a younger sister [[Gelli de Belen|Gelli]] who is also an actress. On March 19, 2016, her mother died at the age of 67 due to heart attack.\n\n==Career==\nAt the age of nine, she became a newscaster for ''[[NewsWatch (Philippine TV program)#NewsWatch Kids Edition|NewsWatch Kids Edition]]''. She got her biggest break from the same channel when she got the lead role in the soap opera ''Flordeluna'' a top-rating and phenomenally successful TV soap where she played Flor from 1979 until 1984, when she momentarily quit showbiz to continue her studies. The soap continued to air a few more years after Janice left but it started going on a downward trend and never regained its popularity. (It was remade by [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]] in 2007 as ''[[Maria Flordeluna]]'' but based it more closely on the original radio serial by Marcos Navarro Sacol; it was well-received as the original show). <br>Janice re-joined showbiz after a short break, returning to TV with the soap \"Jesy\" and the early evening variety show ''The Big, Big Show'' Friday edition on City2 (reverted to BBC-2). She was considered the 80s Teen Drama Princess alongside the late [[Julie Vega]], whose soap \"[[Anna Liza]]\" provided stiff competition to \"Flordeluna.\" The two TV rivals co-starred in a number of '80s movies, mostly produced by Regal Films. In 1982, Janice was partnered with Gabby Concepcion via the movies, \"Puppy Love\" and \"Home Sweet Home\". What started as reel loveteam became real later. Janice was also known for her relationship with Aga Muhlach, which produced a love child, and her tumultuous relationship with now ex-husband [[John Estrada]]. <br>She returned to the world of TV in soap in 1985 with \"Andrea Amor\"  and \"Don Camote dela Mancha\" (produced by Inday Badiday's Loca Productions) both aired over [[GMA Network|GMA 7]]. Her transformation from a teenage star to a serious actress started in 1989 when she topbilled Mina Films' \"Rosenda\" opposite erstwhile boyfriend Gabby Concepcion. But she received her first Best Actress (Raha Sulayman Award) recognition in 1991 over Vision Films' \"Kailan ka Magiging Akin\", a Manila Film Festival entry. In 2001-2010, after her separation from Estrada, she hosted the now defunct popular morning talk show ''[[SiS (TV show)|SiS]]'' also on GMA-7 with sister Gelli De Belen and their friend [[Carmina Villarroel]]. In 2011-2012, she starred and won public admiration anew in the critically acclaimed TV series ''[[Budoy]]''. She followed it up with another noteworthy performance in the teleserye ''[[Ina, Kapatid, Anak]]'' which aired on the Primetime Bida Block and worldwide through [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]] from 2012\u20132013. She co-hosted ''[[Showbiz Inside Report]]'' as well from February 2012 to October 2013 and until recently, was also doing ''[[The Buzz (talk show)|Buzz ng Bayan]]'' with Boy Abunda. In 2016, she moved back to GMA to appear in ''[[Destined to Be Yours]]'' and ''[[My Korean Jagiya]]''. In 2018, she returned to ABS-CBN and was casted in ''[[The General's Daughter (TV series)|The General's Daughter]]'' and ''[[Sino ang Maysala?: Mea Culpa]]''.\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n| '''Title''' || '''Year'''|| '''Role'''\n|-\n| ''Tropang Bulilit''\n| 1981\n| Flor\n|-\n| ''Mga Basang Sisiw''\n| 1981\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Flor de Liza]]''\n| 1981\n| Flor\n|-\n| ''Manedyer...Si Kumander''\n| 1982\n|\n|-\n| ''Puppy Love''\n| 1982\n| Florecita\n|-\n| ''Where Love Has Gone''\n| 1982\n| Crystal\n|-\n| ''To Mama with Love''\n| 1983\n| Marissa\n|-\n| ''Home Sweet Home''\n| 1983\n|\n|-\n| ''Aking Prince Charming''\n| 1983\n| Neneng\n|-\n| ''Nagalit Ang Buwan Sa Haba ng Gabi''\n| 1983\n|\n|-\n| ''I'll Wait For You: If It Takes Forever!''\n| 1983\n| Jenny\n|-\n| ''Roman Rapido''\n| 1983\n| Corazon\n|-\n| ''Always In My Heart''\n| 1983\n| Gina\n|-\n| ''Erpat Kong Forgets''\n| March 22, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''Hawakan mo at pigilan ang kahapon''\n|1984\n|\n|-\n| ''Dear Mama''\n| May 4, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''Daddy's Little Darlings''\n| June 15, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''Lovingly Yours, Helen: The Movie''\n| July 26, 1984\n| Candy (segment \"Candy\")\n|-\n| ''Bigats''\n| August 17, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''14 Going Steady''\n| September 7, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''May Daga sa Labas ng Lungga''\n| October 11, 1984\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Shake, Rattle & Roll (film)|Shake, Rattle & Roll]]''\n| December 25, 1984\n| Virgie (segment \"Pridyider\")\n|-\n| ''Super Wan-Tu-Tri''\n| December 11, 1985\n| Amor\n|-\n| ''Life Begins at 40''\n| February 7, 1985\n|\n|-\n| ''The Crazy Professor''\n| September 4, 1985\n| Katrina\n|-\n| ''Bakit Manipis ang Ulap?''\n| October 17, 1985\n|\n|-\n| ''OKS na OKS Pakner''\n| December 25, 1985\n|\n|-\n| ''Ano Ka, Hilo?''\n| April 24, 1986\n|\n|-\n| ''Super Islaw and the Flying Kids''\n| July 17, 1986\n| Juanita\n|-\n| ''Bakit Madalas ang Tibok ng Puso?''\n| December 11, 1986\n| Anna\n|-\n| ''Nasaan Ka Nang Kailangan Kita?''\n| September 17, 1986\n| Diana\n|-\n| ''Napakasakit, Kuya Eddie''\n| March 20, 1986\n| Sandra\n|-\n| ''When I Fall In Love''\n| March 14, 1986\n|\n|-\n| ''Payaso''\n| December 25, 1986\n|\n|-\n| ''Remember Me Mama''\n| May 14, 1987\n|\n|-\n| ''Menudo't Pandesal''\n| January 15, 1986\n|\n|-\n| ''Once Upon a Time''\n| January 4, 1987\n| Gwen\n|-\n| ''Nasaan Ka Inay?''\n| May 5, 1988\n| Amanda\n|-\n| ''[[Tiyanak (film0|Tiyanak]]''\n| October 27, 1988\n| Julie\n|-\n| ''Hawakan at Pigilan ang Panahon''\n| July 20, 1988\n|\n|-\n| ''Babaing Hampaslupa''\n| November 16, 1988\n| Eden\n|-\n| ''Rosenda''\n| 1989\n| Rosenda\n|-\n| ''Bakit Iisa Lamang ang Puso?''\n| 1989\n|\n|-\n| ''Mahirap ang Magmahal''\n| 1989\n|\n|-\n| ''Isang Araw Walang Diyos''\n| 1989\n| Sis.

There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare.

The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The Commune elections were held on 26 March. They elected a Commune council of 92 members, one member for each 20,000 residents.<ref>Rougerie, Jacques, ''La Commune de Paris''. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France. {{ISBN|978-2-13-062078-5}}.</ref> Despite internal differences, the council began to organise public services. It reached a consensus on certain policies that tended towards a progressive, secular and highly democratic [[social democracy]].\n\nBecause the Commune was able to meet on fewer than 60 days in total, only a few decrees were actually implemented. These included the [[separation of church and state]]; the remission of rents owed for the period of the siege (during which payment had been suspended); the abolition of [[Shift work|night work]] in the hundreds of Paris [[bakeries]]; the granting of pensions to the unmarried companions and children of National Guards killed on active service; and the free return of all workmen's tools and household items valued up to 20 francs that had been pledged during the siege.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre, La Commune\">Milza, Pierre, ''La Commune''.</ref> The Commune was concerned that skilled workers had been forced to pawn their tools during the war; the postponement of commercial [[debt]] obligations and the abolition of interest on the debts; and the [[workers' self-management|right of employees to take over and run an enterprise]] if it were deserted by its owner.

In 1865 and 1866, it held a preliminary conference and had its first congress in [[Geneva]], respectively. Due to their wide variety of philosophies, conflict immediately erupted. The first objections to Marx came from the mutualists who opposed [[state socialism]]. Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into camps headed by Marx and Bakunin.<ref>\"It is unnecessary to repeat the accounts of the Geneva and Hague Congresses of the International in which the issues between Marx and Bakunin were fought out and the organisation itself split apart into the dying Marxist rump centered around the New York General Council and the anti-authoritarian majority centred around the Bakuninist Jura Federation.

Like Proudhonists, they asserted the right of each individual to the product of his labour and to be remunerated for his particular contribution to production. By contrast, [[anarcho-communists]] sought collective ownership of both the means and the products of labour. [[Errico Malatesta]] put it: \"[I]nstead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common.

Revolutionary socialists quickly targeted reformism: [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Social Reform or Revolution]]?'' [[Revolutionary socialism]] encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define \"revolution\" differently. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections, it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels.

He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working to pay their expenses. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in [[Petrograd]], Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers' [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s to take full authority. He issued a [[April Thesis|thesis]] outlining the Bolshevik programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be administered through the soviets.

Major reforms in the Nordic countries are the results of consensus and compromise across the political spectrum. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, key reforms were implemented under social democratic cabinets while in Finland and Iceland centre-right parties dominated during the implementation of the model. Since World War II, Nordic countries have largely maintained a [[Mixed economy#European social democracy|mixed-market economy]].

These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\" [[Benjamin Tucker]].

Some democratic socialists support [[social democracy]] as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences.\n\nThe major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a [[welfare state]] and unemployment insurance as a means to \"humanise\" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to \"humanise\" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |year=2006 |url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labour movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanised, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labour discipline breaks down; etc.)\"</ref>\n\nDemocratic socialism generally refers to any political movement that seeks to establish an economy based on [[economic democracy]] by and for the working class. Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, [[Reformism|reformist]] or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one.<ref>This definition is captured in this statement by [[Anthony Crosland]], who \"argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the [[Marxist]]s, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant\". {{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Pierson |title=Lost property: What the Third Way lacks |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201363 |doi=10.1080/13569310500097265}} Other texts which use the terms \"democratic socialism\" in this way include Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'' (St Martin's Press 1989).</ref>\n\n{{quotation|You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums.

The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup.

He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused and that \"affirming one's difference\" can actually enhance social integration.<ref>[[Charles Fourier]], ''Le Nouveau Monde amoureux'' (written 1816\u201318, not published widely until 1967: Paris: \u00c9ditions Anthropos). pp. 389, 391, 429, 458, 459, 462, and 463.</ref> In [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man Under Socialism]]'', he passionately advocates for an [[egalitarian]] society where wealth is shared by all, while warning of the dangers of social systems that crush individuality. Wilde's [[libertarian socialist]] politics were shared by other figures who actively campaigned for homosexual emancipation in the late 19th century such as [[Edward Carpenter]].<ref>According to his biographer Neil McKenna, Wilde was part of a secret organisation that aimed to legalise homosexuality, and was known among the group as a leader of \"the Cause\".

An important early influence was the thought of the American [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''<ref name=\"Thoreau\">\"Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"La Insumisi\u00f3n voluntaria.

[[Eduard Bernstein]] was a leading [[social democrat]] in Germany who proposed the concept of [[evolutionary socialism]]. Revolutionary socialists quickly targeted reformism: [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Social Reform or Revolution]]?'' [[Revolutionary socialism]] encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define \"revolution\" differently. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections, it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels.

In April of that year, [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|socialists in Russia]] and known for his [[Leninism|profound and controversial expansions]] of [[Marxism]], was allowed to cross Germany to return from exile in Switzerland.\n\nLenin had published [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|essays]] on his analysis of [[Leninism#Imperialism|imperialism]], the monopoly and [[globalisation]] phase of capitalism, as well as analyses on social conditions. He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working to pay their expenses. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in [[Petrograd]], Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers' [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s to take full authority. He issued a [[April Thesis|thesis]] outlining the Bolshevik programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be administered through the soviets. The Bolsheviks became the most influential force. On 7 November, the [[Winter Palace|capitol of the provisional government]] was stormed by [[Red Guards (Russia)|Bolshevik Red Guards]] in what afterwards became known as the [[Great October Socialist Revolution]]. The provisional government ended and the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]]\u2014the world's first constitutionally socialist state\u2014was established.

Influential in these policies was the idea of a \"[[Third Way]]\" which called for a re-evaluation of welfare state policies.<ref>Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 3\u20134, 16.</ref> In 1995, the Labour Party re-defined its stance on socialism by re-wording [[Clause IV]] of its constitution, effectively rejecting socialism by removing all references to public, direct worker or municipal ownership of the means of production. The Labour Party stated: \"The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that, by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create, for each of us, the means to realise our true potential, and, for all of us, a community in which power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |title=Labour Party Clause Four |publisher=Labour.org.uk |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081023/http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |archivedate=11 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary socialist politics ==\n[[File:1989 CPA 6101.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first [[president of Ghana]] and theorist of [[African socialism]], on a [[Soviet Union]] commemorative postage stamp]]\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{main|African socialism}}\nAfrican socialism has been and continues to be a major ideology around the continent.

Essentially he believed Africans were already socialists. Other African socialists include [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. [[Fela Kuti]] was inspired by socialism and called for a democratic African republic. In South Africa the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) abandoned its partial socialist allegiances after taking power and followed a standard neoliberal route. From 2005 through to 2007, the country was wracked by many thousands of protests from poor communities. One of these gave rise to a mass movement of shack dwellers, [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] that despite major police suppression continues to work for popular people's planning and against the creation of a market economy in land and housing.\n\n=== Asia ===\n{{main|Arab socialism|History of the People's Republic of China|Socialist market economy|Socialist-oriented market economy}}\nIn Asia, states with socialist economies\u2014such as the People's Republic of China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam\u2014have largely moved away from centralised economic planning in the 21st century, placing a greater emphasis on markets.

Dismantling the capitalist class leads eventually to a [[classless society]] in which the [[Withering away of the state|state would wither away]]. Marx claimed that socialism was a specific historical phase that would displace capitalism and precede [[communism]]. The major characteristics of socialism (particularly after the [[Paris Commune]]) are that the [[proletariat]] controls the means of production through a [[workers' state]]. Economic activity is organised via incentive systems and social classes still exist, but diminish with time.\n\nOrthodox Marxists see socialism as distributing income based on the principle of \"from each according to his ability, [[to each according to his contribution]]\" while communism is based on the principle of \"[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]\".

In contrast to Marx, Lassalle rejected the concept of the state as a class-based power structure whose main function was to preserve existing class structures. Lassalle also rejected the Marxist view that the state would \"wither away\". Lassalle considered the state to be an entity independent of class allegiances and an instrument of justice that was essential for achieving socialism.{{sfn|Berlau|1949|p=21}}\n\nPreceding the [[Russian Revolution]], socialists including [[reformists]], [[orthodox Marxist]] currents such as [[council communism]], [[anarchists]] and [[libertarian socialists]] criticised the idea of using the state to conduct central planning and own the means of production as a way to establish socialism.

But with the victory of Leninism in Russia, all dissent was silenced, and socialism became identified with 'democratic centralism', 'central planning', and State ownership of the means of production. |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/0199279144.001.0001|isbn=978-0-19-927914-2|p=295|ref=p. 295}}</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Schumpeter]] rejected the association of socialism with state ownership because the state is a product of capitalist society and cannot be transplanted to a different institutional framework. Schumpeter argued that socialism would adopt different institutions, just as [[feudalism]] had its own distinct institutional forms. The state, along with concepts like [[Private property|property]] and [[taxation]], were concepts exclusive to capitalism.

Typically it refers to a form of technocratic management, whereby technical specialists administer or manage economic enterprises on behalf of society (and the public interest) instead of workers' councils or workplace democracy.\n\nA state-directed economy may refer to a type of mixed economy consisting of public ownership over large industries, as promoted by various Social democratic political parties during the 20th century. This ideology influenced the policies of the British Labour Party during Clement Attlee's administration. In the biography of the 1945 United Kingdom Labour Party Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]], [[Francis Beckett]] states: \"[T]he government... wanted what would become known as a mixed economy\".<ref>Beckett, Francis, ''Clem Attlee'', (2007) Politico's.</ref>\n\nNationalisation in the United Kingdom was achieved through compulsory purchase of the industry (i.e. with compensation).

Socialism, in Walras's view, entailed state ownership of land and natural resources and the abolition of income taxes. As owner of land and natural resources, the state could then lease these resources to many individuals and groups, which would eliminate monopolies and thus enable free competition. The leasing of land and natural resources would also provide enough state revenue to make income taxes unnecessary, allowing a worker to invest his savings and become 'an owner or capitalist at the same time that he remains a worker.}}</ref> Yugoslavia implemented a market socialist economy based on cooperatives and worker self-management.\n\n[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], main theorist of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and influential French socialist thinker]]\n[[Mutualism (economy)|Mutualism]] is an [[Economics|economic theory]] and [[anarchist school of thought]] that advocates a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labour in the [[free market]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutualist.org/ |title=Introduction |publisher=Mutualist.org |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.

Some democratic socialists support [[social democracy]] as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences.\n\nThe major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a [[welfare state]] and unemployment insurance as a means to \"humanise\" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to \"humanise\" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |year=2006 |url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance.

The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup.

De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural.
