The [[M60 motorway|M60]] is an [[orbital motorway]] circling Greater Manchester with access gained via junction 22. The motorway's completion in the Failsworth area around 1995\u20132000 saw the installation of a huge graded junction amongst other notable changes to the A62 and the implementation of the motorway itself, meaning a large proportion of rows of buildings around the junction that ran down the A62 were demolished.\n\nThere are frequent buses running through Failsworth between [[Manchester city centre]] and Oldham on [[First Greater Manchester]]'s 83 overground service. There is also a frequent service running to Manchester city centre and to [[Huddersfield]]/[[Saddleworth]] via Oldham with services 180 and 184. Other destinations which can be reached from Failsworth on the bus are [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], [[Chadderton]], Huddersfield, [[Rochdale]], [[Royton]], Saddleworth and [[Shaw and Crompton]].\n\n[[Failsworth tram stop]], located on Hardman Lane, is on Manchester's [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] network.

After [[Europe]]an settlements had been made to the south and north, the colonial [[Province of Maryland]] was granted by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to Sir [[George Calvert]] (1579\u20131632), his former Secretary of State in 1632, for settlement beginning in March 1634. It was notable for having been established with religious freedom for [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], since Calvert had publicly converted to that faith.<ref>Greenwell, Megan. \"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/15/AR2008081504104.html Religious Freedom Byway Would Recognize Maryland's Historic Role]\", ''Washington Post'', August 21, 2008.</ref><ref>Calvert, Cecilius. \"Instructions to the Colonists by Lord Baltimore, (1633)\", ''Narratives of Early Maryland, 1633\u20131684'' (Clayton Coleman Hall, ed.), (NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1910), 11\u201323.</ref><ref name=\"stmaryscity.org\">{{cite web|url=https://stmaryscity.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Chapel-Reconstruction.pdf|title=Reconstructing the Brick Chapel of 1667|page=1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313133644/http://www.stmaryscity.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Chapel-Reconstruction.pdf|archive-date=March 13, 2014|access-date=December 10, 2015}}</ref> Like other colonies and settlements of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region, its economy was soon based on [[tobacco]] as a commodity crop, highly prized among the English, cultivated primarily by [[Africa]]n [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor, although many young people came from [[Great Britain|Britain]] sent as [[indentured servants]] or criminal prisoners in the early years.\n\nIn 1781, during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), Maryland became the seventh state of the [[United States]] to ratify the [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]].  They were drawn up by a committee of the [[Second Continental Congress]] (1775\u20131781), which began shortly after the adoption of a [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in July 1776, through to 1778. Later that year, these Articles were recommended to the newly independent sovereign states via their legislatures for the required unanimous ratification. This long process was held up for three years by objections from smaller states led by Maryland until certain issues and principles over the western lands beyond  the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]]. These objections were resolved with the larger states agreeing to cede their various western claims to the authority of the new [[Congress of the Confederation]], representing all the states, to be held in common for the laying out and erection of new states out of the jointly held Federal territories. Maryland then finally agreed to join the new American confederation by being one of the last of the former colonies ratifying the long proposed Articles in 1781, when they took effect.\n\nLater that same decade, Maryland became the seventh state to ratify the stronger government structure proposed in the new [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] in 1788.\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, numerous Maryland planters freed their slaves as the economy changed. [[Baltimore]] grew to become one of the largest cities on the eastern seaboard, and a major economic force in the country. Although Maryland was still a [[slave state]] in 1860, by that time nearly half of [[African Americans in Maryland|the African American population]] was already free, due mostly to [[manumission]]s after the [[American Revolution]].<ref name=\"Peter Kolchin 1993, pp.81\u201382\">Kolchin, Peter. ''American Slavery: 1619\u20131877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 81\u201382</ref> Baltimore had the highest number of free people of color of any city in the United States. Maryland was among the four divided border states that officially remained in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), although large numbers of Marylanders \"went south\" to fight for the seceded [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].\n\n==Pre-colonial history==\n{{See also|Pre-Colonial America}}\n{{History of Maryland}}\nIt appears that the first humans in the area that would become Maryland arrived around the [[tenth millennium BC]], about the time that the [[last glacial period|last ice age]] ended. They were [[hunter-gatherer]]s organized into semi-nomadic bands. They adapted as the region's environment changed, developing the spear for hunting as smaller animals, like [[deer]], became more prevalent. By about 1500 BC, oysters had become an important food resource in the region. With the increased variety of food sources, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] villages and settlements started appearing and their social structures increased in complexity. By about 1000 BC, pottery was being produced. With the eventual rise of [[agriculture]], more permanent Native-American villages were built. But even with the advent of farming, hunting and fishing were still important means of obtaining food. The [[bow and arrow]] were first used for hunting in the area around the year 800. They ate what they could kill, grow or catch in the rivers and other waterways.\n\n[[File:Native Languages of Maryland.svg|thumb|left|Some of the historical Native languages of Maryland]]\nBy 1000 AD, there were about 8,000 Native Americans, all [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking, living in what is now the state, in 40 different villages. By the 17th century, the state was populated by a mix of Iroquoian and Algonquian peoples. These were the [[Susquehannocks]] (west of the Delaware River), the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] and [[Tockwogh]] (on the Delmarva Peninsula between the Delaware and Indian Rivers), the [[Piscataway people|Piscataway]] (surrounding the Potomac River from Washington D.C. south) and the [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]] (Delmarva Peninsula, south of the Indian River). John Smith labelled the Tuscarora as the Kuskarawock on an early map from 1606, but they shortly thereafter moved west to join the Meherrin and Nottoway in Virginia.<ref>See [[commons:File:Capt John Smith's map of Virginia 1624.jpg|John Smith's map of Virginia]] on Wikimedia Commons.</ref> Meanwhile, the Tockwogh may have moved to New York and/or been given refuge by the Susquehannock. They are noted as the Akhrakovaetonon and Trakwaerronnons, which seems similar to Tockwogh. They were extinct as a people by the end of the 17th century, however.<ref>John Steckley, \"[http://www.ontarioarchaeology.wildapricot.org/Resources/Publications/oa51-2-steckley.pdf The Early Map \"Novvelle France\": A Linguistic Analysis]\", ''Ontario Archaeology'' 51, 1990.</ref>\n\nThe following [[Piscataway Indian Nation|Piscataway tribes]] lived on the eastern bank of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], from south to north: [[Yaocomico]]es, Chopticans, [[Nanjemoy]]s, [[Potopac]]s, [[Mattawoman]]s, [[Piscataway tribe|Piscataways]], [[Patuxent people|Patuxents]], and [[Nacotchtank]]s. The area in which the Nacotchtank lived is now the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. On the west bank of the Potomac river in what is now [[Virginia]] were the related tribes of the [[Patawomeck]] and the [[Doeg tribe|Doeg]]. Further west in the [[Appalachian Mountains]], the [[Shawnee]] lived near [[Oldtown, Maryland|Oldtown]] at a site abandoned around 1731. On the Eastern Shore of the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]], from south to north, there were the [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]] tribes: [[Pocomoke people|Annemessex]], [[Assateague people|Assateagues]], [[Wicocomico|Wicomicoes]], [[Nanticoke people|Nanticokes]], [[Chicacone]], and, on the north bank of the [[Choptank River]], the [[Choptank people|Choptanks]]. The [[Tockwogh tribe]] lived near the headwaters of the Chesapeake near what is now [[Delaware]].<ref>{{Cite news | first=Patrick M. | last=Reynolds | title=Flashback column:The Tribes of Maryland | url=| work=Washington Post | location=Washington, DC | pages= SC9 | date=April 11, 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> They were driven further north by enemies and eventually broke apart, with some staying in the region, others merging with the Nanticoke and others, known as the Conoy, migrated west into West Virginia.<ref>John Heckewelder (Loskiel): Conoys, Ganawese, etc. explains Charles A. Hanna (Vol II, 1911:96, Ganeiens-gaa, Margry, i., 529; ii., 142\u201343,) using La Salle's letter of August 22, 1681 Fort Saint Louis (Illinois) mentioning \"Ohio tribes\" for extrapolation.</ref> Some appeared around the end of the 18th century at Fort Detroit in Michigan.\n\n[[File:Capt John Smith's map of Virginia 1624.jpg|thumb|405px|John Smith's map of the Chesapeake area]]\n\nWhen Europeans began to settle in Maryland in the early 17th century, the main tribes included the Nanticoke on the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], and the Iroquoian speaking [[Susquehannock]]. Early exposure to new European diseases brought widespread fatalities to the Native Americans, as they had no immunity to them. Communities were disrupted by such losses. Furthermore, The Susquehannock, already incorrectly considered savages and cannibals by the first Spanish explorers, made massive moves to control local trade with the first Swedish, Dutch and English settlers of the Chesapeake Bay region. As the century wore on, the Susquehannock would be caught up in the [[Beaver Wars]], a war with the neighboring [[Lenape]], a war with the Dutch, a war with the English, and a series of wars with the colonial government of Maryland. Due to colonial land claims, the exact territory of the Susquehannock was originally limited to the territory immediately surrounding the Susquehanna River, however archaeology has discovered settlements of theirs dating to the 14th and 15th centuries around the Maryland-West Virginia border, and beyond. It could generally be assumed that most of Maryland's southern border is based on the borders of their own land. All of these wars, coupled with disease, destroyed the tribe and the last of their people were offered refuge from the Iroquois Confederacy to the north shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cecildaily.com/our_cecil/article_75360102-240f-504b-97ae-d7ad37878cb4.html |title=Susquehannocks \u2013 The vanquished tribe &#124; Our Cecil |publisher=cecildaily.com |date=May 17, 2014 |access-date=July 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe closest living language to them are the languages of the Mohawk and Tuscarora Iroquois, who once lived immediately north and south of them. The English and Dutch came to call them the Minqua, from Lenape, which breaks into min-kwe and translates to \"as a woman.\" As to when they arrived, some early records detailing their oral history seem to point to the fact that they descended from an Iroquoian group who conquered Ohio centuries before, but were pushed back east again by Siouan and Algonquin enemies. They also conquered and absorbed other unknown groups in the process, which probably explains how languages like Tuscarora came to be so completely divergent from other Iroquoian languages.

Such punishment persisted until the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].\n\nThe [[Maryland Toleration Act]], issued in 1649, was one of the first laws that explicitly defined tolerance of varieties of Christianity.\n\nSt. Mary's City was the largest settlement in Maryland and the seat of colonial government until 1695. Because [[Anglicanism]] had become the official religion in Virginia, a band of [[Puritan]]s in 1642 left for Maryland; they founded Providence (now called [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]).<ref>Owen M.

St. Mary's City is now an archaeological site, with a small tourist center.\n\n===City planning===\nJust as the city plan for St. Mary's City reflected the ideals of the founders, the city plan of Annapolis reflected those in power at the turn of the 18th century. The plan of Annapolis extends from two circles at the center of the city&nbsp;\u2013 one including the [[Maryland State House|State House]] and the other the established Anglican [[St. Anne's Church (Annapolis, Maryland)|St. Anne's Church]] (now [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]]). The plan reflected a stronger relationship between church and state, and a colonial government more closely aligned with Protestant churches. General British policy regarding immigration to all [[British America]] would be reflected broadly in the [[Plantation Act 1740|Plantation Act]] of 1740.\n\n[[File: Tobacco cultivation (Virginia, ca. 1670).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Tobacco was the main export crop in the colonial era; it involved a great deal of hand labor, usually done by enslaved Africans, as shown here in a 1670 painting from Virginia]]\n\n===Mason\u2013Dixon Line===\nBased on an incorrect map, the original royal charter granted to Maryland the [[Potomac River]] and territory northward to the [[40th parallel north|fortieth parallel]]. This was found to be a problem, as the northern boundary would have put [[Philadelphia]], the major city in [[Pennsylvania]], within Maryland. The [[Baron Baltimore|Calvert family]], which controlled Maryland, and the [[William Penn|Penn family]], which controlled Pennsylvania, decided in 1750 to engage two surveyors, [[Charles Mason]] and [[Jeremiah Dixon]], to establish a boundary between the colonies.\n\nThey surveyed what became known as the [[Mason\u2013Dixon Line]], which became the boundary between the two colonies. The crests of the Penn family and of the Calvert family were put at the Mason\u2013Dixon line to mark it.\n\n===Horse racing and gentry values===\nIn Chesapeake society (that is, colonial Virginia and Maryland) sports occupied a great deal of attention at every social level. [[Horse racing]] was sponsored by the wealthy gentry plantation owners, and attracted ordinary farmers as spectators and gamblers. Selected slaves often became skilled horse trainers.  Horse racing was especially important for knitting the gentry together. The race was a major public event designed to demonstrate to the world the superior social status of the gentry through expensive breeding and training of horses, boasting and gambling, and especially winning the races themselves.<ref>Nancy L.

During this initial phase of the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary period]], Maryland was governed by a series of conventions of the [[Annapolis Convention (1774\u20131776)|Assembly of Freemen]]. The first convention of the Assembly lasted four days, from June 22 to 25, 1774. All sixteen [[County (United States)|counties]] then existing were represented by a total of 92 members; [[Matthew Tilghman]] was elected chairman.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Johnson (governor).jpeg|left|thumb|[[Thomas Johnson (jurist)|Thomas Johnson]], Maryland's first elected governor under its [[Maryland Constitution of 1776|1776 Constitution]]]]\n\nThe eighth session decided that the continuation of an ad-hoc government by the convention was not a good mechanism for all the concerns of the province. A more permanent and structured government was needed. So, on July 3, 1776, they resolved that a new convention be elected that would be responsible for drawing up their first [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]], one that did not refer to parliament or the king, but would be a government \"...of the people only.\" After they set dates and prepared notices to the counties they adjourned. On August 1, all freemen with property elected delegates for the last convention. The ninth and last convention was also known as the [[List of delegates to the Maryland Constitutional Convention (1776)|Constitutional Convention of 1776]]. They drafted a constitution, and when they adjourned on November 11, they would not meet again. The conventions were replaced by the new state government which the [[Maryland Constitution of 1776]] had established. [[Thomas Johnson (jurist)|Thomas Johnson]] became the state's first elected governor.\n\nOn March 1, 1781, the [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]] was ratified and took effect with the confirmation signing of the Articles by two Maryland delegates in Philadelphia. The articles had initially been submitted to the states on November 17, 1777, but the ratification process dragged on for several years, stalled by an interstate quarrel over claims to uncolonized land in the west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]]. Maryland was the last hold-out; it refused to ratify until larger states like [[Virginia]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] agreed to rescind their claims to lands in what became the old [[Northwest Territory]] and the Southwest Territory. [[Anne-C\u00e9sar, Chevalier de la Luzerne|Chevalier de La Luzerne]], French [[Diplomatic rank|Minister]] to the United States, felt that the Articles would help strengthen the American government. In 1780 when Maryland requested France provide naval forces in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] for protection from the British (who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay), he indicated that French Admiral [[Charles Ren\u00e9 Dominique Sochet, Chevalier Destouches|Destouches]] would do what he could but La Luzerne also \"sharply pressed\" Maryland to ratify the Articles, thus suggesting the two issues were related.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sioussat |first= St. George L.|date= October 1936 |title= THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE AND THE RATIFICATION OF THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION BY MARYLAND, 1780-1781 With Accompanying Documents|url= https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/view/28432/28188 |journal= The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography |volume= 60|issue= 4|pages= 391\u2013418 |access-date= 19 April 2018}}</ref> On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the [[Maryland General Assembly]] in Annapolis.<ref name=\"lawsofmaryland\">{{cite web |date= February 2, 1781 |work= Laws of Maryland, 1781 |url= http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |title= An ACT to empower the delegates |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723015508/http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |archivedate= July 23, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, \"among engrossed Bills\" was \"signed and sealed by Governor [[Thomas Sim Lee]] in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation\" and perpetual union among the states.

It was also there that the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1783, which ended the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], was ratified by Congress on January 14, 1784.\n\nMajor General William Smallwood, having served under General George Washington during the Revolutionary War, then Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, became the fourth American Governor of Maryland. In 1787, Governor William Smallwood called together and convened the state convention which adopted the new U.S. Constitution in 1788, becoming the seventh state to ratify the Constitution. This made Governor Smallwood, an American Major General of the Revolutionary War, the first Governor of Maryland under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n==Maryland, 1789\u20131849==\n{{Further|History of the United States (1789\u20131849)}}\n\n===Economic development===\nThe American Revolution stimulated the domestic market for wheat and iron ore, and flour milling increased in Baltimore. Iron ore transport greatly boosted the local economy. By 1800 Baltimore had become one of the major cities of the new republic. The British naval blockade during the War of 1812 hurt Baltimore's shipping, but also freed merchants and traders from British debts, which along with the capture of British merchant vessels furthered the city's economic growth.\n\n====Transportation initiatives====\nThe city had a deepwater port. In the early 19th century, many business leaders in Maryland were looking inland, toward the western frontier, for economic growth potential. The challenge was to devise a reliable means to transport goods and people. The [[National Road]] and private [[Toll road|turnpikes]] were being completed throughout the state, but additional routes and capacity were needed. Following the success of the [[Erie Canal]] (constructed 1817\u201325) and similar canals in the northeastern states, leaders in Maryland were also developing plans for canals. After several failed canal projects in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area, the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] (C&O) began construction there in 1828. The Baltimore business community viewed this project as a competitive threat. The geography of the Baltimore area made building a similar canal to the west impractical, but the idea of constructing railroads was beginning to gather support in the 1820s.\n\nIn 1827 city leaders obtained a charter from the [[Maryland General Assembly]] to build a railroad to the [[Ohio River]].<ref name=\"Stover\">{{cite book | last = Stover | first = John F. | title = History of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad | publisher = Purdue University Press | year = 1987 | location = West Lafayette, IN | isbn = 0-911198-81-4}}</ref>{{rp|17}} The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) became the first chartered railroad in the United States, and opened its first section of track for regular operation in 1830, between Baltimore and [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott City]].<ref name=\"Dilts\">{{cite book |title=The Great Road: The Building of the Baltimore and Ohio, the Nation's First Railroad, 1828\u20131853 |last=Dilts |first=James D. |year=1993 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Palo Alto, CA |isbn=0-8047-2235-8}}</ref>{{rp|80}} It became the first company to operate a [[steam locomotive|locomotive]] built in America, with the ''[[Tom Thumb (locomotive)|Tom Thumb]].''<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Holland |authorlink= |title=The Age of Invention: A Chronicle of Mechanical Conquest |series= Chronicles of America Series, Vol. 37 |year=1921 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |isbn= |pages=80\u201381|oclc=3616164 }}</ref> The B&O built a branch line to Washington, D.C. in 1835.<ref name=\"Dilts\"/>{{rp|184}} The main line west reached [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]] in 1842, beating the C&O Canal there by eight years, and the railroad continued building westward.<ref name=\"Stover\"/>{{rp|54}} In 1852 it became the first rail line to reach the Ohio River from the eastern seaboard.<ref name=\"Stover\"/>{{rp|18}} Other railroads were built in and through Baltimore by mid-century, most significantly the [[Northern Central Railway|Northern Central]]; the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad|Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore]]; and the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad|Baltimore and Potomac]].

The first was the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] on August 24, 1814, just outside the national capital, [[Washington, D.C.]] The British army routed the American militiamen, who fled in confusion, and went on to capture Washington, D.C. They [[Burning of Washington|burned and looted]] major public buildings, forcing President [[James Madison]] to flee to [[Brookeville, Maryland]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe British next marched to [[Baltimore]], where they hoped to strike a knockout blow against the demoralized Americans. Baltimore was not only a busy port but also suspected of harboring many of the [[privateer]]s despoiling British ships. The city's defenses were under the command of Major General [[Samuel Smith (Maryland)|Samuel Smith]], an officer and commander of the Maryland state militia and a [[United States Senator]]. Baltimore had been well fortified with excellent supplies and some 15,000 troops. Maryland militia fought a determined delaying action at the [[Battle of North Point]], during which a Maryland militia marksman shot and killed the British commander, Major General [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]]. The battle bought enough time for Baltimore's defenses to be strengthened.\n\nAfter advancing to the edge of American defenses, the British halted their advance and withdrew. With the failure of the land advance, the sea battle became irrelevant and the British retreated.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:bombardment2.jpg|200px|thumb|right|An artist's rendering of the battle at [[Fort McHenry]].]] -->\n\nAt [[Fort McHenry]], some 1000 soldiers under the command of Major [[George Armistead]] awaited the British naval bombardment. Their defense was augmented by the sinking of a line of American merchant ships at the adjacent entrance to Baltimore Harbor in order to thwart passage of British ships. The attack began on the morning of September 13, as the British fleet of some nineteen ships began pounding the fort with rockets and mortar shells. After an initial exchange of fire, the British fleet withdrew just beyond the {{convert|1.5|mi}} range of Fort McHenry's cannons. For the next 25 hours, they bombarded the outmanned Americans. On the morning of September 14, an oversized [[Star-Spangled Banner Flag|American flag]], which had been raised before daybreak, flew over Fort McHenry. The British knew that victory had eluded them. The bombardment of the fort inspired [[Francis Scott Key]] of [[Frederick, Maryland]] to write \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" as witness to the assault. It later became the country's [[national anthem]].\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Maryland in the Civil War==\n{{Main|Maryland in the American Civil War}}\n''See also: [[American Civil War]], [[Origins of the American Civil War]] and [[History of slavery in Maryland]]''\n\n===Maryland's mixed sympathies===\n[[File:Balt.

As in [[Virginia]] and [[Delaware]], some planters in Maryland had freed their slaves in the years after the Revolutionary War. By 1860 Maryland's [[free black]] population comprised 49.1% of the total of African Americans in the state.<ref name=\"Peter Kolchin 1993, pp.81\u201382\"/>\n\nAfter [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s raid in 1859 on [[Harper's Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry, Virginia]], some citizens in slaveholding areas began forming local [[militia]]s for defense. Of the 1860 population of 687,000, about 60,000 men joined the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and about 25,000 fought for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The political alignments of each group generally reflected their economic interests, with slaveholders and people involved in trade with the South most likely to favor the Confederate cause, and small farmers and merchants outside the major cities and in western Maryland allied with the Union. In the 1860 election, Lincoln received only one vote in [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], a center of large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cleveland|first=J.

After that, Baltimore Mayor [[George William Brown]], Marshal [[George P. Kane]], and former Governor [[Enoch Louis Lowe]] requested that Maryland Governor [[Thomas H. Hicks]], a slave owner from the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], burn the railroad bridges and cut the [[telegraph line]]s leading to Baltimore to prevent further troops from entering the state. Hicks reportedly approved this proposal. These actions were addressed in the famous federal court case of ''[[Ex parte Merryman]]''.\n\nMaryland remained part of the Union during the Civil War. President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s strong hand suppressing violence and dissent in Maryland and the belated assistance of Governor Hicks played important roles. Hicks worked with federal officials to stop further violence.\n\nLincoln promised to avoid having Northern defenders march through Baltimore while en route to protect the acutely endangered federal capital. The majority of forces took a slow route by boat. Massachusetts militia general [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] used the water route after learning about the troubles in Baltimore. He commandeered the P. W. & B. Railroad ferryboat ''Harriet Lane''  at the [[Susquehanna River]] crossing between [[Perryville, Maryland|Perryville]] in [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]] to [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]] in [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]]. Avoiding the riotous city, he steamed down the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to anchor at night off the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]] at Severn Point in Annapolis.\n\nHe landed his troops of Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island militia over the protests of Governor [[Thomas Holliday Hicks]] (1798\u20131865). He put some on the old Navy training ship frigate, ''[[USS Constitution]]'' (\"Old Ironsides\") and moved it off shore beyond reach of easy attack. Recruiting some railroad workers and boilermakers among his soldiers, Butler had them rescue a small yard locomotive in the trainyards and use it to take cars full of soldiers up the Annapolis Line of the B&O Railroad to Relay Junction near Ellicott City, where it joined the [[Old Main Line Subdivision|Main Line]] going west to [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]] or south to Washington. The Northern regiments used this route to reach the train station (now [[Union Station (Washington, DC)|Union Station]] near the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]]). They camped that evening in the Rotunda, which was not yet completed. An additional unit was sent up [[Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site|Pennsylvania Avenue]] to reinforce the [[White House]], where the President greeted them with relief.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nMarylanders sympathetic to the South easily crossed the [[Potomac River]] to join and fight for the Confederacy. Exiles organized a \"Maryland Line\" in the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] which consisted of one [[infantry]] regiment, one infantry battalion, two [[cavalry]] battalions and four battalions of [[artillery]]. According to the best extant records, up to 25,000 Marylanders went south to fight for the Confederacy. About 60,000 Maryland men served in all branches of the Union military. Many of the Union troops were said to enlist on the promise of home garrison duty.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nMaryland's naval contribution, the relatively new sloop-of-war [[USS Constellation (1854)|USS ''Constellation'']] was flagship of the US [[Africa Squadron]] from 1859 to 1861 and continued in this role during the war. In this period, she disrupted the [[African slave trade]] by interdicting three slave ships and releasing the imprisoned slaves. The last of the ships was captured at the outbreak of the Civil War: ''Constellation'' overpowered the slaver brig ''Triton'' in African coastal waters. ''Constellation'' spent much of the war as a deterrent to Confederate cruisers and commerce raiders in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].\n\n===Occupation of Baltimore===\n\nA Union artillery garrison was placed on [[Federal Hill, Baltimore|Federal Hill]] with express orders to destroy the city should Southern sympathizers overwhelm law and order there.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nevins |first=Allan |authorlink= |title=The War for the Union: The Improvised War, 1861\u20131862 |url=https://archive.org/details/warforunionvol202nevi|url-access=registration |accessdate= |year=1959 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |location=New York |isbn= |page=[https://archive.org/details/warforunionvol202nevi/page/87 87]}}</ref> Following the riot of 1861, Union troops under the command of General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F.

Their goal was to guarantee the allegiance of the city and the state of Maryland to the federal government under threat of force. This fort and the Union occupation persisted for the duration of the Civil War. A large flag, a few cannon, and a small [[Grand Army of the Republic]] monument remain to testify to this period of the hill's history.\n[[File:John Pendleton Kennedy, politician, author.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pendleton Kennedy]], politician, author. Kennedy played a major role in bringing an end to slavery in Maryland. ''1850 photograph.'']]\nBecause Maryland remained in the Union, it fell outside the scope of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. A constitutional convention  in 1864 culminated in the passage of [[Maryland Constitution of 1864|a new state constitution]] on November 1 of that year. Article 24 of that document outlawed the practice of slavery. A campaign by state politician [[John Pendleton Kennedy]] and others ensured that abolishment of slavery would be in the new document, and the issue was hotly contested for nearly a year throughout the state. In the end the elimination of slavery was approved by a 1,000-vote margin. The right to vote was extended to non-white males in the [[Maryland Constitution of 1867]], which is still in effect today.\n\n===The war on Maryland soil===\n{{See also|American Civil War#Eastern Theater 1861.26ndash.3B1863|l1=American Civil War: Eastern Theater 1861\u20131863}}\n[[File:Battle of Antietam2.jpg|thumb|300px|''Battle of Antietam'' by Kurz and Allison]]\nThe largest and most significant battle fought in the state was the [[Battle of Antietam]], fought on September 17, 1862, near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]]. The battle was the culmination of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Maryland Campaign]], which aimed to secure new supplies, recruit fresh men from among the considerable pockets of Confederate sympathies in Maryland, and to impact public opinion in the North. With those goals, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, consisting of about 40,000 men, had entered Maryland following their recent victory at [[Second Bull Run]].\n\nWhile Major General [[George B. McClellan]]'s 87,000-man [[Army of the Potomac]] was moving to intercept Lee, a [[Union Army|Union]] soldier discovered a mislaid copy of the detailed battle plans of Lee's army. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically (to [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]], and [[Hagerstown, Maryland]]), thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail if McClellan could move quickly enough. McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence and position his forces based on it, thus endangering a golden opportunity to defeat Lee decisively.\n\n[[File:Bodies on the battlefield at antietam.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Dead Confederate soldiers from Starke's Louisiana Brigade, on the Hagerstown Turnpike, north of the Dunker Church]]\n\nThe armies met near the town of Sharpsburg by [[Antietam Creek]]. Although McClellan arrived in the area on September 16, his trademark caution delayed his attack on Lee, which gave the Confederates more time to prepare defensive positions and allowed [[James Longstreet|Longstreet's]] corps to arrive from Hagerstown and [[Stonewall Jackson|Jackson's]] corps, minus [[A. P. Hill]]'s division, to arrive from Harpers Ferry. McClellan's two-to-one advantage in the battle was almost completely nullified by a lack of coordination and concentration of Union forces, which allowed Lee to shift his defensive forces to parry each thrust.\n\n[[File:Bloodylane.JPG|thumb|[[Antietam National Battlefield]] today]]\nAlthough a tactical draw, the Battle of Antietam was considered a strategic Union victory and a [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]] of the war. It forced the end of Lee's invasion of the North. It also was enough of a victory to enable President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect on January 1, 1863. He had been advised by his Cabinet to make the announcement after a Union victory, to avoid any perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union's winning the Battle of Antietam also may have dissuaded the governments of [[Second French Empire|France]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] from recognizing the Confederacy. Some observers believed they may have done so in the aftermath of another Union defeat.\n\n==1865\u20131920==\n===Post-Civil War political developments===\nSince Maryland had remained in the Union during the Civil War, the state was not covered by the [[Reconstruction Act]], as were states of the former Confederacy. After the war, many white Maryland residents struggled to re-establish [[white supremacy]] over [[freedmen]] and formerly free blacks, and racial tensions rose. There were deep divisions in the state between those who fought for the North and those who fought for the South.\n\n[[File:Thomas Swann of Maryland - photo portrait seated.jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[Thomas Swann]], the only [[Governor of Maryland]] elected under the state's [[Maryland Constitution of 1864|1864 constitution]]]]\n\nIn the late 1860s, the whites of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] rapidly regained power in the state and replaced [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] who had been elected or appointed during the war. Support for the Constitution of 1864 ended, and Democrats replaced it with the [[Maryland Constitution of 1867]]. That document, which is still in effect today, resembled the 1851 constitution more than its immediate predecessor and was approved by 54.1% of the state's population. It provided for the [[reapportionment]] of the legislature based on population, not counties, which gave greater political power to more dense urban areas (and, by extension, to [[freedmen]]), but the new constitution deprived African Americans of some of the protections of the 1864 document.<!--Why be coy? Explain what these are-->\n\n[[File:Austin Lane Crothers, photograph of head with top hat.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Austin Lane Crothers]], the 46th Governor, supported the disfranchisement of black voters and poor whites]]\n\nIn 1896, a biracial Republican coalition gained election of [[Lloyd Lowndes, Jr.]] as governor, and also achieved election of some Republican congressmen, including [[Sydney Emanuel Mudd I|Sydney Emanuel Mudd]], after Democratic dominance.<ref name=\"tuck\"/> Over the next several decades, the African-American population struggled in a discriminatory environment. The Democrat-dominated legislature tried to pass disfranchising bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911, but was rebuffed on each occasion, in large part because of black opposition and strength. Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and had established themselves in several cities, where they had comparative security. In addition, immigrants comprised 15% of the voting population and opposed these measures. The legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants.<ref name=\"tuck\"/>\n\nIn 1910 the legislature proposed the [[Digges Amendment]] to the state constitution. It would have used property requirements to effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction Era|disfranchise]] many African Americans as well as many poor whites (including new immigrants), a technique used by other southern states from 1890 to 1910, beginning with Mississippi's new constitution. The [[Maryland General Assembly]] passed the bill, which [[Governor of Maryland|Governor]] [[Austin Lane Crothers]] supported. Before the measure went to popular vote, a bill was proposed that would have effectively passed the requirements of the Digges Amendment into law. Due to widespread public opposition, that measure failed, and the amendment was also rejected by the voters of Maryland.\n\nNationally Maryland citizens achieved the most notable rejection of a black-disfranchising amendment.<ref name=\"tuck\"/> Similar measures had earlier been proposed in Maryland, but also failed to pass (the Poe Amendment in 1905 and the Straus Amendment in 1909). The power of blacks at the ballot box and economically helped them resist these bills and disfranchising effort.<ref name=\"tuck\">[http://www.brandonkendhammer.com/democratization_Spring2013/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Tuck-2007.pdf STEPHEN TUCK, \"Democratization and the Disfranchisement of African Americans in the US South during the Late 19th Century\" (pdf)], Spring 2013, reading for \"Challenges of Democratization\", by Brandon Kendhammer, Ohio University</ref>\n\nThe businessmen [[Johns Hopkins]], [[Enoch Pratt]], [[George Peabody]], and [[Henry Walters]] were philanthropists of 19th-century Baltimore; they founded notable educational, health care, and cultural institutions in that city.

One of their main goals included having government jobs granted on the basis of merit rather than patronage. Other changes aimed to reduce the power of [[political boss]]es and [[political machine|machines]], which they succeeded in doing.\n\nIn a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and pre-marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from \"assisting\" voters; initiated [[primary election]]s to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the [[illiterate]] from participating. Although promoted as democratic reforms, the changes had other results sought by the middle class. They discouraged participation by the lower classes and illiterate voters. Voting participation dropped from about 82% of eligible voters in the 1890s to about 49% in the 1920s.\n\nOther laws regulated working conditions. For instance, in a series of laws passed in 1902, the state regulated conditions in [[Mining|mines]]; outlawed [[child labor]]ers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first [[workers' compensation]] law.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910. The law become a model for national legislation a few decades later.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe debate over [[prohibition]] of alcohol, another progressive reform, led to Maryland's gaining its second nickname. A mocking newspaper editorial dubbed Maryland \"the Free State\" for its allowing alcohol.<ref name=GLANCE /><ref name=quarter />\n\n===Great Baltimore Fire===\n[[File:Baltimore fire aftermath.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The aftermath of the [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904]]\n\nThe [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904 was a momentous event for Maryland's largest city and the state as a whole. The fire raged in [[Baltimore]] from 10:48&nbsp;a.m. Sunday, February 7, to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Monday, February 8, 1904. More than 1,231 [[firefighter]]s worked to bring the blaze under control.\n\nOne reason for the fire's duration was the lack of national [[standardization|standards]] in fire-fighting equipment. Although fire engines from nearby cities (such as [[Philadelphia]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], as well as units from [[New York City|New York]], [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]) responded, many were useless because their hose couples failed to fit Baltimore [[Fire hydrant|hydrants]]. As a result, the fire burned over 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks.\n\nIn the aftermath, 35,000 people were left unemployed. After the fire, the city was rebuilt using more fireproof materials, such as [[granite]] pavers.\n\n===The World War I era===\n[[World War I#Entry of the United States|Entry into World War I]] brought changes to Maryland.\n\nMaryland was the site of new military bases, such as Camp Meade (now [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]]), the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], which were established in 1917, and the [[Edgewood Arsenal]], which was founded the following year. Other existing facilities, including [[Fort McHenry]], were greatly expanded.\n\nTo coordinate wartime activities, like the expansion of federal facilities, the General Assembly set up a Council of Defense. The 126 seats on the council were filled by appointment.{{clarify|appointment by who?|date=October 2010}} The Council, which had a virtually unlimited budget, was charged with defending the state, supervising the draft, maintaining wage and price controls, providing housing for war-related industries, and promoting support for the war. Citizens were encouraged to grow their own [[victory garden]]s and to obey ration laws. They were also forced to work, once the legislature adopted a compulsory labor law with the support of the Council of Defense.\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:H L Mencken Carl Van Vechten.jpg|thumb|left|225px|H. L. Mencken in 1932]]\n[[H. L. Mencken]] (1880\u20131956) was the state's iconoclastic writer and intellectual trendsetter. In 1922 the \"Sage of Baltimore\" praised the state for its \"singular and various beauty from the stately estuaries of the Chesapeake to the peaks of the Blue Ridge.\"  He happily reported that Providence had spared Maryland the harsh weather, the decay, the intractable social problems of other states. Statistically, Maryland held tightly to the middle ground\u2013 in population, value of manufacturers, percentage of native whites, the proportion of Catholics, the first and last annual frost. Everywhere he looked he found Maryland in the middle. In national politics it worked sometimes with the northern Republicans, other times with southern Democrats. This average quality perhaps represented a national ideal toward which other states were striving. Nevertheless, Mencken sensed something was wrong.  \"Men are ironed out. Ideas are suspect. No one appears to be happy.

Ritchie]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], governor. He was reelected four times, serving from 1919 to 1934. Ritchie was handsome, aristocratic, and very pro-business. He hired a management firm to streamline government operations and established a budget process controlled largely by economists. He also won approval for a [[civil service]] system, long been sought by reformers who wanted positions given on the basis of merit and not patronage; reduced the number of state elections by extending legislative terms from two to four years; and appointed citizens' commissions to advise on nearly every aspect of government. State property taxes dropped sharply under Ritchie, but so did state services. A powerful movie censorship board kept subversive ideas away from the masses. Three times, including 1924 and 1932, Ritchie was a candidate for [[President of the United States]], arguing that Presidents [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]] and [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] were hopeless spendthrifts.<ref>Joseph B.

In 1932 the \"[[Bonus Army]]\" marched through the state on its way to [[Washington, D.C.]] In addition to the nationwide [[New Deal]] reforms of President Roosevelt, which put men to work building roads and park facilities, Maryland also took steps to weather the hard times. For instance, in 1937 the state instituted its first ever [[income tax]] to generate revenue for schools and welfare.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe state had some advances in [[civil rights]]. The 1935 case ''[[Murray v. Pearson]] et al.'' resulted in a Baltimore City Court's ordering integration of [[University of Maryland Law School]]. The plaintiff in that case was represented by [[Thurgood Marshall]], a young lawyer with the [[NAACP]] and a native of Baltimore. When the state [[attorney general]] appealed to the [[Maryland Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], it affirmed the decision. Because the state did not appeal the ruling in the federal courts, this state ruling under the U.S. Constitution was the first to overturn ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', the 1896 Supreme Court decision that allowed separate but equal facilities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} While the ruling was a moral precedent, it had no authority outside the state of Maryland.\n\nA hurricane in 1933 created an inlet in [[Sinepuxent Bay]] at [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]], making the then-small town attractive for [[recreational fishing]].

Two [[beltway]]s, [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]] and [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]], were built around Baltimore and Washington, while [[I-70]], [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]], and later [[I-68]] linked central Maryland with [[western Maryland]], and [[I-97]] linked Baltimore with Annapolis.

Large-scale, mechanized [[poultry]] farms became prevalent on the lower [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], along with irrigated [[vegetable]] farming. In [[Southern Maryland]] tobacco farming had nearly vanished by the century's end, due to suburban housing development and a state tobacco incentive buy-out program. Industrial, railroad, and coal-mining jobs in the four westernmost counties declined, but that area's economy was helped by expansion of outdoor recreational tourism and new technology jobs and industries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} As the 21st century dawned, Maryland joined neighboring states in a new initiative to save the health of [[Chesapeake Bay]], whose aquatic life and seafood industry are threatened by waterfront residential development, as well as by fertilizer and livestock waste entering the bay, especially from Pennsylvania's [[Susquehanna River]].<ref>{{cite news |title=An Unsavory Byproduct: Runoff and Pollution |first=Peter S. |last=Goodman |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/aug99/chicken1.htm |newspaper=Washington Post |date=August 1, 1999 |page=A1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hog farms' waste poses a threat |first=Tom |last=Horton |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-01-01/news/9904280856_1_hog-farm-cafos-factory-hog |newspaper=Baltimore Sun |date=January 1, 1999}}</ref> In addition, about {{convert|580|acre}} of Maryland shore are eroded per year due to the land sinking and rising sea levels.<ref>{{cite news |title=Losing Battle Against the Bay |first=David A. |last=Fahrenthold |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/24/AR2010102403208.html |newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 25, 2010}}</ref> In 2013, Maryland abolished capital punishment.\n\n==See also==\n{{main|Historical outline of Maryland}}\n* [[Government of Maryland]]\n* [[Colonial South and the Chesapeake]]\n* [[History of the Southern United States]]\n* [[History of Washington, D.C.]]\n* [[List of people from Maryland]]\n* {{req|Timeline of Maryland}}<ref>{{cite book |location=NY |publisher=Oxford University Press |series=[[American Guide Series]] |title=Maryland: a Guide to the Old Line State |author=Federal Writers' Project |date=1940 |chapter=Chronology |via=HathiTrust |hdl=2027/mdp.39015054402659 |author-link=Federal Writers' Project }}</ref>\n* [[Timeline of Baltimore]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n\n===Surveys===\n* Brugger, Robert J.

It was notable for having been established with religious freedom for [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], since Calvert had publicly converted to that faith.<ref>Greenwell, Megan. \"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/15/AR2008081504104.html Religious Freedom Byway Would Recognize Maryland's Historic Role]\", ''Washington Post'', August 21, 2008.</ref><ref>Calvert, Cecilius. \"Instructions to the Colonists by Lord Baltimore, (1633)\", ''Narratives of Early Maryland, 1633\u20131684'' (Clayton Coleman Hall, ed.), (NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1910), 11\u201323.</ref><ref name=\"stmaryscity.org\">{{cite web|url=https://stmaryscity.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Chapel-Reconstruction.pdf|title=Reconstructing the Brick Chapel of 1667|page=1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313133644/http://www.stmaryscity.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Chapel-Reconstruction.pdf|archive-date=March 13, 2014|access-date=December 10, 2015}}</ref> Like other colonies and settlements of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region, its economy was soon based on [[tobacco]] as a commodity crop, highly prized among the English, cultivated primarily by [[Africa]]n [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor, although many young people came from [[Great Britain|Britain]] sent as [[indentured servants]] or criminal prisoners in the early years.\n\nIn 1781, during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), Maryland became the seventh state of the [[United States]] to ratify the [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]].  They were drawn up by a committee of the [[Second Continental Congress]] (1775\u20131781), which began shortly after the adoption of a [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in July 1776, through to 1778. Later that year, these Articles were recommended to the newly independent sovereign states via their legislatures for the required unanimous ratification. This long process was held up for three years by objections from smaller states led by Maryland until certain issues and principles over the western lands beyond  the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]]. These objections were resolved with the larger states agreeing to cede their various western claims to the authority of the new [[Congress of the Confederation]], representing all the states, to be held in common for the laying out and erection of new states out of the jointly held Federal territories. Maryland then finally agreed to join the new American confederation by being one of the last of the former colonies ratifying the long proposed Articles in 1781, when they took effect.\n\nLater that same decade, Maryland became the seventh state to ratify the stronger government structure proposed in the new [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] in 1788.\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, numerous Maryland planters freed their slaves as the economy changed. [[Baltimore]] grew to become one of the largest cities on the eastern seaboard, and a major economic force in the country. Although Maryland was still a [[slave state]] in 1860, by that time nearly half of [[African Americans in Maryland|the African American population]] was already free, due mostly to [[manumission]]s after the [[American Revolution]].<ref name=\"Peter Kolchin 1993, pp.81\u201382\">Kolchin, Peter. ''American Slavery: 1619\u20131877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 81\u201382</ref> Baltimore had the highest number of free people of color of any city in the United States. Maryland was among the four divided border states that officially remained in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), although large numbers of Marylanders \"went south\" to fight for the seceded [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].\n\n==Pre-colonial history==\n{{See also|Pre-Colonial America}}\n{{History of Maryland}}\nIt appears that the first humans in the area that would become Maryland arrived around the [[tenth millennium BC]], about the time that the [[last glacial period|last ice age]] ended. They were [[hunter-gatherer]]s organized into semi-nomadic bands. They adapted as the region's environment changed, developing the spear for hunting as smaller animals, like [[deer]], became more prevalent. By about 1500 BC, oysters had become an important food resource in the region. With the increased variety of food sources, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] villages and settlements started appearing and their social structures increased in complexity. By about 1000 BC, pottery was being produced. With the eventual rise of [[agriculture]], more permanent Native-American villages were built. But even with the advent of farming, hunting and fishing were still important means of obtaining food. The [[bow and arrow]] were first used for hunting in the area around the year 800. They ate what they could kill, grow or catch in the rivers and other waterways.\n\n[[File:Native Languages of Maryland.svg|thumb|left|Some of the historical Native languages of Maryland]]\nBy 1000 AD, there were about 8,000 Native Americans, all [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking, living in what is now the state, in 40 different villages. By the 17th century, the state was populated by a mix of Iroquoian and Algonquian peoples. These were the [[Susquehannocks]] (west of the Delaware River), the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] and [[Tockwogh]] (on the Delmarva Peninsula between the Delaware and Indian Rivers), the [[Piscataway people|Piscataway]] (surrounding the Potomac River from Washington D.C. south) and the [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]] (Delmarva Peninsula, south of the Indian River). John Smith labelled the Tuscarora as the Kuskarawock on an early map from 1606, but they shortly thereafter moved west to join the Meherrin and Nottoway in Virginia.<ref>See [[commons:File:Capt John Smith's map of Virginia 1624.jpg|John Smith's map of Virginia]] on Wikimedia Commons.</ref> Meanwhile, the Tockwogh may have moved to New York and/or been given refuge by the Susquehannock. They are noted as the Akhrakovaetonon and Trakwaerronnons, which seems similar to Tockwogh. They were extinct as a people by the end of the 17th century, however.<ref>John Steckley, \"[http://www.ontarioarchaeology.wildapricot.org/Resources/Publications/oa51-2-steckley.pdf The Early Map \"Novvelle France\": A Linguistic Analysis]\", ''Ontario Archaeology'' 51, 1990.</ref>\n\nThe following [[Piscataway Indian Nation|Piscataway tribes]] lived on the eastern bank of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], from south to north: [[Yaocomico]]es, Chopticans, [[Nanjemoy]]s, [[Potopac]]s, [[Mattawoman]]s, [[Piscataway tribe|Piscataways]], [[Patuxent people|Patuxents]], and [[Nacotchtank]]s. The area in which the Nacotchtank lived is now the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. On the west bank of the Potomac river in what is now [[Virginia]] were the related tribes of the [[Patawomeck]] and the [[Doeg tribe|Doeg]]. Further west in the [[Appalachian Mountains]], the [[Shawnee]] lived near [[Oldtown, Maryland|Oldtown]] at a site abandoned around 1731. On the Eastern Shore of the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]], from south to north, there were the [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]] tribes: [[Pocomoke people|Annemessex]], [[Assateague people|Assateagues]], [[Wicocomico|Wicomicoes]], [[Nanticoke people|Nanticokes]], [[Chicacone]], and, on the north bank of the [[Choptank River]], the [[Choptank people|Choptanks]]. The [[Tockwogh tribe]] lived near the headwaters of the Chesapeake near what is now [[Delaware]].<ref>{{Cite news | first=Patrick M. | last=Reynolds | title=Flashback column:The Tribes of Maryland | url=| work=Washington Post | location=Washington, DC | pages= SC9 | date=April 11, 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> They were driven further north by enemies and eventually broke apart, with some staying in the region, others merging with the Nanticoke and others, known as the Conoy, migrated west into West Virginia.<ref>John Heckewelder (Loskiel): Conoys, Ganawese, etc. explains Charles A. Hanna (Vol II, 1911:96, Ganeiens-gaa, Margry, i., 529; ii., 142\u201343,) using La Salle's letter of August 22, 1681 Fort Saint Louis (Illinois) mentioning \"Ohio tribes\" for extrapolation.</ref> Some appeared around the end of the 18th century at Fort Detroit in Michigan.\n\n[[File:Capt John Smith's map of Virginia 1624.jpg|thumb|405px|John Smith's map of the Chesapeake area]]\n\nWhen Europeans began to settle in Maryland in the early 17th century, the main tribes included the Nanticoke on the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], and the Iroquoian speaking [[Susquehannock]]. Early exposure to new European diseases brought widespread fatalities to the Native Americans, as they had no immunity to them. Communities were disrupted by such losses. Furthermore, The Susquehannock, already incorrectly considered savages and cannibals by the first Spanish explorers, made massive moves to control local trade with the first Swedish, Dutch and English settlers of the Chesapeake Bay region. As the century wore on, the Susquehannock would be caught up in the [[Beaver Wars]], a war with the neighboring [[Lenape]], a war with the Dutch, a war with the English, and a series of wars with the colonial government of Maryland. Due to colonial land claims, the exact territory of the Susquehannock was originally limited to the territory immediately surrounding the Susquehanna River, however archaeology has discovered settlements of theirs dating to the 14th and 15th centuries around the Maryland-West Virginia border, and beyond. It could generally be assumed that most of Maryland's southern border is based on the borders of their own land. All of these wars, coupled with disease, destroyed the tribe and the last of their people were offered refuge from the Iroquois Confederacy to the north shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cecildaily.com/our_cecil/article_75360102-240f-504b-97ae-d7ad37878cb4.html |title=Susquehannocks \u2013 The vanquished tribe &#124; Our Cecil |publisher=cecildaily.com |date=May 17, 2014 |access-date=July 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe closest living language to them are the languages of the Mohawk and Tuscarora Iroquois, who once lived immediately north and south of them. The English and Dutch came to call them the Minqua, from Lenape, which breaks into min-kwe and translates to \"as a woman.\" As to when they arrived, some early records detailing their oral history seem to point to the fact that they descended from an Iroquoian group who conquered Ohio centuries before, but were pushed back east again by Siouan and Algonquin enemies. They also conquered and absorbed other unknown groups in the process, which probably explains how languages like Tuscarora came to be so completely divergent from other Iroquoian languages.

Meeting resistance, in February 1635, he summoned a colonial [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]]. In 1638, the Assembly forced him to govern according to the laws of England. The right to initiate legislation passed to the assembly.\n\nIn 1638 Calvert seized a trading post in [[Kent Island, Maryland|Kent Island]] established by the Virginian [[William Claiborne]]. In 1644 Claiborne led an uprising of Maryland [[Protestant]]s. Calvert was forced to flee to Virginia, but he returned at the head of an armed force in 1646 and reasserted [[Proprietary colony|proprietarial]] rule.\n[[File:Large Broadside on the Maryland Toleration Act.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A large broadside of the [[Maryland Toleration Act]]]]\n\nMaryland soon became one of the few predominantly Catholic regions among the English colonies in North America. Maryland was also one of the key destinations where the government sent tens of thousands of English convicts punished by sentences of transportation. Such punishment persisted until the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].\n\nThe [[Maryland Toleration Act]], issued in 1649, was one of the first laws that explicitly defined tolerance of varieties of Christianity.\n\nSt. Mary's City was the largest settlement in Maryland and the seat of colonial government until 1695. Because [[Anglicanism]] had become the official religion in Virginia, a band of [[Puritan]]s in 1642 left for Maryland; they founded Providence (now called [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]).<ref>Owen M. Taylor, ''History of Annapolis'' (1872) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr9ib-I1WlIC p 5 online]</ref>\nIn 1650 the Puritans revolted against the proprietary government. They set up a new government prohibiting both Catholicism and Anglicanism. In March 1655, the [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|2nd Lord Baltimore]] sent an army under Governor [[William Stone (Maryland governor)|William Stone]] to put down this revolt. Near Annapolis, his Roman Catholic army was decisively defeated by a Puritan army in the [[Battle of the Severn]]. The Puritan revolt lasted until 1658, when the Calvert family regained control and re-enacted the Toleration Act.<ref>Daniel R.

Lord Baltimore was stripped of his right to govern the province, though not of his territorial rights. Maryland was designated as a royal province, administered by the crown via appointed governors until 1715.

Mobs burned down all the original Catholic churches of southern Maryland. The Anglican Church was made the established church of the colony. In 1695 the royal Governor, Francis Nicholson, moved the seat of government to Ann Arundell Town in Anne Arundel County and renamed it Annapolis in honor of the Princess Anne, who later became Queen Anne of Great Britain.<ref>{{cite book |first1=S.

St. Mary's City is now an archaeological site, with a small tourist center.\n\n===City planning===\nJust as the city plan for St. Mary's City reflected the ideals of the founders, the city plan of Annapolis reflected those in power at the turn of the 18th century. The plan of Annapolis extends from two circles at the center of the city&nbsp;\u2013 one including the [[Maryland State House|State House]] and the other the established Anglican [[St. Anne's Church (Annapolis, Maryland)|St. Anne's Church]] (now [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]]). The plan reflected a stronger relationship between church and state, and a colonial government more closely aligned with Protestant churches. General British policy regarding immigration to all [[British America]] would be reflected broadly in the [[Plantation Act 1740|Plantation Act]] of 1740.\n\n[[File: Tobacco cultivation (Virginia, ca. 1670).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Tobacco was the main export crop in the colonial era; it involved a great deal of hand labor, usually done by enslaved Africans, as shown here in a 1670 painting from Virginia]]\n\n===Mason\u2013Dixon Line===\nBased on an incorrect map, the original royal charter granted to Maryland the [[Potomac River]] and territory northward to the [[40th parallel north|fortieth parallel]]. This was found to be a problem, as the northern boundary would have put [[Philadelphia]], the major city in [[Pennsylvania]], within Maryland. The [[Baron Baltimore|Calvert family]], which controlled Maryland, and the [[William Penn|Penn family]], which controlled Pennsylvania, decided in 1750 to engage two surveyors, [[Charles Mason]] and [[Jeremiah Dixon]], to establish a boundary between the colonies.\n\nThey surveyed what became known as the [[Mason\u2013Dixon Line]], which became the boundary between the two colonies. The crests of the Penn family and of the Calvert family were put at the Mason\u2013Dixon line to mark it.\n\n===Horse racing and gentry values===\nIn Chesapeake society (that is, colonial Virginia and Maryland) sports occupied a great deal of attention at every social level. Horse racing was sponsored by the wealthy gentry plantation owners, and attracted ordinary farmers as spectators and gamblers. Selected slaves often became skilled horse trainers.  Horse racing was especially important for knitting the gentry together. The race was a major public event designed to demonstrate to the world the superior social status of the gentry through expensive breeding and training of horses, boasting and gambling, and especially winning the races themselves.<ref>Nancy L.

During this initial phase of the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary period]], Maryland was governed by a series of conventions of the [[Annapolis Convention (1774\u20131776)|Assembly of Freemen]]. The first convention of the Assembly lasted four days, from June 22 to 25, 1774. All sixteen [[County (United States)|counties]] then existing were represented by a total of 92 members; [[Matthew Tilghman]] was elected chairman.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Johnson (governor).jpeg|left|thumb|[[Thomas Johnson (jurist)|Thomas Johnson]], Maryland's first elected governor under its [[Maryland Constitution of 1776|1776 Constitution]]]]\n\nThe eighth session decided that the continuation of an ad-hoc government by the convention was not a good mechanism for all the concerns of the province. A more permanent and structured government was needed. So, on July 3, 1776, they resolved that a new convention be elected that would be responsible for drawing up their first [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]], one that did not refer to parliament or the king, but would be a government \"...of the people only.\" After they set dates and prepared notices to the counties they adjourned. On August 1, all freemen with property elected delegates for the last convention. The ninth and last convention was also known as the [[List of delegates to the Maryland Constitutional Convention (1776)|Constitutional Convention of 1776]]. They drafted a constitution, and when they adjourned on November 11, they would not meet again. The conventions were replaced by the new state government which the [[Maryland Constitution of 1776]] had established. [[Thomas Johnson (jurist)|Thomas Johnson]] became the state's first elected governor.\n\nOn March 1, 1781, the [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]] was ratified and took effect with the confirmation signing of the Articles by two Maryland delegates in Philadelphia. The articles had initially been submitted to the states on November 17, 1777, but the ratification process dragged on for several years, stalled by an interstate quarrel over claims to uncolonized land in the west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]]. Maryland was the last hold-out; it refused to ratify until larger states like [[Virginia]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] agreed to rescind their claims to lands in what became the old [[Northwest Territory]] and the Southwest Territory. [[Anne-C\u00e9sar, Chevalier de la Luzerne|Chevalier de La Luzerne]], French [[Diplomatic rank|Minister]] to the United States, felt that the Articles would help strengthen the American government. In 1780 when Maryland requested France provide naval forces in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] for protection from the British (who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay), he indicated that French Admiral [[Charles Ren\u00e9 Dominique Sochet, Chevalier Destouches|Destouches]] would do what he could but La Luzerne also \"sharply pressed\" Maryland to ratify the Articles, thus suggesting the two issues were related.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sioussat |first= St. George L.|date= October 1936 |title= THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE AND THE RATIFICATION OF THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION BY MARYLAND, 1780-1781 With Accompanying Documents|url= https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/view/28432/28188 |journal= The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography |volume= 60|issue= 4|pages= 391\u2013418 |access-date= 19 April 2018}}</ref> On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the [[Maryland General Assembly]] in Annapolis.<ref name=\"lawsofmaryland\">{{cite web |date= February 2, 1781 |work= Laws of Maryland, 1781 |url= http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |title= An ACT to empower the delegates |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723015508/http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |archivedate= July 23, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, \"among engrossed Bills\" was \"signed and sealed by Governor [[Thomas Sim Lee]] in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation\" and perpetual union among the states.

Marylander [[John Hanson]], served as [[President of the Continental Congress]] from 1781 to 1782.

It was in the old [[Maryland Senate|Senate]] chamber<ref name=\"GLANCE\"/> that General [[George Washington]] famously resigned his commission as [[commander in chief]] of the [[Continental Army]] on December 23, 1783. It was also there that the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1783, which ended the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], was ratified by Congress on January 14, 1784.\n\nMajor General William Smallwood, having served under General George Washington during the Revolutionary War, then Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, became the fourth American Governor of Maryland. In 1787, Governor William Smallwood called together and convened the state convention which adopted the new U.S. Constitution in 1788, becoming the seventh state to ratify the Constitution. This made Governor Smallwood, an American Major General of the Revolutionary War, the first Governor of Maryland under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n==Maryland, 1789\u20131849==\n{{Further|History of the United States (1789\u20131849)}}\n\n===Economic development===\nThe American Revolution stimulated the domestic market for wheat and iron ore, and flour milling increased in Baltimore. Iron ore transport greatly boosted the local economy. By 1800 Baltimore had become one of the major cities of the new republic. The British naval blockade during the War of 1812 hurt Baltimore's shipping, but also freed merchants and traders from British debts, which along with the capture of British merchant vessels furthered the city's economic growth.\n\n====Transportation initiatives====\nThe city had a deepwater port. In the early 19th century, many business leaders in Maryland were looking inland, toward the western frontier, for economic growth potential. The challenge was to devise a reliable means to transport goods and people. The [[National Road]] and private [[Toll road|turnpikes]] were being completed throughout the state, but additional routes and capacity were needed. Following the success of the [[Erie Canal]] (constructed 1817\u201325) and similar canals in the northeastern states, leaders in Maryland were also developing plans for canals. After several failed canal projects in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area, the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] (C&O) began construction there in 1828. The Baltimore business community viewed this project as a competitive threat. The geography of the Baltimore area made building a similar canal to the west impractical, but the idea of constructing railroads was beginning to gather support in the 1820s.\n\nIn 1827 city leaders obtained a charter from the [[Maryland General Assembly]] to build a railroad to the [[Ohio River]].<ref name=\"Stover\">{{cite book | last = Stover | first = John F. | title = History of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad | publisher = Purdue University Press | year = 1987 | location = West Lafayette, IN | isbn = 0-911198-81-4}}</ref>{{rp|17}} The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) became the first chartered railroad in the United States, and opened its first section of track for regular operation in 1830, between Baltimore and [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott City]].<ref name=\"Dilts\">{{cite book |title=The Great Road: The Building of the Baltimore and Ohio, the Nation's First Railroad, 1828\u20131853 |last=Dilts |first=James D. |year=1993 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Palo Alto, CA |isbn=0-8047-2235-8}}</ref>{{rp|80}} It became the first company to operate a [[steam locomotive|locomotive]] built in America, with the ''[[Tom Thumb (locomotive)|Tom Thumb]].''<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Holland |authorlink= |title=The Age of Invention: A Chronicle of Mechanical Conquest |series= Chronicles of America Series, Vol. 37 |year=1921 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |isbn= |pages=80\u201381|oclc=3616164 }}</ref> The B&O built a branch line to Washington, D.C. in 1835.<ref name=\"Dilts\"/>{{rp|184}} The main line west reached [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]] in 1842, beating the C&O Canal there by eight years, and the railroad continued building westward.<ref name=\"Stover\"/>{{rp|54}} In 1852 it became the first rail line to reach the Ohio River from the eastern seaboard.<ref name=\"Stover\"/>{{rp|18}} Other railroads were built in and through Baltimore by mid-century, most significantly the [[Northern Central Railway|Northern Central]]; the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad|Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore]]; and the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad|Baltimore and Potomac]].

Two notable battles occurred in the state. The first was the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] on August 24, 1814, just outside the national capital, [[Washington, D.C.]] The British army routed the American militiamen, who fled in confusion, and went on to capture Washington, D.C.

The city's defenses were under the command of Major General [[Samuel Smith (Maryland)|Samuel Smith]], an officer and commander of the Maryland state militia and a [[United States Senator]]. Baltimore had been well fortified with excellent supplies and some 15,000 troops. Maryland militia fought a determined delaying action at the [[Battle of North Point]], during which a Maryland militia marksman shot and killed the British commander, Major General [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]]. The battle bought enough time for Baltimore's defenses to be strengthened.\n\nAfter advancing to the edge of American defenses, the British halted their advance and withdrew.

Their defense was augmented by the sinking of a line of American merchant ships at the adjacent entrance to Baltimore Harbor in order to thwart passage of British ships. The attack began on the morning of September 13, as the British fleet of some nineteen ships began pounding the fort with rockets and mortar shells. After an initial exchange of fire, the British fleet withdrew just beyond the {{convert|1.5|mi}} range of Fort McHenry's cannons. For the next 25 hours, they bombarded the outmanned Americans. On the morning of September 14, an oversized [[Star-Spangled Banner Flag|American flag]], which had been raised before daybreak, flew over Fort McHenry. The British knew that victory had eluded them. The bombardment of the fort inspired [[Francis Scott Key]] of [[Frederick, Maryland]] to write \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" as witness to the assault. It later became the country's [[national anthem]].\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Maryland in the Civil War==\n{{Main|Maryland in the American Civil War}}\n''See also: [[American Civil War]], [[Origins of the American Civil War]] and [[History of slavery in Maryland]]''\n\n===Maryland's mixed sympathies===\n[[File:Balt.

As in [[Virginia]] and [[Delaware]], some planters in Maryland had freed their slaves in the years after the Revolutionary War. By 1860 Maryland's [[free black]] population comprised 49.1% of the total of African Americans in the state.<ref name=\"Peter Kolchin 1993, pp.81\u201382\"/>\n\nAfter [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s raid in 1859 on [[Harper's Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry, Virginia]], some citizens in slaveholding areas began forming local [[militia]]s for defense. Of the 1860 population of 687,000, about 60,000 men joined the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and about 25,000 fought for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The political alignments of each group generally reflected their economic interests, with slaveholders and people involved in trade with the South most likely to favor the Confederate cause, and small farmers and merchants outside the major cities and in western Maryland allied with the Union. In the 1860 election, Lincoln received only one vote in [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], a center of large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cleveland|first=J.

After that, Baltimore Mayor [[George William Brown]], Marshal [[George P. Kane]], and former Governor [[Enoch Louis Lowe]] requested that Maryland Governor [[Thomas H. Hicks]], a slave owner from the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], burn the railroad bridges and cut the [[telegraph line]]s leading to Baltimore to prevent further troops from entering the state. Hicks reportedly approved this proposal. These actions were addressed in the famous federal court case of ''[[Ex parte Merryman]]''.\n\nMaryland remained part of the Union during the Civil War. President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s strong hand suppressing violence and dissent in Maryland and the belated assistance of Governor Hicks played important roles. Hicks worked with federal officials to stop further violence.\n\nLincoln promised to avoid having Northern defenders march through Baltimore while en route to protect the acutely endangered federal capital. The majority of forces took a slow route by boat. Massachusetts militia general [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] used the water route after learning about the troubles in Baltimore. He commandeered the P. W. & B. Railroad ferryboat ''Harriet Lane''  at the [[Susquehanna River]] crossing between [[Perryville, Maryland|Perryville]] in [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]] to [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]] in [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]]. Avoiding the riotous city, he steamed down the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to anchor at night off the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]] at Severn Point in Annapolis.\n\nHe landed his troops of Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island militia over the protests of Governor [[Thomas Holliday Hicks]] (1798\u20131865). He put some on the old Navy training ship frigate, ''[[USS Constitution]]'' (\"Old Ironsides\") and moved it off shore beyond reach of easy attack. Recruiting some railroad workers and boilermakers among his soldiers, Butler had them rescue a small yard locomotive in the trainyards and use it to take cars full of soldiers up the Annapolis Line of the B&O Railroad to Relay Junction near Ellicott City, where it joined the [[Old Main Line Subdivision|Main Line]] going west to [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]] or south to Washington. The Northern regiments used this route to reach the train station (now [[Union Station (Washington, DC)|Union Station]] near the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]]). They camped that evening in the Rotunda, which was not yet completed. An additional unit was sent up [[Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site|Pennsylvania Avenue]] to reinforce the [[White House]], where the President greeted them with relief.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nMarylanders sympathetic to the South easily crossed the [[Potomac River]] to join and fight for the Confederacy. Exiles organized a \"Maryland Line\" in the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] which consisted of one [[infantry]] regiment, one infantry battalion, two [[cavalry]] battalions and four battalions of [[artillery]]. According to the best extant records, up to 25,000 Marylanders went south to fight for the Confederacy. About 60,000 Maryland men served in all branches of the Union military. Many of the Union troops were said to enlist on the promise of home garrison duty.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nMaryland's naval contribution, the relatively new sloop-of-war [[USS Constellation (1854)|USS ''Constellation'']] was flagship of the US [[Africa Squadron]] from 1859 to 1861 and continued in this role during the war. In this period, she disrupted the [[African slave trade]] by interdicting three slave ships and releasing the imprisoned slaves. The last of the ships was captured at the outbreak of the Civil War: ''Constellation'' overpowered the slaver brig ''Triton'' in African coastal waters. ''Constellation'' spent much of the war as a deterrent to Confederate cruisers and commerce raiders in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].\n\n===Occupation of Baltimore===\n\nA Union artillery garrison was placed on [[Federal Hill, Baltimore|Federal Hill]] with express orders to destroy the city should Southern sympathizers overwhelm law and order there.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nevins |first=Allan |authorlink= |title=The War for the Union: The Improvised War, 1861\u20131862 |url=https://archive.org/details/warforunionvol202nevi|url-access=registration |accessdate= |year=1959 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |location=New York |isbn= |page=[https://archive.org/details/warforunionvol202nevi/page/87 87]}}</ref> Following the riot of 1861, Union troops under the command of General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] occupied the hill in the middle of the night. Butler and his men erected a small fort, with cannon pointing towards the central business district. Their goal was to guarantee the allegiance of the city and the state of Maryland to the federal government under threat of force. This fort and the Union occupation persisted for the duration of the Civil War. A large flag, a few cannon, and a small [[Grand Army of the Republic]] monument remain to testify to this period of the hill's history.\n[[File:John Pendleton Kennedy, politician, author.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pendleton Kennedy]], politician, author. Kennedy played a major role in bringing an end to slavery in Maryland. ''1850 photograph.'']]\nBecause Maryland remained in the Union, it fell outside the scope of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. A constitutional convention  in 1864 culminated in the passage of [[Maryland Constitution of 1864|a new state constitution]] on November 1 of that year. Article 24 of that document outlawed the practice of slavery. A campaign by state politician [[John Pendleton Kennedy]] and others ensured that abolishment of slavery would be in the new document, and the issue was hotly contested for nearly a year throughout the state. In the end the elimination of slavery was approved by a 1,000-vote margin. The right to vote was extended to non-white males in the [[Maryland Constitution of 1867]], which is still in effect today.\n\n===The war on Maryland soil===\n{{See also|American Civil War#Eastern Theater 1861.26ndash.3B1863|l1=American Civil War: Eastern Theater 1861\u20131863}}\n[[File:Battle of Antietam2.jpg|thumb|300px|''Battle of Antietam'' by Kurz and Allison]]\nThe largest and most significant battle fought in the state was the [[Battle of Antietam]], fought on September 17, 1862, near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]]. The battle was the culmination of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Maryland Campaign]], which aimed to secure new supplies, recruit fresh men from among the considerable pockets of Confederate sympathies in Maryland, and to impact public opinion in the North. With those goals, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, consisting of about 40,000 men, had entered Maryland following their recent victory at [[Second Bull Run]].\n\nWhile Major General [[George B. McClellan]]'s 87,000-man [[Army of the Potomac]] was moving to intercept Lee, a [[Union Army|Union]] soldier discovered a mislaid copy of the detailed battle plans of Lee's army. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically (to [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]], and [[Hagerstown, Maryland]]), thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail if McClellan could move quickly enough. McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence and position his forces based on it, thus endangering a golden opportunity to defeat Lee decisively.\n\n[[File:Bodies on the battlefield at antietam.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Dead Confederate soldiers from Starke's Louisiana Brigade, on the Hagerstown Turnpike, north of the Dunker Church]]\n\nThe armies met near the town of Sharpsburg by [[Antietam Creek]]. Although McClellan arrived in the area on September 16, his trademark caution delayed his attack on Lee, which gave the Confederates more time to prepare defensive positions and allowed [[James Longstreet|Longstreet's]] corps to arrive from Hagerstown and [[Stonewall Jackson|Jackson's]] corps, minus [[A. P. Hill]]'s division, to arrive from Harpers Ferry. McClellan's two-to-one advantage in the battle was almost completely nullified by a lack of coordination and concentration of Union forces, which allowed Lee to shift his defensive forces to parry each thrust.\n\n[[File:Bloodylane.JPG|thumb|[[Antietam National Battlefield]] today]]\nAlthough a tactical draw, the Battle of Antietam was considered a strategic Union victory and a [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]] of the war. It forced the end of Lee's invasion of the North. It also was enough of a victory to enable President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect on January 1, 1863. He had been advised by his Cabinet to make the announcement after a Union victory, to avoid any perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union's winning the Battle of Antietam also may have dissuaded the governments of [[Second French Empire|France]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] from recognizing the Confederacy. Some observers believed they may have done so in the aftermath of another Union defeat.\n\n==1865\u20131920==\n===Post-Civil War political developments===\nSince Maryland had remained in the Union during the Civil War, the state was not covered by the [[Reconstruction Act]], as were states of the former Confederacy. After the war, many white Maryland residents struggled to re-establish [[white supremacy]] over [[freedmen]] and formerly free blacks, and racial tensions rose. There were deep divisions in the state between those who fought for the North and those who fought for the South.\n\n[[File:Thomas Swann of Maryland - photo portrait seated.jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[Thomas Swann]], the only [[Governor of Maryland]] elected under the state's [[Maryland Constitution of 1864|1864 constitution]]]]\n\nIn the late 1860s, the whites of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] rapidly regained power in the state and replaced [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] who had been elected or appointed during the war. Support for the Constitution of 1864 ended, and Democrats replaced it with the [[Maryland Constitution of 1867]]. That document, which is still in effect today, resembled the 1851 constitution more than its immediate predecessor and was approved by 54.1% of the state's population. It provided for the [[reapportionment]] of the legislature based on population, not counties, which gave greater political power to more dense urban areas (and, by extension, to [[freedmen]]), but the new constitution deprived African Americans of some of the protections of the 1864 document.<!--Why be coy? Explain what these are-->\n\n[[File:Austin Lane Crothers, photograph of head with top hat.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Austin Lane Crothers]], the 46th Governor, supported the disfranchisement of black voters and poor whites]]\n\nIn 1896, a biracial Republican coalition gained election of [[Lloyd Lowndes, Jr.]] as governor, and also achieved election of some Republican congressmen, including [[Sydney Emanuel Mudd I|Sydney Emanuel Mudd]], after Democratic dominance.<ref name=\"tuck\"/> Over the next several decades, the African-American population struggled in a discriminatory environment. The Democrat-dominated legislature tried to pass disfranchising bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911, but was rebuffed on each occasion, in large part because of black opposition and strength. Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and had established themselves in several cities, where they had comparative security. In addition, immigrants comprised 15% of the voting population and opposed these measures. The legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants.<ref name=\"tuck\"/>\n\nIn 1910 the legislature proposed the [[Digges Amendment]] to the state constitution. It would have used property requirements to effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction Era|disfranchise]] many African Americans as well as many poor whites (including new immigrants), a technique used by other southern states from 1890 to 1910, beginning with Mississippi's new constitution. The [[Maryland General Assembly]] passed the bill, which [[Governor of Maryland|Governor]] [[Austin Lane Crothers]] supported. Before the measure went to popular vote, a bill was proposed that would have effectively passed the requirements of the Digges Amendment into law. Due to widespread public opposition, that measure failed, and the amendment was also rejected by the voters of Maryland.\n\nNationally Maryland citizens achieved the most notable rejection of a black-disfranchising amendment.<ref name=\"tuck\"/> Similar measures had earlier been proposed in Maryland, but also failed to pass (the Poe Amendment in 1905 and the Straus Amendment in 1909). The power of blacks at the ballot box and economically helped them resist these bills and disfranchising effort.<ref name=\"tuck\">[http://www.brandonkendhammer.com/democratization_Spring2013/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Tuck-2007.pdf STEPHEN TUCK, \"Democratization and the Disfranchisement of African Americans in the US South during the Late 19th Century\" (pdf)], Spring 2013, reading for \"Challenges of Democratization\", by Brandon Kendhammer, Ohio University</ref>\n\nThe businessmen [[Johns Hopkins]], [[Enoch Pratt]], [[George Peabody]], and [[Henry Walters]] were philanthropists of 19th-century Baltimore; they founded notable educational, health care, and cultural institutions in that city.

One of their main goals included having government jobs granted on the basis of merit rather than patronage. Other changes aimed to reduce the power of [[political boss]]es and [[political machine|machines]], which they succeeded in doing.\n\nIn a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and pre-marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from \"assisting\" voters; initiated [[primary election]]s to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the [[illiterate]] from participating. Although promoted as democratic reforms, the changes had other results sought by the middle class. They discouraged participation by the lower classes and illiterate voters. Voting participation dropped from about 82% of eligible voters in the 1890s to about 49% in the 1920s.\n\nOther laws regulated working conditions. For instance, in a series of laws passed in 1902, the state regulated conditions in [[Mining|mines]]; outlawed [[child labor]]ers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first [[workers' compensation]] law.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910. The law become a model for national legislation a few decades later.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe debate over [[prohibition]] of alcohol, another progressive reform, led to Maryland's gaining its second nickname. A mocking newspaper editorial dubbed Maryland \"the Free State\" for its allowing alcohol.<ref name=GLANCE /><ref name=quarter />\n\n===Great Baltimore Fire===\n[[File:Baltimore fire aftermath.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The aftermath of the [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904]]\n\nThe [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904 was a momentous event for Maryland's largest city and the state as a whole. The fire raged in [[Baltimore]] from 10:48&nbsp;a.m. Sunday, February 7, to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Monday, February 8, 1904. More than 1,231 [[firefighter]]s worked to bring the blaze under control.\n\nOne reason for the fire's duration was the lack of national [[standardization|standards]] in fire-fighting equipment. Although fire engines from nearby cities (such as [[Philadelphia]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], as well as units from [[New York City|New York]], [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]) responded, many were useless because their hose couples failed to fit Baltimore [[Fire hydrant|hydrants]]. As a result, the fire burned over 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks.\n\nIn the aftermath, 35,000 people were left unemployed. After the fire, the city was rebuilt using more fireproof materials, such as [[granite]] pavers.\n\n===The World War I era===\n[[World War I#Entry of the United States|Entry into World War I]] brought changes to Maryland.\n\nMaryland was the site of new military bases, such as Camp Meade (now [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]]), the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], which were established in 1917, and the [[Edgewood Arsenal]], which was founded the following year. Other existing facilities, including [[Fort McHenry]], were greatly expanded.\n\nTo coordinate wartime activities, like the expansion of federal facilities, the General Assembly set up a Council of Defense. The 126 seats on the council were filled by appointment.{{clarify|appointment by who?|date=October 2010}} The Council, which had a virtually unlimited budget, was charged with defending the state, supervising the draft, maintaining wage and price controls, providing housing for war-related industries, and promoting support for the war. Citizens were encouraged to grow their own [[victory garden]]s and to obey ration laws. They were also forced to work, once the legislature adopted a compulsory labor law with the support of the Council of Defense.\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:H L Mencken Carl Van Vechten.jpg|thumb|left|225px|H. L. Mencken in 1932]]\n[[H. L. Mencken]] (1880\u20131956) was the state's iconoclastic writer and intellectual trendsetter. In 1922 the \"Sage of Baltimore\" praised the state for its \"singular and various beauty from the stately estuaries of the Chesapeake to the peaks of the Blue Ridge.\"  He happily reported that Providence had spared Maryland the harsh weather, the decay, the intractable social problems of other states. Statistically, Maryland held tightly to the middle ground\u2013 in population, value of manufacturers, percentage of native whites, the proportion of Catholics, the first and last annual frost. Everywhere he looked he found Maryland in the middle. In national politics it worked sometimes with the northern Republicans, other times with southern Democrats. This average quality perhaps represented a national ideal toward which other states were striving. Nevertheless, Mencken sensed something was wrong.  \"Men are ironed out. Ideas are suspect. No one appears to be happy.

Ritchie]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], governor. He was reelected four times, serving from 1919 to 1934. Ritchie was handsome, aristocratic, and very pro-business. He hired a management firm to streamline government operations and established a budget process controlled largely by economists. He also won approval for a [[civil service]] system, long been sought by reformers who wanted positions given on the basis of merit and not patronage; reduced the number of state elections by extending legislative terms from two to four years; and appointed citizens' commissions to advise on nearly every aspect of government. State property taxes dropped sharply under Ritchie, but so did state services. A powerful movie censorship board kept subversive ideas away from the masses. Three times, including 1924 and 1932, Ritchie was a candidate for [[President of the United States]], arguing that Presidents [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]] and [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] were hopeless spendthrifts.<ref>Joseph B.

In 1932 the \"[[Bonus Army]]\" marched through the state on its way to [[Washington, D.C.]] In addition to the nationwide [[New Deal]] reforms of President Roosevelt, which put men to work building roads and park facilities, Maryland also took steps to weather the hard times. For instance, in 1937 the state instituted its first ever [[income tax]] to generate revenue for schools and welfare.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe state had some advances in [[civil rights]]. The 1935 case ''[[Murray v. Pearson]] et al.'' resulted in a Baltimore City Court's ordering integration of [[University of Maryland Law School]]. The plaintiff in that case was represented by [[Thurgood Marshall]], a young lawyer with the [[NAACP]] and a native of Baltimore. When the state [[attorney general]] appealed to the [[Maryland Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], it affirmed the decision. Because the state did not appeal the ruling in the federal courts, this state ruling under the U.S. Constitution was the first to overturn ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', the 1896 Supreme Court decision that allowed separate but equal facilities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} While the ruling was a moral precedent, it had no authority outside the state of Maryland.\n\nA hurricane in 1933 created an inlet in [[Sinepuxent Bay]] at [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]], making the then-small town attractive for [[recreational fishing]]. During [[World War II]] additional large defense facilities were established in the state such as [[Andrews Air Force Base]], [[Patuxent River Naval Air Station]], and the large [[Glenn L.

Soon after, the [[Baltimore Harbor Tunnel]] allowed long-distance interstate motorists to bypass downtown Baltimore, while the earlier [[Harry W.

Two [[beltway]]s, [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]] and [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]], were built around Baltimore and Washington, while [[I-70]], [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]], and later [[I-68]] linked central Maryland with [[western Maryland]], and [[I-97]] linked Baltimore with Annapolis. Passenger and freight [[steamboat]] transportation, previously very important throughout the Chesapeake Bay and its many tributaries, came to an end in mid-century.\n\nIn 1980, the opening of [[Harborplace]] and the [[Baltimore Aquarium]] made that city a significant tourist destination, while [[Charles Center]], the [[Baltimore World Trade Center|World Trade Center]], and the popular [[Camden Yards]] baseball stadium were constructed in the downtown area.

Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region. This idea is the basis for a new generation of UV-pumped white light emitting diodes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carreira|first1=J. F.
