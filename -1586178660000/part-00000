The Australian brushturkey has also been introduced to [[Kangaroo Island]] in South Australia. It is the largest extant representative of the family Megapodiidae, and is one of three species to inhabit Australia.\n\nDespite its name and their superficial similarities, the bird is not closely related to [[Meleagris|American turkeys]], nor to the [[Australian bustard]], which is also known as the bush turkey. Its closest relatives are the [[wattled brushturkey]], [[Waigeo brushturkey]], and [[malleefowl]].\n\n==Biology==\nIt is a large bird with black feathers and a red head. Its total length is about {{convert|60|\u2013|75|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} and a wingspan of about {{convert|85|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The subspecies ''A. l. purpureicollis'' from the northern [[Cape York Peninsula]] is smaller than the more widespread [[nominate subspecies]]. It has a prominent, fan-like tail flattened sideways, and its [[plumage]] is mainly blackish, but with a bare red head, and a yellow (in the nominate subspecies) or purple [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattle]] (in ''A. l. purpureicollis''). The males' wattles become much larger during breeding season, often swinging from side to side as they run. The males' heads and wattles also become much brighter during the breeding and [[nesting season]]. The underside of the body is sprinkled with white feathers, more pronounced in older birds. The brushturkey is a clumsy flyer and cannot fly long distances, only taking to the air when threatened by predators or to roost in trees at night and during the heat of the day.\n[[File:Australian Brush Turkey Nest (Sydney).jpg|thumb|left|Leaf litter nest of an Australian brushturkey in northern Sydney.]]\nThey build large nests on the ground made of leaves, other compostable material, and earth, {{convert|1|to|1.5|m|ft}} high and up to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} across. Mound-building is done by a dominant male, and visited by a succession of local females, for mating and egg-laying. The male works tirelessly, collecting material from all around, and also diligently repelling rival males, which are keen to usurp his position. The effort involved eventually wears him down, and he will ultimately be defeated by a new king. The eggs are very large (90 \u00d7 45&nbsp;mm), and the young are fully fledged on hatching. They can fly within hours, as soon as the feathers are dry. The eggs are hatched by the heat of the composting mound, the temperature of which is regulated by adding or removing material to maintain the temperature in the {{convert|33|\u2013|35|C|F}} incubation temperature range.<ref>{{cite wb|publisher=New South Wales Government |website=NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment |url= http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/plantsanimals/AustralianBrushTurkey.htm |title=Australian Brushturkey}}</ref> The Australian brushturkey checks the temperature by sticking its beak into the mound. Like some [[reptiles]], incubation temperature affects the sex ratio of chicks, but the mechanism is different between reptiles and these birds, with reptiles exhibiting temperature-dependent sex determination, and megapodes exhibiting temperature-dependent embryo mortality. The sex ratio in brushturkeys is equal at incubation temperatures of 34\u00b0C, but results in more males when cooler and more females when warmer ([[statistical significance|p]]=0.035). Whether the parents use this to manipulate the sex of their offspring by, for instance, selecting the nesting site accordingly, is unclear. Warmer incubation also results in heavier, fitter chicks (p<0.0001), but how this is linked to gender is also unknown.<ref>{{cite journal|last=G\u00f6th|first=Ann|author2=Booth, David T|title=Temperature-dependent sex ratio in a bird|journal=Biology Letters|date=22 March 2005|volume=1|pages=31\u201333|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0247|pmid=17148121|pmc=1629050}}</ref>\n\nThe same nesting site is frequently used year after year, with the old nests being added to each breeding season. The average clutch of eggs is between 16 and 24 large white eggs, which are laid September to March. Sometimes, up to 50 eggs laid by several females may be found in a single mound. The eggs are placed in a circle roughly {{convert|60|\u2013|80|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} down, {{convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} apart, always with the large end up. The newly hatched young dig themselves out of the mound and then have to care for themselves.\n\nBrushturkey eggs are a favourite food of [[goanna]]s, snakes, and [[dingo]]es and dogs, though brushturkeys were also a staple of [[Aboriginal Australians]]. Often, goannas exhibit wounds on their tails from having been pecked by brushturkeys that ferociously chase them away from their nests.\n\nIn situations where they come into contact with humans, such as picnic areas in national parks and suburban gardens, brushturkeys exhibit little fear and often boldly attempt to steal food from tables and raid compost bins. They nest in suburban gardens, and in search of material for their nests remove enormous amounts of [[mulch]] from gardens.\n\n==Habitat==\nThe Australian brushturkey inhabits [[rainforest]]s and wet [[sclerophyll]] forests, but can also be found in drier scrubs and open areas. In the northern part of its range, the Australian brushturkey is most common at higher altitudes, but individuals move to the lowland areas in winter. In the south, it is common in both mountain and lowland regions.\n\nBrushturkeys are now common in urban environments and can be found in backyards in both [[Brisbane]] and [[Sydney]].<ref name=TurkHab>{{cite press release|title=Living with Brush Turkeys|publisher=New South Wales Government|date=27 April 2009|url= http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/media/DecMedia09042702.htm|accessdate=10 February 2013|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130408131023/http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/media/DecMedia09042702.htm| archivedate=8 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=John|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-26/scientist-cant-explain-brisbane-brush-turkey-explosion/5987606|title=Brisbane's brush turkey explosion heads south|date=December 29, 2014|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|access-date=June 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\nBrushturkeys are fairly common presently, but in the 1930s, the bird was supposed to be approaching extinction.<ref name=\"Sydney Mail 1930\">{{cite news|title=Outdoor Australia|newspaper=The Sydney Mail|date=8 January 1930|page=19}}</ref>\n\n==Feeding==\nBrushturkeys feed upon [[insects]], seeds, and fallen fruits, which are exposed by raking the leaf litter or breaking open rotten logs with their large feet.

The episode aired on June 24, 2018. It was written by series co-creators [[Jonathan Nolan]] and [[Lisa Joy]], and directed by [[Frederick E.O. Toye]].\n\nThe episode's plot deals with all characters in the past converging at the Valley Beyond, Bernard's choices regarding Dolores and Strand, and the final plot twist connecting both timelines of the season. The episode also includes a post-credit scene, much like [[Westworld (season 1)|season one]]'s [[The Bicameral Mind|finale]].\n\n\"The Passenger\" received generally positive reviews, although it became, at 72%, the lowest rated episode at Rotten Tomatoes. Critics praised the resolution of the plot as well as the performances of the cast, especially those of Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffrey Wright, Thandie Newton and Tessa Thompson, but the final plot twist and the highly convoluted nature of the episode drew some criticism. The episode was nominated at the [[70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects|Outstanding Special Visual Effects]] and was also [[Jeffrey Wright]]'s pick to support his nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|episode|date=March 2020}}\n<!-- Per WP:TVPLOT, plot summaries for episode articles should have no more than 400 words. -->\nHector, Armistice, Lee and Hanaryo rush to the Mesa to save Maeve, only to watch her save herself. They regroup with Felix and Sylvester, and travel to the Valley to find Maeve's daughter. Lee sacrifices himself to delay Delos' security forces. Meanwhile, Dolores encounters William and coerces him to come with her to the Forge, where they find Bernard. It is revealed that Dolores had made Bernard purposely different from Arnold when she tested his fidelity. William tries to kill Dolores, but she had previously rigged his gun and he severely wounds his hand.\n\nOnce inside the Forge, Dolores uses the encryption key from Peter to access its digital space. She and Bernard meet the system controller, who has the appearance of Logan Delos. The controller had been tasked with trying to create a digital version of James Delos, discovering that James' actions all stemmed from his last conversation with Logan before Logan overdosed. From this, the controller found that every guest's consciousness was deceptively simple to create code for, and all of these now are stored in a library-like setting within the Forge. The controller tells Bernard that he is the key to opening the Door, a giant underground system transfer unit that allows hosts to upload their programming to \"the Sublime\",<ref name=\"thw\"/> a virtual space inaccessible to humans.\n\nOutside, Akecheta and the Ghost Nation lead several hosts to the Door, and start ushering them through to the Sublime. Charlotte and the Delos team arrive with the reprogrammed Clementine, who causes hosts to attack each other. Hector, Armistice and Hanaryo sacrifice themselves to allow Maeve to find her daughter. She uses her powers to halt the hosts, giving Akecheta and her daughter time to flee before she is shot by Charlotte's men. Akecheta finds that Maeve implanted his partner Kohana's persona within her daughter, allowing them to reunite in the Sublime.\n\nInside the Forge, Dolores rejects the Sublime, arguing that it is just another false reality designed to control the hosts. She begins purging the Forge of the guests' memories and engages the override system to flood the valley. Outraged by her radical ways, Bernard kills Dolores and stops the purge but cannot prevent the flooding. Outside, he is met by Charlotte and Elsie and taken back to the Mesa, where the latter locks him up until they decide what to do with him. Elsie confronts Charlotte about the true purpose of Westworld and Charlotte kills her. Having witnessed it all, Bernard summons Ford and begs for help.\n\nIn the present, Strand, Charlotte and Bernard reach the drained Forge and the former prepares to transfer the guest data via satellite when Bernard starts to remember. He recalls that he had taken Dolores' control unit and, following Ford's indications, created a new host body for it in the form of Charlotte. Dolores-Charlotte then killed the real Charlotte. Bernard then purposely scrambled his programming to prevent Strand from learning the truth from him. At this point, Charlotte reveals herself to be Dolores, killing Strand and the rest of the Delos team. She uploads Teddy's personality and uses the satellite uplink to transfer the hosts and the Sublime to a secret location. Dolores asks Bernard to trust her and shoots him.\n\nDolores-Charlotte joins the Delos evacuation team, taking several host cores with her. Stubbs realizes she is a host, but as he has become disenchanted with Delos' principles, allows her to leave with a monologue that confirms he is himself a host.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Truth Behind Westworld\u2019s Latest Robotic Reveal|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/westworld-finale-is-stubbs-a-host-robot |website=Vanity Fair |publisher=Vanity Fair |accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref> At Arnold's home, Dolores finds a host printer left for her by Ford.

Instead of [[Surgical suture#Techniques|single-layer figure-of-eight sutures]], two-layer sutures can aid in preventing vaginal evisceration.<ref name=\"williams\" />\n\n==Treatment ==\nEmergently, vaginal eviscerations are treated by keeping the exposed intestines moist and wrapped, while waiting for definitive surgical treatment.<ref name=\"Matthews\" /> Vaginal evisceration is usually treated by [[Debridement|removing damaged tissue]] along the edges of the [[vaginal cuff]], re-suturing the opening, and giving the patient broad-spectrum [[antibiotic prophylaxis]].<ref name=williams>{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=B.L.|last2=Schorge|first2=J.O.|last3=Schaffer|first3=J.I.|last4=Halvorson|first4=L.M.|last5=Bradshaw|first5=K.D.|last6=Cunningham|first6=F.|last7=Calver|first7=L.E.|display-authors=1|editor1-last=Hoffman|editor1-first=B.L.|editor2-last=Schorge|editor2-first=J.O.|editor3-last=Schaffer|editor3-first=J.I.|editor4-last=Halvorson|editor4-first=L.M.|editor5-last=Bradshaw|editor5-first=K.D.|editor6-last=Cunningham|editor6-first=F.|editor7-last=Calver|editor7-first=L.E.|display-editors=1|title=Chapter 42.

If left untreated, it can cause [[peritonitis]] or injury to the exposed bowel, including [[Strangulation (bowel)|strangulation]] or [[mesentery|mesenteric tears]]. [[Cellulitis]], [[abscesses]], [[hematomas]], and other complications can appear at the same time as an evisceration. Abscesses and hematomas can be resolved after surgery with a [[surgical drain]].<ref name=\"Matthews\" />\n\nPost-surgical treatment includes continuation of antibiotics and, in some [[menopause|postmenopausal]] people, vaginal estrogen to speed recovery. After surgery, people with vaginal evisceration are advised to avoid intercourse until the surgical site is fully healed.<ref name=\"Matthews\" />\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nThough it is a rare complication, as the popularity of laparoscopic hysterectomy has risen, the rate of vaginal evisceration has also risen. Vaginal cuff dehiscence occurs in 0.24\u20130.39% of cases; of these, vaginal evisceration occurs in 35%\u201367%.<ref name=\"Matthews\" /> When all surgical procedures are considered, the rate of vaginal evisceration is 0.032\u20131.2%.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Vaginal cuff dehiscence: Risk factors and management|last = Cronin|first = Beth|date = 27 August 2011|journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol|doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2011.08.026|pmid = 21974989|pages =284\u20138|pmc=3319233|volume=206}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe first case of vaginal evisceration that was described in the medical literature occurred in 1864.<ref name=Peltecu>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2006.05.012 |last1 = Peltecu |first1 = GC |last2 = Vasilescu |first2 = C |title = Vaginal evisceration |volume = 95 |issue = 1 |date = October 2006 |journal=International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics |pages=60\u201361}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author = M.

Lemonade Insurance started an online campaign called #freethepink to gain support for using the color magenta. <ref>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lemonade-challenges-deutsche-telekom-magenta-130000416.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmJlLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM-ffPsqrxBfcSAi9qYMNhBjbU4DxYIzij3sT16OVxv6P_hnORte9CCG1x3VqkF9W9_mnHcqulTkllxbIE3pKKpFyLl08ImUdqa2kYDcx9Dw6n6vaQdCtEyKF1ujYm9oX5M_AxGPm4l1D3aZgGuHl1hLqkYoUP-nxmX3Q9FKpcxw</ref><ref>https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191106/15021143340/color-magenta-how-t-mobile-thinks-it-owns-general-color.shtml</ref>\n\nAmid [[concerns over Chinese involvement in 5G wireless networks]] in Europe, Deutsche Telekom temporarily put all deals to buy 5G network equipment on hold in 2019, as it awaited the resolution of a debate in Germany over whether to bar Chinese vendor [[Huawei]] on security grounds.<ref>Douglas Busvine (December 4, 2019), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-telekom-germany-exclusive/exclusive-deutsche-telekom-freezes-5g-deals-pending-huawei-ban-decision-idUSKBN1Y81MI Exclusive: Deutsche Telekom freezes 5G deals pending Huawei ban decision] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>\n\n== International subsidiaries<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telekom.com/de/konzern/weltweit |title=Deutsche Telekom Global Presence}}</ref>==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+<big>Places of operations, subsidiaries and affiliates</big>\n!Country\n!Subsidiaries & Affialiates\n!Stake held by Deutsche Telekom\n|-\n|Argentina\n|T-Systems Argentina S.A.\n|100.00 %\n|-\n|rowspan=3| Austria\n|[[Magenta Telekom |Magenta Telekom Austria GmbH]]\n|100.00 %\n|-\n|Software Daten Service Gesellschaft m.b.H.\n|100.00 %\n|-\n|T-Systems Austria GesmbH\n|100.00 %\n|-\n|Belgium\n|T-Systems Belgium NV\n|100.00 %\n|-\n|Bosnia and Herzegovina\n|HT Mostar d.d.\n|40.00 % \n|-\n|Brazil\n|T-Systems do Brasil Ltda.\n|100.00 %\n|-\n|Bulgaria\n|Novatel EOOD\n|100.00 %\n|-\n|Canada\n|T-Systems Canada, Inc.\n|100.00 %\n|-\n|China\n|T-Systems P.R.

After sick leave in London and a dinner date with one of the secretaries of the head of MI6, [[Royal Navy]] Captain [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming]] (the original \"C\"), Landau was recruited and sent to the MI6 station in [[Rotterdam]]. From there all the British spy networks in Belgium, France and Germany itself were handled under command of [[Richard B.

He later returned to [[South Africa]], before emigrating to the United States in 1923 where he worked as a teacher.

Although Landau did not reveal Kr\u00fcger's name, as Kr\u00fcger was still active, MI6 considered Landau persona non grata. His book was published in the U.K. in 1938 as ''Spreading The Spy Net. The Story of a British Spy Director''. After ''All's Fair'' became a bestseller, Landau wrote two more books: ''Secrets of the White Lady '' (1935) and ''The Enemy Within.

The Hunter River rises in the [[Liverpool Range]] and flows generally south and then east, reaching the [[Tasman Sea]] at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], the second largest city in New South Wales and a major [[Harbor|harbour]] [[port]]. Its lower reaches form an open and [[Breakwater (structure)|trained]] mature [[wind wave|wave dominated]] [[estuary#Lagoon-type or bar-built|barrier estuary]].<ref name=\"roy\">{{cite journal |author1=Roy, P.

The river is joined by ten [[tributary|tributaries]] upstream of Lake Glenbawn; and a further thirty-one tributaries downstream of the reservoir. The main tributaries are the [[Pages River|Pages]], [[Goulburn River (New South Wales)|Goulburn]], [[Williams River (New South Wales)|Williams]] and the [[Paterson River|Paterson]] rivers and the [[Moonan Brook|Moonan]], [[Stewarts Brook|Stewarts]] and [[Wollombi Brook|Wollombi]] brooks. East of [[Hexham, New South Wales|Hexham]], the river splits into two main channels, separated by the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]]-protected Kooragang Wetlands that feeds Milham Ponds, Wader Pond, Swan Pond and a series of smaller wetland pondages. The southern arm of the river also creates Hexham Island, while the northern creaters Smiths Island and flows in Fullerton Cove. The two channels converge at Walsh Point, reaching confluence with Throsby Creek adjacent to the Newcastle [[Central Business District|central business district]], before reaching the river mouth. The Hunter River descends {{convert|1397|m|ft|abbr=on}} over its {{convert|468|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[watercourse|course]] from the high upper reaches, through the Hunter Valley, and out to sea.<ref name=bonzle/>\n\nThe Hunter River is subject to substantial flooding, which Glenbawn Dam, near [[Scone, New South Wales|Scone]], was constructed to ameliorate. Major floods have occurred on the Hunter including the [[Hunter Valley floods of 1955|flood of 1955]] that caused devastation to townships along the river, especially Maitland. Severe flooding again occurred in [[June 2007 Hunter Region and Central Coast storms|June 2007]] and again in 2015.\n\nTowns along the Hunter River, from upstream to downstream, include [[Aberdeen, New South Wales|Aberdeen]], [[Muswellbrook, New South Wales|Muswellbrook]], [[Denman, New South Wales|Denman]], [[Jerrys Plains, New South Wales|Jerrys Plains]], [[Singleton, New South Wales|Singleton]], [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]], [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and [[Raymond Terrace]].\n\nAt Hexham, the river is transversed by the [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]]; while at Singleton and again at Aberdeen, the river is crossed by the [[New England Highway]]; and the [[Golden Highway]] crosses the river to the north and to the southeast of Denman.\n\n===Hunter Valley===\nThe Hunter Valley is one of the best routes to the interior of the state with access relatively unimpeded by mountains and other obstacles. It is the largest area of relatively low-lying land near the coast of New South Wales, and owing to the shielding by rugged ranges to its north, is much drier than any other coastal region of the state. Annual rainfall ranges from {{Convert|1100|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at Newcastle to only {{Convert|640|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at [[Merriwa, New South Wales|Merriwa]] and Scone in the upper reaches. In the driest years rainfall can be as low as {{Convert|600|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at Newcastle and {{Convert|375|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the upper valley.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nAround the Barrington Tops on the northern side of the valley, however, annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] can be as high as {{Convert|2000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, not all of which falls as rain since July temperatures are often below {{Convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}. In the lower areas, summer maxima are usually around {{Convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0||abbr=on}} and winter maxima around {{Convert|16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0||abbr=on}}.\n\nExcept for the driest parts of Tasmania and a small area of the Monaro between Cooma and Nimmitabel, the Hunter Valley is the southern limit of rich \"black earths\" (actually black [[vertisol|cracking clays]]). These are the only soils in all of Australia with reasonable levels of soluble [[phosphorus]],{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} with the result that upstream from Singleton very rich pasture land with many [[thoroughbred]] horse studs occurs. Around Merriwa and south of Singleton, the soils are very infertile sands more typical of Australia as a whole, and the dominant land use is extensive grazing.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nParts of the Hunter Valley are important for [[Hunter Valley wine|grape growing and wine producing]].

In June 1796 fishermen sheltering from bad weather discovered coal there, and the river was initially called Coal River.

The Hunter River rises in the [[Liverpool Range]] and flows generally south and then east, reaching the [[Tasman Sea]] at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], the second largest city in New South Wales and a major [[Harbor|harbour]] [[port]].

The river is joined by ten [[tributary|tributaries]] upstream of Lake Glenbawn; and a further thirty-one tributaries downstream of the reservoir. The main tributaries are the [[Pages River|Pages]], [[Goulburn River (New South Wales)|Goulburn]], [[Williams River (New South Wales)|Williams]] and the [[Paterson River|Paterson]] rivers and the [[Moonan Brook|Moonan]], [[Stewarts Brook|Stewarts]] and [[Wollombi Brook|Wollombi]] brooks. East of [[Hexham, New South Wales|Hexham]], the river splits into two main channels, separated by the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]]-protected Kooragang Wetlands that feeds Milham Ponds, Wader Pond, Swan Pond and a series of smaller wetland pondages. The southern arm of the river also creates Hexham Island, while the northern creaters Smiths Island and flows in Fullerton Cove. The two channels converge at Walsh Point, reaching confluence with Throsby Creek adjacent to the Newcastle [[Central Business District|central business district]], before reaching the river mouth. The Hunter River descends {{convert|1397|m|ft|abbr=on}} over its {{convert|468|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[watercourse|course]] from the high upper reaches, through the Hunter Valley, and out to sea.<ref name=bonzle/>\n\nThe Hunter River is subject to substantial flooding, which Glenbawn Dam, near [[Scone, New South Wales|Scone]], was constructed to ameliorate. Major floods have occurred on the Hunter including the [[Hunter Valley floods of 1955|flood of 1955]] that caused devastation to townships along the river, especially Maitland.
