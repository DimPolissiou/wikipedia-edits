Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.

Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.

This designation is not universal. Those living on the shore of Lake Superior often refer to all the other lakes as \"the lower lakes\", because they are farther south. Sailors of bulk freighters transferring cargoes from Lake Superior and northern Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to ports on Lake Erie or Ontario commonly refer to the latter as the lower lakes and Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior as the upper lakes. This corresponds to thinking of lakes Erie and Ontario as \"down south\" and the others as \"up north\".

Even late in winter, the lakes often have no icepack in the middle. The prevailing winds from the west pick up the air and moisture from the lake surface, which is slightly warmer in relation to the cold surface winds above. As the slightly warmer, moist air passes over the colder land surface, the moisture often produces concentrated, heavy snowfall that sets up in bands or \"streamers\". This is similar to the effect of warmer air dropping snow as it passes over mountain ranges. During freezing weather with high winds, the \"snow belts\" receive regular snow fall from this localized weather pattern, especially along the eastern shores of the lakes. [[Snow belt]]s are found in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, United States; and Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe lakes also moderate seasonal temperatures to some degree, but not with as large an influence as do large oceans; they absorb heat and cool the air in summer, then slowly radiate that heat in autumn. They protect against frost during transitional weather, and keep the summertime temperatures cooler than further inland. This effect can be very localized and overridden by offshore wind patterns. This temperature buffering produces areas known as \"[[Fruit Belt]]s\", where fruit can be produced that is typically grown much farther south. For instance, [[Western Michigan]] has apple and cherry orchards, and vineyards cultivated adjacent to the lake shore as far north as the [[Grand Traverse Bay]] and [[Nottawasaga Bay]] in central Ontario. The eastern shore of Lake Michigan and the southern shore of Lake Erie have many successful wineries because of the moderating effect, as does the [[Niagara Peninsula]] between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. A similar phenomenon allows wineries to flourish in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of New York, as well as in [[Prince Edward County, Ontario]] on Lake Ontario's northeast shore. Related to the lake effect is the regular occurrence of [[fog]] over medium-sized areas, particularly along the shorelines of the lakes. This is most noticeable along Lake Superior's shores.\n\nThe Great Lakes have been observed to help intensify storms, such as [[Hurricane Hazel]] in 1954, and the [[2011 Goderich, Ontario tornado]], which moved onshore as a tornadic waterspout. In 1996 a rare tropical or subtropical storm was observed forming in Lake Huron, dubbed the [[1996 Lake Huron cyclone]]. Rather large severe thunderstorms covering wide areas are well known in the Great Lakes during mid-summer; these [[Mesoscale convective complex]]es or MCCs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=m|title=Glossary |publisher= NOAA's National Weather Service}}</ref> can cause damage to wide swaths of forest and shatter glass in city buildings. These storms mainly occur during the night, and the systems sometimes have small embedded tornadoes, but more often straight-line winds accompanied by intense lightning.\n\n==Ecology==\n\n[[File:USGS image cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Generalized schematic of Great Lakes waterline ecosystem]]\n\nHistorically, the Great Lakes, in addition to their [[lake ecology]], were surrounded by various [[forest]] [[ecoregion]]s (except in a relatively small area of southeast Lake Michigan where savanna or prairie occasionally intruded). Logging, urbanization, and agriculture uses have changed that relationship. In the early 21st century, Lake Superior's shores are 91% forested, Lake Huron 68%, Lake Ontario 49%, Lake Michigan 41%, and Lake Erie, where logging and urbanization has been most extensive, 21%. Some of these forests are second or third growth (i.e. they have been logged before, changing their composition). At least 13 wildlife species are documented as becoming extinct since the arrival of Europeans, and many more are threatened or endangered.<ref name=Grady/> Meanwhile, exotic and invasive species have also been introduced.\n\n===Fauna===\n{{see also|Great Lakes Areas of Concern#Invasive species|Category:Fauna of the Great Lakes region (North America)|Category:Fish of the Great Lakes|Asian carp in North America}}\n[[File:Lakesturgeon public U.S.Fish&Wildlife.jpg|thumb|[[Lake sturgeon]], the largest native fish in the Great Lakes and the subject of extensive commercial fishing in the 19th and 20th centuries is listed as a threatened species<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/sturgeon/biology.htm|title=Great Lakes Lake Sturgeon Web Site|author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|work=fws.gov}}</ref>]]\nWhile the organisms living on the bottom of shallow waters are similar to those found in smaller lakes, the deep waters contain organisms found only in deep, cold lakes of the northern latitudes.

In the early 19th century, the government of [[Upper Canada]] found it necessary to introduce similar legislation prohibiting the use of weirs and nets at the mouths of Lake Ontario's tributaries. Other protective legislation was passed, as well, but enforcement remained difficult.<ref name=\"Bogue2001m\">{{cite book|author=Margaret Beattie Bogue|title=Fishing the Great Lakes: An Environmental History, 1783\u20131933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn7IlRl8DhsC&pg=PA180|year=2001|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-16763-9|page=180}}</ref>\n\nOn both sides of the Canada\u2013United States border, the proliferation of [[dam]]s and impoundments have multiplied, necessitating more regulatory efforts.

Many of the larger cities owe their existence to their position on the lakes as a freight destination as well as for being a magnet for immigrants. After railroads and surface roads developed, the freight and passenger businesses dwindled and, except for ferries and a few foreign cruise ships, have now vanished.\nThe immigration routes still have an effect today. Immigrants often formed their own communities and some areas have a pronounced ethnicity, such as Dutch, German, Polish, Finnish, and many others. Since many immigrants settled for a time in New England before moving westward, many areas on the U.S. side of the Great Lakes also have a New England feel, especially in home styles and accent.\n[[File:Eastland Christopher Columbus leaving Chicago ca1912.jpg|thumb|The ''[[SS Eastland|Eastland]]'' leaving Chicago, c. 1909]]\nSince general freight these days is transported by railroads and trucks, domestic ships mostly move bulk cargoes, such as [[iron ore]], [[coal]] and [[limestone]] for the [[steel]] industry. The domestic bulk freight developed because of the nearby mines. It was more economical to transport the ingredients for steel to centralized plants rather than try to make steel on the spot. Grain exports are also a major cargo on the lakes.\n\nIn the 19th century and early 20th centuries, iron and other ores such as copper were shipped south on (downbound ships), and supplies, food, and coal were shipped north (upbound). Because of the location of the coal fields in Pennsylvania and [[West Virginia]], and the general northeast track of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], railroads naturally developed shipping routes that went due north to ports such as [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] and [[Ashtabula, Ohio]].\n\nBecause the lake maritime community largely developed independently, it has some distinctive vocabulary. Ships, no matter the size, are called ''boats''. When the sailing ships gave way to steamships, they were called ''steamboats''\u2014the same term used on the Mississippi. The ships also have a distinctive design (see [[Lake freighter]]). Ships that primarily trade on the lakes are known as ''[[Lake freighter|lakers]]''. Foreign boats are known as ''salties''. One of the more common sights on the lakes has been since about 1950 the 1,000\u2011by\u2011105-foot (305-by-32-meter), {{convert|78850|LT|metric ton|adj=on}} self-unloader.

McCullough has written that the fishing industry of the Great Lakes got its start \"on the American side of Lake Ontario in [[Chaumont Bay]], near the [[Maumee River]] on Lake Erie, and on the [[Detroit River]] at about the time of the [[War of 1812]].\" Although the region was sparsely populated until the 1830s, so there was not much local demand and transporting fish was still prohibitively costly, there were economic and infrastructure developments that were promising for the future of the fishing industry going into the 1830s. Particularly, the 1825 opening of the [[Erie Canal]] and the [[Welland Canal]] a few years later. The fishing industry expanded particularly in the waters associated with the [[fur trade]] that connect Lake Erie and Lake Huron. In fact, two major suppliers of fish in the 1830s were the fur trading companies [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the [[American Fur Company]].<ref name=\"bogue\">{{cite book |last1=Bogue |first1=Magaret Beattie |title=Fishing the Great Lakes: An Environmental History, 1783-1933 |date=2000 |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press |pages=29\u201331}}</ref>\n\nThe catch from these waters would be sent to the growing market for [[salted fish]] in [[Detroit]], where merchants involved in the fur trade had already gained some experience handling salted fish. One such merchant was [[John P. Clark]], a [[shipbuilder]] and merchant who began selling fish in the area of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin]] where [[Lake whitefish|whitefish]] was abundant. Another operation cropped up in [[Georgian Bay]], Canadian waters plentiful with [[trout]] as well as whitefish. In 1831, [[Alexander MacGregor]] from [[Goderich, Ontario]] found whitefish and [[herring]] in unusually abundant supply around the Fishing Islands. A contemporary account by [[Methodist]] missionary John Evans describes the fish as resembling a \"bright cloud moving rapidly through the water\".<ref name=\"bogue\" />\n\n===Shipping===\nExcept when the water is frozen during winter, more than 100 lake freighters operate continuously on the Great Lakes,{{r|clui}} which remain a major [[water transport]] corridor for bulk goods. The [[Great Lakes Waterway]] connects all the lakes; the smaller [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] connects the lakes to the Atlantic oceans. Some [[lake freighter]]s are too large to use the Seaway, and operate only on the Waterway and lakes.\n\nIn 2002, 162 million net [[ton]]s of dry bulk cargo were moved on the Lakes. This was, in order of volume: iron ore, grain and [[potash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatlakesports.org/industry-overview/cargoes/|title=Great Lake Seaway Cargoes \u2013 American Great Lakes Ports Association|website=www.greatlakesports.org}}</ref> The iron ore and much of the stone and coal are used in the steel industry. There is also some shipping of liquid and containerized cargo but most container ships cannot pass the locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway because the ships are too wide.\n\nOnly four bridges are on the Great Lakes other than Lake Ontario because of the cost of building structures high enough for ships to pass under.

Since that time, the eight Great Lakes Governors and the Premiers of Ontario and Quebec have negotiated the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Agreement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cglg.org/projects/water/docs/12-13-05/Great_Lakes-St_Lawrence_River_Basin_Sustainable_Water_Resources_Agreement.pdf |title=Great Lakes\u2014St |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref> and the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact<ref>[http://www.cglg.org/projects/water/docs/12-13-05/Great_Lakes-St_Lawrence_River_Basin_Water_Resources_Compact.pdf Agreement. Great Lakes-St Lawrence River Basin Water Resources]. cglg.org. December 13, 2005</ref> that would prevent most future diversion proposals and all long-distance ones. The agreements strengthen protection against abusive water withdrawal practices within the Great Lakes basin. On December 13, 2005, the Governors and Premiers signed these two agreements, the first of which is between all ten jurisdictions. It is somewhat more detailed and protective, though its legal strength has not yet been tested in court. The second, the [[Great Lakes Compact]], has been approved by the state legislatures of all eight states that border the Great Lakes as well as the U.S. Congress, and was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on October 3, 2008.<ref>[http://www.greatlakes.org/Page.aspx?pid=526 Back to Water Conservation]. www.greatlakes.org</ref>\n\nThe Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, described as \"the largest investment in the Great Lakes in two decades\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greatlakesrestoration.us/ |title=Great Lakes Restoration Initiative home page |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206222143/http://greatlakesrestoration.us/ |archivedate=February 6, 2016 |df= }}</ref> was funded at $475&nbsp;million in the U.S. federal government's Fiscal Year 2011 budget, and $300&nbsp;million in the Fiscal Year 2012 budget.

This designation is not universal. Those living on the shore of Lake Superior often refer to all the other lakes as \"the lower lakes\", because they are farther south. Sailors of bulk freighters transferring cargoes from Lake Superior and northern Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to ports on Lake Erie or Ontario commonly refer to the latter as the lower lakes and Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior as the upper lakes.

Even late in winter, the lakes often have no icepack in the middle. The prevailing winds from the west pick up the air and moisture from the lake surface, which is slightly warmer in relation to the cold surface winds above. As the slightly warmer, moist air passes over the colder land surface, the moisture often produces concentrated, heavy snowfall that sets up in bands or \"streamers\". This is similar to the effect of warmer air dropping snow as it passes over mountain ranges. During freezing weather with high winds, the \"snow belts\" receive regular snow fall from this localized weather pattern, especially along the eastern shores of the lakes. [[Snow belt]]s are found in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, United States; and Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe lakes also moderate seasonal temperatures to some degree, but not with as large an influence as do large oceans; they absorb heat and cool the air in summer, then slowly radiate that heat in autumn. They protect against frost during transitional weather, and keep the summertime temperatures cooler than further inland. This effect can be very localized and overridden by offshore wind patterns. This temperature buffering produces areas known as \"[[Fruit Belt]]s\", where fruit can be produced that is typically grown much farther south. For instance, [[Western Michigan]] has apple and cherry orchards, and vineyards cultivated adjacent to the lake shore as far north as the [[Grand Traverse Bay]] and [[Nottawasaga Bay]] in central Ontario. The eastern shore of Lake Michigan and the southern shore of Lake Erie have many successful wineries because of the moderating effect, as does the [[Niagara Peninsula]] between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. A similar phenomenon allows wineries to flourish in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of New York, as well as in [[Prince Edward County, Ontario]] on Lake Ontario's northeast shore. Related to the lake effect is the regular occurrence of [[fog]] over medium-sized areas, particularly along the shorelines of the lakes. This is most noticeable along Lake Superior's shores.\n\nThe Great Lakes have been observed to help intensify storms, such as [[Hurricane Hazel]] in 1954, and the [[2011 Goderich, Ontario tornado]], which moved onshore as a tornadic waterspout. In 1996 a rare tropical or subtropical storm was observed forming in Lake Huron, dubbed the [[1996 Lake Huron cyclone]]. Rather large severe thunderstorms covering wide areas are well known in the Great Lakes during mid-summer; these [[Mesoscale convective complex]]es or MCCs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=m|title=Glossary |publisher= NOAA's National Weather Service}}</ref> can cause damage to wide swaths of forest and shatter glass in city buildings. These storms mainly occur during the night, and the systems sometimes have small embedded tornadoes, but more often straight-line winds accompanied by intense lightning.\n\n==Ecology==\n\n[[File:USGS image cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Generalized schematic of Great Lakes waterline ecosystem]]\n\nHistorically, the Great Lakes, in addition to their [[lake ecology]], were surrounded by various [[forest]] [[ecoregion]]s (except in a relatively small area of southeast Lake Michigan where savanna or prairie occasionally intruded). Logging, urbanization, and agriculture uses have changed that relationship. In the early 21st century, Lake Superior's shores are 91% forested, Lake Huron 68%, Lake Ontario 49%, Lake Michigan 41%, and Lake Erie, where logging and urbanization has been most extensive, 21%. Some of these forests are second or third growth (i.e. they have been logged before, changing their composition). At least 13 wildlife species are documented as becoming extinct since the arrival of Europeans, and many more are threatened or endangered.<ref name=Grady/> Meanwhile, exotic and invasive species have also been introduced.\n\n===Fauna===\n{{see also|Great Lakes Areas of Concern#Invasive species|Category:Fauna of the Great Lakes region (North America)|Category:Fish of the Great Lakes|Asian carp in North America}}\n[[File:Lakesturgeon public U.S.Fish&Wildlife.jpg|thumb|[[Lake sturgeon]], the largest native fish in the Great Lakes and the subject of extensive commercial fishing in the 19th and 20th centuries is listed as a threatened species<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/sturgeon/biology.htm|title=Great Lakes Lake Sturgeon Web Site|author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|work=fws.gov}}</ref>]]\nWhile the organisms living on the bottom of shallow waters are similar to those found in smaller lakes, the deep waters contain organisms found only in deep, cold lakes of the northern latitudes. These include the delicate opossum shrimp (order [[mysida]]), the [[deepwater scud]] (a crustacean of the order [[amphipoda]]), two types of [[copepods]], and the [[deepwater sculpin]] (a spiny, large-headed fish).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Great-Lakes |title=Great Lakes |last1=Beeton |first1=Alfred |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=January 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Lakes are an important source of [[fishing]]. Early European settlers were astounded by both the variety and quantity of fish; there were 150 different species in the Great Lakes.<ref name=\"Grady\" /> Throughout history, fish populations were the early indicator of the condition of the Lakes and have remained one of the key indicators even in the current era of sophisticated analyses and measuring instruments.

In the early 19th century, the government of [[Upper Canada]] found it necessary to introduce similar legislation prohibiting the use of weirs and nets at the mouths of Lake Ontario's tributaries. Other protective legislation was passed, as well, but enforcement remained difficult.<ref name=\"Bogue2001m\">{{cite book|author=Margaret Beattie Bogue|title=Fishing the Great Lakes: An Environmental History, 1783\u20131933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn7IlRl8DhsC&pg=PA180|year=2001|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-16763-9|page=180}}</ref>\n\nOn both sides of the Canada\u2013United States border, the proliferation of [[dam]]s and impoundments have multiplied, necessitating more regulatory efforts.

Within the past ten years mercury has become more apparent in water tests. Mercury compounds have been used in paper mills to prevent slime from forming during their production, and chemical companies have used mercury to separate chlorine from brine solutions. Studies conducted by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have shown that when the mercury comes in contact with many of the bacteria and compounds in the fresh water, it forms the compound [[Methylmercury|methyl mercury]], which has a much greater impact on human health than elemental mercury due to a higher propensity for absorption. This form of mercury is not detrimental to a majority of fish types, but is very detrimental to people and other wildlife animals who consume the fish. Mercury has been known for health related problems such as birth defects in humans and animals, and the near extinction of eagles in the Great Lakes region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/factsheets/mercuryspills.htm |title=Mercury Spills |publisher=Idph.state.il.us |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Sewage ====\nThe amount of raw sewage dumped into the waters was the primary focus of both the first [[Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement]] and federal laws passed in both countries during the 1970s.

Nonetheless, both nations maintain coast guard vessels in the Great Lakes.\n\nDuring settlement, the Great Lakes and its rivers were the only practical means of moving people and freight.

Many of the larger cities owe their existence to their position on the lakes as a freight destination as well as for being a magnet for immigrants. After railroads and surface roads developed, the freight and passenger businesses dwindled and, except for ferries and a few foreign cruise ships, have now vanished.\nThe immigration routes still have an effect today. Immigrants often formed their own communities and some areas have a pronounced ethnicity, such as Dutch, German, Polish, Finnish, and many others. Since many immigrants settled for a time in New England before moving westward, many areas on the U.S. side of the Great Lakes also have a New England feel, especially in home styles and accent.\n[[File:Eastland Christopher Columbus leaving Chicago ca1912.jpg|thumb|The ''[[SS Eastland|Eastland]]'' leaving Chicago, c. 1909]]\nSince general freight these days is transported by railroads and trucks, domestic ships mostly move bulk cargoes, such as [[iron ore]], [[coal]] and [[limestone]] for the [[steel]] industry. The domestic bulk freight developed because of the nearby mines. It was more economical to transport the ingredients for steel to centralized plants rather than try to make steel on the spot. Grain exports are also a major cargo on the lakes.\n\nIn the 19th century and early 20th centuries, iron and other ores such as copper were shipped south on (downbound ships), and supplies, food, and coal were shipped north (upbound). Because of the location of the coal fields in Pennsylvania and [[West Virginia]], and the general northeast track of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], railroads naturally developed shipping routes that went due north to ports such as [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] and [[Ashtabula, Ohio]].\n\nBecause the lake maritime community largely developed independently, it has some distinctive vocabulary. Ships, no matter the size, are called ''boats''. When the sailing ships gave way to steamships, they were called ''steamboats''\u2014the same term used on the Mississippi. The ships also have a distinctive design (see [[Lake freighter]]). Ships that primarily trade on the lakes are known as ''[[Lake freighter|lakers]]''. Foreign boats are known as ''salties''.

Particularly, the 1825 opening of the [[Erie Canal]] and the [[Welland Canal]] a few years later. The fishing industry expanded particularly in the waters associated with the [[fur trade]] that connect Lake Erie and Lake Huron. In fact, two major suppliers of fish in the 1830s were the fur trading companies [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the [[American Fur Company]].<ref name=\"bogue\">{{cite book |last1=Bogue |first1=Magaret Beattie |title=Fishing the Great Lakes: An Environmental History, 1783-1933 |date=2000 |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press |pages=29\u201331}}</ref>\n\nThe catch from these waters would be sent to the growing market for [[salted fish]] in [[Detroit]], where merchants involved in the fur trade had already gained some experience handling salted fish. One such merchant was [[John P. Clark]], a [[shipbuilder]] and merchant who began selling fish in the area of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin]] where [[Lake whitefish|whitefish]] was abundant. Another operation cropped up in [[Georgian Bay]], Canadian waters plentiful with [[trout]] as well as whitefish. In 1831, [[Alexander MacGregor]] from [[Goderich, Ontario]] found whitefish and [[herring]] in unusually abundant supply around the Fishing Islands. A contemporary account by [[Methodist]] missionary John Evans describes the fish as resembling a \"bright cloud moving rapidly through the water\".<ref name=\"bogue\" />\n\n===Shipping===\nExcept when the water is frozen during winter, more than 100 lake freighters operate continuously on the Great Lakes,{{r|clui}} which remain a major [[water transport]] corridor for bulk goods. The [[Great Lakes Waterway]] connects all the lakes; the smaller [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] connects the lakes to the Atlantic oceans. Some [[lake freighter]]s are too large to use the Seaway, and operate only on the Waterway and lakes.\n\nIn 2002, 162 million net [[ton]]s of dry bulk cargo were moved on the Lakes.

Concerns over diversion of Lake water are of concern to both Americans and Canadians. Some water is diverted through the [[Chicago River]] to operate the [[Illinois Waterway]] but the flow is limited by treaty. Possible schemes for bottled water plants and diversion to dry regions of the continent raise concerns.

Since that time, the eight Great Lakes Governors and the Premiers of Ontario and Quebec have negotiated the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Agreement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cglg.org/projects/water/docs/12-13-05/Great_Lakes-St_Lawrence_River_Basin_Sustainable_Water_Resources_Agreement.pdf |title=Great Lakes\u2014St |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref> and the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact<ref>[http://www.cglg.org/projects/water/docs/12-13-05/Great_Lakes-St_Lawrence_River_Basin_Water_Resources_Compact.pdf Agreement.

The agreements strengthen protection against abusive water withdrawal practices within the Great Lakes basin. On December 13, 2005, the Governors and Premiers signed these two agreements, the first of which is between all ten jurisdictions. It is somewhat more detailed and protective, though its legal strength has not yet been tested in court. The second, the [[Great Lakes Compact]], has been approved by the state legislatures of all eight states that border the Great Lakes as well as the U.S. Congress, and was signed into law by President [[George W.

In December 1858, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]], High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\n\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei.

He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, [[Huangshi|Daye]] Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education.

In one legend, the Baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away.

Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities.

During the [[Second Opium War]] (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the [[Treaties of Tianjin]] and the [[Convention of Peking]], which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]], High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\n\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei.

He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, [[Huangshi|Daye]] Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education.

Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the ''Zhongshan'' has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban [[Jiangxia District]], which opened on September 26, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newscontent.cctv.com/news.jsp?fileId=117667|title=HOME-CCTVPLUS|website=newscontent.cctv.com}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAs a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinaww2.com/2015/09/12/the-us-firebombing-of-wuhan-part-1/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218210230/http://www.chinaww2.com/2015/09/12/the-us-firebombing-of-wuhan-part-1/ |archive-date=February 18, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city.<ref name=\"Fenby, Jonathan page 447\">Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York: Carroll & Graf, 2004 page 447.</ref> For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city.

From June to September 1954, the [[1954 Yangtze River floods|Yangtze River Floods]] were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\n\nBefore construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], [[Hunslet Engine Company]] built two extra heavy [[0-8-0]] locomotives for loading the [[Train ferry|train ferries]] for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan. \n\nThe project of building the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway]] with the [[Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway]] into the [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway]], making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862}}}}) in name and in fact.\n\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=Li Rui wen ji.|last=1917-|first=Li, Rui|last2=1917-|first2=\u674e\u9510|date=2007|publisher=Xianggang she hui ke xue jiao yu chu ban you xian gong si|isbn=9789889958114|location=[Xianggang]|pages=|oclc=688480117}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the [[Wuhan Incident]] (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Thomas W.

In one legend, the Baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

With the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an observant Jews in modern time in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of Jewish scholars such as [[Maimonides]], [[Nachmanides]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and many more.\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Blumenzweig]], the other rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva are  Rabbi [[Uriel Eitam]], Rabbi Chaim Wolfson, Rabbi Shai Gnizi, Rabbi Shmuel Gleizer, Rabbi Achiya Ben Pazi, Rabbi Shmuel Ariel and Rabbi Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.[[File:Hayeshiva.jpg|thumb|Lunch room of the Yeshiva]]'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the afternoon seder, the yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas. With the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an observant Jews in modern time in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of Jewish scholars such as [[Maimonides]], [[Nachmanides]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and many more.\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Blumenzweig]], the other rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva are  Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

A year later in 1997, two additional cars were purchased.  To generate additional revenues, the company started in 1899 a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' and four years later in 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new company called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, the company could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute that electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would generate additional revenues by providing its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters which it powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility, and it was not until forty years later in 1977, did [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decide to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$ 4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors, which were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] (now Enbridge) to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity, including Cornwall.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the power dam to the city were for the first time powered with electricity generated by the local power plant.  There were three wires and all were weighed down and covered with ice.  Two of the three wires were dangerously close to each other, until a Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires, allowing workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other. For the first and only time in history, this permitted [[Ontario Hydro]] with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the 1998 ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds and later in 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$ 25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, the fund was also setup to only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

The cost of the project was CA$3 million which along with its financing would be recouped from the energy savings in switching to LED coupled with a lower maintenance cost.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Contraversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to also convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  At a special council meeting on January 24 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter.

That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' and four years later in 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new company called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, the company could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute that electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would generate additional revenues by providing its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters which it powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility, and it was not until forty years later in 1977, did [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decide to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$ 4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors, which were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] (now Enbridge) to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity, including Cornwall.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the power dam to the city were for the first time powered with electricity generated by the local power plant.  There were three wires and all were weighed down and covered with ice.  Two of the three wires were dangerously close to each other, until a Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires, allowing workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other. For the first and only time in history, this permitted [[Ontario Hydro]] with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the 1998 ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds and later in 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$ 25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, the fund was also setup to only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.  Over the years, interest generated by the fund has been used in part for the redevelopment of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, the establishment of a [[hospice]], the building of an aquatic centre, and for mortgage payments on the city's new sports complex the Benson Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/09/24/cornwall-hit-sweet-spot-in-98-sale-of-cornwall-electric/|title=Cornwall hit \u2018sweet spot\u2019 in \u201998 sale of Cornwall Electric|last=Editor|date=2019-09-24|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Fortis Inc. ===\nIn May 2002, [[Enbridge|Enbridge Energy Distribution Inc.]] announced that it had agreed to sell ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' to [[Fortis Inc.|Fortic Inc.]] in a cash deal worth CA$67 million. Both the Canadian [[Competition Bureau (Canada)|Competition Bureau]] and the Ontario Energy Board approved the sale which Fortis Inc. concluded on October 18, 2002.\u00a0 Fortis Inc. which has its roots in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John Newfoundland]] and is today an international company, operates Cornwall Electric under its Ontario subsidiary, Fortis Ontario Inc.\n\n=== LED lighting ===\nIn 2016, after an initial test run in certain areas, the City of Cornwall which still owns the utility poles and lights, contracted crews to convert approximate 5,000 street lamps that were using the older [[Sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-vapour lamps]] which typically lasted six years, to the more energy efficient [[LED lamp|LED bulbs]] that could last as long as twenty years.  The cost of the project was CA$3 million which along with its financing would be recouped from the energy savings in switching to LED coupled with a lower maintenance cost.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Contraversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to also convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  At a special council meeting on January 24 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter.  In an email published in the [[Cornwall Seaway News]], the councillor stated:  \u201c''The big issue is this is a real savings that once we have transferred maintenance and future replacement cost to reserves we can then pass that savings along to rate payers, who in fact have these lights worked into their property taxes. It\u2019s a true savings we miss out on every month we pay the bill and Cornwall Electric doesn\u2019t come to the table''.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2020/01/27/sg-council-considers-not-paying-cornwall-electric-bill/|title=SG Council considers not paying Cornwall Electric bill|date=2020-01-27|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Cornwall, Ontario]]\n* [[Cornwall Street Railway]]\n* [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]]\n\n== Footnote ==\nAs of 2017, the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) no longer includes Cornwall Ontario in its [https://www.oeb.ca/_html/performance/rates_chart.php electricity rate comparison charts].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.cornwallelectric.com/ Official website]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/Cornwall-Electric-407144872778622/ Facebook site]\n* [https://twitter.com/CE_electric?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor Twitter site]\n* [https://theseeker.ca/2017/02/history-cornwall-cotton-mills/ History of the Cornwall Cotton Mills]\n\n{{portalbar|Canada|Companies|Lists}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Canadian electric utilities}}\n[[Category:Electric power-related lists]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTransmission:Added missing word.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall_Electric"}
