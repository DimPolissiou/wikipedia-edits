After Garvey's departure a year later, she was replaced by Ann Abernathy, who in turn, left in 1985 to return to [[Los Angeles]]. That year, [[Kathie Lee Gifford|Kathie Lee Johnson]] (who would marry [[Frank Gifford]] a year later) became Philbin's new co-host.\n\nIn 1988, [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]] began syndicating the show nationally as ''Live with Regis and Kathie Lee''. Gifford left the show in 2000 and was eventually replaced by [[Kelly Ripa]]. Philbin left the show in November 2011 and the show aired for nearly a year as ''Live! with Kelly'' until former [[New York Giants]] defensive end [[Michael Strahan]] became Ripa's permanent co-host in September 2012. In May 2016, Strahan left the show to become a full-time anchor at ''Good Morning America'', thus leaving Ripa as the solo host again. On May 1, 2017, it was announced that [[Ryan Seacrest]] would become the new host of the show; in order to accommodate his syndicated radio show ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]'' (which normally originates from Los Angeles), an additional studio was built within WABC's facilities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ryan Seacrest Tapped as Kelly Ripa's Permanent Co-Host on 'Live'|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/ryan-seacrest-kelly-ripa-co-host-live-with-kelly-and-ryan-1202404490/|website=Variety|accessdate=May 9, 2017|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sports programming===\n\nWABC-TV serves as the local over-the-air broadcaster of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games involving the New York Giants and the [[New York Jets]], airing simulcasts of the team's ESPN-televised games (WABC-TV's corporate parent, The Walt Disney Company, holds an 80% majority ownership stake in ESPN, and the ABC Owned Television Stations have right of first refusal for simulcasts of ESPN's [[National Football League|NFL]] telecasts within a team's home market). Because of this, atypical for a network-owned station outside of [[breaking news]] and severe weather coverage necessitating such situations, the station has had to reschedule ABC network programs preempted by the telecasts. The preseason and Monday night telecasts mark the only NFL games to have aired on WABC-TV since ABC lost the rights to NFL games in 2006. ''Monday Night Football'' telecasts involving the Giants or Jets that are not carried by WABC-TV are sublicensed to [[WPIX]].<ref name=\"wpix-mnf\">{{cite news |title=PIX11 to air three Monday night football games this season, starting with Jets vs. Browns tonight |url=https://pix11.com/2019/09/16/pix11-to-air-three-monday-night-football-games-this-season-starting-with-jets-vs-browns-tonight/ |accessdate=October 23, 2019 |publisher=[[WPIX]] |date=September 16, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> The station carried coverage of the Giants' victory in [[Super Bowl XXV]].\n\nSince 2013, WABC-TV serves as the exclusive local English-language carrier of the annual [[New York City Marathon]], which the station airs live, highlights air via [[ESPN on ABC]]. The station preempts a weekend edition of ''Good Morning America'' and delays ''This Week'' to schedule time for the live broadcast. The marathon is also simulcast on [[ESPN2]] nationally (although viewers in the WABC-TV viewing area cannot see it via ESPN2 because the simulcast is blacked out locally).\n\nWABC-TV currently airs any [[New York Knicks]] and [[Brooklyn Nets]] games televised via the ''[[NBA on ABC]]''. The station has aired the Knicks' appearances in the [[1970 NBA Finals|1970]], [[1972 NBA Finals|1972]] and [[1973 NBA Finals]] (where the Knicks won in 1970 and 1973), as well as the then-New Jersey Nets' appearance in the [[2003 NBA Finals]].\n\n==News operation==\nWABC-TV presently broadcasts 43 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and 5\u00bd hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station partners with Philadelphia sister station, WPVI-TV \u2013 which popularized the ''[[Action News]]'' format \u2013 in the production and broadcast of statewide [[New Jersey]] political debates. When the two stations broadcast a statewide office debate, such as for [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]] or [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], they'll pool resources and have anchors or reporters from both stations participate in the debate. Additionally, the two stations share coverage of news from New Jersey where their markets overlap, pooling reporters, live trucks and helicopters.\n\n===Beginning to 1999===\n[[File:WABC Eyewitness News 2013.png|thumb|right|Channel 7 ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' at 11:00 p.m. open, used from August 8, 2011 \u2013 May 3, 2016]]\nWABC-TV launched ''Report to New York'', its first regular news program, on October 26, 1959, featuring [[Scott Vincent]] with news, [[Howard Cosell]] with sports, and Lynn Dollar with weather. ''Report to New York'' aired Monday through Friday at 11:00&nbsp;p.m. By January 1961, channel 7 expanded ''Report to New York'' with a 15-minute early edition at 6:15 p.m. on weeknights, and on Saturday and Sunday evenings.\n\nOn October 22, 1962, WABC-TV expanded its weeknight news to 45-minutes, and retitled it ''The Big News''. Newcomers [[Bill Beutel]] and Jim Barnes were the anchors, with Cosell continuing on sports and Rosemary Haley as \"weather girl\". However, this effort failed to draw viewers from ratings leader [[WCBS-TV]] and second-place [[WNBC]].\n\nIn early 1968, Beutel left the station to become the [[London]] bureau chief for [[ABC News]] and was replaced by [[Roger Grimsby]], who was transferred by ABC from [[San Francisco]] sister station [[KGO-TV]]. In a complete revamp, Grimsby was joined by [[Tex Antoine]] doing weather, celebrity gossip columnist [[Rona Barrett]], ''[[New York Daily News]]'' columnist [[Jimmy Breslin]] with political commentary and reviews by [[Martin Bookspan]] and Allan Jeffries, while Cosell continued doing sports. Known as ''Roger Grimsby and the Noisemakers'', this format didn't help the ratings, which plunged to an all-time low.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2003/05/giving-witness-to-eyewitness-n/|title=Giving Witness to Eyewitness News|last=Primo|first=Al|date=May 19, 2003|work=TVWeek.com|access-date=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nLater that year, newly hired news director [[Al Primo]] brought to WABC-TV the [[Eyewitness News]] format, in which reporters present their stories directly to the viewers. Having experienced great success introducing the format during his time at [[KYW-TV]] in Philadelphia, Primo this time added a twist \u2013 a degree of conversational chatter among the anchors, known as \"happy talk\". The \"Tar Sequence\" cue from the musical score of the [[1967 in film|1967 film]] ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'', composed by [[Lalo Schifrin]], was introduced as the theme music. The score included a telegraphic-style melody appropriate for a newscast. The ''Eyewitness News'' format and theme music were quickly adopted by ABC's other four owned-and-operated stations at the time: KGO-TV, WLS-TV in Chicago, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles (though KGO-TV and WXYZ-TV didn't use the ''Eyewitness News'' title for their programs). The format quickly rejuvenated a station that had long been an also-ran to WCBS-TV and WNBC-TV. Within a year, Channel 7 had shot to first place in the ratings for the first time in its history, displacing longtime leader WCBS-TV. It spent most of the decade going back and forth with WCBS-TV for first place. For a time in the 1980s, it fell into last place, but still fought with WNBC-TV for second place.\n\nRetaining only Grimsby, Cosell and Antoine from the earlier ''Noisemakers'' format, Primo also hired [[Tom Dunn (journalist)|Tom Dunn]] away from WCBS-TV to serve as Grimsby's co-anchor. After Dunn departed for [[WOR-TV]] in 1970, Bill Beutel returned to the station as his replacement and for the next 16 years, Grimsby and Beutel were the faces of ''Eyewitness News''.\n\nThe Grimsby-Beutel team were split up for several months in 1975 after ABC had reassigned Beutel to its new morning show, ''[[AM America]]'' that January. The station brought in WXYZ-TV's [[Bill Bonds]] and veteran [[Boston]] anchor [[Tom Ellis (journalist)|Tom Ellis]] to help replace Beutel, with Grimsby teaming with Ellis at 6:00 p.m. and Bonds at 11:00 p.m.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gardella |first=Kay |date=August 20, 1975 |title=TV's local news front undergoes some changes |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/395918532/ |work=Daily News |location=New York, NY |access-date=April 30, 2019 }}{{paywall}}</ref> When ''AM America'' was canceled and replaced with ''Good Morning America'' in November 1975, Beutel was re-teamed with Grimsby at 6:00 p.m., with Ellis joining Bonds at 11:00 p.m..

Applegate claimed credit for taking WLS-TV from last to first in only two years and ABC hoped he could work the same magic at the flagship station. In the wake of declining ratings, Grimsby was fired on April 16, 1986, a move for which Applegate drew considerable ire and Grimsby was quickly hired by rival WNBC-TV. In 1987, Channel 7 surged back into first place. It has been the ratings leader in New York City since then, and has grown to become the most-watched broadcast television station in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/channel---tv-station-new-york-nation--nielsen-sweep/ |title=Nielsen Sweep |publisher=FOX Business |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212112032/http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/channel---tv-station-new-york-nation--nielsen-sweep/ |archivedate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> Beutel stepped down from the anchor desk in 2001, which concluded the longest tenure for a main anchor in New York City television history at that time. His record has since been surpassed by WNBC's Chuck Scarborough and [[WXTV-DT|WXTV]]'s Rafael Pineda. Scarborough's uninterrupted run behind the desk is the longest in New York television (since 1974). Pineda is second, having started with WXTV in 1972, retiring in 2013 after 41 years.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nWABC-TV's news department is respected for its straightforward presentation (especially during breaking news). For the last decade, it has waged a spirited battle for first place, but for most of the time has held onto the lead, helped in part by lead-ins from highly rated talk and entertainment shows. For over 24 years (December 1986 to May 2011), the lead-in for the 5:00 p.m. ''Eyewitness News'' broadcast had been ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' at 4:00 p.m. and its strong ratings brought viewers along to the 5:00 p.m. newscast.\n\nThe newscasts were replayed on one of channel 7's digital subchannels, another which also carried a local weather and news channel. WABC-TV's website had a link for live streaming video of \"Channel 7 Eyewitness News NOW\", which offered live local and national weather updated from [[AccuWeather]] alongside local news. The format of \"Eyewitness News NOW\" is similar to the defunct [[NBC Weather Plus]]. On February 24, 2011, AccuWeather and ABC both replaced ENN as well as similar news channels on WABC-TV's sister stations, KABC-TV in Los Angeles and WLS-TV in Chicago, replacing them in all three cities with a [[standard-definition television|standard definition]], [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] simulcast of the [[Live Well Network]], and then on April 15, 2015, these stations were replaced by [[Laff (TV network)|Laff]].\n\nOn December 2, 2006, WABC-TV became the second station in the New York City market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[High-definition television|high definition]]. On September 7, 2010, WABC-TV expanded its weekday morning newscast, moving its start time to 4:30 a.m. 3 Days earlier on September 4, 2010, WABC added an hour-long extension of its Saturday morning newscast from 9:00 a.m. \u2013 10:00 a.m.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/08/24/44695/wabc-expands-morning-news |title=WABC Expands Morning News |date=August 24, 2010 |publisher=TVNewsCheck}}</ref> On May 26, 2011, WABC-TV added another hour of local news at 4:00 p.m. to replace ''Oprah'', which aired its last original episode the previous day.

After Garvey's departure a year later, she was replaced by Ann Abernathy, who in turn, left in 1985 to return to [[Los Angeles]]. That year, [[Kathie Lee Gifford|Kathie Lee Johnson]] (who would marry [[Frank Gifford]] a year later) became Philbin's new co-host.\n\nIn 1988, [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]] began syndicating the show nationally as ''Live with Regis and Kathie Lee''.

The station preempts a weekend edition of ''Good Morning America'' and delays ''This Week'' to schedule time for the live broadcast. The marathon is also simulcast on [[ESPN2]] nationally (although viewers in the WABC-TV viewing area cannot see it via ESPN2 because the simulcast is blacked out locally).\n\nWABC-TV currently airs any [[New York Knicks]] and [[Brooklyn Nets]] games televised via the ''[[NBA on ABC]]''. The station has aired the Knicks' appearances in the [[1970 NBA Finals|1970]], [[1972 NBA Finals|1972]] and [[1973 NBA Finals]] (where the Knicks won in 1970 and 1973), as well as the then-New Jersey Nets' appearance in the [[2003 NBA Finals]].\n\n==News operation==\nWABC-TV presently broadcasts 43 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and 5\u00bd hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station partners with Philadelphia sister station, WPVI-TV \u2013 which popularized the ''[[Action News]]'' format \u2013 in the production and broadcast of statewide [[New Jersey]] political debates. When the two stations broadcast a statewide office debate, such as for [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]] or [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], they'll pool resources and have anchors or reporters from both stations participate in the debate. Additionally, the two stations share coverage of news from New Jersey where their markets overlap, pooling reporters, live trucks and helicopters.\n\n===Beginning to 1999===\n[[File:WABC Eyewitness News 2013.png|thumb|right|Channel 7 ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' at 11:00 p.m. open, used from August 8, 2011 \u2013 May 3, 2016]]\nWABC-TV launched ''Report to New York'', its first regular news program, on October 26, 1959, featuring [[Scott Vincent]] with news, [[Howard Cosell]] with sports, and Lynn Dollar with weather.

Newcomers [[Bill Beutel]] and Jim Barnes were the anchors, with Cosell continuing on sports and Rosemary Haley as \"weather girl\". However, this effort failed to draw viewers from ratings leader [[WCBS-TV]] and second-place [[WNBC]].\n\nIn early 1968, Beutel left the station to become the [[London]] bureau chief for [[ABC News]] and was replaced by [[Roger Grimsby]], who was transferred by ABC from [[San Francisco]] sister station [[KGO-TV]]. In a complete revamp, Grimsby was joined by [[Tex Antoine]] doing weather, celebrity gossip columnist [[Rona Barrett]], ''[[New York Daily News]]'' columnist [[Jimmy Breslin]] with political commentary and reviews by [[Martin Bookspan]] and Allan Jeffries, while Cosell continued doing sports.

The \"Tar Sequence\" cue from the musical score of the [[1967 in film|1967 film]] ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'', composed by [[Lalo Schifrin]], was introduced as the theme music. The score included a telegraphic-style melody appropriate for a newscast. The ''Eyewitness News'' format and theme music were quickly adopted by ABC's other four owned-and-operated stations at the time: KGO-TV, WLS-TV in Chicago, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles (though KGO-TV and WXYZ-TV didn't use the ''Eyewitness News'' title for their programs). The format quickly rejuvenated a station that had long been an also-ran to WCBS-TV and WNBC-TV. Within a year, Channel 7 had shot to first place in the ratings for the first time in its history, displacing longtime leader WCBS-TV. It spent most of the decade going back and forth with WCBS-TV for first place. For a time in the 1980s, it fell into last place, but still fought with WNBC-TV for second place.\n\nRetaining only Grimsby, Cosell and Antoine from the earlier ''Noisemakers'' format, Primo also hired [[Tom Dunn (journalist)|Tom Dunn]] away from WCBS-TV to serve as Grimsby's co-anchor. After Dunn departed for [[WOR-TV]] in 1970, Bill Beutel returned to the station as his replacement and for the next 16 years, Grimsby and Beutel were the faces of ''Eyewitness News''.\n\nThe Grimsby-Beutel team were split up for several months in 1975 after ABC had reassigned Beutel to its new morning show, ''[[AM America]]'' that January. The station brought in WXYZ-TV's [[Bill Bonds]] and veteran [[Boston]] anchor [[Tom Ellis (journalist)|Tom Ellis]] to help replace Beutel, with Grimsby teaming with Ellis at 6:00 p.m. and Bonds at 11:00 p.m.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gardella |first=Kay |date=August 20, 1975 |title=TV's local news front undergoes some changes |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/395918532/ |work=Daily News |location=New York, NY |access-date=April 30, 2019 }}{{paywall}}</ref> When ''AM America'' was canceled and replaced with ''Good Morning America'' in November 1975, Beutel was re-teamed with Grimsby at 6:00 p.m., with Ellis joining Bonds at 11:00 p.m..

Applegate claimed credit for taking WLS-TV from last to first in only two years and ABC hoped he could work the same magic at the flagship station. In the wake of declining ratings, Grimsby was fired on April 16, 1986, a move for which Applegate drew considerable ire and Grimsby was quickly hired by rival WNBC-TV. In 1987, Channel 7 surged back into first place. It has been the ratings leader in New York City since then, and has grown to become the most-watched broadcast television station in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/channel---tv-station-new-york-nation--nielsen-sweep/ |title=Nielsen Sweep |publisher=FOX Business |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212112032/http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/channel---tv-station-new-york-nation--nielsen-sweep/ |archivedate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> Beutel stepped down from the anchor desk in 2001, which concluded the longest tenure for a main anchor in New York City television history at that time. His record has since been surpassed by WNBC's Chuck Scarborough and [[WXTV-DT|WXTV]]'s Rafael Pineda. Scarborough's uninterrupted run behind the desk is the longest in New York television (since 1974). Pineda is second, having started with WXTV in 1972, retiring in 2013 after 41 years.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nWABC-TV's news department is respected for its straightforward presentation (especially during breaking news). For the last decade, it has waged a spirited battle for first place, but for most of the time has held onto the lead, helped in part by lead-ins from highly rated talk and entertainment shows. For over 24 years (December 1986 to May 2011), the lead-in for the 5:00 p.m. ''Eyewitness News'' broadcast had been ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' at 4:00 p.m. and its strong ratings brought viewers along to the 5:00 p.m. newscast.\n\nThe newscasts were replayed on one of channel 7's digital subchannels, another which also carried a local weather and news channel. WABC-TV's website had a link for live streaming video of \"Channel 7 Eyewitness News NOW\", which offered live local and national weather updated from [[AccuWeather]] alongside local news. The format of \"Eyewitness News NOW\" is similar to the defunct [[NBC Weather Plus]]. On February 24, 2011, AccuWeather and ABC both replaced ENN as well as similar news channels on WABC-TV's sister stations, KABC-TV in Los Angeles and WLS-TV in Chicago, replacing them in all three cities with a [[standard-definition television|standard definition]], [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] simulcast of the [[Live Well Network]], and then on April 15, 2015, these stations were replaced by [[Laff (TV network)|Laff]].\n\nOn December 2, 2006, WABC-TV became the second station in the New York City market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[High-definition television|high definition]]. On September 7, 2010, WABC-TV expanded its weekday morning newscast, moving its start time to 4:30 a.m. 3 Days earlier on September 4, 2010, WABC added an hour-long extension of its Saturday morning newscast from 9:00 a.m. \u2013 10:00 a.m.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/08/24/44695/wabc-expands-morning-news |title=WABC Expands Morning News |date=August 24, 2010 |publisher=TVNewsCheck}}</ref> On May 26, 2011, WABC-TV added another hour of local news at 4:00 p.m. to replace ''Oprah'', which aired its last original episode the previous day. WABC also produces a 7:00 p.m. newscast on Saturdays following college football during the regular season.\n\nOn September 24, 2011, the station began broadcasting its newscasts and public affairs programs from a new street-level window studio at a former [[Disney Store]] location in the ABC building on 66th Street and Columbus Avenue. The space previously used for news broadcasts was used to expand the ''Live with Kelly'' studio.<ref>{{cite news |last=Flamm |first=Matthew |date=February 6, 2011 |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110206/FREE/302069970# |title=WABC Plans Post-Oprah Era \u2013 Station To Add Local News Hour; Regis Exit Delayed Several Months |newspaper=[[Crain Communications|Crain's New York Business]] |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Huff |first=Richard |date=February 18, 2011 |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/eyewitness-news-set-major-face-lift-summer-new-studio-timeslot-article-1.136978 |title='Eyewitness News' Set for Major Face-Lift Come Summer with New Studio, Timeslot |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref> In January 2012, the station also expanded its weekend 11:00 p.m. newscasts to an hour.
