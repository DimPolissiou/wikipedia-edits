The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as [[List of Khazar rulers|Irbis]] and describe him as a scion of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is whether he can be identified with one of the many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk rulers of the same name.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and other priorities, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.{{sfn|Mako|2010|p=45}} The Khazars launched a few raids into Transcaucasian principalities under Muslim dominion, including a large-scale raid in 683\u2013685 during the [[Second Fitna|Second Muslim Civil War]] that rendered much booty and many prisoners.{{sfn|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}} There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in Transoxiana.\n\n[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|300px|{{center|Caucasus region, c. 740}}]]\n\nThe Second Arab-Khazar War began with a series of raids across the Caucasus in the early 8th century. The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].{{sfn|Brook|2010|p=127}} The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.{{sfn|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}} Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Qa\u011fan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence.{{sfn|Wasserstein|2007|pp=375\u2013376}} The suggestion that the Khazars adopted [[Judaism]] as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.{{efn|group=note|\"The Khazars, the close allies of the Byzantines, adopted Judaism, as their official religion, apparently by 740, three years after an invasion by the Arabs under Marwan ibn Muhammad. Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan's terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty's conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (however theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.\"{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}}}\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].{{sfn|Shepard|2006|p=19}} Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld. [[Ancestor worship]] was observed. The key religious figure appears to have been a [[shamanism|shaman]]-like ''qam'',{{sfn|Golden|2007|pp=131\u2013133}} and it was these (''qozm\u00edm'') that were, according to the Khazar Hebrew conversion stories, driven out.\n\nMany sources suggest, and a notable number of scholars have argued, that the charismatic \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 clan played a germinal role in the early Khazar state, although Zuckerman dismisses the widespread notion of their pivotal role as a 'phantom'.

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops.

The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].{{sfn|Brook|2010|p=127}} The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.{{sfn|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}} Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan's terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty's conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (however theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.\"{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}}}\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].{{sfn|Shepard|2006|p=19}} Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld.

In what came to be known as the Sykes Picot agreement, the French and the British agreed to divide the Middle East between the two of them after the war.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} When they reached the Paris Peace Conference, this agreement made negotiation on the Middle East nearly impossible.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} When American diplomats proposed the King-Crane Commission to investigate popular sentiment in [[Greater Syria]], both French and British Diplomats greeted it with public approval, but behind the scenes the outcome had already been decided.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} \n\nThe British also engaged in secret negotiations with Arab powers in the Hussein-McMahon correspondence before the conference occurred.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Ultimately, this would cause the British to fall into poor standing with the Arabs because they would betray Arabian trust by conducting simultaneous negotiations in the [[Sykes-Picot agreement]] and the [[Balfour Declaration]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Syria|last=Petran|first=Tabitha|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=1972|isbn=|location=New York|pages=54-56}}</ref> When the time came for a mandate to be selected, Arabs felt they could no longer trust Great Britain because of their support for Zionism.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} \n\n=== Zionism and Early Jewish Settlement ===\n{{see also|Balfour Declaration}}\n[[Zionism]] has been a popular and contentious subject among historians for many years. According to the author [[Nadim Rouhana]], \u201cthe essence of the encounter therefore took place between a group of people living in their homeland and a group of people who arrived from other parts of the world guided by an ideology that claimed the same homeland as exclusively theirs.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism\u2019s Ecounter with the Palestinians.|last=Rouhana|first=Nadim|work=Israeli and Palestinian Narratives of Conflict: History\u2019s Double Helix|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Rotberg|editor-first=Robert|location=Indianapolis|pages=118}}</ref> Zionism in Rouhana\u2019s eye revolved around a system of exclusion in which Zionist arrived and stole the lands they resided on.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} This interpretation is understandable given the nature of the future state of [[Israel]], but it doesn\u2019t give a full picture of Jewish people in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Author Dina Porat rounds off Rouhana\u2019s argument by stating, \u201cAlmost none of the Zionist leaders educated in Europe studied Arabic\u2026Arabs did not master European languages or the Hebrew spoken by the settlers.

So, the United States alone sponsored the commission.\n\nThe Commission's representatives appointed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] were [[Henry Churchill King]] and [[Charles R. Crane]].

Nonetheless the British Prime Minister tried to make the best of it by attempting to get the commission to focus exclusively on the claims of France--and the resistance to those claims by the Arabs whom France sought to rule.... The British, like the French, had staked out an enormous claim in the Middle East, but Lloyd George successfully kept the British claims from being scrutinised. When President Wilson's Commission of Inquiry went out to ascertain the wishes of the Middle Eastern peoples, it did not go to Mesopotamia, where British India had instituted direct rule.</blockquote></ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Brecher|first=Frank W.|year=1987|title=Woodrow Wilson and the Origins of the Arab-Israeli Conflict|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/1987_39_01_00_brecher.pdf|format=PDF|journal=American Jewish Archives|volume=39|issue=1|pages=37|ref=harv}}  Citing, U.S. State Department, The Paris Peace Conference, Vol. 11, p. 75. </ref>\n\n== Context ==\n[[File:President Woodrow Wilson (1913).jpg|200px|thumb|right|President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the United States was an avowed opponent of secret diplomacy.]]\nAt the Paris Peace Conference, groups of imperial nations such as [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] sought to divide the Ottoman Empire among themselves using the [[mandate system]] while anti-imperialist leaders such as [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Amir Faysal]] sought to oppose such plans.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The King Crane Commission|last=Howard|first=Harry|publisher=Khayats|year=1963|isbn=|location=Beirut|pages=1}}</ref> The conference began in 1919. In the wake of [[World War I]], the participants were exhausted and particularly interested in the fate of their imperial rival, the Ottoman Empire.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe French in particular had extensive claims in the Middle East. Since as early 1900, the French began to build relationships and claims on political, moral and economic grounds.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Syrian and the French Mandate: The Politics of Arab Nationalism|last=Khoury|first=Philip|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=30-31}}</ref> They created a role for themselves as the traditional protector of [[Christianity in Lebanon|Lebanese Christians]]. The French supported the [[Maronites]] in Lebanon with missionaries and schools, deepening their relationship with the Christian religious community.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Many Lebanese Christians feared domination as a religious minority and vocally supported the [[French Mandate]]. This gave the French political credibility in the region.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} \n\nFinally French capitalists controlled 63% of the Ottoman Public Debt.<ref name=\":0\" /> This economic tie made France very concerned about the fate of the Ottoman Empire. The French were adamant that because of their unique relationship with [[Syria]], they should be one of the nations to receive a mandate in Syria.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Secret Negotiations ===\n{{see also|Sykes-Picot agreement}}\n{{see also|McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence}}\nThe French allied themselves with the British in order to press their claims.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} While the British did not have the same connection with the Middle East, they were still interested in expanding and defending their existing colonial empire. In what came to be known as the Sykes Picot agreement, the French and the British agreed to divide the Middle East between the two of them after the war.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} When they reached the Paris Peace Conference, this agreement made negotiation on the Middle East nearly impossible.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} When American diplomats proposed the King-Crane Commission to investigate popular sentiment in [[Greater Syria]], both French and British Diplomats greeted it with public approval, but behind the scenes the outcome had already been decided.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} \n\nThe British also engaged in secret negotiations with Arab powers in the Hussein-McMahon correspondence before the conference occurred.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Ultimately, this would cause the British to fall into poor standing with the Arabs because they would betray Arabian trust by conducting simultaneous negotiations in the [[Sykes-Picot agreement]] and the [[Balfour Declaration]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Syria|last=Petran|first=Tabitha|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=1972|isbn=|location=New York|pages=54-56}}</ref> When the time came for a mandate to be selected, Arabs felt they could no longer trust Great Britain because of their support for Zionism.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} \n\n=== Zionism and Early Jewish Settlement ===\n{{see also|Balfour Declaration}}\n[[Zionism]] has been a popular and contentious subject among historians for many years. According to the author [[Nadim Rouhana]], \u201cthe essence of the encounter therefore took place between a group of people living in their homeland and a group of people who arrived from other parts of the world guided by an ideology that claimed the same homeland as exclusively theirs.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism\u2019s Ecounter with the Palestinians.|last=Rouhana|first=Nadim|work=Israeli and Palestinian Narratives of Conflict: History\u2019s Double Helix|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Rotberg|editor-first=Robert|location=Indianapolis|pages=118}}</ref> Zionism in Rouhana\u2019s eye revolved around a system of exclusion in which Zionist arrived and stole the lands they resided on.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} This interpretation is understandable given the nature of the future state of [[Israel]], but it doesn\u2019t give a full picture of Jewish people in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Author Dina Porat rounds off Rouhana\u2019s argument by stating, \u201cAlmost none of the Zionist leaders educated in Europe studied Arabic\u2026Arabs did not master European languages or the Hebrew spoken by the settlers. The absence of a common language created an abyss that exists today.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Forging Zionist Identity Prior to 1948|last=Porat|first=Dina|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Indianapolis|pages=53-54}}</ref> The reason for the distance between the two groups rested in the lack of cultural assimilation.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} These two viewpoints demonstrate that the encounter between Zionists and Arab was one where cultural differences were ignored or exploited.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The British in particular exploited the rivalry between these groups with the Balfour declaration. The [[Balfour Declaration]] aligned the goals of Zionism with their imperial goals.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n== The 1919 Paris Peace Conference ==\n[[File:1919 Photo of the King Crane Commission.jpg|thumb|left|1919 Photo of the King Crane Commission]]\nThe Commission was originally proposed by the United States as an international effort to determine if the region was ready for [[self-determination]] and to see what nations, if any, the locals wanted to act as [[League of Nations Mandate|mandatory powers]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The plan received little support from the other nations, with many claimed delays.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The Americans gradually realised that the British and French had already come to their own backroom deals about the future of the region, and new information could only muddy the waters. So, the United States alone sponsored the commission.\n\nThe Commission's representatives appointed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] were [[Henry Churchill King]] and [[Charles R. Crane]].  The authors still desired  to gauge the region's desired future with regard to the [[Mandate System]].
