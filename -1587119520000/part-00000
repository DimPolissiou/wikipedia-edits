Bonny and Opobo are of the same origin, both belonging to the [[Ibani tribe]]. An [[Igbo people|Igbo]] man (who was subsequently initiated into the [[Ibani]]) called [[Jubo Jubogha]] rose from slavery to lead the Anna Pepple chieftaincy house of Bonny. In 1870, Jubo first arrived in what is now Opobo, having moved there due to a [[Kingdom of Bonny#Bonny civil war|civil war]] in Bonny between his followers and those of Chief [[Oko Jumbo]], the leader of the rival Manilla Pepple chieftaincy family.<ref name=Jones2001/>\nHe was accommodated by the [[Nkoro]] leaders King Kpokpo and Chief Ubani,<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/36981645/The-Izon-of-the-Niger-Delta-Chapter-22</ref> and formed what he called the \"Kingdom of Opobo\" soon afterwards. The king named his new state after Amanyanabo Opubo \"Pepple\" Perekule the Great, a Pepple king in Bonny that had reigned there from 1792 to 1830.\n\nJubo Jubogha became involved in [[palm oil]] trading with Europeans.  He started a trading post at Opobo Town, close to Ikot Abasi and 4 miles southwest of the Opobo river. Due to his dealings with them, he soon acquired the [[trade name]] ''Jaja''. Jubo Jubogha was never on good terms with the [[Ngwa]] people to the north, or the [[Annang]] and the [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] to the east, as he declared himself as the middleman in palm oil trading, thus asking them to stop trading directly with the Europeans. This resulted in a war (the Ikot Udo Obong War) between Jubo and the Annang and Ibuno people as recorded by Nair.<ref>Cf. Nair, 1972, page 183</ref> In 1887, he was deceived when he was told to go and negotiate with the Queen of England by the British. He was captured upon his arrival on the consul's flagship, and was sent into exile in [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent]] in the [[West Indies]] thereafter.\n\n==Traditions==\nThe following are a few of Opobo's unique customs: <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punchng.com/land-of-the-great-king-jaja-where-making-noise-at-night-is-forbidden/|title=Opobo: Land of the \u2018great\u2019 King Jaja where making noise at night is forbidden|last=Published|website=Punch Newspapers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n\n* Dogs are forbidden in Opobo. This tradition, which has its roots in ancient times, is one of the most important taboos the people of this coastal town hold on to. While the people are free to bring in dog meat to eat in their homes whenever they feel like it, they are not allowed to keep dogs as pets or bring such into the community. For those, who flout this grand rule, the penalty is usually grave. In addition  \n* In Opobo, one is not allowed to shoot a gun. Such a thing is only to occur by royal sanction during a war. * Individuals are forbidden from wearing caps while passing through the gateway linking one compound to another. The gateways are small roofed passages, essentially a series of tunnels, connecting one compound to another. On the floor of such gateways is a crossbar, which those passing are forbidden from stepping foot on. Adhering to this rule while passing through the place is a mark of respect for the high chief of a particular compound, which is also referred to as a war canoe house.\n\nWhile these taboos could be said to hold sway during daytime, another set of unusual ones rules the land at nighttime. Some of that set include: \n\n* Making noise, pounding or quarrelling at night is forbidden. While it is not uncommon to hear giant loud speakers blaring music at hundreds of decibels at night time, with a cacophony of voices providing background percussion in other communities, in Opobo such a thing is totally forbidden. Making any form of noise at night is one of the biggest offences anyone can commit in this island community. You could be labelled an enemy of the town. Similarly, quarrelling and fighting at night is taboo here as well. Regardless of how provoked you are, you must wait till the break of dawn to vent your anger on whoever has provoked you.\n\nBreaking any of these rules attracts a fine of N7,000 each or a serious punishment by the community heads .\n\n===The Initiation into Womanhood===\nA certified wife who has not been initiated into womanhood with the appropriate initiation ceremony, known as the ''Mgbede'', is not allowed to tie a special wrapper called 'George'. Such a woman would also be denied many other rights: there are sacred places that she cannot enter and she will not be entitled to mix freely with women that have been initiated. In fact, she can be traditionally disgraced by the other women in the community at any time.\n\n[[File:King Jaja of Opobo's Palace.jpg|thumb|King Jaja of Opobo's Palace]]\n\n==Rulers==\n\nThe rulers of Opobo were:<ref name=wstates/>\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:10em;\"|Start !!style=\"width:10em;\"| End !!

This provided an opportunity to secure the island and led to the appointment of [[Proprietary Governor]]s to establish colonial settlements on the island from 1610 to 1728. [[John Guy (governor)|John Guy]] became [[List of Newfoundland and Labrador lieutenant-governors|governor]] of the first settlement at [[Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cuper's Cove]]. Other settlements included [[Subdivision 1I, Newfoundland and Labrador#Bristol's Hope|Bristol's Hope]], [[Renews]], [[New Cambriol]], [[South Falkland]] and [[Province of Avalon|Avalon]] (which became a province in 1623). The first governor given jurisdiction over all of Newfoundland was [[David Kirke|Sir David Kirke]] in 1638.\n\nExplorers quickly realized the waters around Newfoundland had the best fishing in the North Atlantic.<ref>Grant C.

The Mi'kmaq, as allies of the French, were amenable to limited French settlement in their midst and fought alongside them against the English. English attacks on Placentia provoked retaliation by [[New France]] explorer [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] who during [[King William's War]] in the 1690s destroyed nearly every English settlement on the island. The entire population of the English colony was either killed, captured for ransom, or sentenced to expulsion to England, with the exception of those who withstood the attack at [[Carbonear Island]] and those in the then remote [[Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bonavista]].\n\nAfter France lost political control of the area after the [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Siege of Port Royal in 1710]], the M\u00ed'kmaq engaged in warfare with the British throughout [[Dummer's War]] (1722\u20131725), [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748), [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749\u20131755) and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763). The French colonization period lasted until the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713, which ended the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]: France ceded to the British its claims to Newfoundland (including its claims to the shores of [[Hudson Bay]]) and to the French possessions in [[Acadia]]. Afterward, under the supervision of the last French governor, the French population of Plaisance moved to \u00cele Royale (now [[Cape Breton Island]]), part of Acadia which remained then under French control.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), France had acknowledged British ownership of the island. However, in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), control of Newfoundland once again became a major source of conflict between Britain, France and Spain who all pressed for a share in the valuable fishery there. [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victories around the globe]] led [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] to insist nobody other than Britain should have access to Newfoundland. The [[Battle of Signal Hill]] took place in Newfoundland in 1762 when a French force landed and tried to occupy the island, only to be repulsed by the British.\n[[File:Vue de la descente a Terre Neuve par le chevalier de Ternay en 1762.jpg|thumb|A French invasion of the Newfoundland was repulsed during the [[Battle of Signal Hill]] in 1762.]]\nFrom 1763 to 1767 [[James Cook]] made a detailed survey of the coasts of Newfoundland and southern Labrador while commander of {{HMS|Grenville|1754|6}}. (The following year, 1768, Cook began [[First voyage of James Cook|his first circumnavigation of the world]].) In 1796 a Franco-Spanish expedition again [[Newfoundland expedition|succeeded in raiding]] the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, destroying many of the settlements.\n\nBy the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), French fishermen gained the right to land and cure fish on the \"French Shore\" on the western coast.

The blue triangles are a tribute to the Union Flag, and represent the British heritage of the province. The two red triangles represent Labrador (the mainland portion of the province) and the island.

It originated in the late nineteenth century and enjoyed popularity among people who were under the impression that it was the Native Flag of Newfoundland which was created before 1852 by the Newfoundland Natives'Society. The true Native Flag (red-white-green tricolour) was widely flown into the late nineteenth century. Neither tricolour was ever adopted by the Newfoundland government.<ref name=\"THE PROVINCES Chap XIX\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Provinces/Newfoundland.html|title=THE PROVINCES Chap XIX: Newfoundland|accessdate=June 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nA 1976 article reported the tricolour flag was created in 1843 by then Roman Catholic Bishop of Newfoundland, [[Michael Anthony Fleming]].<ref name=\"monitor\">''The Monitor'', July 1976, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newfoundland</ref> The colours were intended to represent the symbolic union of Newfoundland's historically dominant ethnic/religious groups: English, Scots and Irish.<ref name=\"monitor\"/> Though popular, there is no historical evidence to support this legend. Recent scholarship <!--by whom? cite article--> suggests the green-white-pink flag was first used in the late 1870s or early 1880s by the Roman Catholic \"Star of the Sea Association\" a fishermen's aid and benefit organization established by the Catholic Church in 1871. It resembled the unofficial [[flag of Ireland]]. The tricolour flag remained relatively unknown outside of St. John's and the Avalon peninsula until the growth of the tourist industry since the late 20th century. It has been used as an emblem on items in gift shops in St. John's and other towns. Some tourists assume it is the Irish flag.\n\nThe \"Pink, White and Green\"(sic) has been adopted by some residents as a symbol of ties with Irish heritage and as a political statement.

[[Ice hockey]], however, remains popular; a minor league professional team called the [[Newfoundland Growlers]] of the [[ECHL]] plays at the [[Mile One Centre]] in St. John's since the 2018\u201319 season. The area had an intermittent [[American Hockey League]] presence with the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]] then [[St. John's IceCaps]] until 2017, and the [[Newfoundland Senior Hockey League]] has teams around the island. Since the departure of the [[St. John's Fog Devils]] in 2008, Newfoundland and Labrador is the only province in Canada to not have a team in the major junior [[Canadian Hockey League]] (should one ever join it would be placed in the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League|QMJHL]], which hosted the Fog Devils and has jurisdiction over Atlantic Canada).\n\n[[Association football]] (soccer) and [[rugby union]] are both more popular in Newfoundland and Labrador than the rest of Canada in general. Soccer is hosted at [[King George V Park]], a 6,000-seat stadium built as Newfoundland's national stadium during the time as an independent dominion. [[Swilers Rugby Park]] is home of the [[Swilers RFC]] rugby union club, as well as the [[Atlantic Rock]], one of the four regional teams in the [[Canadian Rugby Championship]]. Other sports facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador include [[Pepsi Centre]], an indoor arena in Corner Brook; [[Shamrock Field]], Canada's national Gaelic Games venue in St. John's; and [[St. Patrick's Park]], a baseball park in St. John's.\n\n[[Gridiron football]], be it either [[American football|American]] or [[Canadian football|Canadian]], is almost nonexistent; it is the only Canadian province other than [[Prince Edward Island]] to have never hosted a [[Canadian Football League]] or [[CIS football|Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] game, and it was not until 2013 the province saw its first amateur teams form.\n\n[[Cricket]] was once a popular sport. The earliest mention is in the ''Newfoundland Mercantile Journal'', Thursday September 16, 1824, indicating the St. John's Cricket Club was an established club at this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadacricket.com/nlcricket/?page_id=4|title=History \u2013 Cricket Newfoundland and Labrador|website=www.canadacricket.com}}</ref> The St. John's Cricket club was one of the first cricket clubs in North America.

John Shannon Munn is Newfoundland's most famous cricketer, having represented Oxford University. After the first World War, cricket declined in popularity and was replaced by soccer and baseball.

The number of their sites discovered on Newfoundland indicates they may have been the most numerous group of Aboriginal people to live there. They thrived from about 2000 BC to AD 800. Many of their sites were on exposed headlands and outer islands. They were more oriented to the sea than earlier peoples, and had developed sleds and boats similar to kayaks. They burned seal blubber in soapstone lamps.<ref name=\"pastore\">[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/aboriginal/palaeo.html Ralph T.

This provided an opportunity to secure the island and led to the appointment of [[Proprietary Governor]]s to establish colonial settlements on the island from 1610 to 1728. [[John Guy (governor)|John Guy]] became [[List of Newfoundland and Labrador lieutenant-governors|governor]] of the first settlement at [[Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cuper's Cove]]. Other settlements included [[Subdivision 1I, Newfoundland and Labrador#Bristol's Hope|Bristol's Hope]], [[Renews]], [[New Cambriol]], [[South Falkland]] and [[Province of Avalon|Avalon]] (which became a province in 1623). The first governor given jurisdiction over all of Newfoundland was [[David Kirke|Sir David Kirke]] in 1638.\n\nExplorers quickly realized the waters around Newfoundland had the best fishing in the North Atlantic.<ref>Grant C.

The Mi'kmaq, as allies of the French, were amenable to limited French settlement in their midst and fought alongside them against the English. English attacks on Placentia provoked retaliation by [[New France]] explorer [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] who during [[King William's War]] in the 1690s destroyed nearly every English settlement on the island. The entire population of the English colony was either killed, captured for ransom, or sentenced to expulsion to England, with the exception of those who withstood the attack at [[Carbonear Island]] and those in the then remote [[Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bonavista]].\n\nAfter France lost political control of the area after the [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Siege of Port Royal in 1710]], the M\u00ed'kmaq engaged in warfare with the British throughout [[Dummer's War]] (1722\u20131725), [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748), [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749\u20131755) and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763). The French colonization period lasted until the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713, which ended the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]: France ceded to the British its claims to Newfoundland (including its claims to the shores of [[Hudson Bay]]) and to the French possessions in [[Acadia]]. Afterward, under the supervision of the last French governor, the French population of Plaisance moved to \u00cele Royale (now [[Cape Breton Island]]), part of Acadia which remained then under French control.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), France had acknowledged British ownership of the island. However, in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), control of Newfoundland once again became a major source of conflict between Britain, France and Spain who all pressed for a share in the valuable fishery there. [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victories around the globe]] led [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] to insist nobody other than Britain should have access to Newfoundland. The [[Battle of Signal Hill]] took place in Newfoundland in 1762 when a French force landed and tried to occupy the island, only to be repulsed by the British.\n[[File:Vue de la descente a Terre Neuve par le chevalier de Ternay en 1762.jpg|thumb|A French invasion of the Newfoundland was repulsed during the [[Battle of Signal Hill]] in 1762.]]\nFrom 1763 to 1767 [[James Cook]] made a detailed survey of the coasts of Newfoundland and southern Labrador while commander of {{HMS|Grenville|1754|6}}.

In 1796 a Franco-Spanish expedition again [[Newfoundland expedition|succeeded in raiding]] the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, destroying many of the settlements.\n\nBy the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), French fishermen gained the right to land and cure fish on the \"French Shore\" on the western coast. (They had a permanent base on nearby [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]] islands; the French gave up their French Shore rights in 1904.) In 1783 the British signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] with the United States that gave American fishermen similar rights along the coast. These rights were reaffirmed by treaties in 1818, 1854 and 1871 and confirmed by arbitration in 1910.\n\nIn 1854 the British government established Newfoundland's [[responsible government]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/representative.html \n|title= Representative Government, 1832\u20131855\n|last= Webb |first= Jeff \n|accessdate= October 17, 2008\n}}\n</ref>\nIn 1855, [[Philip Francis Little]], a native of [[Prince Edward Island]], won a parliamentary majority over [[Hugh Hoyles]] and the [[Conservative Party of Newfoundland|Conservatives]].

The blue triangles are a tribute to the Union Flag, and represent the British heritage of the province. The two red triangles represent Labrador (the mainland portion of the province) and the island.

It originated in the late nineteenth century and enjoyed popularity among people who were under the impression that it was the Native Flag of Newfoundland which was created before 1852 by the Newfoundland Natives'Society. The true Native Flag (red-white-green tricolour) was widely flown into the late nineteenth century. Neither tricolour was ever adopted by the Newfoundland government.<ref name=\"THE PROVINCES Chap XIX\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Provinces/Newfoundland.html|title=THE PROVINCES Chap XIX: Newfoundland|accessdate=June 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nA 1976 article reported the tricolour flag was created in 1843 by then Roman Catholic Bishop of Newfoundland, [[Michael Anthony Fleming]].<ref name=\"monitor\">''The Monitor'', July 1976, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newfoundland</ref> The colours were intended to represent the symbolic union of Newfoundland's historically dominant ethnic/religious groups: English, Scots and Irish.<ref name=\"monitor\"/> Though popular, there is no historical evidence to support this legend. Recent scholarship <!--by whom? cite article--> suggests the green-white-pink flag was first used in the late 1870s or early 1880s by the Roman Catholic \"Star of the Sea Association\" a fishermen's aid and benefit organization established by the Catholic Church in 1871. It resembled the unofficial [[flag of Ireland]]. The tricolour flag remained relatively unknown outside of St. John's and the Avalon peninsula until the growth of the tourist industry since the late 20th century. It has been used as an emblem on items in gift shops in St. John's and other towns. Some tourists assume it is the Irish flag.\n\nThe \"Pink, White and Green\"(sic) has been adopted by some residents as a symbol of ties with Irish heritage and as a political statement.

[[Ice hockey]], however, remains popular; a minor league professional team called the [[Newfoundland Growlers]] of the [[ECHL]] plays at the [[Mile One Centre]] in St. John's since the 2018\u201319 season. The area had an intermittent [[American Hockey League]] presence with the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]] then [[St. John's IceCaps]] until 2017, and the [[Newfoundland Senior Hockey League]] has teams around the island. Since the departure of the [[St. John's Fog Devils]] in 2008, Newfoundland and Labrador is the only province in Canada to not have a team in the major junior [[Canadian Hockey League]] (should one ever join it would be placed in the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League|QMJHL]], which hosted the Fog Devils and has jurisdiction over Atlantic Canada).\n\n[[Association football]] (soccer) and [[rugby union]] are both more popular in Newfoundland and Labrador than the rest of Canada in general. Soccer is hosted at [[King George V Park]], a 6,000-seat stadium built as Newfoundland's national stadium during the time as an independent dominion. [[Swilers Rugby Park]] is home of the [[Swilers RFC]] rugby union club, as well as the [[Atlantic Rock]], one of the four regional teams in the [[Canadian Rugby Championship]]. Other sports facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador include [[Pepsi Centre]], an indoor arena in Corner Brook; [[Shamrock Field]], Canada's national Gaelic Games venue in St. John's; and [[St. Patrick's Park]], a baseball park in St. John's.\n\n[[Gridiron football]], be it either [[American football|American]] or [[Canadian football|Canadian]], is almost nonexistent; it is the only Canadian province other than [[Prince Edward Island]] to have never hosted a [[Canadian Football League]] or [[CIS football|Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] game, and it was not until 2013 the province saw its first amateur teams form.\n\n[[Cricket]] was once a popular sport. The earliest mention is in the ''Newfoundland Mercantile Journal'', Thursday September 16, 1824, indicating the St. John's Cricket Club was an established club at this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadacricket.com/nlcricket/?page_id=4|title=History \u2013 Cricket Newfoundland and Labrador|website=www.canadacricket.com}}</ref> The St. John's Cricket club was one of the first cricket clubs in North America. Other centres were at [[Harbour Grace]], [[Twillingate]], and [[Trinity, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity]]. The heyday of the game was the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, at which time there was league in St. John's, as well as an interschool tournament. John Shannon Munn is Newfoundland's most famous cricketer, having represented Oxford University. After the first World War, cricket declined in popularity and was replaced by soccer and baseball.

Recognized for her defense of [[direct action]] in the struggle against [[racial segregation]], in 1960 she was an early recruit to [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS). With [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) in Mississippi  Hayden was a strategist and organizer for the 1964 [[Freedom Summer]]. In the internal discussion that followed its uncertain outcome, she clashed with the SNCC national executive. Hayden's vision was of a \"radically democratic\" movement driven by organizers in the field. In defending grassroots organization she believed she was also advocating for the voice of women. In \"Sex and Caste\" (November 1965),<ref>Document 86A: Casey Hayden (aka Sandra Cason) and Mary King, \"Sex and Caste,\" 18 November 1965, ''Liberation Magazine'', April 1966, Elaine DeLott Baker Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. pp. 35-36. https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc86A.htm</ref> a reworking of an internal memo they had drafted with other SNCC women, Hayden and [[Mary King (political scientist)|Mary King]] drew  \"parallels\" with the experience of African-Americans to suggest that women are \"caught up in a common-law caste system that operates, sometimes subtly, forcing them to work around or outside hierarchical structures of power.\"  Since regarded as a bridge connecting civil rights to women's liberation, Hayden describes its publication as her \"last action as a movement activist.\" In the decades since, she has continued to acknowledge the civil-rights struggle of the era as the forerunner for women, and for all those, who have taken up \"the idea of organising for themselves.\"\n\n== Early life ==\nCasey Hayden was born Sandra Cason on October 31, 1937, in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]],<ref name=Smith>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Harold L. |editor-last1=Turner |editor-first1=Elizabeth Hayes |editor-last2=Cole |editor-first2=Stephanie |editor-last3=Sharpless |editor-first3=Rebecca |title=Texas Women: Their Histories, Their Lives. |publisher=University of Georgia Press |date=2015 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/texaswomentheirh0000turn/page/295 295\u2013318] |chapter=Casey Hayden: Gender and the Origins of SNCC, SDS, and the Women's Liberation Movement |isbn=9780820347905 |url=https://archive.org/details/texaswomentheirh0000turn/page/295 }}</ref> as a fourth-generation Texan.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt175758p|title=Texas Women: Their Histories, Their Lives|date=2015|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=9780820347202|editor-last=Turner|editor-first=Elizabeth Hayes|editor-last2=Cole|editor-first2=Stephanie|editor-last3=Sharpless|editor-first3=Rebecca|chapter=Their Histories, Their Lives}}</ref> She was raised in Victoria, Texas, in a \"\u201cmultigenerational matriarchal family\u201d<ref>Casey Hayden (2010). \"In the Attics of my Mind.\" Written for Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC.

Dixon (2009) ''Women and the Civil Rights Movement, 1954-1965''. University Press of Mississippi. p. 135</ref>\n\n== Campus activist  ==\nIn 1957 Cason enrolled as junior at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas]]. She moved out of campus dorms into the [[Social Gospel]] and racially-integrated Christian Faith and Life Community, and as officer of [[Young Womens Christian Association]] and member of the Social Action Committee of the university's Religious Council was soon engaged in civil-rights education and protest. Continuing from 1959 as a UT English and philosophy graduate student, she participated in a successful sit-in campaign to desegregate Austin-area restaurants and theaters.\n\nIn a dramatic intervention at the [[National Student Association]] convention in Minneapolis in August 1960, Cason turned back a broadly-supported motion that, objecting to sit-ins, would have denied support to the fledgling [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). \u201cI cannot say to a person who suffers injustice, \u2018Wait,\u2019 And having decided that I cannot urge caution, I must stand with him.\u201d Among the delegates who, after a moments silence, gave her a standing ovation was SDS president [[Alan Haber]], whom, as she recalls, \"scooped\" her \"up,\" and [[Tom Hayden]] editor of University of Michigan student newspaper. Stirred by her \"ability to think morally [and] express herself poetically,\" he followed her into Haber's new left-wing grouping.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 365</ref>\n\nAt the SNCC second coordinating conference in Atlanta in October 1960, Cason reported herself transfixed by the idea of the Beloved Community as espoused by [[James Lawson (activist)|James Lawson]] and [[Diane Nash]] of the [[Nashville Student Movement]].<ref>Houck and Dixon (2009). p. 135</ref>\n\n== With the SNCC in the South==\nIn the summer of 1961 Cason moved to New York City and lived with Tom Hayden. In a ceremony invoking [[Albert Camus]]--\"I, on the other hand, choose justice in order to remain faithful to the world\"\u2014they  married in October, and then moved to Atlanta.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 369</ref>  \"Godmother of the SNCC\" [[Ella Baker]] had hired Cason (now Casey Hayden) for a YWCA special project, travelling to southern campuses to conduct integrated race-relations workshops (secretly in the case of some white schools). She also worked in the SNCC office on, among other projects, preparations for the [[Freedom Riders]] who were to challenge non-enforcement of the United States Supreme Court decision [[Boynton v. Virginia]] (1960). In December, as Freedom Riders themselves, the Haydens were arrested in Albany, Georgia.\n\nIt was from the jail cell that Tom Hayden began drafting what was to become the [[Port Huron Statement]], adopted by the SDS at its convention in June 1962 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  With Tom Hayden elected SDS president for the 1962\u20131963 academic year, and Casey Hayden heeding the SNCC call to return to Atlanta, they separated, divorcing in 1965. While she had had the reputation in the SDS of being \"one of the boys,\"  much of the discussion within the SDS inner circle struck her as young men posturing. Her heart was with the SNCC where, consistent with the focus on action, greater value was placed on building relationships, and where women, Black women, spoke out.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 372</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Casey Hayden moved to Mississippi where, along with [[Doris Derby]], she was asked to begin a literacy project at [[Tougaloo College]] in an all-black community outside Jackson. The comparative safety of the college was a consideration: out in the field the increased visibility she brought as a white woman was a risk not only to herself, but also to her comrades. But it was also important to Hayden that the \"request was specifically made\" because of her background in English education:\n\n<blockquote>As a Southerner, I considered the Southern Freedom Movement Against Segregation mine as much any one else's. I was working for my right to be with who I chose to be with as I chose to be with them. It was my freedom. However, when I worked full time in the black community I considered myself a guest of that community, which required decency and good manners, as every Southerner knows. I considered myself a support person; my appropriate role was to provide support from behind the lines, not to be a leader in any public way.</blockquote>\n\nIt was not that within SNCC she did not have a \"right to leadership\" but that \"it would have been counterproductive.\"<ref>https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc86A.htm</ref>  Not being \"a leader in any public way,\" however, did not leave Hayden feeling in any way excluded. Although she appears quicker to recognize the  advantage it was to her as a woman in the movement than to her as a \"guest\" in the community, Hayden noted that because of \"the participatory, town-hall, consensus-forming nature of the SNCC operation\" being \"on the Executive Committee or a project director didn't carry much weight anyway.\"<ref>Casey Hayden (2015), \"Only Love Is Radical.\" ''Inspiring Participatory Democracy: Student Movements from Port Huron to Today'', ed. Tom Hayden. New York: Routledge, 2015, p. 65.</ref> Her ability to make decisions and to control her own work was not a matter of formal position.\n\nIn 1964 she became organizer and strategist for [[Freedom Summer]] and for the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] in the challenge they were to mount to the seating of the all-white regulars at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]]. She explains that in those roles:\n<blockquote>I did the work all the way up and down. That means I did my own typing and mimeographing and mailing and I also did my own research and analysis and writing and decision making, the latter usually in conversation with other staff. As we said at the time, both about our constituencies and ourselves, \"The people who do the work should make the decisions.\" There were no secretaries in SNCC, with the exception of Norma Collins in the Atlanta office, so there was no office hierarchy. I was at the center of the organization, unlimited except by my own choices and challenged at every turn to think and do and grow and care.<ref>Casey Hayden (1995). \"Feminists and Women,\" 12th Annual Fannie Lou Hamer Symposium Lecture Series, Jackson State University, 4\u20136 October. Document 89, Elaine DeLott Baker Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. p. 2 https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc89.htm</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, it is the recollection of Elaine DeLott Baker that when she joined Hayden in Jackson just the month before Freedom Summer, the era when \"the beloved community\"  operated \"in a space beyond race and gender\" was already being spoken of with nostalgia.<blockquote>There was a hierarchy in place that determined the definition of the \"people\" in the phrase, \"Let the people decide\". There was an unspoken understanding of who should speak up at meetings, who should propose ideas in public places, and who should remain silent. [It] was not the traditional hierarchy, it was a hierarchy based on considerations of race, the amount of time spent in the struggle, dangers suffered, and finally, of gender . . . \u2014black men at the top of the hierarchy, then black women, followed by white men, and at the bottom, white women.</blockquote> \"Women, black and white,\" still retained \"an enormous amount of operational freedom, they were indeed the ones that were keeping things moving.\" But as people began to debate the direction the movement should take \"in the post-freedom summer reality,\" there was \"little public recognition of that reality.\"<ref>Elaine DeLott Baker (2009).

Women seem to be placed in the same position of assumed subordination in personal situations too. It is a caste system which, at its worst, uses and exploits women.</blockquote>\n\nIn November 1965, Hayden had the paper published in ''Liberation'', the bi-monthly of the [[War Resisters League]], the title Sex and Caste being suggested by the editor by David McReynolds.<ref>Document 86A: Casey Hayden (aka Sandra Cason) and Mary King, \"Sex and Caste,\" 18 November 1965, Liberation Magazine, April 1966, Elaine DeLott Baker Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. pp. 35-36. https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc86A.htm</ref> It was, Hayden has pointed out, her \"last action as movement activist.\"<ref>Casey Hayden (2015), \"Only Love Is Radical.\" ''Inspiring Participatory Democracy: Student Movements from Port Huron to Today'', ed.

Filmed interview conducted for ''Eyes on the Prize'' (May 15, 1986). Washington University in St Louis.</ref> She was not asked about the issues raised by ''Sex and Caste'' but was pressed on black-white division within the SNCC Mississippi operation, particularly in the light of calls for [[Black Power]] and black separatism. She allowed that there was an understandable degree of frustration, even resentment, felt by the local black staff, \"the backbone\" of the project, in having to deal \"with a lot of young white people who were intellectual and moneyed.\" Calls for Black Power only came later, after Freedom Summer, and were in great measure a reaction, she believed, to continued political exclusion, something which the refusal to accredit the MFDP at the Democratic convention had dramatically symbolized: \"it was like, if you won't let us in, we'll do our own thing.\"\n\nDivision of any kind, however, was not her abiding memory of the movement. Rather it was the feeling of being \"part of a visionary community which really transcended race and really was integrated,\" and whose later dissipation continued to be felt as \"a great loss.\" It was also \"a lot of fun.\" \"We were all out there doing whatever we thought up to do. We were totally self-directed people, and very few people have that experience.\"\n\nThe \"direction\" travelled with the movement in the South \"put a lot of people in touch with themselves and the idea of organizing for themselves, so it spun off into anti-war organizing, and women's organizing and so on.\" There was also what Hayden called \"the long suits of the black community in the South,\" the \"patience and spirituality.\" This was something she believed northern black intellectuals tried to \"tap into\" and that she felt she and others also \"picked up on.\"\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hayden, Casey}}\n[[Category:American women activists]]\n[[Category:American civil rights activists]]\n[[Category:University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts alumni]]\n[[Category:1937 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American civil rights activist}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name          = Casey Hayden\n| image         = Sandra Cason (\"Casey\" Hayden).jpg\n| alt           = <!-- descriptive text for use by speech synthesis (text-to-speech) software -->\n| caption       = \n| birth_name    = <!-- only use if different from name -->\n| birth_date    = {{Birth date and age|1937|10|31}}\n| birth_place   = \n| death_date    = <!-- {{Death date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|YYYY|MM|DD}} (DEATH date then BIRTH date) -->\n| death_place   = \n| nationality   = American\n| other_names   = \n| occupation    = Civil rights activist\n| years_active  = \n| known_for     = \n| notable_works = \n}}\n\n'''Sandra Cason \"Casey\" Hayden''' (born October 31, 1937), American, was a radical student activist and civil rights worker in the 1960s. Recognized for her defense of [[direct action]] in the struggle against [[racial segregation]], in 1960 she was an early recruit to [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS). With [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) in Mississippi  Hayden was a strategist and organizer for the 1964 [[Freedom Summer]]. In the internal discussion that followed its uncertain outcome, she clashed with the SNCC national executive. Hayden's vision was of a \"radically democratic\" movement driven by organizers in the field. In defending grassroots organization she believed she was also advocating for the voice of women. In \"Sex and Caste\" (November 1965),<ref>Document 86A: Casey Hayden (aka Sandra Cason) and Mary King, \"Sex and Caste,\" 18 November 1965, ''Liberation Magazine'', April 1966, Elaine DeLott Baker Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. pp. 35-36. https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc86A.htm</ref> a reworking of an internal memo they had drafted with other SNCC women, Hayden and [[Mary King (political scientist)|Mary King]] drew  \"parallels\" with the experience of African-Americans to suggest that women are \"caught up in a common-law caste system that operates, sometimes subtly, forcing them to work around or outside hierarchical structures of power.\"  Since regarded as a bridge connecting civil rights to women's liberation, Hayden describes its publication as her \"last action as a movement activist.\" In the decades since, she has continued to acknowledge the civil-rights struggle of the era as the forerunner for women, and for all those, who have taken up \"the idea of organising for themselves.\"\n\n== Early life ==\nCasey Hayden was born Sandra Cason on October 31, 1937, in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]],<ref name=Smith>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Harold L. |editor-last1=Turner |editor-first1=Elizabeth Hayes |editor-last2=Cole |editor-first2=Stephanie |editor-last3=Sharpless |editor-first3=Rebecca |title=Texas Women: Their Histories, Their Lives. |publisher=University of Georgia Press |date=2015 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/texaswomentheirh0000turn/page/295 295\u2013318] |chapter=Casey Hayden: Gender and the Origins of SNCC, SDS, and the Women's Liberation Movement |isbn=9780820347905 |url=https://archive.org/details/texaswomentheirh0000turn/page/295 }}</ref> as a fourth-generation Texan.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt175758p|title=Texas Women: Their Histories, Their Lives|date=2015|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=9780820347202|editor-last=Turner|editor-first=Elizabeth Hayes|editor-last2=Cole|editor-first2=Stephanie|editor-last3=Sharpless|editor-first3=Rebecca|chapter=Their Histories, Their Lives}}</ref> She was raised in Victoria, Texas, in a \"\u201cmultigenerational matriarchal family\u201d<ref>Casey Hayden (2010). \"In the Attics of my Mind.\" Written for Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC.

Dixon (2009) ''Women and the Civil Rights Movement, 1954-1965''. University Press of Mississippi. p. 135</ref>\n\n== Campus activist  ==\nIn 1957 Cason enrolled as junior at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas]]. She moved out of campus dorms into the [[Social Gospel]] and racially-integrated Christian Faith and Life Community, and as officer of [[Young Womens Christian Association]] and member of the Social Action Committee of the university's Religious Council was soon engaged in civil-rights education and protest. Continuing from 1959 as a UT English and philosophy graduate student, she participated in a successful sit-in campaign to desegregate Austin-area restaurants and theaters.\n\nIn a dramatic intervention at the [[National Student Association]] convention in Minneapolis in August 1960, Cason turned back a broadly-supported motion that, objecting to sit-ins, would have denied support to the fledgling [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). \u201cI cannot say to a person who suffers injustice, \u2018Wait,\u2019 And having decided that I cannot urge caution, I must stand with him.\u201d Among the delegates who, after a moments silence, gave her a standing ovation was SDS president [[Alan Haber]], whom, as she recalls, \"scooped\" her \"up,\" and [[Tom Hayden]] editor of University of Michigan student newspaper. Stirred by her \"ability to think morally [and] express herself poetically,\" he followed her into Haber's new left-wing grouping.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 365</ref>\n\nAt the SNCC second coordinating conference in Atlanta in October 1960, Cason reported herself transfixed by the idea of the Beloved Community as espoused by [[James Lawson (activist)|James Lawson]] and [[Diane Nash]] of the [[Nashville Student Movement]].<ref>Houck and Dixon (2009). p. 135</ref>\n\n== With the SNCC in the South==\nIn the summer of 1961 Cason moved to New York City and lived with Tom Hayden. In a ceremony invoking [[Albert Camus]]--\"I, on the other hand, choose justice in order to remain faithful to the world\"\u2014they  married in October, and then moved to Atlanta.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 369</ref>  \"Godmother of the SNCC\" [[Ella Baker]] had hired Cason (now Casey Hayden) for a YWCA special project, travelling to southern campuses to conduct integrated race-relations workshops (secretly in the case of some white schools). She also worked in the SNCC office on, among other projects, preparations for the [[Freedom Riders]] who were to challenge non-enforcement of the United States Supreme Court decision [[Boynton v. Virginia]] (1960). In December, as Freedom Riders themselves, the Haydens were arrested in Albany, Georgia.\n\nIt was from the jail cell that Tom Hayden began drafting what was to become the [[Port Huron Statement]], adopted by the SDS at its convention in June 1962 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  With Tom Hayden elected SDS president for the 1962\u20131963 academic year, and Casey Hayden heeding the SNCC call to return to Atlanta, they separated, divorcing in 1965. While she had had the reputation in the SDS of being \"one of the boys,\"  much of the discussion within the SDS inner circle struck her as young men posturing. Her heart was with the SNCC where, consistent with the focus on action, greater value was placed on building relationships, and where women, Black women, spoke out.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 372</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Casey Hayden moved to Mississippi where, along with [[Doris Derby]], she was asked to begin a literacy project at [[Tougaloo College]] in an all-black community outside Jackson. The comparative safety of the college was a consideration: out in the field the increased visibility she brought as a white woman was a risk not only to herself, but also to her comrades. But it was also important to Hayden that the \"request was specifically made\" because of her background in English education:\n\n<blockquote>As a Southerner, I considered the Southern Freedom Movement Against Segregation mine as much any one else's. I was working for my right to be with who I chose to be with as I chose to be with them. It was my freedom. However, when I worked full time in the black community I considered myself a guest of that community, which required decency and good manners, as every Southerner knows. I considered myself a support person; my appropriate role was to provide support from behind the lines, not to be a leader in any public way.</blockquote>\n\nIt was not that within SNCC she did not have a \"right to leadership\" but that \"it would have been counterproductive.\"<ref>https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc86A.htm</ref>  Not being \"a leader in any public way,\" however, did not leave Hayden feeling in any way excluded. Although she appears quicker to recognize the  advantage it was to her as a woman in the movement than to her as a \"guest\" in the community, Hayden noted that because of \"the participatory, town-hall, consensus-forming nature of the SNCC operation\" being \"on the Executive Committee or a project director didn't carry much weight anyway.\"<ref>Casey Hayden (2015), \"Only Love Is Radical.\" ''Inspiring Participatory Democracy: Student Movements from Port Huron to Today'', ed. Tom Hayden. New York: Routledge, 2015, p. 65.</ref> Her ability to make decisions and to control her own work was not a matter of formal position.\n\nIn 1964 she became organizer and strategist for [[Freedom Summer]] and for the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] in the challenge they were to mount to the seating of the all-white regulars at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]]. She explains that in those roles:\n<blockquote>I did the work all the way up and down. That means I did my own typing and mimeographing and mailing and I also did my own research and analysis and writing and decision making, the latter usually in conversation with other staff. As we said at the time, both about our constituencies and ourselves, \"The people who do the work should make the decisions.\" There were no secretaries in SNCC, with the exception of Norma Collins in the Atlanta office, so there was no office hierarchy. I was at the center of the organization, unlimited except by my own choices and challenged at every turn to think and do and grow and care.<ref>Casey Hayden (1995). \"Feminists and Women,\" 12th Annual Fannie Lou Hamer Symposium Lecture Series, Jackson State University, 4\u20136 October.

There was an unspoken understanding of who should speak up at meetings, who should propose ideas in public places, and who should remain silent. [It] was not the traditional hierarchy, it was a hierarchy based on considerations of race, the amount of time spent in the struggle, dangers suffered, and finally, of gender . . . \u2014black men at the top of the hierarchy, then black women, followed by white men, and at the bottom, white women.</blockquote> \"Women, black and white,\" still retained \"an enormous amount of operational freedom, they were indeed the ones that were keeping things moving.\" But as people began to debate the direction the movement should take \"in the post-freedom summer reality,\" there was \"little public recognition of that reality.\"<ref>Elaine DeLott Baker (2009).

We had been flying by the seat of our pants for years.\" Through the committee Forman put forward a plan for a decision making structure that \"spoke to the structural needs of the Atlanta office.\" [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]] countered with a paper that \"spoke to the structural needs of organizers.\"\n\nHayden's attempt, as she saw it, was \"to get us through the impasse.\" She agreed the need for structure, \"basically\" Forman's, while seeking to maintain \"both SNCC's central allegiance to programmatic control by organizers in the field and respect for the way we had organically developed, the ways we actually operated.\" Her plan went along with Forman's proposal to constitute the staff as the Coordinating Committee (the campus sit-in groups that comprised the original Committee had largely evaporated in the move to voter registration). But she hedged it round with various sub-committees and provisos to ensure that \"leadership for all our programs\" would continue to be driven from the field and not from central office \"which makes many program areas responsible to one person rather than to all of us.\"<ref>(Casey Hayden to Elaine DeLott Baker, 11 September 2014).

She studied Zen Buddhism, and had two children with Dondald Campbell Boyce III, a \"yogi carpenter\" who helped Hayden and others establish the Integral Yoga Institute of San Francisco in 1970.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 409</ref> In 1981, Hayden was back in Atlanta working for the voter-education, voter-registration [[Southern Regional Council]].

A veteran of the [[Poor People's Campaign|1968 Poor People's March on Washington]] and of community organizing with the [[Industrial Areas Foundation]], Buckwalter was an Episcopalian priest and  a leader in the [[Sanctuary movement]].<ref>\"Paul Buckwalter passed away February 15, 2016.\" ''Dunbar Spring Neighborhood''. http://dunbarspring.org/current-news/paul-buckwalter-passed-away-february-15-2016</ref><ref>\"Obituary: Paul Buckwalter.\" Arizona Daily Star.

It was \"the most obvious example,\" she commented, of \"Fortress America, the right wing\u2019s answer to the real issues we all face: 'We\u2019ve got it and we are keeping it and we\u2019ll shoot you if you try to get any of it.'\"<ref>Casey Hayden (2010). \"Boycott Arizona: Church leaders call SB 1070 'racist and sinful'.\" The Rag Blog.

Filmed interview conducted for ''Eyes on the Prize'' (May 15, 1986). Washington University in St Louis.</ref> She was not asked about the issues raised by ''Sex and Caste'' but was pressed on black-white division within the SNCC Mississippi operation, particularly in the light of calls for [[Black Power]] and black separatism. She allowed that there was an understandable degree of frustration, even resentment, felt by the local black staff, \"the backbone\" of the project, in having to deal \"with a lot of young white people who were intellectual and moneyed.\" Calls for Black Power only came later, after Freedom Summer, and were in great measure a reaction, she believed, to continued political exclusion, something which the refusal to accredit the MFDP at the Democratic convention had dramatically symbolized: \"it was like, if you won't let us in, we'll do our own thing.\"\n\nDivision of any kind, however, was not her abiding memory of the movement. Rather it was the feeling of being \"part of a visionary community which really transcended race and really was integrated,\" and whose later dissipation continued to be felt as \"a great loss.\" It was also \"a lot of fun.\" \"We were all out there doing whatever we thought up to do. We were totally self-directed people, and very few people have that experience.\"\n\nThe \"direction\" travelled with the movement in the South \"put a lot of people in touch with themselves and the idea of organizing for themselves, so it spun off into anti-war organizing, and women's organizing and so on.\" There was also what Hayden called \"the long suits of the black community in the South,\" the \"patience and spirituality.\" This was something she believed northern black intellectuals tried to \"tap into\" and that she felt she and others also \"picked up on.\"\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hayden, Casey}}\n[[Category:American women activists]]\n[[Category:American civil rights activists]]\n[[Category:University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts alumni]]\n[[Category:1937 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1700:72a0:4ac0:58f4:8c9c:da3:db55", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(This photo is Joan Mulholland)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Hayden"}
