Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was tasked to fire this explosive charge under simulated battle conditions and was assisted by a party of seven sappers in this task.\n\nWhile Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was in the process of setting up and preparing the Charge Line Mine Clearing for firing, the tail initiator of the charge got prematurely actuated. He at once realized that the entire explosive was likely to blow up within 10 seconds. Realizing the danger to the lives of the men under his command, he immediately ordered them to run to a safe distance and he himself, in utter disregard of his personal safety set upon the hazardous task of uncoupling the actuated initiator to ensure the safety of the men and equipment.\n\nBut unfortunately, in spite of his best efforts and determination, he was not able to prevent the explosion within the few seconds, at his disposal. There was an explosion and Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was blown to pieces.  Thus, in order to save the lives of the men under his command, Nb Sub Gurnam Singh made the supreme self sacrifice.  \n\n== Ashoka Chakra Awardee ==\nNb Sub Gurnam Singh was given the nation's highest gallantry award during peace time \u201cAshok Chakra\u201d for his commendable courage and unflinching devotion to duty.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Template:Ashoka Chakra award recipients}}\n\n<br />\n[[Category:1935 births]]\n[[Category:1973 deaths]]\n[[Category:Indian military personnel]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)]]\n[[Category:Ashoka Chakra]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{Notability|date=March 2020}}\n}}{{Infobox military person\n| honorific_prefix = [[Naib Subedar]]\n| name          = Gurnam Singh\n| honorific_suffix = [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|AC]]\n| image         = Naib Subedar Gurnam Singh.jpg\n| image_size    = 250 px\n| caption       = \n| birth_date    = {{birth date |1935|08|18}}\n| death_date    = {{death date and age |1973|09|23|1935|08|18}}\n| birth_place   = [[Bhullar]], [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab]], [[British India]]\n| death_place   = \n| allegiance    = {{flag|India}}\n| branch        = {{Army|India}}\n| serviceyears  = 1955-1973\n| rank          = [[File:Naib Subedar - Naib Risaldar of the Indian Army.svg|24px]] [[Naib Subedar]]\n| servicenumber = JC47692K\n| unit          = [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|108 Engr Regt]]\n| awards        = [[File:Ashoka Chakra ribbon.svg|25px]] [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakra]]\n}}\n\n[[Naib subedar|Naib Subedar]] '''Gurnam Singh''', [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|AC]] (18 Aug 1935 - 23 Sep 1973) was a [[Junior commissioned officer|Junior Commissioned officer]] (JCO) in [[Indian Army]].

On 5 January 1971, he was then appointed as an instructor at \u201c[[College of Military Engineering, Pune|College of Military Engineering]]\u201d, [[Pune]] after serving with 22 and 23 Field Companies for few years.\n\n== Mine Explosin ==\nOn the 23rd September 1973, a demonstration was arranged by the College of Military Engineering for the visiting staff and student officers of the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington.\u00a0 One part of the demonstration was the actual firing of the Charge Line Mine Clearing, an explosive device for the clearing of enemy mine fields, which was recently introduced in the Army. Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was tasked to fire this explosive charge under simulated battle conditions and was assisted by a party of seven sappers in this task.\n\nWhile Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was in the process of setting up and preparing the Charge Line Mine Clearing for firing, the tail initiator of the charge got prematurely actuated. He at once realized that the entire explosive was likely to blow up within 10 seconds. Realizing the danger to the lives of the men under his command, he immediately ordered them to run to a safe distance and he himself, in utter disregard of his personal safety set upon the hazardous task of uncoupling the actuated initiator to ensure the safety of the men and equipment.\n\nBut unfortunately, in spite of his best efforts and determination, he was not able to prevent the explosion within the few seconds, at his disposal. There was an explosion and Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was blown to pieces.  Thus, in order to save the lives of the men under his command, Nb Sub Gurnam Singh made the supreme self sacrifice.  \n\n== Ashoka Chakra Awardee ==\nNb Sub Gurnam Singh was given the nation's highest gallantry award during peace time \u201cAshok Chakra\u201d for his commendable courage and unflinching devotion to duty.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Template:Ashoka Chakra award recipients}}\n\n<br />\n[[Category:1935 births]]\n[[Category:1973 deaths]]\n[[Category:Indian military personnel]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)]]\n[[Category:Ashoka Chakra]]\n", "name_user": "Koushik Pain", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurnam_Singh_(soldier)"}

Portland's newest bridge in the downtown area, [[Tilikum Crossing]], opened in 2015 and is the first new bridge to span the Willamette in Portland since the 1973 opening of the double-decker [[Fremont Bridge (Portland)|Fremont Bridge]].\n\nOther bridges that span the Willamette river in the downtown area include the [[Burnside Bridge]], the [[Ross Island Bridge]] (both built 1926), and the double-decker [[Marquam Bridge]] (built 1966). Other bridges outside the downtown area include the [[Sellwood Bridge]] (built 2016) to the south; and the [[St. Johns Bridge]], a [[Gothic revival]] suspension bridge built in 1931, to the north. The [[Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Interstate Bridge]] provide access from Portland across the Columbia River into Washington state.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | header_align = center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align = center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = HawthorneBridge-Pano.jpg\n | width1    = 780\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Panorama of downtown Portland in the day.

In 1891 the cities of Portland, [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]], and [[East Portland, Oregon|East Portland]] were consolidated, creating inconsistent patterns of street names and addresses.  It was not unusual for a street name to be duplicated in disparate areas.  The \"Great Renumbering\" on September 2, 1931 standardized street naming patterns and divided Portland into five \"general districts.\"  It also changed house numbers from 20 per block to 100 per block and adopted a single street name on a grid.  For example, the 200 block north of Burnside is either NW Davis Street or NE Davis Street throughout the entire city.<ref>{{Citation|title=Ordinance 61325: Street re-numbering report.

In 1891 the cities of Portland, [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]], and [[East Portland, Oregon|East Portland]] were consolidated, creating inconsistent patterns of street names and addresses.  It was not unusual for a street name to be duplicated in disparate areas.  The \"Great Renumbering\" on September 2, 1931 standardized street naming patterns and divided Portland into five \"general districts.\"  It also changed house numbers from 20 per block to 100 per block and adopted a single street name on a grid.  For example, the 200 block north of Burnside is either NW Davis Street or NE Davis Street throughout the entire city.<ref>{{Citation|title=Ordinance 61325: Street re-numbering report.

In his stories set in [[India]] like ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', Kipling was faced with the problem of Western readers not knowing the culture and environment of that land, so he gradually developed the technique of explaining through example. But this was relatively subtle, compared to Kipling's [[science fiction]] stories, where he used the technique much more obviously and necessarily, to explain an entirely fantastic world unknown to any reader, in his [[Aerial Board of Control]] universe.<ref>[http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=234 Rudyard Kipling Invented SF]</ref>\n\nKipling's writing influenced other science fiction writers, most notably the \"Dean of Science Fiction\", [[Robert A.

This can be done in a number of ways: through [[Dialogue in writing|dialogues]], [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], characters' thoughts,<ref name=\"Dibell 1988 51\" /> background details, [[in-universe]] media,<ref name=\"Morrell 2006 64\">{{cite book|title=Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing|first=Jessica Page|last=Morrell |publisher=Writer's Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|page=64|year=2006|isbn=978-1-58297-393-7|ref=harv}}</ref> or the narrator telling a [[backstory]].<ref name=\"Dibell 1988 51\">{{cite book|title=Plot|first=Ansen|last=Dibell|publisher=Writer\u2019s Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, OH|year=1988|isbn=0-89879-303-3|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/plotdibe00dibe}} *{{cite book|title=Building Better Plots|first=Robert|last=Kernen|publisher=Writer\u2019s Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, Ohio|page=51|year=1999|isbn=0-89879-903-1}}</ref> Instead of saying \"I am a woman\", a first person narrator can say \"I kept the papers inside my purse.\" The reader (in most English-speaking cultures) now knows the character is probably female.<ref>[http://rachelsimon.com/wwg_exposition_v2.php The Writer's Writing Guide: Exposition]</ref>\n\nIndirect exposition has always occurred in storytelling incidentally, but is first clearly identified, in the modern literary world, in the writing of [[Rudyard Kipling]]. In his stories set in [[India]] like ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', Kipling was faced with the problem of Western readers not knowing the culture and environment of that land, so he gradually developed the technique of explaining through example. But this was relatively subtle, compared to Kipling's [[science fiction]] stories, where he used the technique much more obviously and necessarily, to explain an entirely fantastic world unknown to any reader, in his [[Aerial Board of Control]] universe.<ref>[http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=234 Rudyard Kipling Invented SF]</ref>\n\nKipling's writing influenced other science fiction writers, most notably the \"Dean of Science Fiction\", [[Robert A. Heinlein#Writing style|Robert Heinlein]], who became known for his advanced rhetorical and storytelling techniques, including indirect exposition. \n\nThe word ''incluing'' is attributed to fantasy and science fiction author [[Jo Walton]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Michelle Bottorff|url=http://www.lshelby.com/rasfcFAQ.html|title=rec.arts.sf.composition Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Lshelby.com|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref> She defined it as \"the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html|title=papersky: Thud: Half a Crown & Incluing|publisher=Papersky.livejournal.com|date=|accessdate=6 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119145140/http://papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html|archive-date=19 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> \"Information dump\" (or info-dump) is the term given for overt exposition, which writers want to avoid.<ref name=Bell>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=James Scott|title=Write Great Fiction \u2013 Plot & Structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL1MCUXmqdcC&pg=PT78|date=22 September 2004|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=978-1-58297-684-6|page=78}}</ref><ref>=http://www.screenplayology.com/content-sections/screenplay-form-content/3-3/</ref> In an ''idiot lecture'', characters tell each other information that needs to be explained for the purpose of the audience, but of which the characters in-universe would already be aware.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Ashmead|author2=Darrell Schweitzer|author3=George H.

Due to this declaration, the peace talks between the government and the NDF resumed on August 2016. The peace talks were carried out in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].\n\nIn February 2017, the CPP-NPA-NDF declared that they will withdraw from the ceasefire, effective on 10 February 2017, due to the unfulfilled promise by the government that it will release all 392 political prisoners. However, the communists attacked and killed 3 soldiers before the withdrawal, which angered the government and made them declare a withdrawal from the ceasefire also. The peace talks was informally terminated and an all-out war was declared by the AFP after the withdrawal.\n\nIn March 2017, the government announced a new truce and the resumption of peace talks, to take place in April.

While Samar represents 2% and 5% of the Philippine population and territory respectively, 11% of all NPA related incidents have taken place on the island. Samar's terrain consists of densely forested mountainous areas, providing fertile ground for the conduct of guerrilla warfare.<ref name=Damw/>\n\nAn important factor in the spread of the rebellion was the issue of widespread landlessness. Land reforms provided only a limited solution for the millions of Philippine landless farmers. In the case of Samar, 40 landowning clans controlled approximately half of the island's agricultural land. Instances of landowner harassment and violence towards working class tenants led to escalating tensions between the two social groups.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nAnother factor into the Samar Island being a stronghold is historically the island has been among the most rebellious against the American Commonwealth rule, Spanish rule, and the Japanese occupation.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nIn 1976, NPA gained popular support among the inhabitants of Samar following vigilante actions against cattle rustling gangs. The following year, NPA transferred agents from [[Cebu]] and Manila where conditions were less favorable. The influx of troops enable NPA to form units fully engaged in guerrilla activities. In 1982, an unofficial communist government was formed, solidifying Samar as a communist stronghold. The 1980s downfall of the coconut industry greatly affected livelihoods of many Samaranos, further fueling the rebellion. Between January 2011 and December 2012, a total of 153 insurgency related incidents took place in [[Samar]], resulting in 21 deaths and 55 injuries.<ref name=Damw/>\n\n==Peace talks==\nBased on the

The peace talks were carried out in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].\n\nIn February 2017, the CPP-NPA-NDF declared that they will withdraw from the ceasefire, effective on 10 February 2017, due to the unfulfilled promise by the government that it will release all 392 political prisoners. However, the communists attacked and killed 3 soldiers before the withdrawal, which angered the government and made them declare a withdrawal from the ceasefire also. The peace talks was informally terminated and an all-out war was declared by the AFP after the withdrawal.\n\nIn March 2017, the government announced a new truce and the resumption of peace talks, to take place in April.

While Samar represents 2% and 5% of the Philippine population and territory respectively, 11% of all NPA related incidents have taken place on the island. Samar's terrain consists of densely forested mountainous areas, providing fertile ground for the conduct of guerrilla warfare.<ref name=Damw/>\n\nAn important factor in the spread of the rebellion was the issue of widespread landlessness. Land reforms provided only a limited solution for the millions of Philippine landless farmers. In the case of Samar, 40 landowning clans controlled approximately half of the island's agricultural land. Instances of landowner harassment and violence towards working class tenants led to escalating tensions between the two social groups.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nAnother factor into the Samar Island being a stronghold is historically the island has been among the most rebellious against the American Commonwealth rule, Spanish rule, and the Japanese occupation.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nIn 1976, NPA gained popular support among the inhabitants of Samar following vigilante actions against cattle rustling gangs. The following year, NPA transferred agents from [[Cebu]] and Manila where conditions were less favorable. The influx of troops enable NPA to form units fully engaged in guerrilla activities. In 1982, an unofficial communist government was formed, solidifying Samar as a communist stronghold. The 1980s downfall of the coconut industry greatly affected livelihoods of many Samaranos, further fueling the rebellion. Between January 2011 and December 2012, a total of 153 insurgency related incidents took place in [[Samar]], resulting in 21 deaths and 55 injuries.<ref name=Damw/>\n\n==Peace talks==\nBased on the records of the [[Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process]], the Government of the Philippines and the CPP-NPA-NDF had engaged in over 40 rounds of peace talks by November 2017.<ref name=\"Marchadesch20171124\">{{Cite news |last=Marchadesch |first=Barbara |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/634324/timeline-the-peace-talks-between-the-government-and-the-cpp-npa-ndf-1986-present/story/ |title=TIMELINE: The peace talks between the government and the CPP-NPA-NDF, 1986 \u2013 present |date=2017-11-24 |work=GMA News Online |access-date=2020-04-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124103321/http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/634324/timeline-the-peace-talks-between-the-government-and-the-cpp-npa-ndf-1986-present/story/ |archive-date=2017-11-24 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion]]\n* [[Maoism]]\n* [[Political killings in the Philippines (2001\u201310)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Communism in the Philippines}}\n{{The Marcoses}}\n{{Philippines topics}}\n{{Ongoing military conflicts}}\n{{Philippines conflicts}}\n{{Post-Cold War Asian conflicts}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion}}\n[[Category:Communism in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Communist rebellions]]\n[[Category:20th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:21st-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Ongoing insurgencies]]\n[[Category:Maoism in Asia]]\n[[Category:Insurgencies in Asia]]\n[[Category:Military history of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:History of the Philippines (1965\u201386)]]\n[[Category:History of the Philippines (1986\u2013present)]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Proxy wars]]\n", "name_user": "Chieharumachi", "label": "safe", "comment": "corrected layout error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_rebellion_in_the_Philippines"}

The 37th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the tenth and last released during the [[Disney Renaissance]] era, it is based on the story ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], being the first animated major motion picture version of the story. Directed by [[Chris Buck]] and [[Kevin Lima]] from a screenplay by Tab Murphy, [[Bob Tzudiker]], and [[Noni White]], the film stars the voices of [[Tony Goldwyn]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Brian Blessed]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Wayne Knight]], and [[Nigel Hawthorne]].\n\nPre-production of ''Tarzan'' began in 1995, with Lima selected as director<ref>{{cite web|last=Fulton|first=Rick|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BACK+TO+BASICS%3A+DISNEY+FINALLY+MAKE+THE+APE+MAN+THE+KIND.-a060358245|title=Back to Basics: Disney Finally Makes the Ape Man the Kind|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]]|publisher=TheFreeLibrary.com|date=September 17, 1999|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> and Buck joining him the same year. Following Murphy's first draft, Tzudiker, White, and Dave Reynolds were brought in to reconstruct the third act and add additional material to the screenplay. English recording artist [[Phil Collins]] was recruited to compose and record songs integrated with a score by [[Mark Mancina]]. Meanwhile, the production team embarked on a research trip to [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] to study the gorillas. The animation of the film combines [[traditional animation|2D traditional hand-drawn animation]] with the extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]], and it was done in California, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and Paris, with the pioneering [[computer animation]] software system Deep Canvas being predominantly used to create three-dimensional backgrounds.\n\n''Tarzan'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on June 12, 1999, and was released in the United States on June 16, 1999. It received a positive reaction from critics, who praised its animation and music. Against a production budget of $130 million (then the most expensive animated film ever made until  ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' in 2001), the film grossed $448.2 million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest film release in 1999, the second-highest animation release of 1999 behind ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and the first Disney animated feature to open at first place at the North American box office since ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995). It won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (\"You'll Be in My Heart\" by Phil Collins). The film has led to many derived works, such as a [[Tarzan (musical)|Broadway adaptation]], a [[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|television series]], and two [[direct-to-video]] sequels: ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tarzan II]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 19th century, an English couple and their infant son survive a shipwreck. They end up near an uncharted rainforest on the Congolese coast, where they build themselves a treehouse from the ship's wreckage. Meanwhile, [[Kerchak]], the leader of a troop of gorillas, and his mate [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] mourn the death of their baby at the hands of a savage leopard named [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]]. Soon afterward, Kala hears the infant son's cries and finds the treehouse, where she discovers that Sabor has killed the couple as well. Kala encounters Sabor and escapes with the infant in her possession. Kala takes the infant back to her troop to raise as her own, an action which Kerchak objects to. Kala adopts the human child, naming him Tarzan. When aged seven, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including Kala and Kerchak's niece [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]] and a paranoid elephant named Tantor; but he is treated hostilely by Kerchak due to physical differences, so he makes great efforts to improve himself. As an adult, Tarzan manages to slay Sabor with a spear he crafted, gaining Kerchak's respect.\n\nOne day, the gorillas' peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of English explorers, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]], and their tour guide, a hunter named Clayton, who have come looking for gorillas to study. Jane drifts out of the group, and is attacked by a baboon troop, who chase her through the trees' branches, but a curious Tarzan manages to save her. Tarzan realizes that Jane is similar to him, and she leads him to their camp, where Porter and Clayton garner interest in him. Porter views Tarzan as an opportunity for scientific advancement, while Clayton desires to persuade Tarzan to lead him to the gorillas. Kerchak firmly warns Tarzan to stay away from them, but Tarzan disobeys his warnings and continues to return to the camp, where the Porters and Clayton teach him what the human civilization is like with the use of a slide projector and various other gadgets. A few months pass, and Jane and Tarzan begin to develop feelings for each other, but Tarzan still refuses to lead them to the gorillas out of respect for Kerchak.\n\nThe explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says that it is unlikely that they will ever return. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him if he leads them to the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the trio to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to prevent him from attacking the humans. Jane and her father are excited to mingle with the gorillas, when suddenly, Kerchak returns and attacks the Porters and Clayton, but Tarzan stops him with a chokehold, allowing them to escape. Kerchak accuses Tarzan of betraying the troop, who turns against him. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse where she found him and reveals his past to him. He dons a suit that once belonged to his father, signifying his decision to go to England, before he and Kala share a bittersweet goodbye.\n\nWhen Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter, they are all captured by Clayton and his band of stowaway poachers. Clayton reveals his plan to capture the gorillas and sell them for a fortune, and he was just using the Porters for a way to go to the jungle. He subsequently used Tarzan to find the nesting grounds and locks him, Jane, and Porter away in the storage area of the ship. Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor and returns to the jungle to save the gorillas. During the ensuing battle, Clayton fatally shoots Kerchak and fights Tarzan across the treetops. Although Tarzan spares his life and destroys his shotgun, Clayton tries to kill him with his machete. After Tarzan traps Clayton in vines, Clayton wildly slashes the vines with his machete, causing him to fall from the tree with a vine tangled around his throat, hanging and killing him. Kerchak apologizes to Tarzan, finally accepts him as his son, and names him his successor before peacefully dying.\n\nThe next day, Jane and her father prepare to leave on the ship, but Tarzan remains behind with the gorilla troop, intending to withhold Kerchak's last wish to lead and protect the family in his place. As the ship departs, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with Tarzan, and Jane jumps overboard to meet Tarzan with her father shortly following her. The Porters reunite with Tarzan and embark on their new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as [[Tarzan]], a twenty-year-old man raised by gorillas who finds his human roots. [[Glen Keane]] served as the supervising animator for Tarzan as an adult, while John Ripa animated Tarzan as an infant and child. John Ripa studied the movements of young chimpanzees to use for young Tarzan's animation.<ref name=\"Green\" /> [[Brian Blessed]] provided the [[Tarzan yell]], while Goldwyn provided Tarzan's speaking voice.\n:*[[Alex D. Linz]] as young Tarzan\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], the eccentric, feisty, kind-hearted, and intelligent daughter of Professor Porter. She is the first of the group to encounter Tarzan and becomes his love interest. Ken Duncan served as the supervising animator for Jane. Many of Driver's mannerisms and characteristics were incorporated into Jane's animation. The scene where Jane describes meeting Tarzan for the first time to her father and Clayton was improvised by Driver, resulting in Ken Duncan animating one of the longest animated scenes on record. The scene took 7 weeks to animate and 73 feet of film.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n* [[Glenn Close]] as [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]], Tarzan's adoptive mother, who found and raised him after losing her biological son to Sabor. She is also Kerchak's mate. [[Russ Edmonds]] served as the supervising animator for Kala.\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as [[Kerchak]], Kala's mate and the leader of the gorilla troop who struggles to accept Tarzan. [[Bruce W. Smith]] served as the supervising animator for Kerchak.\n* [[Brian Blessed]] as [[William Cecil Clayton|William Clayton]], an intelligent and suave - yet arrogant and treacherous - hunter, who guides the Porters on their quest. Randy Haycock served as the supervising animator for Clayton, basing his design on [[Clark Gable]] and other film stars of the 1930s and 40s.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, an eccentric, short-statured scientist and Jane's father. Dave Burgess served as the supervising animator for Porter. This was Hawthorne's final voice acting role before his death in 2001.\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as Terk (short for Terkina, a feminization of Terkoz merged with Teeka), Tarzan's best friend, a wisecracking gorilla. She is also Kala and Kerchak's niece, making her and Tarzan adoptive cousins. Michael Surrey served as the supervising animator for Terk.\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as [[Tantor]], a paranoid and submissive elephant, and Tarzan and Terk's close friend. [[Sergio Pablos]] served as the supervising animator for Tantor.\n:*Taylor Dempsey as young Tantor. \n* [[Erik von Detten]] and [[Jason Marsden]] as Flynt and Mungo, a duo of young gorillas who are friends with Terk.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDisney's ''Tarzan'' was the first Tarzan film to be animated.<ref>{{cite web|last=Whipp|first=Glenn|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WITH+%60TARZAN,'+IT'S+A+DISNEY+JUNGLE+OUT+THERE.-a083614442|title=With Tarzan, It's A Disney Jungle Out There|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407132030/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WITH+%60TARZAN,'+IT'S+A+DISNEY+JUNGLE+OUT+THERE.-a083614442|date=June 16, 1999|accessdate=September 29, 2014|archivedate=April 7, 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=TheFreeLibrary.com}}</ref> [[Thomas Schumacher]], the President of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], expressed surprise that there weren't any previous attempts to animate a ''Tarzan'' film, saying, \"Here is a book that cries out to be animated.

For the third act, Murphy suggested that Tarzan should leave for England, as he did in the book, but the directors felt that it was incompatible with their central theme of what defines a family. In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle, the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In this departure from Burrough's novel, a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q.

The 6000-mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration, especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane. [[Glen Keane]] was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio, while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank. To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier, the animators used a system called a \"scene machine\" that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Meanwhile, following production on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', two hundred animators at the [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida|Feature Animation Florida satellite studio]] provided character animation and special effects animation where the filmmakers had to discuss their work through daily video conferences among the three studios.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abbott|first=Jim|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-06-08/lifestyle/9906070397_1_animated-tarzan-keane-character|title=A Fresh Tarzan|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=June 8, 1999|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nKeane was inspired to make Tarzan \"surf\" through the trees because of his son's interest in extreme sports, and he began working on a test scene. The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a \"surfer dude\", but when Keane revealed the test animation to them they liked it enough to use it in the film during the \"Son of Man\" sequence, with movements inspired by skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]. Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth, he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal. To figure out Tarzan's movements, the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him. They also consulted with a professor of anatomy. This resulted in Tarzan being the first Disney character to accurately display working muscles.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n\nTo prepare for animating the gorillas, the animation team attended lectures on primates, made trips to zoos, and studied nature documentaries, with a group of animators also witnessing a gorilla dissection to learn about their musculature. In 1996, the animation team went on a two-week safari in Kenya to take reference photographs and observe the animals. On the trip, they visited [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda to view mountain gorillas in the wild, and get inspiration for the setting.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In 2000, Chris Buck repeated the journey accompanied by journalists to promote the film's home video release.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Falk|first1=Quentin|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HOLIDAYS%3A+Close+encounter+of+the+hairy+kind.-a064964720|title=Holidays: Close encounter of the hairy kind|accessdate=August 30, 2014|work=Sunday Mirror|publisher=MGN Ltd.|date=September 3, 2000|page=53}} Available through [[ProQuest]] Historical Newsstand.</ref>\n\nTo create the sweeping 3D backgrounds, ''Tarzan''{{'}}s production team developed a 3D painting and rendering technique known as ''Deep Canvas'' (a term coined by artist/engineer Eric Daniels).<ref name=\"Essman\" /> This technique allows artists to produce [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] background that looks like a traditional painting, according to art director [[Daniel St. Pierre]].<ref name=\"Essman\" /> (The software keeps track of brushstrokes applied in 3D space.)<ref name=\"Essman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |title=State of the Art of F/X |accessdate=April 6, 2009 |last=Essman |first=Scott |date=July 5, 1999 |publisher=MovieMaker Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606210336/http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |archivedate=June 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For this advancement, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded the creators of ''Deep Canvas'' a Technical Achievement Award in 2003.

The 37th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the tenth and last released during the [[Disney Renaissance]] era, it is based on the story ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], being the first animated major motion picture version of the story. Directed by [[Chris Buck]] and [[Kevin Lima]] from a screenplay by Tab Murphy, [[Bob Tzudiker]], and [[Noni White]], the film stars the voices of [[Tony Goldwyn]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Brian Blessed]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Wayne Knight]], and [[Nigel Hawthorne]].\n\nPre-production of ''Tarzan'' began in 1995, with Lima selected as director<ref>{{cite web|last=Fulton|first=Rick|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BACK+TO+BASICS%3A+DISNEY+FINALLY+MAKE+THE+APE+MAN+THE+KIND.-a060358245|title=Back to Basics: Disney Finally Makes the Ape Man the Kind|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]]|publisher=TheFreeLibrary.com|date=September 17, 1999|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> and Buck joining him the same year. Following Murphy's first draft, Tzudiker, White, and Dave Reynolds were brought in to reconstruct the third act and add additional material to the screenplay. English recording artist [[Phil Collins]] was recruited to compose and record songs integrated with a score by [[Mark Mancina]]. Meanwhile, the production team embarked on a research trip to [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] to study the gorillas. The animation of the film combines [[traditional animation|2D traditional hand-drawn animation]] with the extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]], and it was done in California, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and Paris, with the pioneering [[computer animation]] software system Deep Canvas being predominantly used to create three-dimensional backgrounds.\n\n''Tarzan'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on June 12, 1999, and was released in the United States on June 16, 1999. It received a positive reaction from critics, who praised its animation and music. Against a production budget of $130 million (then the most expensive animated film ever made until  ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' in 2001), the film grossed $448.2 million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest film release in 1999, the second-highest animation release of 1999 behind ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and the first Disney animated feature to open at first place at the North American box office since ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995). It won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (\"You'll Be in My Heart\" by Phil Collins). The film has led to many derived works, such as a [[Tarzan (musical)|Broadway adaptation]], a [[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|television series]], and two [[direct-to-video]] sequels: ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tarzan II]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 19th century, an English couple and their infant son survive a shipwreck. They end up near an uncharted rainforest on the Congolese coast, where they build themselves a treehouse from the ship's wreckage. Meanwhile, [[Kerchak]], the leader of a troop of gorillas, and his mate [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] mourn the death of their baby at the hands of a savage leopard named [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]]. Soon afterward, Kala hears the infant son's cries and finds the treehouse, where she discovers that Sabor has killed the couple as well. Kala encounters Sabor and escapes with the infant in her possession. Kala takes the infant back to her troop to raise as her own, an action which Kerchak objects to. Kala adopts the human child, naming him Tarzan. When aged seven, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including Kala and Kerchak's niece [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]] and a paranoid elephant named Tantor; but he is treated hostilely by Kerchak due to physical differences, so he makes great efforts to improve himself. As an adult, Tarzan manages to slay Sabor with a spear he crafted, gaining Kerchak's respect.\n\nOne day, the gorillas' peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of English explorers, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]], and their tour guide, a hunter named Clayton, who have come looking for gorillas to study. Jane drifts out of the group, and is attacked by a baboon troop, who chase her through the trees' branches, but a curious Tarzan manages to save her. Tarzan realizes that Jane is similar to him, and she leads him to their camp, where Porter and Clayton garner interest in him. Porter views Tarzan as an opportunity for scientific advancement, while Clayton desires to persuade Tarzan to lead him to the gorillas. Kerchak firmly warns Tarzan to stay away from them, but Tarzan disobeys his warnings and continues to return to the camp, where the Porters and Clayton teach him what the human civilization is like with the use of a slide projector and various other gadgets. A few months pass, and Jane and Tarzan begin to develop feelings for each other, but Tarzan still refuses to lead them to the gorillas out of respect for Kerchak.\n\nThe explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says that it is unlikely that they will ever return. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him if he leads them to the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the trio to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to prevent him from attacking the humans. Jane and her father are excited to mingle with the gorillas, when suddenly, Kerchak returns and attacks the Porters and Clayton, but Tarzan stops him with a chokehold, allowing them to escape. Kerchak accuses Tarzan of betraying the troop, who turns against him. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse where she found him and reveals his past to him. He dons a suit that once belonged to his father, signifying his decision to go to England, before he and Kala share a bittersweet goodbye.\n\nWhen Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter, they are all captured by Clayton and his band of stowaway poachers. Clayton reveals his plan to capture the gorillas and sell them for a fortune, and he was just using the Porters for a way to go to the jungle. He subsequently used Tarzan to find the nesting grounds and locks him, Jane, and Porter away in the storage area of the ship. Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor and returns to the jungle to save the gorillas. During the ensuing battle, Clayton fatally shoots Kerchak and fights Tarzan across the treetops. Although Tarzan spares his life and destroys his shotgun, Clayton tries to kill him with his machete. After Tarzan traps Clayton in vines, Clayton wildly slashes the vines with his machete, causing him to fall from the tree with a vine tangled around his throat, hanging and killing him. Kerchak apologizes to Tarzan, finally accepts him as his son, and names him his successor before peacefully dying.\n\nThe next day, Jane and her father prepare to leave on the ship, but Tarzan remains behind with the gorilla troop, intending to withhold Kerchak's last wish to lead and protect the family in his place. As the ship departs, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with Tarzan, and Jane jumps overboard to meet Tarzan with her father shortly following her. The Porters reunite with Tarzan and embark on their new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as [[Tarzan]], a twenty-year-old man raised by gorillas who finds his human roots.

For the third act, Murphy suggested that Tarzan should leave for England, as he did in the book, but the directors felt that it was incompatible with their central theme of what defines a family. In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle, the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In this departure from Burrough's novel, a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q.

The 6000-mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration, especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane. [[Glen Keane]] was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio, while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank. To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier, the animators used a system called a \"scene machine\" that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Meanwhile, following production on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', two hundred animators at the [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida|Feature Animation Florida satellite studio]] provided character animation and special effects animation where the filmmakers had to discuss their work through daily video conferences among the three studios.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abbott|first=Jim|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-06-08/lifestyle/9906070397_1_animated-tarzan-keane-character|title=A Fresh Tarzan|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=June 8, 1999|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nKeane was inspired to make Tarzan \"surf\" through the trees because of his son's interest in extreme sports, and he began working on a test scene. The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a \"surfer dude\", but when Keane revealed the test animation to them they liked it enough to use it in the film during the \"Son of Man\" sequence, with movements inspired by skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]. Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth, he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal. To figure out Tarzan's movements, the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him. They also consulted with a professor of anatomy. This resulted in Tarzan being the first Disney character to accurately display working muscles.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n\nTo prepare for animating the gorillas, the animation team attended lectures on primates, made trips to zoos, and studied nature documentaries, with a group of animators also witnessing a gorilla dissection to learn about their musculature. In 1996, the animation team went on a two-week safari in Kenya to take reference photographs and observe the animals. On the trip, they visited [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda to view mountain gorillas in the wild, and get inspiration for the setting.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In 2000, Chris Buck repeated the journey accompanied by journalists to promote the film's home video release.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Falk|first1=Quentin|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HOLIDAYS%3A+Close+encounter+of+the+hairy+kind.-a064964720|title=Holidays: Close encounter of the hairy kind|accessdate=August 30, 2014|work=Sunday Mirror|publisher=MGN Ltd.|date=September 3, 2000|page=53}} Available through [[ProQuest]] Historical Newsstand.</ref>\n\nTo create the sweeping 3D backgrounds, ''Tarzan''{{'}}s production team developed a 3D painting and rendering technique known as ''Deep Canvas'' (a term coined by artist/engineer Eric Daniels).<ref name=\"Essman\" /> This technique allows artists to produce [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] background that looks like a traditional painting, according to art director [[Daniel St. Pierre]].<ref name=\"Essman\" /> (The software keeps track of brushstrokes applied in 3D space.)<ref name=\"Essman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |title=State of the Art of F/X |accessdate=April 6, 2009 |last=Essman |first=Scott |date=July 5, 1999 |publisher=MovieMaker Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606210336/http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |archivedate=June 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For this advancement, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded the creators of ''Deep Canvas'' a Technical Achievement Award in 2003.
