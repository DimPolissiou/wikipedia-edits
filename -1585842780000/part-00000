This is the only viral [[capsid]] protein of \u03a6X174 to lack a crystal structure for a couple of reasons. It has low aromatic content and high [[glycine]] content, making the protein structure very flexible and in addition, individual hydrogen atoms (the R group for glycines) are difficult to detect in protein crystallography.  Additionally, H protein induces [[lysis]] of the bacterial host at high concentrations as the predicted N-terminal transmembrane helix easily pokes holes through the bacterial wall.  By [[bioinformatics]], this protein contains four predicted [[coiled-coil]] domains which has a significant homology to known transcription factors.  Additionally, it was determined that ''de novo'' H protein was required for optimal synthesis of other viral proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruboyianes MV, Chen M, Dubrava MS, Cherwa JE, Fane BA | title = The expression of N-terminal deletion DNA pilot proteins inhibits the early stages of phiX174 replication | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 83 | issue = 19 | pages = 9952\u20136 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19640994 | pmc = 2748053 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.01077-09 }}</ref> Mutations in H protein that prevent viral incorporation, can be overcome when excess amounts of protein B, the internal scaffolding protein, are supplied.\n\nThe DNA is ejected through a hydrophilic channel at the 5-fold vertex<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McKenna R, Xia D, Willingmann P, Ilag LL, Krishnaswamy S, Rossmann MG, Olson NH, Baker TS, Incardona NL | title = Atomic structure of single-stranded DNA bacteriophage phi X174 and its functional implications | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue = 6356 | pages = 137\u201343 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1370343 | pmc = 4167681 | doi = 10.1038/355137a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.355..137M }}</ref>.  It is understood that H protein resides in this area but experimental evidence has not verified its exact location.  Once inside the host bacterium, replication of the [+] ssDNA genome proceeds via [[negative sense DNA]] intermediate.  This is done as the phage genome supercoils and the secondary structure formed by such supercoiling attracts a [[primosome]] protein complex.  This translocates once around the genome and synthesizes a [-]ssDNA from the positive original genome. [+]ssDNA genomes to package into viruses are created from this by a rolling circle mechanism.  This is the mechanism by which the double stranded supercoiled genome is nicked on the positive strand by a virus-encoded A protein, also attracting a bacterial [[DNA polymerase]] (DNAP) to the site of cleavage.  DNAP uses the negative strand as a template to make positive sense DNA.  As it translocates around the genome it displaces the outer strand of already-synthesised DNA, which is immediately coated by [[SSBP]] proteins.  The A protein cleaves the complete genome every time it recognises the origin sequence.\n\nAs D protein is the most abundant gene transcript, it is the most protein in the viral procapsid.  Similarly, gene transcripts for F, J, and G are more abundant than for H as the [[stoichiometry]] for these structural proteins is 5:5:5:1. The primosomes are protein complexes which attach/bind the enzyme [[helicase]] on the template. Primosomes gives RNA primers for DNA synthesis to strands.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Evolution===\nIt has been used as a [[model organism]] in many evolution experiments,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wichman HA, Brown CJ | title = Experimental evolution of viruses: Microviridae as a model system | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This is the only viral [[capsid]] protein of \u03a6X174 to lack a crystal structure for a couple of reasons. It has low aromatic content and high [[glycine]] content, making the protein structure very flexible and in addition, individual hydrogen atoms (the R group for glycines) are difficult to detect in protein crystallography.  Additionally, H protein induces [[lysis]] of the bacterial host at high concentrations as the predicted N-terminal transmembrane helix easily pokes holes through the bacterial wall.  By [[bioinformatics]], this protein contains four predicted [[coiled-coil]] domains which has a significant homology to known transcription factors.  Additionally, it was determined that ''de novo'' H protein was required for optimal synthesis of other viral proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruboyianes MV, Chen M, Dubrava MS, Cherwa JE, Fane BA | title = The expression of N-terminal deletion DNA pilot proteins inhibits the early stages of phiX174 replication | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 83 | issue = 19 | pages = 9952\u20136 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19640994 | pmc = 2748053 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.01077-09 }}</ref> Mutations in H protein that prevent viral incorporation, can be overcome when excess amounts of protein B, the internal scaffolding protein, are supplied.\n\nThe DNA is ejected through a hydrophilic channel at the 5-fold vertex<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McKenna R, Xia D, Willingmann P, Ilag LL, Krishnaswamy S, Rossmann MG, Olson NH, Baker TS, Incardona NL | title = Atomic structure of single-stranded DNA bacteriophage phi X174 and its functional implications | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue = 6356 | pages = 137\u201343 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1370343 | pmc = 4167681 | doi = 10.1038/355137a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.355..137M }}</ref>.  It is understood that H protein resides in this area but experimental evidence has not verified its exact location.  Once inside the host bacterium, replication of the [+] ssDNA genome proceeds via [[negative sense DNA]] intermediate.  This is done as the phage genome supercoils and the secondary structure formed by such supercoiling attracts a [[primosome]] protein complex.  This translocates once around the genome and synthesizes a [-]ssDNA from the positive original genome. [+]ssDNA genomes to package into viruses are created from this by a rolling circle mechanism.  This is the mechanism by which the double stranded supercoiled genome is nicked on the positive strand by a virus-encoded A protein, also attracting a bacterial [[DNA polymerase]] (DNAP) to the site of cleavage.  DNAP uses the negative strand as a template to make positive sense DNA.  As it translocates around the genome it displaces the outer strand of already-synthesised DNA, which is immediately coated by [[SSBP]] proteins.  The A protein cleaves the complete genome every time it recognises the origin sequence.\n\nAs D protein is the most abundant gene transcript, it is the most protein in the viral procapsid.  Similarly, gene transcripts for F, J, and G are more abundant than for H as the [[stoichiometry]] for these structural proteins is 5:5:5:1. The primosomes are protein complexes which attach/bind the enzyme [[helicase]] on the template. Primosomes gives RNA primers for DNA synthesis to strands.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Evolution===\nIt has been used as a [[model organism]] in many evolution experiments,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wichman HA, Brown CJ | title = Experimental evolution of viruses: Microviridae as a model system | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.
