It was named after [[George Wythe]], the first Virginian signer of the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]]. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the [[Battle of Cove Mountain]] was fought in the county.\n\nPrior to Wythe County's creation, what is now the Wythe County community of Austinville served as the county seat for [[Fincastle County]], an extinct Virginia county whose borders stretched from Roanoke, Virginia, to the Mississippi River \u2013 a county roughly the size of half the State of Texas.<ref>Appalachian Magazine [http://appalachianmagazine.com/2015/01/02/wythe-county-turns-225-years-old-in-2015-is-the-place-to-visit-for-historians/ Wythe County Turns 225 Years Old in 2015].</ref>\n\nWythe County's Austinville community was founded by Stephen and his brother [[Moses Austin]], father of the famous [[Stephen F. Austin]].  In the 1790s the Austins took over the mines that produced lead and zinc; the town was named for the Austin surname, and not for any one particular Austin of the brothers who bore that surname.  Lead was mined and shipped throughout the fledgling country; [[lead shot]] was also produced. Located near Fosters Falls, [[Jackson Ferry Shot Tower]] still stands as a testament to the citizens of Wythe County.  Lead was hoisted to the top of the tower using block and tackle and oxen.  The lead was melted in a retort and then poured through a sieve at the top of the tower. The droplets of molten lead would become round during the 150-foot descent.  The shot would collect in a kettle of water and slave laborers<ref>Slavery in the American Mountain South, Wilma A. Dunaway; Cambridge University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-521-01215-7}}</ref> would enter through a 110-foot access tunnel located near the bank of the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] to retrieve the shot from the kettle.\n\nThe lead mines closed in 1982 due to new [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] standards and the lack of a market for lead. The mines have since filled with water; the main shaft extended in excess of 1100 feet straight down.\n\nAnother notable area within the county is the unincorporated community of [[Fort Chiswell, Virginia|Fort Chiswell]] - named for a [[French and Indian War]] era fort. The fort and its surrounding buildings served as the county seat until the incorporated town of Wytheville was established approximately 10 miles to the west. The fort fell into disrepair and its ruins were covered over when the intersection of [[Interstate 77|I-77]] and [[Interstate 81|I-81]] was constructed in the 1970s. A pyramid marker now stands in the approximate location of the former fort. The community was named for Colonel [[John Chiswell]] who helped establish the lead mines (1757) prior to the Austin's purchase.\n\nWythe County's location, at the confluence of I-81 and I-77 which is, incidentally, a [[wrong-way concurrency]], has led to its growth for industry and tourism.  Recently [[Gatorade]] and [[Pepsi]] manufacturing facilities have located here, primarily due to the ease of access and central location along the Eastern seabord. There are a variety of travel-related businesses including several hundred hotel rooms, several [[truck stops]], and restaurants located in the county.\nTourism takes a variety of different forms in Wythe County.  There are numerous opportunities for those that enjoy outdoor activities including a variety of trails, campgrounds, and parks in the area.  Its first [[winery]] opened in 2006 and a second opened in 2007.  A [[dinner theatre]] is located in the county seat, [[Wytheville]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|465|sqmi}}, of which, {{convert|462|sqmi}} of it is land and {{convert|2.8|sqmi}} (0.6%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The county is intersected by the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]].

It was named after [[George Wythe]], the first Virginian signer of the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]]. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the [[Battle of Cove Mountain]] was fought in the county.\n\nPrior to Wythe County's creation, what is now the Wythe County community of Austinville served as the county seat for [[Fincastle County]], an extinct Virginia county whose borders stretched from Roanoke, Virginia, to the Mississippi River \u2013 a county roughly the size of half the State of Texas.<ref>Appalachian Magazine [http://appalachianmagazine.com/2015/01/02/wythe-county-turns-225-years-old-in-2015-is-the-place-to-visit-for-historians/ Wythe County Turns 225 Years Old in 2015].</ref>\n\nWythe County's Austinville community was founded by Stephen and his brother [[Moses Austin]], father of the famous [[Stephen F. Austin]].  In the 1790s the Austins took over the mines that produced lead and zinc; the town was named for the Austin surname, and not for any one particular Austin of the brothers who bore that surname.  Lead was mined and shipped throughout the fledgling country; [[lead shot]] was also produced. Located near Fosters Falls, [[Jackson Ferry Shot Tower]] still stands as a testament to the citizens of Wythe County.  Lead was hoisted to the top of the tower using block and tackle and oxen.  The lead was melted in a retort and then poured through a sieve at the top of the tower. The droplets of molten lead would become round during the 150-foot descent.  The shot would collect in a kettle of water and slave laborers<ref>Slavery in the American Mountain South, Wilma A. Dunaway; Cambridge University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-521-01215-7}}</ref> would enter through a 110-foot access tunnel located near the bank of the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] to retrieve the shot from the kettle.\n\nThe lead mines closed in 1982 due to new [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] standards and the lack of a market for lead. The mines have since filled with water; the main shaft extended in excess of 1100 feet straight down.\n\nAnother notable area within the county is the unincorporated community of [[Fort Chiswell, Virginia|Fort Chiswell]] - named for a [[French and Indian War]] era fort. The fort and its surrounding buildings served as the county seat until the incorporated town of Wytheville was established approximately 10 miles to the west. The fort fell into disrepair and its ruins were covered over when the intersection of [[Interstate 77|I-77]] and [[Interstate 81|I-81]] was constructed in the 1970s. A pyramid marker now stands in the approximate location of the former fort. The community was named for Colonel [[John Chiswell]] who helped establish the lead mines (1757) prior to the Austin's purchase.\n\nWythe County's location, at the confluence of I-81 and I-77 which is, incidentally, a [[wrong-way concurrency]], has led to its growth for industry and tourism.  Recently [[Gatorade]] and [[Pepsi]] manufacturing facilities have located here, primarily due to the ease of access and central location along the Eastern seabord. There are a variety of travel-related businesses including several hundred hotel rooms, several [[truck stops]], and restaurants located in the county.\nTourism takes a variety of different forms in Wythe County.  There are numerous opportunities for those that enjoy outdoor activities including a variety of trails, campgrounds, and parks in the area.  Its first [[winery]] opened in 2006 and a second opened in 2007.  A [[dinner theatre]] is located in the county seat, [[Wytheville]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|465|sqmi}}, of which, {{convert|462|sqmi}} of it is land and {{convert|2.8|sqmi}} (0.6%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The county is intersected by the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]].

At various points some or all of these eleven unsolved murders of women have been ascribed to the notorious unidentified [[serial killer]] known as [[Jack the Ripper]].\n\nMost, if not all, of the victims\u2014[[Emma Elizabeth Smith]], [[Martha Tabram]], [[Mary Ann Nichols|Mary Ann \"Polly\" Nichols]], [[Annie Chapman]], [[Elizabeth Stride]], [[Catherine Eddowes]], [[Mary Jane Kelly]], Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, Frances Coles, and an unidentified woman\u2014were prostitutes. Smith was [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] and robbed by a gang. Tabram was stabbed 39 times. Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes, Kelly, McKenzie and Coles had their throats cut. Eddowes and Stride were murdered on the same night, within approximately an hour and less than a mile apart; their murders are known as the \"double event\", after a phrase in a [[Saucy Jacky postcard|postcard sent to the press]] by an individual claiming to be the Ripper. The bodies of Nichols, Chapman, Eddowes and Kelly had abdominal [[mutilation|mutilations]]. Mylett was [[strangulation|strangled]]. The body of the unidentified woman was [[Dismemberment|dismembered]], but the exact cause of her death is unclear.\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], [[City of London Police]], and private organisations such as the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] were actively involved in the search for the killer or killers. Despite extensive inquiries and several arrests, the culprit or culprits evaded identification and capture. The murders drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End slums, which were subsequently improved. The enduring mystery of who committed the crimes has captured public imagination to the present day.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Dorset-street-1902.jpg|230px|thumb|right|[[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]], [[Spitalfields]], seen here in 1902]]\nIn the late [[Victorian era]], Whitechapel was considered to be the most notorious criminal [[Rookery (slum)|rookery]] in London. The area around [[Flower and Dean Street]] was described as \"perhaps the foulest and most dangerous street in the whole metropolis\";<ref>Greenwood, James (1883), ''In Strange Company'', London, p. 158, quoted in Begg, pp. 21, 45</ref> [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]] was called \"the worst street in London\".<ref>''Daily Mail'', 16 July 1901, quoted in Werner (ed.), pp. 62, 179</ref> Assistant Police Commissioner [[Robert Anderson (police official)|Robert Anderson]] recommended Whitechapel to \"those who take an interest in the dangerous classes\" as one of London's prime criminal \"show places\".<ref>''Pall Mall Gazette'', 4 November 1889, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 225 and Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 516</ref> Robbery and violence were commonplace. The district was characterised by extreme poverty, sub-standard housing, homelessness, drunkenness and endemic prostitution. These factors were focused in the institution of the [[common lodging-house]], which provided cheap communal lodgings for the desperate and the destitute, among whom the Whitechapel murder victims were numbered.<ref>Werner (ed.), pp. 42\u201344, 118\u2013122, 141\u2013170</ref> All the identified victims lived in the heart of the rookery in [[Spitalfields]], including three in George Street (later named Lolesworth Street), two in Dorset Street, two in Flower and Dean Street and one in Thrawl Street.<ref>White, Jerry (2007), ''London in the Nineteenth Century'', London: Jonathan Cape, {{ISBN|978-0-224-06272-5}}, pp. 323\u2013332</ref>\n\nPolice work and criminal prosecutions at the time relied heavily on confessions, witness testimony, and apprehending perpetrators in the act of committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. [[Forensic science|Forensic techniques]], such as [[fingerprint]] analysis, were not in use.<ref>Marriott, p. 207</ref> Policing in London was\u2014and still is\u2014divided between two forces: the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] with jurisdiction over most of the urban area, and the [[City of London Police]] with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the city centre. The [[Home Secretary]], a senior minister of the United Kingdom government, controlled the Metropolitan Police, whereas the City Police were responsible to the [[Corporation of London]]. Beat constables walked regular, timed routes.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 14</ref>\n\nEleven deaths in or near Whitechapel between 1888 and 1891 were gathered into a single file, referred to in the police docket as the Whitechapel murders.<ref name=met>[http://www.met.police.uk/history/ripper.htm \"The Enduring Mystery of Jack the Ripper\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204014147/http://www.met.police.uk/history/ripper.htm |date=4 February 2010 }}, Metropolitan Police, retrieved 1 May 2009</ref><ref>Cook, pp. 33\u201334; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 3</ref> Much of the original material has been either stolen or destroyed.<ref name=met/>\n\n==Victims and investigation==\n[[File:Spitalfields rookery.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Map of about a dozen interconnecting London streets|Map of the Spitalfields rookery, where the victims lived. [[Emma Elizabeth Smith]] was attacked near the junction of Osborn Street and Brick Lane (red circle). She lived in a common lodging-house at 18 George Street (later named Lolesworth Street), one block west of where she was attacked.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 47; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 4; Fido, p. 15; Rumbelow, p. 30</ref>]]\n===Emma Elizabeth Smith===\nOn Tuesday 3 April 1888, following the Easter Monday bank holiday, 45-year-old prostitute [[Emma Elizabeth Smith]] was assaulted and robbed at the junction of [[Osborn Street]] and [[Brick Lane]], Whitechapel, in the early hours of the morning. Although injured, she survived the attack and managed to walk back to her lodging house at 18 George Street, Spitalfields. She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of them a youth. Mrs Russell took Smith to the [[London Hospital]], where medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her [[peritoneum]].

Her body was discovered by cart driver Charles Cross at 3:45&nbsp;am on the ground in front of a gated stable entrance. Her throat had been slit twice from left to right and her abdomen was mutilated by a deep jagged wound. Several shallower incisions across the abdomen, and three or four similar cuts on the right side were caused by the same knife used violently and downwards.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 60\u201361; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 35; Rumbelow, pp. 24\u201327</ref> As the murder occurred in the territory of the J or [[Bethnal Green]] Division of the Metropolitan Police, it was at first investigated by the local detectives. On the same day, [[James Monro]] resigned as the head of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID) over differences with [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police]] Sir [[Charles Warren]].<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 64</ref> Initial investigations into the murder had little success, although elements of the press linked it to the two previous murders and suggested the killing might have been perpetrated by a gang, as in the case of Smith.<ref>Begg, p. 98; Cook, pp. 25\u201328; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 62\u201363</ref> ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' newspaper suggested instead that a single killer was responsible and other newspapers took up their storyline.<ref>Cook, pp. 25\u201328; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 21\u201322</ref> Suspicions of a serial killer at large in London led to the secondment of Detective Inspectors [[Frederick Abberline]], [[Henry Moore (police officer)|Henry Moore]] and [[Walter Simon Andrews|Walter Andrews]] from the Central Office at [[Scotland Yard]].<ref>Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 676, 678</ref> On the available evidence, [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Coroner Baxter]] concluded that Nichols was murdered at just after 3&nbsp;am where she was found. In his summing up, he dismissed the possibility that her murder was connected with those of Smith and Tabram, as the lethal weapons were different in those cases, and neither of the earlier cases involved a slash to the throat.<ref>Marriott, pp. 21\u201322</ref> However, by the time the inquest into Nichols' death had concluded, a fourth woman had been murdered, and Baxter noted \"The similarity of the injuries in the two cases is considerable.\"<ref>Marriott, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\n===Annie Chapman===\n[[File:Annie Chapman2.jpg|thumb|left|100px|alt=Mortuary photograph of Chapman: a middle-aged woman with short, curly hair|[[Annie Chapman]], 47, lived in a lodging-house at 35 Dorset Street.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 66\u201373; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 33\u201334</ref>]]\nThe mutilated body of the fourth woman, [[Annie Chapman]], was discovered at about 6:00&nbsp;am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway in the back yard of 29 [[Hanbury Street]], Spitalfields.

She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, [[George Bagster Phillips]], was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6\u20138&nbsp;inches (15\u201320&nbsp;cm) long.<ref>Cook, p. 221; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 71\u201372; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 67\u201368, 87; Marriott, pp. 26\u201329; Rumbelow, p. 42</ref> However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts.<ref>Fido, p. 35; Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref> As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.<ref>Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref>\n\nOn 10 September, the police arrested a notorious local called [[John Pizer]], dubbed \"Leather Apron\", who had a reputation for terrorising local prostitutes.

Baxter inferred that the man Mrs Long had seen was the murderer. Mrs Long described him as over forty, a little taller than Chapman, of dark complexion, and of foreign, \"shabby-genteel\" appearance.<ref name=begg153/> He was wearing a brown deer-stalker hat and a dark overcoat.<ref name=begg153>Begg, p. 153; Cook, p. 163; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 98; Marriott, pp. 59\u201375</ref> Another witness, carpenter Albert Cadosch, had entered the neighbouring yard at 27 Hanbury Street at about the same time, and heard voices in the yard followed by the sound of something falling against the fence.<ref>Begg, p. 153; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 100; Marriott, pp. 59\u201375</ref>\n[[File:George Lusk, President of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Lusk has a moustache and wears a bowler hat, topcoat, and leather gloves.

At various points some or all of these eleven unsolved murders of women have been ascribed to the notorious unidentified [[serial killer]] known as [[Jack the Ripper]].\n\nMost, if not all, of the victims\u2014[[Emma Elizabeth Smith]], [[Martha Tabram]], [[Mary Ann Nichols|Mary Ann \"Polly\" Nichols]], [[Annie Chapman]], [[Elizabeth Stride]], [[Catherine Eddowes]], [[Mary Jane Kelly]], Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, Frances Coles, and an unidentified woman\u2014were prostitutes. Smith was [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] and robbed by a gang. Tabram was stabbed 39 times. Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes, Kelly, McKenzie and Coles had their throats cut. Eddowes and Stride were murdered on the same night, within approximately an hour and less than a mile apart; their murders are known as  the \"double event\", after a phrase in a [[Saucy Jacky postcard|postcard sent to the press]] by an individual claiming to be the Ripper. The bodies of Nichols, Chapman, Eddowes and Kelly had abdominal [[mutilation|mutilations]]. Mylett was [[strangulation|strangled]]. The body of the unidentified woman was [[Dismemberment|dismembered]], but the exact cause of her death is unclear.\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], [[City of London Police]], and private organisations such as the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] were actively involved in the search for the killer or killers. Despite extensive inquiries and several arrests, the culprit or culprits evaded identification and capture. The murders drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End slums, which were subsequently improved. The enduring mystery of who committed the crimes has captured public imagination to the present day.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Dorset-street-1902.jpg|230px|thumb|right|[[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]], [[Spitalfields]], seen here in 1902]]\nIn the late [[Victorian era]], Whitechapel was considered to be the most notorious criminal [[Rookery (slum)|rookery]] in London.

The district was characterised by extreme poverty, sub-standard housing, homelessness, drunkenness and endemic prostitution. These factors were focused in the institution of the [[common lodging-house]], which provided cheap communal lodgings for the desperate and the destitute, among whom the Whitechapel murder victims were numbered.<ref>Werner (ed.), pp. 42\u201344, 118\u2013122, 141\u2013170</ref> All the identified victims lived in the heart of the rookery in [[Spitalfields]], including three in George Street (later named Lolesworth Street), two in Dorset Street, two in Flower and Dean Street and one in Thrawl Street.<ref>White, Jerry (2007), ''London in the Nineteenth Century'', London: Jonathan Cape, {{ISBN|978-0-224-06272-5}}, pp. 323\u2013332</ref>\n\nPolice work and criminal prosecutions at the time relied heavily on confessions, witness testimony, and apprehending perpetrators in the act of committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. [[Forensic science|Forensic techniques]], such as [[fingerprint]] analysis, were not in use.<ref>Marriott, p. 207</ref> Policing in London was\u2014and still is\u2014divided between two forces: the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] with jurisdiction over most of the urban area, and the [[City of London Police]] with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the city centre.

Her body was discovered by cart driver Charles Cross at 3:45&nbsp;am on the ground in front of a gated stable entrance. Her throat had been slit twice from left to right and her abdomen was mutilated by a deep jagged wound. Several shallower incisions across the abdomen, and three or four similar cuts on the right side were caused by the same knife used violently and downwards.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 60\u201361; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 35; Rumbelow, pp. 24\u201327</ref> As the murder occurred in the territory of the J or [[Bethnal Green]] Division of the Metropolitan Police, it was at first investigated by the local detectives. On the same day, [[James Monro]] resigned as the head of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID) over differences with [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police]] Sir [[Charles Warren]].<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 64</ref> Initial investigations into the murder had little success, although elements of the press linked it to the two previous murders and suggested the killing might have been perpetrated by a gang, as in the case of Smith.<ref>Begg, p. 98; Cook, pp. 25\u201328; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 62\u201363</ref> ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' newspaper suggested instead that a single killer was responsible and other newspapers took up their storyline.<ref>Cook, pp. 25\u201328; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 21\u201322</ref> Suspicions of a serial killer at large in London led to the secondment of Detective Inspectors [[Frederick Abberline]], [[Henry Moore (police officer)|Henry Moore]] and [[Walter Simon Andrews|Walter Andrews]] from the Central Office at [[Scotland Yard]].<ref>Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 676, 678</ref> On the available evidence, [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Coroner Baxter]] concluded that Nichols was murdered at just after 3&nbsp;am where she was found. In his summing up, he dismissed the possibility that her murder was connected with those of Smith and Tabram, as the lethal weapons were different in those cases, and neither of the earlier cases involved a slash to the throat.<ref>Marriott, pp. 21\u201322</ref> However, by the time the inquest into Nichols' death had concluded, a fourth woman had been murdered, and Baxter noted \"The similarity of the injuries in the two cases is considerable.\"<ref>Marriott, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\n===Annie Chapman===\n[[File:Annie Chapman2.jpg|thumb|left|100px|alt=Mortuary photograph of Chapman: a middle-aged woman with short, curly hair|[[Annie Chapman]], 47, lived in a lodging-house at 35 Dorset Street.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 66\u201373; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 33\u201334</ref>]]\nThe mutilated body of the fourth woman, [[Annie Chapman]], was discovered at about 6:00&nbsp;am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway in the back yard of 29 [[Hanbury Street]], Spitalfields.

She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, [[George Bagster Phillips]], was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6\u20138&nbsp;inches (15\u201320&nbsp;cm) long.<ref>Cook, p. 221; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 71\u201372; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 67\u201368, 87; Marriott, pp. 26\u201329; Rumbelow, p. 42</ref> However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts.<ref>Fido, p. 35; Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref> As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.<ref>Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref>\n\nOn 10 September, the police arrested a notorious local called [[John Pizer]], dubbed \"Leather Apron\", who had a reputation for terrorising local prostitutes.

Baxter inferred that the man Mrs Long had seen was the murderer. Mrs Long described him as over forty, a little taller than Chapman, of dark complexion, and of foreign, \"shabby-genteel\" appearance.<ref name=begg153/> He was wearing a brown deer-stalker hat and a dark overcoat.<ref name=begg153>Begg, p. 153; Cook, p. 163; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 98; Marriott, pp. 59\u201375</ref> Another witness, carpenter Albert Cadosch, had entered the neighbouring yard at 27 Hanbury Street at about the same time, and heard voices in the yard followed by the sound of something falling against the fence.<ref>Begg, p. 153; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 100; Marriott, pp. 59\u201375</ref>\n[[File:George Lusk, President of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Lusk has a moustache and wears a bowler hat, topcoat, and leather gloves.

Like most of the previous murders, her left carotid artery was severed from left to right and there were wounds on her abdomen. However, her wounds were not as deep as in previous murders, and a shorter blade was used. Commissioner Monro<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 207\u2013208; Evans and Skinner (2001), p. 137</ref> and one of the pathologists examining the body, Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though another of the pathologists, Phillips, and Robert Anderson disagreed,<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 208\u2013209; Marriott, pp. 182\u2013183</ref> as did Inspector Abberline.<ref>Interview in ''Cassell's Saturday Journal'', 28 May 1892, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 225</ref> Later writers are also divided, and either suggest that McKenzie was a Ripper victim,<ref>Marriott, p. 195</ref> or that the unknown murderer tried to make it look like a Ripper killing to deflect suspicion from himself.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 209</ref> At the inquest, Coroner Baxter acknowledged both possibilities, and concluded: \"There is great similarity between this and the other class of cases, which have happened in this neighbourhood, and if the same person has not committed this crime, it is clearly an imitation of the other cases.\"<ref>Coroner Baxter's summing up, 14 August 1888, quoted in Marriott, p. 193</ref>\n\n===Pinchin Street torso===\nA woman's torso was found at 5:15&nbsp;a.m. on Tuesday 10 September 1889 under a railway arch in Pinchin Street, Whitechapel. No other body parts were found, despite a search of the area, and neither the victim nor the culprit were ever identified. [[Donald Swanson|Chief Inspector Swanson]] and [[James Monro|Commissioner Monro]] noted that the presence of blood within the torso indicated that death was not from haemorrhage or cutting of the throat.<ref>Report to the Home Office by Swanson, 10 September 1889, MEPO 3/140 ff. 136\u201340, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 480\u2013482; Report to the Home Office by Monro, 11 September 1889, HO 144/221/A49301K ff. 1\u20138, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 492\u2013494</ref> The pathologists, however, noted that the general bloodlessness of the tissues and vessels indicated that haemorrhage was the cause of death.<ref>Report of Dr Charles A.

It tells the story of a salesman and a beautiful woman who fall in love with each other and develop a relationship.\n\n==Plot==\nTed Riker ([[Michael Keaton]]) is the top salesman in the [[New York City|New York]] office of business machine company Bineview. The corporate stock lives by quarterly sales numbers, the competition is very intense, and the economy may be headed into a downturn. Ted's company is marking time until a revolutionary new product is ready, probably within a few months. Some competitors may know something about this secret innovation, through industrial [[espionage]], and fear its impact on the market.\n\nA new company hire, callow [[Midwestern]]er Jamie Bashant ([[Brendan Fraser]]), has moved east with his lovely fianc\u00e9e Belisa ([[Amber Valletta]]). Jamie and Belisa are a young couple just starting out, and Jamie has to learn the business as a trainee. Ted is very successful, but also cynical, hard-driving, profane, obnoxious, abusive, and a lousy team player. He has few if any friends in the company, but his shortcomings are tolerated because his output is so outstanding. Ted, assigned to train Jamie, watches Jamie struggle, failing with presentation after presentation; Ted tries, in vain, to help Jamie improve his performance and make a few sales, even giving one of his own sure deals to Jamie, who messes it up. Bashant and Riker head to the sales conference and Riker runs into Leguzza. Then, Ted is introduced to Belisa through normal company friendship, and discovers that he is now in love with her. Belisa is impressed by Ted's success and confident manner and also falls in love with him. They then have sex, and do their best to keep this secret from Jamie, who is worried about being fired because of his weak output. Ted and Belisa then go to Ted's place and sleep with each other, before going to [[Atlantic City]], and having sex in a hotel room. Ted confesses to Belisa that he has a failed love in his past, which affected him very deeply, leading to a career switch from college literature [[professor]] at [[Northwestern University]] near [[Chicago]] (a job he loved) to hard-driving star salesman in New York. Belisa does her best to comfort him. Later that night in bed after sex, the two discover a shared interest in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', which Belisa studied at college and Ted taught every semester.\n\nTed spends increasingly more time with Belisa and away from the office. Ted is falling hard for Belisa, who postpones her wedding to Jamie; the couple had planned a honeymoon to [[Jamaica]] and decides to marry Ted. But Ted's sales performance is dropping dramatically, and since his contribution to the company's profit is so important, the rest of the sales force feels even more pressure. Branch manager John Whitman ([[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]) has prospered with Ted's performance, but starts losing confidence in Ted, and is mystified at Ted's lack of dedication, such a contrast from his previous strong effort. Belisa seems ready to end her engagement to Jamie in favor of Ted, as the two travel to [[Atlantic City]] for a getaway from the stress, and use Jamie's week-long absence at a training conference to deepen their relationship. However, the company is in trouble from plummeting sales, not just in New York but at its other locations as well, and downsizing and firings are imminent. Just as Ted's new relationship with Belisa is prospering, his career is sinking. He no longer cares about his career; he avoids the office, doesn't answer his phone or return messages, fails to close several critical deals, and this drives the company closer to ruin. However, his relationship with Belisa, who now promises to leave Jamie and marry Ted, is creating real change in his life, healing his bitterness. Jamie, showing no improvement whatsoever in his job performance is fired just as Belisa breaks their engagement and asks him to move out. He becomes suspicious that Belisa is cheating on him and nears a [[nervous breakdown]]. Belisa becomes very concerned and meets with Ted to break off their affair so she can take care of Jamie, informing him they are returning to [[Ohio]] together tomorrow. Ted is devastated at Belisa's change of heart, but finally returns to the office the next day to find manager Whitman desperate for him to make some sales as his own career is on the line. Belisa surprises Ted in the parking lot, telling him Jamie went back to Ohio, but she has decided to stay in New York to marry him.\n\nTed goes to the office to find the company has been taken over by a competing firm that was able to buy the company cheap because poor sales at all the offices lowered the stock price drastically. The office is being closed with dozens of staff personnel being fired, including Manager Whitman. Despite the news, Ted is happy and leaves to go see Belisa at her home. When he gets there she is gone and her house is now empty except for a few boxes stacked in the living room. In the boxes Ted finds evidence that Jamie and Belisa were actually working together to destroy his sales performance. Jamie and Belisa are seen at a party with the president of the competing firm which has just purchased Bineview. It is revealed that the bumbling Jamie is actually a ruthless leader of a team of [[double agent]]s sent by this competing firm to infiltrate Bineview. The top salesperson at each office has been targeted by one of the double agents, each having their sales performance ruined in different ways, as part of a strategy to weaken the company in preparation for this corporate takeover.\n\nLeguzza explains how he desired to purchase a company but wanted to get it at a cheap price. So he put together a group to cull the company the animals in order to weaken their sales so he would be able to purchase the company. As Jamie explains how he and Belisa were able to distract Ted, destroying his sales performance, his gloating clearly disgusts Belisa who realises that Ted is her true boyfriend. She leaves the party to go to Ted who is seen packing up all his belongings. Jamie confronts his true employer, the corporate shark who masterminded the whole stratagem to gain control of a new, innovative, Bineview business machine, and demands his money using knowledge of the employer's embarrassing sexual proclivity as blackmail. When Belisa arrives at Ted's loft he is already gone, so she goes to her home to find him. As Ted is shown on the road to an unknown destination, she discovers a personal message from Ted in a volume of Wilde's novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' which he has left behind for her. With the knowledge that Ted knows the truth and is taking a break from her, Belisa is left broken-hearted.

It tells the story of a salesman and a beautiful woman who fall in love with each other and develop a relationship.\n\n==Plot==\nTed Riker ([[Michael Keaton]]) is the top salesman in the [[New York City|New York]] office of business machine company Bineview. The corporate stock lives by quarterly sales numbers, the competition is very intense, and the economy may be headed into a downturn. Ted's company is marking time until a revolutionary new product is ready, probably within a few months. Some competitors may know something about this secret innovation, through industrial [[espionage]], and fear its impact on the market.\n\nA new company hire, callow [[Midwestern]]er Jamie Bashant ([[Brendan Fraser]]), has moved east with his lovely fianc\u00e9e Belisa ([[Amber Valletta]]). Jamie and Belisa are a young couple just starting out, and Jamie has to learn the business as a trainee. Ted is very successful, but also cynical, hard-driving, profane, obnoxious, abusive, and a lousy team player. He has few if any friends in the company, but his shortcomings are tolerated because his output is so outstanding. Ted, assigned to train Jamie, watches Jamie struggle, failing with presentation after presentation; Ted tries, in vain, to help Jamie improve his performance and make a few sales, even giving one of his own sure deals to Jamie, who messes it up. Bashant and Riker head to the sales conference and Riker runs into Leguzza. Then, Ted is introduced to Belisa through normal company friendship, and discovers that he is now in love with her. Belisa is impressed by Ted's success and confident manner and also falls in love with him. They then have sex, and do their best to keep this secret from Jamie, who is worried about being fired because of his weak output. Ted and Belisa then go to Ted's place and sleep with each other, before going to [[Atlantic City]], and having sex in a hotel room. Ted confesses to Belisa that he has a failed love in his past, which affected him very deeply, leading to a career switch from college literature [[professor]] at [[Northwestern University]] near [[Chicago]] (a job he loved) to hard-driving star salesman in New York. Belisa does her best to comfort him. Later that night in bed after sex, the two discover a shared interest in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', which Belisa studied at college and Ted taught every semester.\n\nTed spends increasingly more time with Belisa and away from the office. Ted is falling hard for Belisa, who postpones her wedding to Jamie; the couple had planned a honeymoon to [[Jamaica]] and decides to marry Ted. But Ted's sales performance is dropping dramatically, and since his contribution to the company's profit is so important, the rest of the sales force feels even more pressure. Branch manager John Whitman ([[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]) has prospered with Ted's performance, but starts losing confidence in Ted, and is mystified at Ted's lack of dedication, such a contrast from his previous strong effort. Belisa seems ready to end her engagement to Jamie in favor of Ted, as the two travel to [[Atlantic City]] for a getaway from the stress, and use Jamie's week-long absence at a training conference to deepen their relationship. However, the company is in trouble from plummeting sales, not just in New York but at its other locations as well, and downsizing and firings are imminent. Just as Ted's new relationship with Belisa is prospering, his career is sinking. He no longer cares about his career; he avoids the office, doesn't answer his phone or return messages, fails to close several critical deals, and this drives the company closer to ruin. However, his relationship with Belisa, who now promises to leave Jamie and get married to Ted, is creating real change in his life, healing his bitterness. Jamie, showing no improvement whatsoever in his job performance is fired just as Belisa breaks their engagement and asks him to move out. He becomes suspicious that Belisa is cheating on him and nears a [[nervous breakdown]]. Belisa becomes very concerned and meets with Ted to break off their affair so she can take care of Jamie, informing him they are returning to [[Ohio]] together tomorrow. Ted is devastated at Belisa's change of heart, but finally returns to the office the next day to find manager Whitman desperate for him to make some sales as his own career is on the line. Belisa surprises Ted in the parking lot, telling him Jamie went back to Ohio, but she has decided to stay in New York to marry him.\n\nTed goes to the office to find the company has been taken over by a competing firm that was able to buy the company cheap because poor sales at all the offices lowered the stock price drastically. The office is being closed with dozens of staff personnel being fired, including Manager Whitman. Despite the news, Ted is happy and leaves to go see Belisa at her home. When he gets there she is gone and her house is now empty except for a few boxes stacked in the living room. In the boxes Ted finds evidence that Jamie and Belisa were actually working together to destroy his sales performance. Jamie and Belisa are seen at a party with the president of the competing firm which has just purchased Bineview. It is revealed that the bumbling Jamie is actually a ruthless leader of a team of [[double agent]]s sent by this competing firm to infiltrate Bineview. The top salesperson at each office has been targeted by one of the double agents, each having their sales performance ruined in different ways, as part of a strategy to weaken the company in preparation for this corporate takeover.\n\nLeguzza explains how he desired to purchase a company but wanted to get it at a cheap price.
