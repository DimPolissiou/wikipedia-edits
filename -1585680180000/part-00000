Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/3779061/juventus-twin-towers-of-ronaldomandzukic-to-provide-a-unique-test-for-atleticos-stingy-defence |title=Juventus' twin towers of Ronaldo, Mandzukic to provide a unique test for Atletico's stingy defence |publisher=ESPN FC |author1=Michael Cox |date=19 February 2019 |accessdate=30 April 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"Ronaldo's free role with Juventus is a headache for Sarri\">{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/italian-serie-a/story/3958370/ronaldos-free-role-with-juventus-is-a-headache-for-sarri-how-can-he-work-around-his-star |title=Ronaldo's free role with Juventus is a headache for Sarri.

Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/3779061/juventus-twin-towers-of-ronaldomandzukic-to-provide-a-unique-test-for-atleticos-stingy-defence |title=Juventus' twin towers of Ronaldo, Mandzukic to provide a unique test for Atletico's stingy defence |publisher=ESPN FC |author1=Michael Cox |date=19 February 2019 |accessdate=30 April 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"Ronaldo's free role with Juventus is a headache for Sarri\">{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/italian-serie-a/story/3958370/ronaldos-free-role-with-juventus-is-a-headache-for-sarri-how-can-he-work-around-his-star |title=Ronaldo's free role with Juventus is a headache for Sarri.

{"title_page": "Vegni", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n[[Image:vegnicoat.jpg|thumb|Vegni coat of arms.|120px]] \nThe '''Vegni''' are an Italian family from [[Siena]]. The medioeval origins of the family have limited documentation.\nThe origin of the family is in Siena, with Bencivenne, father of Aringhieri, whose children Guido,Iacobina and Ranieri are mentioned in a contract of a house sale in 1201.<ref>R.Archivio di Stato in Siena: Inventario delle pergamene conservate nel diplomatico dall'anno 736 all'anno 1250, t. 1 Lisini, Alessandro - Siena (1908) Page 201</ref> The son of Guido, Bencivenni, is the first one to have a recognised profession mentioned in the documents. A [[notary]] of the royal chamber, called Bencivennis olim Guidi,<ref>Bencivenni notaro della camera reale: Archivio di Stato di Siena(ASS) DOM 1222 febbraio 19, casella 39 Ms. B 39, n. 147 and 148</ref> was active in Siena in the first part of the 13th century. The [[patronymic]] Bencivennis (the Latin genitive) is used, abbreviated as bcVennis in the documents signed by Luca, a notary, in documents he drew up during late 13th.<ref>Luca BCvennis: ASS Diplomatico, Archivio Generale  1290</ref> Pietro olim (of) Luca bcVennis was active in Siena until 1321. The sons of Pietro settled in the area of [[Chianciano]], focusing the centre of interests of the family in the South of the [[Siena]] Republic until the fall of it in 1555. The surname Bencivennis remains in official documents during all the Republican period, to disappear at the end of the 16th century, substituted by Vegni. The last one to use it in official documents is Eustachio Bencivennis or bcVegnis, again a notary, who died in 1585. His grandson Giovanni Battista di Pietro, a notary in [[Chianciano]] between 1600 and 1641, signs his documents as Vegni, although he still uses the same private legal seal with the family coat of arms.\n\nBesides the local government positions held by family members, the only member worth of notice in these early period is Andrea, [[bishop of Chiusi]] in the mid-16th century.\nBiagio,  [http://www.tesselle.it/siena/chianciano/chianciano_arte_dw1.htm Giovanni Andrea] and Giovanni Battista and Ventura consolidated the family presence in Chianciano during the 17th. \nAt the turn of the 18th century three main branches of the family are known, second cousins, one in Chianciano, headed by Francesco, of Deo' (Adeodato of Ventura), a lawyer and then local judge. Pietro, a landowner in Montisi, son of Giovanni Andrea, with his three sons, Giacomo, Giuseppe and Luca, and a daughter, Laura. Luca became a priest, with Giuseppe and Giacomo dividing, but only in 1745, the properties of the father Pietro, who died in 1728. At that time, the third branch of the family, that of Montegiovi, near [[Pienza]] and Castel del Piano, was headed by Carlo Giuseppe of Ventura.\n \nDuring the first half of the 18th century the family still maintains its centre of interests in the region South of [[Siena]], which remains the city of reference for education, with its university, and local political power.\nA member of international relevance is [https://www.google.com/books?id=mv8EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA177&dq=vegni+leonardo+caterina&as_brr=1&hl=en Leonardo ], born from Francesco Vegni and Caterina Apolloni in 1731. \n[[Image:Devegni.gif|thumb|Leonardo Vegni.]][http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/genscheda.asp?appl=LST&xsl=biografia&lingua=ENG&chiave=300172 Leonardo], who was pleased to add a \"de\" to the surname Vegni in order to stress his ancient nobility, graduated with a degree in civil and canon law from the [[University of Siena]] in 1750, but he was also very much interested in design, architecture, poetry (he was a member of the Roman academy [[Arcadia]]) and science. He invented a new technique for the creation of bas-reliefs: Tartar modelling [La plastica dei tartari], which exploited the cementing properties of the calcareous waters of the Baths of San Filippo. Leonardo opened a factory for the production of bas-reliefs, which the Grand Duke [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Peter Leopold]] visited in 1769. He was much esteemed by his contemporaries, not least for his creation of the theatre of [[Montalcino]], the gate at Sole di Chianciano, the Albergotti palace in Arezzo. He also published a series of critical works on architecture. He died in 1801, in Rome. His adopted child, Luigi, continued his works with less success during the first half of the 19th century, and he had no children. The entire collection of engravings and Leonardo's library went lost. Leonardo de Vegni prints of Italian arts and landscapes are a rarity for today's antique lovers, and his legacy in architecture is only recently being rediscovered by experts.\n \nA first noticeable physician of the family was Ignazio Vegni, son of Giacomo, who studied medicine in Siena, and after a few years at the university was called as court physician to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand Ducal Court]] in Florence in the second half of the 18th century.  \n \nReligion is once again at centre stage with the family branch of Montegiovi, near Pienza: Antonio, born in 1686, after a long period in Rome, was bishop of Sovana and Pitigliano from 1739 to 1746. His nephew, Andrea Domenico, also born in Montegiovi in 1711, was Bishop of Montalcino from 1767 to his death, in November 1773.  \n \nAnother member of the family dedicated his life to the people, but in a slightly different way. Andrea was born in [[Montisi]] in 1751 from Giuseppe of Pietro. After qualifying in civil and canon law from the [[University of Siena]], he started his career as a judge, in 1772, in Siena. He lived exceptional times for his profession, with the [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Peter Leopold]] penal code reform, which, among other important advances, abolished the death penalty in Tuscany, first country in the world, well before the others. In 1777 he is at the Court of Justice in [[Radicofani]], then from 1783 he works in Asinalunga, as head of cabinet of the Imperial Royal Vicar (head of the governmental authority in the area \u2013 a sort of a Prefect) Siminetti, later the Ministry of Justice in [[Florence]]. In 1792, under the rule of the new Grand-Duke, Ferdinand III, Andrea was finally Royal Vicar in Pienza, responsible for the peaceful living of citizens in the area from Val di Chiana to the hills towards the [[Amiata]], in the South Tuscany. His frequent travels obliged him to move the family (he married with Josepha Filugelli) to [[Asciano]], midway between [[Siena]] and [[Pienza]], where his brothers and cousins lived. His brother, Girolamo, was Canonico( prior) of the Collegiata of [[Asciano]]. Andrea's son, Giuseppe Antonio Maria, born in 1785, was educated by his uncle in Asciano, and then sent to Siena to study medicine.[[Image:gvegni1855.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Giuseppe Antonio Maria Vegni in 1855.]] \n  \nSiena, in the first years of the 19th century, was under the rule of [[Napoleon]], and the region was called Ombrone.\nGiuseppe graduated in 1813, at the time of his marriage with Maria Carolina Neri (1792\u20131836). She was a beautiful, well-educated and wealthy woman, living close to the old hospital ([http://www.santamariadellascala.com/sms/splash.html Ospedale Santa Maria della Scala]) where he was intern. Giuseppe, after a brief period of activity as a physician, dedicated his life to the family and to Siena's cultural and social life (he was a member of the Accademia dei Rozzi). He had three children, Adelaide (1816\u20131883), Girolamo (1826\u20131857) and Giovanni (1830\u20131907).\n\nThey moved to the building which was part of her dowry, in via Franciosa, just at the end of the splendid square of the baptistry, Piazza S. Giovanni. On the opposite side of the square lived Andrea's second cousin Niccola(1783\u20131864), a lawyer son of Eustachio of Giacomo, who lived at the corner with via dei Pellegrini, in the Palazzo del Magnifico. \nWith the acquisition of these two houses in Siena, the family's centre of interests had finally moved to Siena, with both the surviving branches of the family maintaining only land ownership links to the val di Chiana and Asciano. The two branches were identified by slightly different coats of arms.<ref>The family was part of the nobility of Chianciano and of the Siena republic before the fall, in 1555, of the Republic, and as per the law of 1750 of the Grand-Duchy of Tuscany it belonged to the Patriziato, of ancient nobility, confirmed by a decree of Leopold II in 1838.

The sons of Pietro settled in the area of [[Chianciano]], focusing the centre of interests of the family in the South of the [[Siena]] Republic until the fall of it in 1555. The surname Bencivennis remains in official documents during all the Republican period, to disappear at the end of the 16th century, substituted by Vegni. The last one to use it in official documents is Eustachio Bencivennis or bcVegnis, again a notary, who died in 1585. His grandson Giovanni Battista di Pietro, a notary in [[Chianciano]] between 1600 and 1641, signs his documents as Vegni, although he still uses the same private legal seal with the family coat of arms.\n\nBesides the local government positions held by family members, the only member worth of notice in these early period is Andrea, [[bishop of Chiusi]] in the mid-16th century.\nBiagio,  [http://www.tesselle.it/siena/chianciano/chianciano_arte_dw1.htm Giovanni Andrea] and Giovanni Battista and Ventura consolidated the family presence in Chianciano during the 17th. \nAt the turn of the 18th century three main branches of the family are known, second cousins, one in Chianciano, headed by Francesco, of Deo' (Adeodato of Ventura), a lawyer and then local judge.

At that time, the third branch of the family, that of Montegiovi, near [[Pienza]] and Castel del Piano, was headed by Carlo Giuseppe of Ventura.\n \nDuring the first half of the 18th century the family still maintains its centre of interests in the region South of [[Siena]], which remains the city of reference for education, with its university, and local political power.\nA member of international relevance is [https://www.google.com/books?id=mv8EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA177&dq=vegni+leonardo+caterina&as_brr=1&hl=en Leonardo ], born from Francesco Vegni and Caterina Apolloni in 1731. \n[[Image:Devegni.gif|thumb|Leonardo Vegni.]][http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/genscheda.asp?appl=LST&xsl=biografia&lingua=ENG&chiave=300172 Leonardo], who was pleased to add a \"de\" to the surname Vegni in order to stress his ancient nobility, graduated with a degree in civil and canon law from the [[University of Siena]] in 1750, but he was also very much interested in design, architecture, poetry (he was a member of the Roman academy [[Arcadia]]) and science. He invented a new technique for the creation of bas-reliefs: Tartar modelling [La plastica dei tartari], which exploited the cementing properties of the calcareous waters of the Baths of San Filippo. Leonardo opened a factory for the production of bas-reliefs, which the Grand Duke [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Peter Leopold]] visited in 1769. He was much esteemed by his contemporaries, not least for his creation of the theatre of [[Montalcino]], the gate at Sole di Chianciano, the Albergotti palace in Arezzo. He also published a series of critical works on architecture. He died in 1801, in Rome. His adopted child, Luigi, continued his works with less success during the first half of the 19th century, and he had no children.

She helped out at the Mount Evelyn Football Club with activities like boundary umpiring and running water, but didn't play since her parents didn't allow her. A family friend convinced her parents to play the last two games of the season with the under-10 boys and they were the only games they won that season. Due to lack of girl's youth teams in football, Tesoriero started playing basketball and netball. She represented the Mount Evelyn Netball Club and later played for the North East Blaze in the Victorian Netball League.<ref name=\"tale\">{{cite web|url=http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2017-03-01/the-tale-of-tesoriero-2017|title=The tale of Tesoriero|first=Tiarne|last=Swersky|work={{AFL Col}}|publisher=[[Telstra Media]]|date=1 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, at the age of 18, Tesoriero started playing senior football at Yarra Valley Cougars.

It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and [[Sepp Blatter]] had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.<ref name=\"sRBCC\" /> The 2014 [[Garcia Report]], an internal investigation led by [[Michael J. Garcia]], was withheld from public release by [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]], FIFA's head of adjudication on ethical matters. Eckert released a shorter revised summary instead, and his (and therefore FIFA's) reluctance to publish the full report caused Garcia to resign in protest.<ref name=\"3BhYq\" /> Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame.

the [[International Football Association Board]]'s decision to incorporate [[video assistant referee]]s (VARs) into the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the game]] (LOTG) on 16&nbsp;March 2018, the [[FIFA Council]] took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.<ref name=\"fifa_20180316\" /><ref name=\"jkNow\" />\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15&nbsp;June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16&nbsp;June and resulted in a goal by [[Antoine Griezmann]].<ref name=\"iQyFC\" /> A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.<ref name=\"zeD2b\" /> Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.<ref name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Each city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />{{dead link|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29&nbsp;September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion was spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8&nbsp;October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium\u2014the two largest stadiums in Russia\u2014were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\n===Stadiums===\n[[File:Bel-Tun (26).jpg|thumb|{{Center|Exterior of Otkrytie Arena}}{{Center| in Moscow}}]]\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the 12 stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.<ref name=\"bVCgh\" />\n* Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new). The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015. On 11&nbsp;April 2018 it hosted its first match.\n* Kazan: Kazan Arena (new). The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer [[Universiade]].

In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena. It hosted its first match on 5&nbsp;September 2014.\n* Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new). Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.<ref name=\"L1mHo\" />\n* Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new). The stadium is located on the left bank of the [[Don (river)|Don]]. Construction was completed on 22&nbsp;December 2017.\n* Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).

The project was officially completed on 29&nbsp;December 2016.<ref name=\"aZz5t\" /> It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and will serve as a venue for [[UEFA Euro 2020]].\n* Samara: Samara Arena (new). Construction officially started on 21&nbsp;July 2014 and was completed on 21&nbsp;April 2018.\n* Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new). The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian [[Spartakiad]], but the plan was revised. The opening was rescheduled to 2017. The arena hosted its first match on 21&nbsp;April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished [[Central Stadium (Volgograd)|Central Stadium]] site, at the foot of the [[Mamayev Kurgan]] memorial complex. It was commissioned on 3&nbsp;April 2018.<ref name=\"j2Lhd\" />\n* Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup.

While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

football|football]] tournament contested by [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] and took place between 14&nbsp;June and 15&nbsp;July 2018 in Russia. It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7 June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n===Response to Skripal poisoning===\nIn response to the March 2018 [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]], British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.<ref name=\"AypwF\" /> Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup.<ref name=\"1CS7B\" /> Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\".<ref name=\"aXQLQ\" /> The [[Russian Foreign Ministry]] denounced [[Boris Johnson]]'s statements that compared the event to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] held in [[Nazi Germany]] as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism]]\".<ref name=\"0aw0J\" />\n\nThe British [[Foreign Office]] and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\" travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\".<ref name=\"qKSXy\" /><ref name=\"WNLwc\" /> English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.<ref name=\"sOFhm\" /><ref name=\"XWjIW\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony (2018-06-14) 11.jpg|thumb|Russia received widespread praise as World Cup hosts.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

The film takes place in the future in [[Scotland]], which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in [[London]], political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair ([[Rhona Mitra]]) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. ''Doomsday'' was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including ''[[Mad Max]]'', ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and ''[[28 Days Later]]''.\n\nMarshall had a budget three times the size of his previous two films, ''[[The Descent]]'' and ''[[Dog Soldiers (film)|Dog Soldiers]]'', and the director filmed the larger-scale ''Doomsday'' in Scotland and [[South Africa]]. The film was released in the United States and Canada on 14 March 2008 and in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2008. ''Doomsday'' did not perform well at the box office, and critics gave the film mixed reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2008, an unknown killer virus, known as the \"Reaper Virus\", has infected the country of [[Scotland]]. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, the British government builds a massive 30-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of [[Great Britain]]. Whilst the quarantine was deemed a success, the extreme method employed by the government destroys diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. Now a [[pariah state]], the UK collapses into a [[dystopia]], rife with unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil.\n\n27 years after the start of the quarantine, a group of armed police officers discover several people in London infected with Reaper Virus during a routine investigation. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] John Hatcher shares satellite footage of survivors in Scotland with domestic security chief Captain Nelson. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses his top police officer, Major Eden Sinclair, to lead the team. Sinclair is originally from Scotland, having escaped as the quarantine began at the cost of her right eye. For Sinclair the mission is also personal, as she hopes to learn if her mother survived or not.\n\nSinclair's team crosses the wall to [[Glasgow]], Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals, led by the power-hungry Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army to start their [[invasion]] on England, which will bring Great Britain into the [[Golden Age]]. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the rest of his gang, who burn Dr. Talbot alive before devouring his body. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's second-in-command. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol abolishes [[martial law]] by creating his own army.\n\nMeanwhile, the Reaper Virus turns everyone present in London into primal savages, destroying everything in sight in an ongoing riot. Hatcher plans secretly to isolate the central London area because of the infection when an infected man breaks into Hatcher\u2019s office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the infected man, but his blood splatters on Hatcher. Hatcher is quarantined by his right hand man, Michael Canaris,  who also takes his place as ''de facto'' prime minister. Hatcher later commits suicide, unable to take much more of his successor's scam.\n\nAfter leaving the train, Sinclair's group are arrested by soldiers armed with archaic weapons and armour. They are taken to a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure, only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, the rest of the group escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.\n\nSinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally escape to a fallout shelter entrance on horseback. They locate an underground facility in the forest and find an intact [[Bentley Continental GT|2007 Bentley Continental GT]], which they fuel up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine wall. On the way, they are intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper once and for all. After a high-speed chase, Sol and many of his men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.\n\nUsing a phone retrieved from the fallout shelter, Sinclair calls Canaris, who later arrives in a government gunship. Canaris then tricks Sinclair into trading Cally (whose blood can be used to create a vaccine to treat the virus), revealing his scheme to use the virus all over the UK as both a form of population control and for profit.\n\nCally and Stirling board the gunship with Canaris while Sinclair returns to her old house in search of her mother, followed by Nelson, who flew into the quarantine zone to speak with his top-ranking officer. While Sinclair confirms that her mother has perished due to the virus, she is able to retrieve a picture of her. Sinclair gives Nelson a recording of Canaris's [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] scheme. The recording is later broadcasted to the rest of the country, much to Canaris's shock as it spells doom to his career. Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns to his gang; she throws the head onto the ground, announcing to the marauders, \u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, try a piece of your friend\u201d. The marauders stand in shock for a moment before bursting into cheering, accepting Sinclair as their new leader.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Rhona Mitra (Straighten Colors).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A seated woman with brown hair extending below her shoulders and wearing a blue shirt smiles as she looks to her right.|Actress Rhona Mitra starred in ''Doomsday'' as Major Eden Sinclair.]]\n\n* [[Rhona Mitra]] as Major Eden Sinclair of the Department of Domestic Security, selected to lead a team to find a cure.<ref name=mitra/> The heroine was inspired by the character [[Snake Plissken]].<ref name=hot>{{cite news | first=Justine | last=Elias | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/30/2007-09-30_hot_heroines_in_apocalyptic_flicks-1.html | title=Hot heroines in apocalyptic flicks | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | date=30 September 2007 | accessdate=24 December 2007}}</ref> Mitra worked out and fight trained for eleven weeks for the film.

[[MyAnna Buring]] portrayed Kane's daughter Cally.<ref name=credits>Listed in the film's credits.</ref> [[Emma Cleasby]] played Eden's mother at the start of the film.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\nDirector [[Neil Marshall]] lived near the ruins of [[Hadrian's Wall]], a Roman fortification built to defend England against Scotland's tribes. The director fantasised about what conditions would cause the Wall to be rebuilt and imagined a lethal virus would work. Marshall had also visualised a mixture of medieval and futuristic elements: \"I had this vision of these futuristic soldiers with high-tech weaponry and body armour and helmets\u2014clearly from the future\u2014facing a medieval knight on horseback.\" The director favoured the English/Scottish border as the location for a rebuilt wall, finding the location more plausible than a lengthy boundary between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Scotland is the home to multiple castles, which fit Marshall's medieval aspect.<ref name=cfq>{{cite news| first=Steve| last=Biodrowski| url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/03/07/interview-neil-marshall-directs-doomsday| title=Interview: Neil Marshall Directs \"Doomsday\"| publisher=Cinefantastique.com|accessdate=15 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe lethal virus in ''Doomsday'' differs from contemporary films like ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' by being an authentic plague that actually devastates the population, instead of infecting people so they become aggressive cannibals or zombies. Marshall intended the virus as the backdrop to the story, having survivors scavenge for themselves and set up a primitive society. The director drew from tribal history around the world to design the society. Though the survivors are depicted as brutal, Marshall sought to have \"shades of gray\" by characterising some people in England as selfishly manipulative.<ref name=cfq/>\n\nThe director intended ''Doomsday'' as a tribute to post-apocalyptic films from the 1970s and 1980s, explaining, \"Right from the start, I wanted my film to be an homage to these sorts of movies, and deliberately so.

While filmmakers did not seek innovative visual effects, they worked with budget restrictions by creating set extensions. With most shots taking place in daylight, the extensions involved [[Matte painting|matte paint]] and 2D and 3D solutions. The visual effects crew visited Scotland to take reference photos so scenes that were filmed in Cape Town, South Africa could instead have Scottish backgrounds. Several challenges for the visual effects crew included the illustration of cow overpopulation in line with a decimated human population and the convincing creation of the rebuilt Hadrian Wall in different lights and from different distances. The most challenging visual effects shot in ''Doomsday'' was the close-up in which a main character is burned alive. The shot required multiple enhancements and implementations of burning wardrobe, burning pigskin, and smoke and fire elements to look authentic.<ref name=vfxworld>{{cite news | first=Thomas J. | last=McLean | url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&format=rss&id=3578 | title=''Doomsday'': A VFX Cure for the Reaper Virus | publisher=VFXWorld.com | date=14 March 2008 | accessdate=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nNeil Marshall's car chase sequence also involved the use of visual effects. A scene in which the Bentley crashes through a bus was intended to implement pyrotechnics, but fire marshals in the South African nature reserve, the filming location for the scene, forbade their use due to dry conditions. A miniature mock-up was created and visual effects were applied so the filming of the mock-up would overlay the filming of the actual scene without pyrotechnics. Other visual effects that were created were the Thames flood plain and a remote Scottish castle. A popular effect with the visual effects crew was the \"rabbit explosion\" scene, depicting a rabbit being shot by guns on automatic sensors. The crew sought to expand the singular shot, but Neil Marshall sought to focus on one shot to emphasise its comic nature and avoid drawing unnecessary sympathy from audiences.<ref name=vfxworld/>\n\n=== Music ===\nMarshall originally intended to include 1980s [[synthesizer|synth]] music in his film, but he found it difficult to combine the music with the intense action. Instead, composer [[Tyler Bates]] composed a score using heavy orchestra music.<ref name=sayer/> The film also included songs from the bands [[Adam and the Ants]], [[Fine Young Cannibals]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]], and [[Kasabian]].<ref name=credits/> The song \"[[Two Tribes]]\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was the only song to remain in the film from the first draft of the screenplay. \"[[Spellbound (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Spellbound]]\" by Siouxsie and the Banshees was a favourite song of the director, who sought to include it. Marshall also hoped to include the song \"Into the Light\" by the Banshees, but it was left out due to the producer disliking it and the cost being too high to licence it.<ref>{{cite news | first=Tim| last=Masters| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7390688.stm| title= Talking Shop: Neil Marshall| publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=9 May 2008| accessdate=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nFor its theatrical run, the film was originally intended to be distributed by [[Focus Features]] under [[Rogue Pictures]], but the company transferred ''Doomsday'' among other films to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] for larger-scale distribution and marketing beginning in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Dade | last=Hayes | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117974078.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Rogue marketing moves to Universal | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=15 October 2007 | accessdate=24 December 2007 }}</ref> ''Doomsday'' was commercially released on 14 March 2008 in the United States and Canada in 1,936 theatres, grossing US$4,926,565 in its opening weekend and ranking seventh in the box office,<ref name=bom>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=doomsday.htm | title=Doomsday (2008) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> which ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'' reported as a \"failed\" opening.<ref>{{cite news | first=Brandon | last=Gray | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2465&p=.htm | title='Horton' Hits It Big | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | date=17 March 2008 | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> Its theatrical run in the United States and Canada lasted 28 days, ending on 10 April 2008, having grossed US$11,008,770.<ref name=bom/> The film opened in the United Kingdom, [[Republic of Ireland]], and [[Malta]] on 9 May 2008, grossing a total of US$2,027,749 in its entire run.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=doomsday.htm | title=Doomsday (2008) - International Box Office Results | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | accessdate=13 October 2008 }}</ref> The film's performance in the UK was considered a \"disappointing run\".<ref name=tanks>{{cite news | first=Orlando | last=Parfitt | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/speed_racer/news/1728059/uk_box_office_breakdown_speed_racer_tanks | title=UK Box Office Breakdown: Speed Racer Tanks | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=14 May 2008 | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> The film premiered in Italy in August 2008, grossing an overall US$500,000.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Frank |last=Segers |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |title='Knight' tops overseas with $19 mil |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Company]] |date=31 August 2008 |accessdate=13 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913082644/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |archivedate=13 September 2008 }}</ref> Worldwide, ''Doomsday'' has grossed US$22,211,426.<ref name=bom/>\n\n{{Anchor|Reception|Critical reception|Critics}}\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Quote box\n | quote = \"The director of top horror flicks ''The Descent'' and ''Dog Soldiers'' was given more money for his latest effort, but many thought he wasted it on a collection of flashy set pieces without much interlinking plot in between.\"\n | source = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] on UK's general consensus<ref name=tanks/>\n | width = 300px\n | align = right\n}}\n''Doomsday'' was not screened for critics in advance of its commercial opening in cinemas.<ref>{{cite news | first=Larry | last=Ratliff | title=Latest virus film put in quarantine | work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] | date=14 March 2008 }}</ref> The film received mixed reviews from critics.

Several of BAFTA Scotland's jury members believed that the criteria and procedures for a Scottish film were unclear and could have been more formalised.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pendreigh |first=Brian |url=http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2461513.0.filmed_in_scotland_loved_by_fans_snubbed_by_bafta.php |title=Filmed in Scotland, loved by fans ... snubbed by BAFTA |work=[[Sunday Herald]] |date=18 October 2008 |accessdate=18 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207041325/http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2461513.0.filmed_in_scotland_loved_by_fans_snubbed_by_bafta.php |archivedate= 7 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\n=== Haunted house ===\n''Doomsday'' was used as inspiration in building a haunted house for [[Halloween Horror Nights (Orlando)|Halloween Horror Nights]] in Orlando.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/story/event-report-universal-orlandos-halloween-horror-nights-18| title=Event Report: Universal Orlando's Halloween Horror Nights 18| publisher=dreadcentral.com| date=28 September 2008| accessdate=25 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Doomsday'' was the first [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] title released by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] after the studio's initial support of the now-folded [[HD DVD]] format.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSN1740482320080417 | title=Universal joining Blu-ray bandwagon in the summer | agency=[[Reuters]]| date=17 April 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2008 }}</ref> The unrated version was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 29 July 2008 in the United States, containing an audio commentary and bonus materials covering the film's post-apocalyptic scenario, visual effects, and destructive vehicles and weapons.<ref>{{cite news | first=David | last=McCutcheon | url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/874/874270p1.html | title=Doomsday Infects Blu-ray | work=[[IGN]] | date=15 May 2008 | accessdate=20 June 2008 }}</ref> [[IGN]] assessed the unrated DVD's video quality, writing, \"For the most part, it's a crisp disc that's leaps above standard def.\" The audio quality was considered up to par with the film's loud scenes, though IGN found volume irregularity between the loud scenes and the quiet scenes.

The film takes place in the future in [[Scotland]], which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in [[London]], political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair ([[Rhona Mitra]]) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. ''Doomsday'' was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including ''[[Mad Max]]'', ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and ''[[28 Days Later]]''.\n\nMarshall had a budget three times the size of his previous two films, ''[[The Descent]]'' and ''[[Dog Soldiers (film)|Dog Soldiers]]'', and the director filmed the larger-scale ''Doomsday'' in Scotland and [[South Africa]]. The film was released in the United States and Canada on 14 March 2008 and in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2008. ''Doomsday'' did not perform well at the box office, and critics gave the film mixed reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2008, an unknown killer virus, known as the \"Reaper Virus\", has infected the country of [[Scotland]]. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, the British government builds a massive 30-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of [[Great Britain]]. Whilst the quarantine was deemed a success, the extreme method employed by the government destroys diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. Now a [[pariah state]], the UK collapses into a [[dystopia]], rife with unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil.\n\n27 years after the start of the quarantine, a group of armed police officers discover several people in London infected with Reaper Virus during a routine investigation. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] John Hatcher shares satellite footage of survivors in Scotland with domestic security chief Captain Nelson. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses his top police officer, Major Eden Sinclair, to lead the team. Sinclair is originally from Scotland, having escaped as the quarantine began at the cost of her right eye. For Sinclair the mission is also personal, as she hopes to learn if her mother survived or not.\n\nSinclair's team crosses the wall to [[Glasgow]], Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals, led by the power-hungry Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army [[Invasion|to start their invasion of England]], which will bring Great Britain into the [[Golden Age]]. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the rest of the gang, who burn Dr. Talbot alive before devouring his body. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's second-in-command. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol abolishes [[martial law]] by creating his own army.\n\nMeanwhile, the Reaper Virus turns everyone present in London into primal savages, destroying everything in sight in an ongoing riot. Hatcher plans secretly to isolate the central London area because of the infection when an infected man breaks into Hatcher\u2019s office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the infected man, but his blood splatters on Hatcher. Hatcher is quarantined by his right hand man, Michael Canaris,  who also takes his place as ''de facto'' prime minister. Hatcher later commits suicide, unable to take much more of his successor's scam.\n\nAfter leaving the train, Sinclair's group are arrested by soldiers armed with archaic weapons and armour. They are taken to a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure, only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, the rest of the group escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.\n\nSinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally escape to a fallout shelter entrance on horseback. They locate an underground facility in the forest and find an intact [[Bentley Continental GT|2007 Bentley Continental GT]], which they fuel up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine wall. On the way, they are intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper once and for all. After a high-speed chase, Sol and many of his men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.\n\nUsing a phone retrieved from the fallout shelter, Sinclair calls Canaris, who later arrives in a government gunship. Canaris then tricks Sinclair into trading Cally (whose blood can be used to create a vaccine to treat the virus), revealing his scheme to use the virus all over the UK as both a form of population control and for profit.\n\nCally and Stirling board the gunship with Canaris while Sinclair returns to her old house in search of her mother, followed by Nelson, who flew into the quarantine zone to speak with his top-ranking officer. While Sinclair confirms that her mother has perished due to the virus, she is able to retrieve a picture of her. Sinclair gives Nelson a recording of Canaris's [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] scheme. The recording is later broadcasted to the rest of the country, much to Canaris's shock as it spells doom to his career. Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns to his gang; she throws the head onto the ground, announcing to the marauders, \u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, try a piece of your friend\u201d. The marauders stand in shock for a moment before bursting into cheering, accepting Sinclair as their new leader.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Rhona Mitra (Straighten Colors).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A seated woman with brown hair extending below her shoulders and wearing a blue shirt smiles as she looks to her right.|Actress Rhona Mitra starred in ''Doomsday'' as Major Eden Sinclair.]]\n\n* [[Rhona Mitra]] as Major Eden Sinclair of the Department of Domestic Security, selected to lead a team to find a cure.<ref name=mitra/> The heroine was inspired by the character [[Snake Plissken]].<ref name=hot>{{cite news | first=Justine | last=Elias | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/30/2007-09-30_hot_heroines_in_apocalyptic_flicks-1.html | title=Hot heroines in apocalyptic flicks | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | date=30 September 2007 | accessdate=24 December 2007}}</ref> Mitra worked out and fight trained for eleven weeks for the film.

The director fantasised about what conditions would cause the Wall to be rebuilt and imagined a lethal virus would work. Marshall had also visualised a mixture of medieval and futuristic elements: \"I had this vision of these futuristic soldiers with high-tech weaponry and body armour and helmets\u2014clearly from the future\u2014facing a medieval knight on horseback.\" The director favoured the English/Scottish border as the location for a rebuilt wall, finding the location more plausible than a lengthy boundary between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Scotland is the home to multiple castles, which fit Marshall's medieval aspect.<ref name=cfq>{{cite news| first=Steve| last=Biodrowski| url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/03/07/interview-neil-marshall-directs-doomsday| title=Interview: Neil Marshall Directs \"Doomsday\"| publisher=Cinefantastique.com|accessdate=15 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe lethal virus in ''Doomsday'' differs from contemporary films like ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' by being an authentic plague that actually devastates the population, instead of infecting people so they become aggressive cannibals or zombies. Marshall intended the virus as the backdrop to the story, having survivors scavenge for themselves and set up a primitive society. The director drew from tribal history around the world to design the society. Though the survivors are depicted as brutal, Marshall sought to have \"shades of gray\" by characterising some people in England as selfishly manipulative.<ref name=cfq/>\n\nThe director intended ''Doomsday'' as a tribute to post-apocalyptic films from the 1970s and 1980s, explaining, \"Right from the start, I wanted my film to be an homage to these sorts of movies, and deliberately so. I wanted to make a movie for a new generation of audience that hadn't seen those movies in the cinema\u2014hadn't seen them at all maybe\u2014and to give them the same thrill that I got from watching them.

While filmmakers did not seek innovative visual effects, they worked with budget restrictions by creating set extensions. With most shots taking place in daylight, the extensions involved [[Matte painting|matte paint]] and 2D and 3D solutions. The visual effects crew visited Scotland to take reference photos so scenes that were filmed in Cape Town, South Africa could instead have Scottish backgrounds. Several challenges for the visual effects crew included the illustration of cow overpopulation in line with a decimated human population and the convincing creation of the rebuilt Hadrian Wall in different lights and from different distances. The most challenging visual effects shot in ''Doomsday'' was the close-up in which a main character is burned alive. The shot required multiple enhancements and implementations of burning wardrobe, burning pigskin, and smoke and fire elements to look authentic.<ref name=vfxworld>{{cite news | first=Thomas J. | last=McLean | url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&format=rss&id=3578 | title=''Doomsday'': A VFX Cure for the Reaper Virus | publisher=VFXWorld.com | date=14 March 2008 | accessdate=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nNeil Marshall's car chase sequence also involved the use of visual effects. A scene in which the Bentley crashes through a bus was intended to implement pyrotechnics, but fire marshals in the South African nature reserve, the filming location for the scene, forbade their use due to dry conditions. A miniature mock-up was created and visual effects were applied so the filming of the mock-up would overlay the filming of the actual scene without pyrotechnics. Other visual effects that were created were the Thames flood plain and a remote Scottish castle. A popular effect with the visual effects crew was the \"rabbit explosion\" scene, depicting a rabbit being shot by guns on automatic sensors. The crew sought to expand the singular shot, but Neil Marshall sought to focus on one shot to emphasise its comic nature and avoid drawing unnecessary sympathy from audiences.<ref name=vfxworld/>\n\n=== Music ===\nMarshall originally intended to include 1980s [[synthesizer|synth]] music in his film, but he found it difficult to combine the music with the intense action. Instead, composer [[Tyler Bates]] composed a score using heavy orchestra music.<ref name=sayer/> The film also included songs from the bands [[Adam and the Ants]], [[Fine Young Cannibals]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]], and [[Kasabian]].<ref name=credits/> The song \"[[Two Tribes]]\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was the only song to remain in the film from the first draft of the screenplay. \"[[Spellbound (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Spellbound]]\" by Siouxsie and the Banshees was a favourite song of the director, who sought to include it. Marshall also hoped to include the song \"Into the Light\" by the Banshees, but it was left out due to the producer disliking it and the cost being too high to licence it.<ref>{{cite news | first=Tim| last=Masters| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7390688.stm| title= Talking Shop: Neil Marshall| publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=9 May 2008| accessdate=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nFor its theatrical run, the film was originally intended to be distributed by [[Focus Features]] under [[Rogue Pictures]], but the company transferred ''Doomsday'' among other films to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] for larger-scale distribution and marketing beginning in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Dade | last=Hayes | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117974078.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Rogue marketing moves to Universal | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=15 October 2007 | accessdate=24 December 2007 }}</ref> ''Doomsday'' was commercially released on 14 March 2008 in the United States and Canada in 1,936 theatres, grossing US$4,926,565 in its opening weekend and ranking seventh in the box office,<ref name=bom>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=doomsday.htm | title=Doomsday (2008) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> which ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'' reported as a \"failed\" opening.<ref>{{cite news | first=Brandon | last=Gray | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2465&p=.htm | title='Horton' Hits It Big | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | date=17 March 2008 | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> Its theatrical run in the United States and Canada lasted 28 days, ending on 10 April 2008, having grossed US$11,008,770.<ref name=bom/> The film opened in the United Kingdom, [[Republic of Ireland]], and [[Malta]] on 9 May 2008, grossing a total of US$2,027,749 in its entire run.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=doomsday.htm | title=Doomsday (2008) - International Box Office Results | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | accessdate=13 October 2008 }}</ref> The film's performance in the UK was considered a \"disappointing run\".<ref name=tanks>{{cite news | first=Orlando | last=Parfitt | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/speed_racer/news/1728059/uk_box_office_breakdown_speed_racer_tanks | title=UK Box Office Breakdown: Speed Racer Tanks | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=14 May 2008 | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> The film premiered in Italy in August 2008, grossing an overall US$500,000.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Frank |last=Segers |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |title='Knight' tops overseas with $19 mil |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Company]] |date=31 August 2008 |accessdate=13 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913082644/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |archivedate=13 September 2008 }}</ref> Worldwide, ''Doomsday'' has grossed US$22,211,426.<ref name=bom/>\n\n{{Anchor|Reception|Critical reception|Critics}}\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Quote box\n | quote = \"The director of top horror flicks ''The Descent'' and ''Dog Soldiers'' was given more money for his latest effort, but many thought he wasted it on a collection of flashy set pieces without much interlinking plot in between.\"\n | source = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] on UK's general consensus<ref name=tanks/>\n | width = 300px\n | align = right\n}}\n''Doomsday'' was not screened for critics in advance of its commercial opening in cinemas.<ref>{{cite news | first=Larry | last=Ratliff | title=Latest virus film put in quarantine | work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] | date=14 March 2008 }}</ref> The film received mixed reviews from critics.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the area was a key centre of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] culture, with the powerful state of [[Kievan Rus']] forming the basis of Ukrainian identity. Following its fragmentation in the 13th century, the territory was contested, ruled and divided by a variety of powers, including the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Russia. A [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack republic]] emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries, but its territory was eventually split between [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. After [[World War II]] the Western part of Ukraine merged into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and the whole country became a part of the Soviet Union as a single state entity. In 1991, Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union in the aftermath of [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|its dissolution]] at the end of the [[Cold War]]. Before its independence, Ukraine was typically referred to in English as \"The Ukraine\", but most sources have since moved to drop \"the\" from the name of Ukraine in all uses.<ref name=UKrW812991TU />\n\nFollowing its independence, Ukraine declared itself a [[neutral state]];<ref name=\"gska2.rada.gov.ua\">{{cite web |url=http://gska2.rada.gov.ua:7777/site/postanova_eng/Declaration_of_State_Sovereignty_of_Ukraine_rev1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224650/http://gska2.rada.gov.ua:7777/site/postanova_eng/Declaration_of_State_Sovereignty_of_Ukraine_rev1.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine |accessdate=24 December 2007 |website=[[Verkhovna Rada]] of Ukraine}}</ref> it formed a limited military partnership with Russia and other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS countries]] while also establishing a [[Partnership for Peace|partnership with NATO]] in 1994. In 2013, after the government of President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] had decided to suspend the [[Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement]] and seek closer economic ties with Russia, a several-months-long wave of demonstrations and protests known as the [[Euromaidan]] began, which later escalated into the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] that led to the overthrow of Yanukovych and the establishment of a new government. These events formed the background for the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea by Russia]] in March 2014, and the [[War in Donbass]] in April 2014.

It is the largest wholly European country and the [[Europe#Territories and regions|second-largest country]] in Europe (after the European part of Russia, before [[metropolitan France]]).{{Ref label|E|e|none}}<ref name=\"cia\" /> It lies between latitudes [[44th parallel north|44\u00b0]] and [[53rd parallel north|53\u00b0 N]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian east|22\u00b0]] and [[41st meridian east|41\u00b0 E]].\n\nThe landscape of Ukraine consists mostly of fertile plains (or [[steppes]]) and plateaus, crossed by rivers such as the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] ({{lang|uk-Latn|Dnipro}}), [[Seversky Donets]], [[Dniester]] and the [[Southern Bug]] as they flow south into the [[Black Sea]] and the smaller [[Sea of Azov]]. To the southwest, the [[Danube Delta|delta]] of the [[Danube]] forms the border with Romania. Ukraine's various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands. The country's only mountains are the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, of which the highest is the [[Hora Hoverla]] at {{convert|2061|m}}, and the [[Crimean Mountains]] on Crimea, in the extreme south along the coast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115052701/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine |archivedate=15 January 2008 |title=Ukraine \u2013 Relief |accessdate=27 December 2007 |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (fee required) |url-status=dead}}</ref> However Ukraine also has a number of highland regions such as the [[Volhynian-Podolian Upland|Volyn-Podillia Upland]] (in the west) and the Near-Dnipro Upland (on the right bank of Dnieper); to the east there are the south-western spurs of the [[Central Russian Upland]] over which runs the border with the [[Russian Federation]]. Near the [[Sea of Azov]] can be found the Donets Ridge and the Near Azov Upland. The [[snow melt]] from the mountains feeds the rivers, and natural changes in altitude form sudden drops in elevation and give rise to [[waterfalls of Ukraine|waterfalls]].\n\nSignificant natural resources in Ukraine include iron ore, coal, manganese, natural gas, oil, salt, sulphur, graphite, titanium, magnesium, kaolin, nickel, mercury, timber and an abundance of arable land. Despite this, the country faces a number of major environmental issues such as inadequate supplies of potable water; air- and water-pollution and deforestation, as well as radiation contamination in the north-east from the [[Chernobyl disaster|1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]].

However, in 2004, deputies introduced changes to the Constitution, which tipped the balance of power in favour of a [[parliamentary system]].

Much of the concern was based on the fact that neither the Constitution of 1996 nor the Constitution of 2004 provided the ability to \"undo the Constitution\", as the decision of the Constitutional Court would have it, even though the 2004 constitution arguably has an exhaustive list of possible procedures for constitutional amendments (articles 154\u2013159).

Established in 1576 in the town of [[Ostroh|Ostrog]], the Collegium was the first higher education institution in the [[East Slavic peoples|Eastern Slavic]] territories. The oldest university was the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv Mohyla Academy]], first established in 1632 and in 1694 officially recognised by the government of [[Imperial Russia]] as a higher education institution. Among the oldest is also the [[Lviv University]], founded in 1661. More higher education institutions were set up in the 19th century, beginning with universities in [[Kharkiv University|Kharkiv]] (1805), [[Kiev University|Kiev]] (1834), [[Odessa University|Odessa]] (1865) and [[Chernivtsi University|Chernivtsi]] (1875) and a number of professional higher education institutions, e.g.: [[Nizhyn Pedagogical University|Nizhyn Historical and Philological Institute]] (originally established as the Gymnasium of Higher Sciences in 1805), a Veterinary Institute (1873) and a [[Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute|Technological Institute]] (1885) in [[Kharkiv]], a [[Kiev Polytechnic Institute|Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Kiev]] (1898) and a Higher Mining School (1899) in [[Dnipro|Katerynoslav]]. Rapid growth followed in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet]] period. By 1988 a number of higher education institutions increased to 146 with over 850,000 students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001465/146552e.pdf |title=Higher education in Ukraine; Monographs on higher education; 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}</ref> Most HEIs established after 1990 are those owned by private organisations.\n\nThe Ukrainian higher education system comprises higher educational establishments, [[scientific]] and [[methodological]] facilities under national, [[municipal government|municipal]] and self-governing bodies in charge of education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/higher_educ_eng.html |title=System of Higher Education of Ukraine |accessdate=23 December 2007 |publisher=Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217073746/http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/higher_educ_eng.html |archivedate=17 December 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The organisation of higher education in Ukraine is built up in accordance with the structure of education of the world's higher [[developed countries]], as is defined by [[UNESCO]] and the UN.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/education_eng.html |title=System of the Education of Ukraine |accessdate=23 December 2007 |publisher=Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212111804/http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/education_eng.html |archivedate=12 December 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\nUkraine has more than 800 higher education institutions and in 2010 the number of graduates reached 654,700 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://outsourcing-ukraine.org/2011/10/14/educational-system-ukraine-facilitates-development-outsourcing-sector/ |title=Educational system in Ukraine |publisher=Outsourcing-ukraine.org |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nUkraine produces the fourth largest number of [[Tertiary education|post-secondary graduates]] in Europe, while being ranked seventh in population. [[Higher education in Ukraine|Higher education]] is either state funded or private. Students that study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test suffice; this rule may be different in some universities. For highest grades, the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses. Most universities provide subsidised housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students. Ukrainian universities confer two degrees: the bachelor's degree (4&nbsp;years) and the master's degree (5\u20136th&nbsp;year), in accordance with the [[Bologna process]]. Historically, [[Specialist degree]] (usually 5 years) is still also granted; it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times.\n\nThe Law of Ukraine ''On Higher Education'' came into force on 6 September 2014.

These policies faced a steep decline in the 1930s, when prominent representatives as well as many others were killed by [[NKVD]] as part of the [[Great Purge]].

The doctrine did not necessarily repress the use of the Ukrainian language, but it required that writers follow a certain style in their works.\n\nIn post-Stalinist times literary activities continued to be somewhat limited under the Communist Party. The most famous figures of Ukrainian post-war Soviet literature were [[Lina Kostenko]], [[Dmytro Pavlychko]], [[Borys Oliynyk (poet)]], [[Ivan Drach]], [[Oles Honchar]], [[Vasyl Stus]], [[Vasyl Symonenko]].\n\nLiterary freedom grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s alongside the decline and collapse of the USSR and the reestablishment of Ukrainian independence in 1991.<ref name=ualit />\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Ukrainian architecture}}\n[[File:80-391-9007 Kyiv St.Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery RB 18.jpg|thumb|right|[[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral]] in [[Kiev]], foremost example of [[Cossack Baroque]] and one of Ukraine's most recognizable landmarks]]\n\nUkrainian architecture includes the motifs and styles that are found in structures built in modern Ukraine, and by [[Ukrainians]] worldwide.\nThese include initial roots which were established in the [[Eastern Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] state of [[Kievan Rus']]. Since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] for several ages Ukrainian architecture was influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture]]. After the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|12th century]], the distinct [[architectural history]] continued in the principalities of [[Galicia-Volhynia]]. During the epoch of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], a new style unique to Ukraine was developed under the western influences of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. After the union with the [[Tsardom of Russia]], many structures in the larger eastern, Russian-ruled area were built in the styles of [[Russian architecture]] of that period, whilst the western [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was developed under [[Architecture of Austria|Austro-Hungarian architectural influences]]. Ukrainian national motifs would finally be used during the period of the [[Soviet Union]] and in modern independent Ukraine.\n\nThe great [[Architecture of Kievan Rus|churches of the Rus']], built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kievan state was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly made of wood, with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of the appearance of pre-Christian pagan Slavic temples.\n\n[[File:Curitiba Parque Tingui.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional Ukrainian village [[Ukrainian architecture|architecture]] in [[Curitiba]], Brazil, which has a large [[Ukrainian diaspora]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brasil.kiev.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=45&layout=blog&Itemid=30&9856877558d17ec206d1a87e99fb1dce=3fab537243dff8dbaf45e8c8619a395b |title=Slavic community in Curitiba |publisher=Brasil.kiev.ua |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203110425/http://www.brasil.kiev.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=45&layout=blog&Itemid=30&9856877558d17ec206d1a87e99fb1dce=3fab537243dff8dbaf45e8c8619a395b |archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref>]]\n\nSeveral examples of these churches survive; however, during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, many were externally rebuilt in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style (see below). Examples include the grand [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|St. Sophia of Kiev]]&nbsp;\u2013 the year 1017 is the earliest record of foundation laid, [[Church of the Saviour at Berestove]] \u2013 built from 1113 to 1125 and [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Church]], circa 12th-century. All can still be found in the Ukrainian capital. Several buildings were reconstructed during the late-19th century, including the [[:File:WladimirWolynsk Uspenski Cathedral.jpeg|Assumption Cathedral]] in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], built in 1160 and reconstructed in 1896\u20131900, the [[:File:AX Chernigiv Pyatnitska Church.jpg|Paraskevi church in Chernihiv]], built in 1201 with reconstruction done in the late 1940s, and the [[Golden Gate (Kiev)|Golden gates in Kiev]], built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982. The latter's reconstruction was criticised by some art and architecture historians as a revivalist fantasy. Unfortunately little secular or [[vernacular architecture]] of [[Kievan Rus']] has survived.\n\nAs Ukraine became increasingly integrated into the [[Russian Empire]], Russian architects had the opportunity to realise their projects in the picturesque landscape that many Ukrainian cities and regions offered. [[St. Andrew's Church of Kiev]] (1747\u20131754), built by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], is a notable example of [[Baroque]] architecture, and its location on top of the Kievan mountain made it a recognisable monument of the city. An equally notable contribution of Rasetrelli was the [[Mariyinsky Palace]], which was built to be a summer residence to Russian Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]. During the reign of the last [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman of Ukraine]], [[Kirill Razumovsky]], many of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]'s towns such as [[Hlukhiv]], [[Baturyn]] and [[Koselets]] had grandiose projects built by [[Andrey Kvasov]]. Russia eventually conquered the south of Ukraine and Crimea, and renamed them as [[New Russia]]. New cities such as [[Mykolayiv|Nikolayev]], [[Odessa]], [[Kherson]] and [[Sevastopol]] were founded. These would contain notable examples of Imperial Russian architecture.\n\n[[File:Kryvyi Rih - apartment building2.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a [[Khrushchyovka]] in [[Kryvyi Rih]]. Such apartments were built throughout Ukraine during Soviet times and are found in every major city.]]\n\nIn 1934, the capital of Soviet Ukraine moved from [[Kharkiv]] to [[Kiev]]. Previously, the city was seen as only a regional centre, hence received little attention. All of that was to change, at great price. The first examples of [[Stalinist architecture]] were already showing, and, in light of the official policy, a new city was to be built on top of the old one. This meant that much-admired examples such as the [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] were destroyed. Even the St. Sophia Cathedral was under threat. Also, the Second World War contributed to the wreckage. After the war, a new project for the reconstruction of central Kiev transformed [[Khreshchatyk]] avenue into a notable example of Stalinism in Architecture. However, by 1955, the new politics of architecture once again stopped the project from fully being realised.\n\nThe task for modern Ukrainian architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. An example of modern Ukrainian architecture is the reconstruction and renewal of the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] in central Kiev. Despite the limit set by narrow space within the plaza, the engineers were able to blend together the uneven landscape, and use underground space for a new shopping centre.\n\nA major project, which may take up most of the 21st century, is the construction of the Kiev City-Centre on the [[Rybalskyi Peninsula]], which, when finished, will include a dense skyscraper park amid the picturesque landscape of the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]].<ref name=gradsovet_05_12_07>{{cite web |url=http://archunion.com.ua/sovet-2005/gradsovet_05_12_07.shtml |script-title=ru:\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u2013 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0433. \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0434 \u0434\u043e 2020\u0433., \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0438\u043b\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043c, \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e-\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u044b, \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0434\u0440. \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u044b\u0431\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435, \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d. |trans-title=Architects of Kiev \u2013 Development rationale for changes in the general development plan of Kiev up to 2020 relating to the construction of residential and office buildings with underground parking, hospitality-office complexes, shopping centres, social and cultural facilities, multi-functional entertainment complexes, etc. on Rybalsky island, Podolsky district. |website=archunion.com.ua |date=7 December 2005 |accessdate=8 January 2014 |language=Russian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510032158/http://archunion.com.ua/sovet-2005/gradsovet_05_12_07.shtml |archivedate=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Ukraine}}\n[[File:Cossack Mamay 1st half of 19th c (4).jpg|thumb|[[Cossack Mamay]] playing a [[kobza]]]]\n\nMusic is a major part of Ukrainian culture, with a long history and many influences. From traditional [[folk music]], to [[classical music|classical]] and [[modern rock]], Ukraine has produced several internationally recognised musicians including [[Kirill Karabits]], [[Okean Elzy]] and [[Ruslana]]. Elements from traditional Ukrainian folk music made their way into Western music and even into modern [[jazz]].\n\nUkrainian music sometimes presents a perplexing mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony. The most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals.\n\n[[File:\u041b\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u041c\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|[[Mykola Lysenko]] is widely considered to be the father of Ukrainian classical music.]]\n\nDuring the Baroque period, music was an important discipline for those that had received a higher education in Ukraine. It had a place of considerable importance in the curriculum of the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. Much of the nobility was well versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as (Mazepa, Paliy, Holovatyj, Sirko) being accomplished players of the [[kobza]], [[bandura]] or [[torban]].\n\nThe first dedicated musical academy was set up in Hlukhiv, Ukraine in 1738 and students were taught to sing, play violin and bandura from manuscripts. As a result, many of the earliest composers and performers within the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian, having been born or educated in Hlukhiv, or had been closely associated with this music school.\nSee: [[Dmytro Bortniansky]], [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Artemy Vedel|Artemiy Vedel]].\n\nUkrainian classical music falls into three distinct categories defined by whether the composer was of Ukrainian ethnicity living in Ukraine, a composer of non-Ukrainian ethnicity who was born or at some time was a citizen of Ukraine, or an ethnic Ukrainian living outside of Ukraine within the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. The music of these three groups differs considerably, as do the audiences for whom they cater.\n\n[[File:Rapid Trident 2014 06.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian dance ''[[hopak]]'']]\n\nSince the mid-1960s, Western-influenced pop music has been growing in popularity in Ukraine. Folk singer and harmonium player [[Mariana Sadovska]] is prominent. Ukrainian pop and folk music arose with the international popularity of groups and performers like [[Vopli Vidoplyasova]], [[Dakh Daughters]], [[Dakha Brakha]], [[Ivan Dorn]] and [[Okean Elzy]].\n\nModern musical culture of Ukraine is presented both with academic and entertainment music. Ukraine has five conservatories, 6 opera houses, five houses of Chamber Music, Philharmony in all regional centers.\n\nUkraine hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017]].\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{Main|Cinema of Ukraine}}\nUkraine has had an influence on the history of the cinema. Ukrainian directors [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], often cited as one of the most important early Soviet filmmakers, as well as being a pioneer of [[Soviet montage theory]], [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]], and [[Sergei Parajanov]], Armenian film director and artist who made significant contributions to Ukrainian, Armenian and Georgian cinema. He invented his own cinematic style, Ukrainian poetic cinema, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism.\n\n[[File:Muratova.jpg|upright|thumbnail|[[Kira Muratova]]]]\n\nOther important directors including [[Kira Muratova]], [[Sergei Loznitsa]], [[Myroslav Slaboshpytskyi]], [[Larisa Shepitko]], [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], [[Leonid Bykov]], [[Yuri Ilyenko]], [[Leonid Osyka]], [[Ihor Podolchak]] with his [[Delirium (2013 film)|Delirium]] and [[Maryna Vroda]]. Many Ukrainian actors have achieved international fame and critical success, including: [[Vera Kholodnaya]], [[Bohdan Stupka]], [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mila Kunis]].\n\nDespite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of European and Russian influence. Ukrainian producers are active in international co-productions and Ukrainian actors, directors and crew feature regularly in Russian (Soviet in past) films. Also successful films have been based on Ukrainian people, stories or events, including [[Battleship Potemkin]], [[Man with a Movie Camera]], [[Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom]], [[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]].\n\nUkrainian State Film Agency owns [[National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre]], film copying laboratory and archive, takes part in hosting of the [[Odessa International Film Festival]], and [[Molodist]] is the only one [[FIAPF]] accredited International Film Festival held in Ukraine; competition program is devoted to student, first short and first full feature films from all over the world.

However, in 2010 Freedom House perceived \"negative trends in Ukraine\".\n\n[[Kiev]] dominates the media sector in Ukraine: the ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' is Ukraine's leading English-language newspaper. National [[List of newspapers in Ukraine|newspapers]] ''[[Den (newspaper)|Den]]'', ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli|Mirror Weekly]]'', tabloids, such as ''[[The Ukrainian Week]]'' or ''[[Focus (Ukrainian magazine)|Focus]]'' (Russian), and television and radio are largely based there, although [[Lviv]] is also a significant national media centre. The National News Agency of Ukraine, [[Ukrinform]] was founded here in 1918. The Ukraine publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover. [[Sanoma]] publishes Ukrainian editions of such magazines as ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Harpers Bazaar]]'' and ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]''. [[BBC Ukrainian]] started its broadcasts in 1992.\n\nUkrainians listen to radio programming, such as [[Radio Ukraine]] or [[Radio Liberty]], largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day. Several television channels operate, and many websites are popular.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Andriy Shevchenko goal celebration Euro 2012 vs Sweden.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian footballer [[Andriy Shevchenko]] celebrates a goal against Sweden at Euro 2012]]\nUkraine greatly benefited from the Soviet emphasis on [[physical education]].

During the [[Middle Ages]], the area was a key centre of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] culture, with the powerful state of [[Kievan Rus']] forming the basis of Ukrainian identity. Following its fragmentation in the 13th century, the territory was contested, ruled and divided by a variety of powers, including the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Russia. A [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack republic]] emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries, but its territory was eventually split between [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. After [[World War II]] the Western part of Ukraine merged into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and the whole country became a part of the Soviet Union as a single state entity. In 1991, Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union in the aftermath of [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|its dissolution]] at the end of the [[Cold War]]. Before its independence, Ukraine was typically referred to in English as \"The Ukraine\", but most sources have since moved to drop \"the\" from the name of Ukraine in all uses.<ref name=UKrW812991TU />\n\nFollowing its independence, Ukraine declared itself a [[neutral state]];<ref name=\"gska2.rada.gov.ua\">{{cite web |url=http://gska2.rada.gov.ua:7777/site/postanova_eng/Declaration_of_State_Sovereignty_of_Ukraine_rev1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224650/http://gska2.rada.gov.ua:7777/site/postanova_eng/Declaration_of_State_Sovereignty_of_Ukraine_rev1.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine |accessdate=24 December 2007 |website=[[Verkhovna Rada]] of Ukraine}}</ref> it formed a limited military partnership with Russia and other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS countries]] while also establishing a [[Partnership for Peace|partnership with NATO]] in 1994. In 2013, after the government of President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] had decided to suspend the [[Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement]] and seek closer economic ties with Russia, a several-months-long wave of demonstrations and protests known as the [[Euromaidan]] began, which later escalated into the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] that led to the overthrow of Yanukovych and the establishment of a new government. These events formed the background for the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea by Russia]] in March 2014, and the [[War in Donbass]] in April 2014.

Religious warfare also broke out among Ukrainian groups. Increasing conflict between Uniate and Orthodox parishes along the newly reinforced Polish-Russian border on the [[Dnieper River]] in the time of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] set the stage for the uprising.

It is the largest wholly European country and the [[Europe#Territories and regions|second-largest country]] in Europe (after the European part of Russia, before [[metropolitan France]]).{{Ref label|E|e|none}}<ref name=\"cia\" /> It lies between latitudes [[44th parallel north|44\u00b0]] and [[53rd parallel north|53\u00b0 N]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian east|22\u00b0]] and [[41st meridian east|41\u00b0 E]].\n\nThe landscape of Ukraine consists mostly of fertile plains (or [[steppes]]) and plateaus, crossed by rivers such as the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] ({{lang|uk-Latn|Dnipro}}), [[Seversky Donets]], [[Dniester]] and the [[Southern Bug]] as they flow south into the [[Black Sea]] and the smaller [[Sea of Azov]]. To the southwest, the [[Danube Delta|delta]] of the [[Danube]] forms the border with Romania. Ukraine's various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands. The country's only mountains are the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, of which the highest is the [[Hora Hoverla]] at {{convert|2061|m}}, and the [[Crimean Mountains]] on Crimea, in the extreme south along the coast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115052701/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine |archivedate=15 January 2008 |title=Ukraine \u2013 Relief |accessdate=27 December 2007 |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (fee required) |url-status=dead}}</ref> However Ukraine also has a number of highland regions such as the [[Volhynian-Podolian Upland|Volyn-Podillia Upland]] (in the west) and the Near-Dnipro Upland (on the right bank of Dnieper); to the east there are the south-western spurs of the [[Central Russian Upland]] over which runs the border with the [[Russian Federation]]. Near the [[Sea of Azov]] can be found the Donets Ridge and the Near Azov Upland. The [[snow melt]] from the mountains feeds the rivers, and natural changes in altitude form sudden drops in elevation and give rise to [[waterfalls of Ukraine|waterfalls]].\n\nSignificant natural resources in Ukraine include iron ore, coal, manganese, natural gas, oil, salt, sulphur, graphite, titanium, magnesium, kaolin, nickel, mercury, timber and an abundance of arable land. Despite this, the country faces a number of major environmental issues such as inadequate supplies of potable water; air- and water-pollution and deforestation, as well as radiation contamination in the north-east from the [[Chernobyl disaster|1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]].

However, in 2004, deputies introduced changes to the Constitution, which tipped the balance of power in favour of a [[parliamentary system]].

Much of the concern was based on the fact that neither the Constitution of 1996 nor the Constitution of 2004 provided the ability to \"undo the Constitution\", as the decision of the Constitutional Court would have it, even though the 2004 constitution arguably has an exhaustive list of possible procedures for constitutional amendments (articles 154\u2013159).

Established in 1576 in the town of [[Ostroh|Ostrog]], the Collegium was the first higher education institution in the [[East Slavic peoples|Eastern Slavic]] territories. The oldest university was the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv Mohyla Academy]], first established in 1632 and in 1694 officially recognised by the government of [[Imperial Russia]] as a higher education institution. Among the oldest is also the [[Lviv University]], founded in 1661. More higher education institutions were set up in the 19th century, beginning with universities in [[Kharkiv University|Kharkiv]] (1805), [[Kiev University|Kiev]] (1834), [[Odessa University|Odessa]] (1865) and [[Chernivtsi University|Chernivtsi]] (1875) and a number of professional higher education institutions, e.g.: [[Nizhyn Pedagogical University|Nizhyn Historical and Philological Institute]] (originally established as the Gymnasium of Higher Sciences in 1805), a Veterinary Institute (1873) and a [[Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute|Technological Institute]] (1885) in [[Kharkiv]], a [[Kiev Polytechnic Institute|Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Kiev]] (1898) and a Higher Mining School (1899) in [[Dnipro|Katerynoslav]]. Rapid growth followed in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet]] period. By 1988 a number of higher education institutions increased to 146 with over 850,000 students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001465/146552e.pdf |title=Higher education in Ukraine; Monographs on higher education; 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}</ref> Most HEIs established after 1990 are those owned by private organisations.\n\nThe Ukrainian higher education system comprises higher educational establishments, [[scientific]] and [[methodological]] facilities under national, [[municipal government|municipal]] and self-governing bodies in charge of education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/higher_educ_eng.html |title=System of Higher Education of Ukraine |accessdate=23 December 2007 |publisher=Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217073746/http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/higher_educ_eng.html |archivedate=17 December 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The organisation of higher education in Ukraine is built up in accordance with the structure of education of the world's higher [[developed countries]], as is defined by [[UNESCO]] and the UN.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/education_eng.html |title=System of the Education of Ukraine |accessdate=23 December 2007 |publisher=Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212111804/http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/education_eng.html |archivedate=12 December 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\nUkraine has more than 800 higher education institutions and in 2010 the number of graduates reached 654,700 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://outsourcing-ukraine.org/2011/10/14/educational-system-ukraine-facilitates-development-outsourcing-sector/ |title=Educational system in Ukraine |publisher=Outsourcing-ukraine.org |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nUkraine produces the fourth largest number of [[Tertiary education|post-secondary graduates]] in Europe, while being ranked seventh in population. [[Higher education in Ukraine|Higher education]] is either state funded or private. Students that study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test suffice; this rule may be different in some universities. For highest grades, the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses. Most universities provide subsidised housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students. Ukrainian universities confer two degrees: the bachelor's degree (4&nbsp;years) and the master's degree (5\u20136th&nbsp;year), in accordance with the [[Bologna process]]. Historically, [[Specialist degree]] (usually 5 years) is still also granted; it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times.\n\nThe Law of Ukraine ''On Higher Education'' came into force on 6 September 2014.

These policies faced a steep decline in the 1930s, when prominent representatives as well as many others were killed by [[NKVD]] as part of the [[Great Purge]].

The doctrine did not necessarily repress the use of the Ukrainian language, but it required that writers follow a certain style in their works.\n\nIn post-Stalinist times literary activities continued to be somewhat limited under the Communist Party. The most famous figures of Ukrainian post-war Soviet literature were [[Lina Kostenko]], [[Dmytro Pavlychko]], [[Borys Oliynyk (poet)]], [[Ivan Drach]], [[Oles Honchar]], [[Vasyl Stus]], [[Vasyl Symonenko]].\n\nLiterary freedom grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s alongside the decline and collapse of the USSR and the reestablishment of Ukrainian independence in 1991.<ref name=ualit />\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Ukrainian architecture}}\n[[File:80-391-9007 Kyiv St.Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery RB 18.jpg|thumb|right|[[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral]] in [[Kiev]], foremost example of [[Cossack Baroque]] and one of Ukraine's most recognizable landmarks]]\n\nUkrainian architecture includes the motifs and styles that are found in structures built in modern Ukraine, and by [[Ukrainians]] worldwide.\nThese include initial roots which were established in the [[Eastern Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] state of [[Kievan Rus']]. Since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] for several ages Ukrainian architecture was influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture]]. After the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|12th century]], the distinct [[architectural history]] continued in the principalities of [[Galicia-Volhynia]]. During the epoch of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], a new style unique to Ukraine was developed under the western influences of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. After the union with the [[Tsardom of Russia]], many structures in the larger eastern, Russian-ruled area were built in the styles of [[Russian architecture]] of that period, whilst the western [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was developed under [[Architecture of Austria|Austro-Hungarian architectural influences]]. Ukrainian national motifs would finally be used during the period of the [[Soviet Union]] and in modern independent Ukraine.\n\nThe great [[Architecture of Kievan Rus|churches of the Rus']], built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kievan state was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly made of wood, with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of the appearance of pre-Christian pagan Slavic temples.\n\n[[File:Curitiba Parque Tingui.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional Ukrainian village [[Ukrainian architecture|architecture]] in [[Curitiba]], Brazil, which has a large [[Ukrainian diaspora]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brasil.kiev.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=45&layout=blog&Itemid=30&9856877558d17ec206d1a87e99fb1dce=3fab537243dff8dbaf45e8c8619a395b |title=Slavic community in Curitiba |publisher=Brasil.kiev.ua |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203110425/http://www.brasil.kiev.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=45&layout=blog&Itemid=30&9856877558d17ec206d1a87e99fb1dce=3fab537243dff8dbaf45e8c8619a395b |archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref>]]\n\nSeveral examples of these churches survive; however, during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, many were externally rebuilt in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style (see below). Examples include the grand [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|St. Sophia of Kiev]]&nbsp;\u2013 the year 1017 is the earliest record of foundation laid, [[Church of the Saviour at Berestove]] \u2013 built from 1113 to 1125 and [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Church]], circa 12th-century. All can still be found in the Ukrainian capital. Several buildings were reconstructed during the late-19th century, including the [[:File:WladimirWolynsk Uspenski Cathedral.jpeg|Assumption Cathedral]] in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], built in 1160 and reconstructed in 1896\u20131900, the [[:File:AX Chernigiv Pyatnitska Church.jpg|Paraskevi church in Chernihiv]], built in 1201 with reconstruction done in the late 1940s, and the [[Golden Gate (Kiev)|Golden gates in Kiev]], built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982. The latter's reconstruction was criticised by some art and architecture historians as a revivalist fantasy. Unfortunately little secular or [[vernacular architecture]] of [[Kievan Rus']] has survived.\n\nAs Ukraine became increasingly integrated into the [[Russian Empire]], Russian architects had the opportunity to realise their projects in the picturesque landscape that many Ukrainian cities and regions offered. [[St. Andrew's Church of Kiev]] (1747\u20131754), built by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], is a notable example of [[Baroque]] architecture, and its location on top of the Kievan mountain made it a recognisable monument of the city. An equally notable contribution of Rasetrelli was the [[Mariyinsky Palace]], which was built to be a summer residence to Russian Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]. During the reign of the last [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman of Ukraine]], [[Kirill Razumovsky]], many of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]'s towns such as [[Hlukhiv]], [[Baturyn]] and [[Koselets]] had grandiose projects built by [[Andrey Kvasov]]. Russia eventually conquered the south of Ukraine and Crimea, and renamed them as [[New Russia]]. New cities such as [[Mykolayiv|Nikolayev]], [[Odessa]], [[Kherson]] and [[Sevastopol]] were founded. These would contain notable examples of Imperial Russian architecture.\n\n[[File:Kryvyi Rih - apartment building2.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a [[Khrushchyovka]] in [[Kryvyi Rih]]. Such apartments were built throughout Ukraine during Soviet times and are found in every major city.]]\n\nIn 1934, the capital of Soviet Ukraine moved from [[Kharkiv]] to [[Kiev]]. Previously, the city was seen as only a regional centre, hence received little attention. All of that was to change, at great price. The first examples of [[Stalinist architecture]] were already showing, and, in light of the official policy, a new city was to be built on top of the old one. This meant that much-admired examples such as the [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] were destroyed. Even the St. Sophia Cathedral was under threat. Also, the Second World War contributed to the wreckage. After the war, a new project for the reconstruction of central Kiev transformed [[Khreshchatyk]] avenue into a notable example of Stalinism in Architecture. However, by 1955, the new politics of architecture once again stopped the project from fully being realised.\n\nThe task for modern Ukrainian architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. An example of modern Ukrainian architecture is the reconstruction and renewal of the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] in central Kiev. Despite the limit set by narrow space within the plaza, the engineers were able to blend together the uneven landscape, and use underground space for a new shopping centre.\n\nA major project, which may take up most of the 21st century, is the construction of the Kiev City-Centre on the [[Rybalskyi Peninsula]], which, when finished, will include a dense skyscraper park amid the picturesque landscape of the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]].<ref name=gradsovet_05_12_07>{{cite web |url=http://archunion.com.ua/sovet-2005/gradsovet_05_12_07.shtml |script-title=ru:\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u2013 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0433. \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0434 \u0434\u043e 2020\u0433., \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0438\u043b\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043c, \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e-\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u044b, \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0434\u0440. \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u044b\u0431\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435, \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d. |trans-title=Architects of Kiev \u2013 Development rationale for changes in the general development plan of Kiev up to 2020 relating to the construction of residential and office buildings with underground parking, hospitality-office complexes, shopping centres, social and cultural facilities, multi-functional entertainment complexes, etc. on Rybalsky island, Podolsky district. |website=archunion.com.ua |date=7 December 2005 |accessdate=8 January 2014 |language=Russian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510032158/http://archunion.com.ua/sovet-2005/gradsovet_05_12_07.shtml |archivedate=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Ukraine}}\n[[File:Cossack Mamay 1st half of 19th c (4).jpg|thumb|[[Cossack Mamay]] playing a [[kobza]]]]\n\nMusic is a major part of Ukrainian culture, with a long history and many influences. From traditional [[folk music]], to [[classical music|classical]] and [[modern rock]], Ukraine has produced several internationally recognised musicians including [[Kirill Karabits]], [[Okean Elzy]] and [[Ruslana]]. Elements from traditional Ukrainian folk music made their way into Western music and even into modern [[jazz]].\n\nUkrainian music sometimes presents a perplexing mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony. The most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals.\n\n[[File:\u041b\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u041c\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|[[Mykola Lysenko]] is widely considered to be the father of Ukrainian classical music.]]\n\nDuring the Baroque period, music was an important discipline for those that had received a higher education in Ukraine. It had a place of considerable importance in the curriculum of the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. Much of the nobility was well versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as (Mazepa, Paliy, Holovatyj, Sirko) being accomplished players of the [[kobza]], [[bandura]] or [[torban]].\n\nThe first dedicated musical academy was set up in Hlukhiv, Ukraine in 1738 and students were taught to sing, play violin and bandura from manuscripts. As a result, many of the earliest composers and performers within the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian, having been born or educated in Hlukhiv, or had been closely associated with this music school.\nSee: [[Dmytro Bortniansky]], [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Artemy Vedel|Artemiy Vedel]].\n\nUkrainian classical music falls into three distinct categories defined by whether the composer was of Ukrainian ethnicity living in Ukraine, a composer of non-Ukrainian ethnicity who was born or at some time was a citizen of Ukraine, or an ethnic Ukrainian living outside of Ukraine within the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. The music of these three groups differs considerably, as do the audiences for whom they cater.\n\n[[File:Rapid Trident 2014 06.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian dance ''[[hopak]]'']]\n\nSince the mid-1960s, Western-influenced pop music has been growing in popularity in Ukraine. Folk singer and harmonium player [[Mariana Sadovska]] is prominent. Ukrainian pop and folk music arose with the international popularity of groups and performers like [[Vopli Vidoplyasova]], [[Dakh Daughters]], [[Dakha Brakha]], [[Ivan Dorn]] and [[Okean Elzy]].\n\nModern musical culture of Ukraine is presented both with academic and entertainment music. Ukraine has five conservatories, 6 opera houses, five houses of Chamber Music, Philharmony in all regional centers.\n\nUkraine hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017]].\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{Main|Cinema of Ukraine}}\nUkraine has had an influence on the history of the cinema. Ukrainian directors [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], often cited as one of the most important early Soviet filmmakers, as well as being a pioneer of [[Soviet montage theory]], [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]], and [[Sergei Parajanov]], Armenian film director and artist who made significant contributions to Ukrainian, Armenian and Georgian cinema. He invented his own cinematic style, Ukrainian poetic cinema, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism.\n\n[[File:Muratova.jpg|upright|thumbnail|[[Kira Muratova]]]]\n\nOther important directors including [[Kira Muratova]], [[Sergei Loznitsa]], [[Myroslav Slaboshpytskyi]], [[Larisa Shepitko]], [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], [[Leonid Bykov]], [[Yuri Ilyenko]], [[Leonid Osyka]], [[Ihor Podolchak]] with his [[Delirium (2013 film)|Delirium]] and [[Maryna Vroda]]. Many Ukrainian actors have achieved international fame and critical success, including: [[Vera Kholodnaya]], [[Bohdan Stupka]], [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mila Kunis]].\n\nDespite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of European and Russian influence. Ukrainian producers are active in international co-productions and Ukrainian actors, directors and crew feature regularly in Russian (Soviet in past) films. Also successful films have been based on Ukrainian people, stories or events, including [[Battleship Potemkin]], [[Man with a Movie Camera]], [[Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom]], [[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]].\n\nUkrainian State Film Agency owns [[National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre]], film copying laboratory and archive, takes part in hosting of the [[Odessa International Film Festival]], and [[Molodist]] is the only one [[FIAPF]] accredited International Film Festival held in Ukraine; competition program is devoted to student, first short and first full feature films from all over the world.

However, in 2010 Freedom House perceived \"negative trends in Ukraine\".\n\n[[Kiev]] dominates the media sector in Ukraine: the ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' is Ukraine's leading English-language newspaper. National [[List of newspapers in Ukraine|newspapers]] ''[[Den (newspaper)|Den]]'', ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli|Mirror Weekly]]'', tabloids, such as ''[[The Ukrainian Week]]'' or ''[[Focus (Ukrainian magazine)|Focus]]'' (Russian), and television and radio are largely based there, although [[Lviv]] is also a significant national media centre. The National News Agency of Ukraine, [[Ukrinform]] was founded here in 1918. The Ukraine publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover. [[Sanoma]] publishes Ukrainian editions of such magazines as ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Harpers Bazaar]]'' and ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]''. [[BBC Ukrainian]] started its broadcasts in 1992.\n\nUkrainians listen to radio programming, such as [[Radio Ukraine]] or [[Radio Liberty]], largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day. Several television channels operate, and many websites are popular.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Andriy Shevchenko goal celebration Euro 2012 vs Sweden.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian footballer [[Andriy Shevchenko]] celebrates a goal against Sweden at Euro 2012]]\nUkraine greatly benefited from the Soviet emphasis on [[physical education]].

The expedition was divided into a Northern Party led by Stefansson, and a Southern Party led by [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R M.

At this time the possible existence of large undiscovered land masses, comparable to the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic islands]] or even a small continent, was scientifically plausible. The approach of the Northern Party, besides simply going out and looking for land, was a program of through-ice depth soundings to map the edge of the continental shelf. Meteorological, magnetic, and marine biological investigations were also planned.\n\n==Southern Party==\nThe objective of the Southern Party was scientific documentation of the geography, geology, resources, wildlife, and people of the [[Mackenzie River]] delta and adjacent regions of Canada between [[Cape Parry]] and the [[Kent Peninsula]], for about {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} inland, and southern and eastern [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]].

Stefansson promptly purchased a small [[schooner]], the ''North Star'', reconstituted the Northern Party with local hires and resumed exploring. Only one of the fourteen ''Karluk'' survivors rejoined the expedition. The expedition purchased another ship, the ''Polar Bear'', in 1915.

Alternatively, ''Bunnicula'' is the main title of the first book in the series, published by [[Atheneum Books]] in April 1979.<ref name=isfdb/> The series consists of seven books, with the latest published in 2006.<ref name=isfdb/> Deborah Howe died in 1978, months before the book first saw print. \n\nThe story is centered on the Monroe family and their pets and is told from the perspective of their dog Harold. The Monroes find a bunny at the theater where they were watching a Dracula film. Because of this, they name him Bunnicula. Their cat Chester, however, is convinced Bunnicula is a vampire and attempts to get Harold (the dog) to help save the Monroes from the perceived menace.\n\nA 1982 animated TV special (from [[Ruby-Spears]]) by the same name was created based on the first book and aired on the ''[[ABC Weekend Special]]''. The animated special deviated heavily from the novels and actively depicted Bunnicula using vampiric powers, which did not occur in the novels.\n\nThe books in the Bunnicula series are 1. ''[[Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery]] (1979);''. 2. ''Howliday Inn; 3. The Celery Stalks at Midnight;'' 4. ''Nighty-Nightmare'' (1987); 5. ''Return to Howliday Inn (''1993); 6. ''Bunnicula Strikes Again!'' (1999); 7. ''Bunnicula Meets Edgar Allan Crow'' (2006). \n\nFollowing the end of the ''Bunnicula'' series, James Howe began a spin-off series called ''Tales from the House of Bunnicula'', which is \"written\" by Howie, the dachshund puppy introduced into the series in ''Howliday Inn''. There is also a series called ''Bunnicula and Friends: Ready To Read''. This is a series of six picture books about the adventures of the characters from the stories. These books are aimed at beginner readers.\n\nAn [[Bunnicula (TV series)|animated series]] that is a loose adaptation of ''Bunnicula'' began airing on [[Cartoon Network]] and on [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] on February 6, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idlehands1.blogspot.com/2015/06/boomerang-presents-bunnicula-be-cool.html|title=Idle Hands: Boomerang Presents Bunnicula, Be Cool Scooby Doo & Wabbit \u2013 A Looney Tunes Production|first=Paul|last=Nicholasi|date=29 June 2015|website=idlehands1.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/06/29/turner-inks-original-wb-content-deal-for-boomerang/|title=Turner inks original WB content deal for Boomerang|website=kidscreen.com}}</ref>\n\n==Characters throughout the series==\n* '''Bunnicula'''\n\nThe titular character, a rabbit with strange and unusual eating habits and vampiric qualities, but otherwise harmless, Bunnicula came to the Monroe household on a dark, stormy night. Toby found him in the theater, which at the time was showing ''Dracula'', and brought him home, where Mrs. Monroe brought up the clever name ''Bunnicula''. A note was placed with Bunnicula when he was found, written in [[Russian language|Russian]], reading \"Please take care of my baby.\" It is unknown who left Bunnicula in the theater or wrote the note, but the letter was written in a dialect that nobody except Harold could read.\n\nHe is subjected to many murder attempts by Chester, who thinks that the rabbit would eventually become [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]. However, his indestructible stature proves to Chester that he cannot be killed. Due to his young age, Bunnicula cannot talk but he can wink and cry. He does exhibit the unusual ability to get in and out of his cage without using the door and initially opens the refrigerator by himself. Instead of a rabbit's [[buck teeth]], Bunnicula has [[fang]]s, which enable him to bite vegetables and suck the juice out of them, similar to the method by which [[Dracula]] dines, leaving them ghostly white. Bunnicula is put on a blender-based vegetable juice diet. Then he escapes his cage and runs off into the night leaving a trail of white vegetables in his wake. Chester is convinced they must be destroyed by using a stake through their hearts. Chester learned from previous mistakes and chose toothpicks as his weapon of choice. One of Bunnicula's apparent victims tries to sneak up on Harold at the end of the book, and it is left ambiguous as to whether or not Chester was playing a prank on Harold, though Chester seemed to be oblivious to the thumping noise the vegetable was making, or if this was indeed an actual attempt at an attack by a vampire vegetable.\n\nBunnicula eventually sires a litter of offspring with a rabbit owned by Pete's best friend Kyle as part of a project for their scout troop. At least one of the offspring is stated by Pete as looking identical to Bunnicula, and was briefly mentioned in ''Bunnicula meets Edger Allan Crow.'' He was named Sonnicula due to his being the son of Bunnicula and carrying an identical appearance to his father. Sonnicula never made any direct appearances in the series, being referred to only twice in passing during the events in the series. In ''Nighty-Nightmare'', Chester's story implies that Bunnicula's parents were vampire rabbits who were created by a lonely vampire, though Chester may have made the entire story up as implied by revelations at the end of the novel. However, Chester seems personally convinced that the story is a complete truth at the time that he tells it and tells it in such a way that it resembles a ghost story, one that entrances the other characters until the truth about the subject that brought up the story is revealed. This is the closest there has ever been to an origin story for Bunnicula and his apparent powers, whether or not it was concocted entirely in Chester's imagination is never explained. The author has never produced an actual origin for him or his abilities, nor has he ever explicitly confirmed or denied whether or not Bunnicula is vampiric outside of occasional hints in the novels by way of Bunnicula's odd abilities and physical features. In the animated special, Bunnicula's name is written in the note itself, to avoid having the Monroes name him. The note is one of the few aspects of the novel to carry over into the animated special, as Bunnicula is found near a processing plant in the special. When Bunnicula goes into his vampiric form, he sprouts bat wings under his arms and his eyes turn yellow. His vampire powers include flight, hypnosis, levitation, and telekinesis. Chester's murder attempts do not take place in the special and he ultimately decides that the idea that Bunnicula is a vampire is \"ridiculous\", something which doesn't occur in the novels, which has a touch of irony since Bunnicula is blatantly shown using his vampiric powers and Chester was correct in his belief of Bunnicula's true nature.\n* '''Harold'''\n\nThe main character, Harold, despite Bunnicula being the title-bearing character, is an old, scruffy and loving dog under the Monroes' care. He narrates the books, sometimes claiming he would not even write the books if it wasn't for Bunnicula. He enjoys his life with the Monroe family, particularly with Toby, always being a diligent and loyal pet. His longtime friends are Chester, Bunnicula, and Howie, who also live in the Monroe household. Harold has a strong affection for [[chocolate]] [[cupcake]]s, as well as other typical snacks such as [[cheese]] [[Cracker (food)|crackers]] and [[fudge]], despite the potential risk of [[Theobromine poisoning#In animals|food poisoning due to chocolate consumption]]. He is a mongrel, but is part-[[Russian wolfhound]] and has pride in his bloodlines. He says that this is why he is able to recognize an obscure dialect of [[Transylvania]]n writing (albeit in a [[Cyrillic]] script as per the 1982 cartoon special) in the first book. In the first book, Harold sees Bunnicula for the first time, as well as seeing a bunny for the first time. While Bunnicula's vampiric activities do scare him a little, he holds no grudges against the bunny, even befriending him. Unluckily, Chester, who has an outrageously vivid imagination and a narrow mind, thinks Bunnicula is a ''real'' vampire and forces Harold to assist him to kill the rabbit. All attempts fail, and finally, Harold goes against Chester's crazy attempts to do away with Bunnicula. Throughout the series, Harold is portrayed as good-hearted, sensible, and kind. Harold remains unconvinced of Chester's belief that Bunnicula is a vampire regardless of some actual evidence that may support Chester's theories, however briefly seen or referenced. Despite everything, Harold never stops thinking of Chester as his best friend.\n* '''Chester'''\nThe highly imaginative, prideful [[Tabby cat|orange tabby]] who loves good literature and milk. He was given to Mr. Monroe as a birthday present, and the name \"Chester\" was derived from [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Ever since Bunnicula's arrival, Chester becomes increasingly convinced that the bunny could be a threat (\"Today vegetables, tomorrow the world!\" he exclaims in reference to Bunnicula's \"[[Hegemony|diabolical plans]]\" when trying to convince Harold of his belief that Bunnicula is a vampire), and becomes singlemindedly obsessed with controlling him. For a long time, out of jealousy Chester really wanted to kill or at least disable Bunnicula and has done the latter by drinking the bunny's vegetable juice or spreading garlic around to contain him. He once tried to kill Bunnicula by using a [[steak]] (not a ''stake''), a mistake he prefers not to dwell on. Another time, he led Harold and Howie on a chase around Centerville, \"[[murder]]ing\" [[Vampire pumpkins and watermelons|vampire vegetables]], which were, in fact, the leftover meals from Bunnicula. An apparent 'survivor' of the purge Chester leads them on appears to try sneaking up on Harold at the climax of ''The Celery Stalks at Midnight'', only to be spotted by Harold, who then asks Chester for a toothpick in order to 'kill' the offending object. It is never explicitly stated if Chester was playing a prank using one of the leftover vegetables that they hadn't \"destroyed\" or if this was an actual attempt at an attack by one of Bunnicula's 'minions'. Harold and Howie disagree with Chester's methods, as Chester is often paranoid. Harold mentions in ''Nighty-Nightmare'' that Chester's constant reading and watching horror movies have given him \"a reality leak that requires constant attention\". He usually calls both of his canine friends \"dolts\", \"[[simpleton]]s\", or \"[[idiot]]s\". He is known not to apologize for his errors that greatly affect Harold, instead referring to them as \"a slight misinterpretation in the facts.\" Despite having a tense relationship with Bunnicula, deep down he accepts him as one of the family, and in the final two books of the series, ''Bunnicula Strikes Again!'' and ''Bunnicula meets Edgar Allan Crow''', becomes friends with Bunnicula, claiming that by knowing the facts about vampires best, he can protect Bunnicula from himself.\n* '''Howie'''\nThe carefree and sometimes slightly dim [[Dachshund]] puppy who was adopted by the Monroes from Chateau Bow-Wow, making him the newest member of the family. He was the [[runt]] of the [[litter]] and his parents, Howard and Heather, were valuable long-haired Dachshunds (whom Chester secretly suspected of being werewolves). Howie's somewhat eerie howling has not changed the cat's mind on the matter. Howie usually does not understand the seriousness of matters, thinking that murdering vampire vegetables is a game and chasing Bunnicula is a race. He did not even know what a vampire was when Chester informed him, though he does not think Bunnicula is a danger. For an unknown reason, he calls Harold and Chester \"Uncle Harold\" and \"Pop\", respectively; while Harold is perfectly comfortable with his nickname, Chester is still not used to his own. Howie's hobbies include chewing things, eating and chasing cars (which he's not allowed to do). Despite his boldness, Howie was a bit unnerved by scary stories at first, then outgrew it after the pets' adventures in ''Bunnicula Strikes Again!'' Later, he decided he wanted to try writing too, and his first drafts turn out to be pretty good for a puppy's work.\n* '''Robert Monroe'''\nHe is the husband of Ann Monroe and the father of Pete and Toby. He works as a college professor of literature, and he often used Chester to practice his lectures, which enabled Chester to read as well. In the animated special, he is described by Harold as being a scientist, rather than a college professor, and works at the plant where Bunnicula is discovered.\n* '''Ann Monroe'''\nShe is Robert's wife and the mother of Pete and Toby. She thought up of the name Bunnicula by combining \"Bunny\" and \"Dracula\". She had previously tried to name him \"Bun-Bun\" and \"Fluffy\". Names like this seem to be a habit with her because Harold and Chester were both called \"Fluffy\" for a short time. In the books, she is a lawyer, but her profession is unmentioned in the animated special. She also does not name Bunnicula in the special, as the name is included in the note they find with him.\n* '''Peter \"Pete\" Monroe'''\nThe oldest of two boys who slacks off often. He's often selfish, and usually bullies his younger brother Toby and the pets, except for Bunnicula. Harold and Chester avoid him, Chester being largely indifferent, but Howie finds him intriguing, mainly because of the scary books he reads. The space under his bed is very messy, and in addition to keeping a stuffed animal named Puddikins under it for emergency hugs, many other stuff has turned up such as Oreos, dirty socks and a notebook that Harold gives to Howie.\n* '''Toby Monroe'''\nThe younger brother, and much more dignified and kinder than Pete. He likes to share his snacks with Harold during his late night readings and is adored by Harold, Chester, Bunnicula, and Howie. He cares a lot for the pets, and was known to slip pieces of food to Harold at dinner. Toby's family found Bunnicula abandoned at a movie theatre one night on an outing to the movies. Toby's family adopted Bunnicula after the family brought him home.\n* '''Sonnicula'''\nThe son of Bunnicula. He looked just like Bunnicula and was born during ''Nighty-Nightmare''. His mother was a rabbit brought by Pete's best friend Kyle. It was not said whether he inherited his father's vampiric appetite, but he sleeps during the day, just like Bunnicula. In the last book, he was adopted by Miles Tanner.\n* '''Miles Tanner \"M.T. Graves\"'''\nThe author of the \"Fleshcrawlers\" series, of which Peter is a fan. He lived temporarily at the Monroes' house when Peter won a contest allowing it. He shows interest in Bunnicula and carried his pet, Edgar Allan Crow, around. He had a pale face, long curly hair, a black cape, and was very attached to a black bag. The black bag was thought to contain Bunnicula (by Chester, of course) when Bunnicula escaped. The pets opened the bag, greatly embarrassing Miles Tanner in front of the company. The contents were stuffed animals. Miles admitted that they were to train him to overcome his fear of animals. He said he was scared of dogs, cats, and people. He wanted a rabbit because a rabbit never barked at him before. Therefore, he wants Bunnicula. In the end, he adopts Sonnicula, saying \"It won't be Bunnicula, but it will be fine.\" The Monroes are greatly relieved to still keep their amazing pet. In a letter, Miles says he will marry Ms. Pickles, Peter's school librarian and they shall be neighbors. The Monroe pets changed his mind towards animals.\n* '''Edgar Allan Crow'''\nA crow Miles adopted, found on his doorstep when he was a wounded baby. Edgar gives Miles company and Miles has said he can't do anything without him. Edgar, however, wants to go back to his own kind. He was seen courting another crow in the Monroes' place. Edgar learns to write and sends an e-mail to the Monroes. Edgar Allan Crow's name is a parody of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].\n* '''Mrs. Marjorie Pickles Tanner'''\nPete and Kyle's English teacher, who is also a fan of M.T. Graves and in fact his wife. She first met Tanner when she brought over a cake as an excuse to meet him before he came to visit Peter's school. Soon after the Monroes received a letter from Tanner announcing his engagement to Pete's teacher.\n* '''Ms. Kipper'''\nThe principal of Pete and Kyle's school.\n* '''Kyle'''\nPete's best friend. His rabbit is the mother of Sonnicula.\n\n==List of books==\n\n===''Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery''===\n{{main|Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery}}\n\nThe first ''Bunnicula'' story was written by Deborah (who died before the book was published) and James Howe, illustrated by Alan Daniel, and published by [[Atheneum Books]] in 1979 (98 pages). It has been reissued many times, perhaps all with the original illustrations.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/bunnicula-a-rabbit-tale-of-mystery/oclc/4498339/editions?start_edition=1&sd=desc&referer=di&se=yr&qt=sort_yr_desc&editionsView=true&fq= \"Formats and Editions of Bunnicula: a rabbit tale of mystery\" (newest first)].

Retrieved 2015-01-20.</ref>\n\n===''Howliday Inn''===\nWhen the Monroe family decides to leave for a vacation, they send Harold and Chester off to a kennel called Chateau Bow-Wow (A special boarding house for special cats and dogs). There, they meet the other inhabitants of the kennel: A frustrated poodle named Louise, an athletic bulldog, a mutt named Taxi, a crazy cat named Lyle, a flirtatious poodle named Georgette, and two dachshunds named Heather and Howard, who Chester is certain are werewolves. The owner of the kennel, Dr. Greenbriar, is taking the week off and the other staff, an aspiring vet named Jill and a comic-book reader named Harrison who hopes to make a million bucks before he is twenty-one, are overworked. Because they are overworked, they make a lot of mistakes, especially Jill. These mistakes include feeding the animals late and temporarily misplacing Chester's file. Harrison will later use this tendency to forget things to his advantage. Tensions are high between the two as a result of stress. In the midst of adapting to their temporary new lives, a mystery soon unfolds when Louise goes missing.\n\nAlthough the kennel workers decide she ran away, Chester becomes certain that foul play was involved. Just when he seems to have solved the mystery, Chester to vanishes. When investigating, Harold overhears Harrison, one of the kennel workers, reporting that he tested Chester's cat food and that it was laced with poison. Horrified, Harold attempts to continue Chester's work and solve the mystery. One evening, Harold finds the message \"Help Howls out now!\" scratched into his dog dish. Chester mysteriously returns later, then rounds up Harold, Taxi, and Lyle. He leads them to find Harrison attempting to capture Heather and Howard. The animals raise the alarm and Harrison is caught by the other kennel workers. Chester tells Harold later that Harrison caught wind that one of the animals in the shelter was very valuable. He first kidnapped Louise and then Chester thinking that it could have been them, but found out that it was the dachshunds, who were actually rare wire-haired dachshunds. He also learned that Heather was going to have puppies, making him even more determined to capture them all to get rich. When Dr. Greenbriar and Jill hear the dogs barking and find, first Lousie at Harrison's house with Max and Georgette, who sneaked out to find her, barking outside and then Harrison trying to capture the dachshunds with the other animals attacking him, he is tried and sentenced. The sentence is to go to university and pay for it by working at the zoo. When the Monroe family arrives after their vacation, they reveal that they're also adopting the runt of the dachshund litter, which they name Howie\u2014Pete named him this because the puppy's father's name was Howard.\n\n===''The Celery Stalks at Midnight''===\nBunnicula has gone missing and Chester begins to fear for the town again. This time, he believes that the vegetables that Bunnicula sucks dry could return as the rabbit's vampire slaves, which he will then use as an army to take over the town. Armed with a box of toothpicks to stab through the \"hearts\" of vegetables, he, Harold, and Howie set off to search the neighborhood for white vegetables. After some success, they witness Toby and Pete wearing dark robes and holding a group of frightened children prisoner. The pets fear that Bunnicula has begun to take over people as well and run to the nearby school, which is full of what they suspect are the rabbit's servants.\n\nAfter causing much mayhem (including Chester destroying a large white carrot, which he believes is the head of the [[undead]] vegetables), they are caught by the Monroes. It is revealed that there was a carnival at the school that day, and Toby and Pete and the other children were rehearsing for a play they were going to put on. The \"carrot\" that Chester destroyed was actually a carrot cake, shaped like a carrot and covered in cream cheese. Finally, Bunnicula was found at the school, entered in the pet show. The pets find out that Bunnicula spent the previous night in the garage, which was accidentally left open, which meant he did indeed leave the house to feed on vegetables.\n\nIn the end, [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s \"[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]\" is parodied when Chester finds an artichoke heart under his favorite chair. After telling Chester there's nothing to worry about and trying to fall asleep, Harold hears a faint thumping.... he opens his eyes to find the vegetable in question right in front of his nose, which leads him to ask if Chester has a toothpick handy. It is left ambiguous as to whether or not this is a prank by Chester or an actual attempt at a vampiric attack on Harold by the artichoke.\n\n===''Nighty Nightmare''===\nA.K.A. ''The Return Of Bunnicula''. While at their lakeside retreat of Boggy Lake and fishing with Harold, Mr. Monroe apparently begins to have a [[mid-life crisis]], and wants to do something exciting while they are there. They decide to go camping out in the woods; Harold only likes the idea because of [[s'mores]], and Chester is skeptical about going out due to it being the eve of [[Saint George's Day]], the one night of the year where evil monsters and spirits come out to prey. Upon going out into the woods, they meet two men; Bud (who constantly holds a [[knife]] out in plain sight for some reason) and Spud (described by Harold as having a [[potato]]-shaped head), along with their dog Teufel ([[German language|German]] for \"[[Devil]]\"), nicknamed \"Dawg\", a bulldog with a [[scar]] on his face and a long ribbon of drool constantly hanging from his lower lip. That night, they go out for a walk, and Dawg leads Harold, Chester, and Howie away from his masters and the Monroes in order to show them something \"neat\", getting them lost in the woods in the process.\n\nChester begins to suspect that Bud and Spud may plan to [[murder]] the Monroes and that Dawg is luring them away in order to keep them from interfering, and Harold slowly begins to believe him. Once they reach a house right in the middle of the woods, Chester tells a story about Bunnicula's origin in an attempt to lull Dawg to sleep and allow himself, Harold, and Howie to escape; he claims that Bunnicula is the child of two rabbits who were artificially transformed into vampires by a lonely vampiric scientist named Diabolicus, and that three humans that he turned into vampires live in the house right before them right now, continuing his work. While the plan is successful, Harold, Howie, and even Chester fall asleep along with Dawg, and awaken shortly before dawn due to the rain and constant [[nightmares]], presumably brought on by Chester's story, which is left open to interpretation by the end of the book as to whether or not Chester made the whole thing up or if it was based on actual 'fact' within the canon of the series, though Chester's belief that the house is an 'American house of Dr. E.A.D' which lead to the story, is proven to be mistaken by story's end.\n\nAfter they return to the Monroes' camp, only to find it trashed and deserted, Dawg reveals that the house they visited is his own, and that Bud and Spud (real names Buford and Spalding) live there with their mother. Buford is revealed to be an architect while Spalding is a practicing lawyer. The Monroes also stayed the night with them in order to get out of the rain, and are relieved that Harold, Howie, and Chester are unharmed. Bud and Spud give their mother a baby [[skunk]] they caught last night as an early [[birthday]] present, and everyone sings campfire songs while eating s'mores; all except for Chester, who sulks in a corner. It is also revealed that Pete had been using Bunnicula in a rabbit breeding project he had been working on and one of the baby rabbits looked like Bunnicula (indicating that it too might be a vampire rabbit).\n\n===''Return to Howliday Inn''===\nThe Monroe family again leaves Harold, Chester, and Howie at Chateau Bow-Wow. The pets quickly notice differences, including a new group of animals staying there (a weasel, two cats named Felony and Miss Demeanor, a sad Great Dane named Hamlet, a pair of homesick dogs, and a parrot named Ditto). Howie is thrilled to be at his birthplace; Chester is none too pleased. Soon, however, all of the animals are in for a shock\u2014They hear a female dog named Rosebud calling from the other side of the fence. When they dig at the dirt around the fence, they find a few bones and a dog collar. Rosebud tells them that she discovered a horrid secret about Chataeu Bow-Wow which sealed her fate and warns the animals to escape. Undaunted, Chester begins to investigate.\n\nAfter listening in on Ditto, he hears her repeated \"6, 1, 1, 1, 5\". Later, she repeats what appears to be the entire sequence of numbers: \"6, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2\". Upon hearing this, Felony and Miss Demeanor are thrilled. When asked, they reluctantly reveal that they wanted to sneak into the kennel worker's building to steal better food and believed that the code would get them in. Shortly after, a tearful kennel worker takes Hamlet into the building. Georgette is brought to Chataeu Bow-Wow and tells the animals the true story of Rosebud: She was alive and well and back with her owners. The bones were chicken bones and her collar had been lost prior. The animals enter the building and find Hamlet, who tells them that his old owner left him there a long time ago. He was now set to be put to sleep. Chester finds his owner's new address and they set off to bring Hamlet there. The new address turns out to be a nursing home, one which does not allow animals. The pets break in and in the chaos, it becomes clear that the patients love the arrival of the animals, who remind them of their old pets. Hamlet finds his old owner, and it is revealed that the owner was a ventriloquist, explaining how Hamlet caused \"Rosebud\" to speak. Using ventriloquism of their own, the pets and patients convince the staff of the nursing home to allow Hamlet to stay. When Harold, Chester, and Howie are picked up at the end, they fool the Monroes with the ventriloquism tricks they picked up.\n\n===''Bunnicula Strikes Again!''===\nChester has once again come to the crazy conclusion that Bunnicula is a threatening vampire. The cat starts drinking the rabbit's juice in the daytime so Bunnicula will die of starvation. Harold and Howie are upset, but once again Chester insists this is all for the best. One night, Harold notices Bunnicula crying while singing him a lullaby. Chester thinks he misses his mother, and in the next few days he leads the two dogs to search for her. This is unsuccessful, as she very likely is not around town. When Bunnicula becomes increasingly ill, either due to lack of food or to his lack of parental love, he is taken to the veterinarian, Chester, however, escapes and gets to the theater first. Before he can actually kill Bunnicula, the demolition starts, crushing both the cat and the rabbit under rubble. Harold and Howie manage to alert the Monroes and the other witnesses, and together they dig through the piles of fragments. They find Chester in a weakened state, but Bunnicula miraculously is completely unharmed. Chester comforts the rabbit, finally claiming that his attempts to murder Bunnicula were futile and that because he survived the demolition without a scratch, he is 'indestructible.' In the end, the Monroes return to their normal lives, and Bunnicula is at last happy because Chester has accepted him as one of the family.\n\n===''Bunnicula Meets Edgar Allan Crow''===\nA.K.A. ''Bunnicula vs The Monster Raven''. Pete writes to the author of his (and Howie's) favorite series, FleshCrawlers. He visits the Monroe household and stays in the guestroom, bringing with him his favorite pet crow, Edgar Allan Crow. Everyone is thrilled, except for Chester, who insists that the author, M.T. Graves, is suspicious. He notes that something bad always happens to the pets in Graves's books, and when he wrote back to Pete, he seemed especially interested in spending some \"quality time with the pets,\" particularly Bunnicula, whom Chester has now befriended. Harold and Howie aren't convinced, but Chester feels certain that there is a secret society amongst the crows, and Edgar is a messenger sent to help Graves transform Bunnicula into a bat. When Bunnicula escapes, the entire party follows him to catch him, and Harold and Howie begin to think that Chester may have been right. M.T. Graves is very careful about a black bag, and when Bunnicula is not found, Chester believes he is trapped in the bag. Harold dumps the bag, only to embarrass Graves in front of everyone because it was filled with stuffed animals. In the end, M.T. Graves tells them that he was a nervous boy when he was younger and was afraid of dogs and cats, so he figured he would stay at the Monroe's house so that he could conquer his phobia. Graves falls in love with Pete's school librarian and marries her. Graves releases Edgar because Edgar fell in love with another crow. Then he adopts Sonnicula, Bunnicula's son. After Graves left, Pete got a letter that said he was inspired to write two books from visiting the Monroes: one called ''Quoth the Raven'' about his relationship with Edgar, and another called ''The Excellently Weird Adventures of Charlie the Cat from Galaxy Nine'', inspired by Chester, who was less than thrilled to discover he was one of them, as he put it, \"psycho creatures from M.T. Graves' demented novels.\"\n\nJames Howe is mentioned when Pete says that all of the other kids wanted to choose authors like [[J.K. Rowling]] or James Howe.\n\n==Tales from the House of Bunnicula==\nA spin-off series centering around the writings of Howie, which involve Howie encountering a supernatural or extraterrestrial creature or event with his trusty friend, Delilah. The books also contain ''notes'' that Howie receives from Harold or Chester.

Alternatively, ''Bunnicula'' is the main title of the first book in the series, published by [[Atheneum Books]] in April 1979.<ref name=isfdb/> The series consists of seven books, with the latest published in 2006.<ref name=isfdb/> Deborah Howe died in 1978, months before the book first saw print. \n\nThe story is centered on the Monroe family and their pets and is told from the perspective of their dog Harold. The Monroes find a bunny at the theater where they were watching a Dracula film. Because of this, they name him Bunnicula. Their cat Chester, however, is convinced Bunnicula is a vampire and attempts to get Harold (the dog) to help save the Monroes from the perceived menace.\n\nA 1982 animated TV special (from [[Ruby-Spears]]) by the same name was created based on the first book and aired on the ''[[ABC Weekend Special]]''. The animated special deviated heavily from the novels and actively depicted Bunnicula using vampiric powers, which did not occur in the novels.\n\nThe books in the Bunnicula series are 1. ''[[Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery]] (1979);''. 2. ''Howliday Inn; 3. The Celery Stalks at Midnight;'' 4. ''Nighty-Nightmare'' (1987); 5. ''Return to Howliday Inn (''1993); 6. ''Bunnicula Strikes Again!'' (1999); 7. ''Bunnicula Meets Edgar Allan Crow'' (2006). \n\nFollowing the end of the ''Bunnicula'' series, James Howe began a spin-off series called ''Tales from the House of Bunnicula'', which is \"written\" by Howie, the dachshund puppy introduced into the series in ''Howliday Inn''. There is also a series called ''Bunnicula and Friends: Ready To Read''. This is a series of six picture books about the adventures of the characters from the stories. These books are aimed for beginner readers.\n\nAn [[Bunnicula (TV series)|animated series]] that is a loose adaptation of ''Bunnicula'' began airing on [[Cartoon Network]] and on [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] on February 6, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idlehands1.blogspot.com/2015/06/boomerang-presents-bunnicula-be-cool.html|title=Idle Hands: Boomerang Presents Bunnicula, Be Cool Scooby Doo & Wabbit \u2013 A Looney Tunes Production|first=Paul|last=Nicholasi|date=29 June 2015|website=idlehands1.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/06/29/turner-inks-original-wb-content-deal-for-boomerang/|title=Turner inks original WB content deal for Boomerang|website=kidscreen.com}}</ref>\n\n==Characters throughout the series==\n* '''Bunnicula'''\n\nThe titular character, a rabbit with strange and unusual eating habits and vampiric qualities, but otherwise harmless, Bunnicula came to the Monroe household on a dark, stormy night. Toby found him in the theater, which at the time was showing ''Dracula'', and brought him home, where Mrs. Monroe brought up the clever name ''Bunnicula''. A note was placed with Bunnicula when he was found, written in [[Russian language|Russian]], reading \"Please take care of my baby.\" It is unknown who left Bunnicula in the theater or wrote the note, but the letter was written in a dialect that nobody except Harold could read.\n\nHe is subjected to many murder attempts by Chester, who thinks that the rabbit would eventually become [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]. However, his indestructible stature proves to Chester that he cannot be killed. Due to his young age, Bunnicula cannot talk but he can wink and cry. He does exhibit the unusual ability to get in and out of his cage without using the door and initially opens the refrigerator by himself. Instead of a rabbit's [[buck teeth]], Bunnicula has [[fang]]s, which enable him to bite vegetables and suck the juice out of them, similar to the method by which [[Dracula]] dines, leaving them ghostly white. Bunnicula is put on a blender-based vegetable juice diet. Then he escapes his cage and runs off into the night leaving a trail of white vegetables in his wake. Chester is convinced they must be destroyed by using a stake through their hearts. Chester learned from previous mistakes and chose toothpicks as his weapon of choice. One of Bunnicula's apparent victims tries to sneak up on Harold at the end of the book, and it is left ambiguous as to whether or not Chester was playing a prank on Harold, though Chester seemed to be oblivious to the thumping noise the vegetable was making, or if this was indeed an actual attempt at an attack by a vampire vegetable.\n\nBunnicula eventually sires a litter of offspring with a rabbit owned by Pete's best friend Kyle as part of a project for their scout troop. At least one of the offspring is stated by Pete as looking identical to Bunnicula, and was briefly mentioned in ''Bunnicula meets Edger Allan Crow.'' He was named Sonnicula due to his being the son of Bunnicula and carrying an identical appearance to his father. Sonnicula never made any direct appearances in the series, being referred to only twice in passing during the events in the series. In ''Nighty-Nightmare'', Chester's story implies that Bunnicula's parents were vampire rabbits who were created by a lonely vampire, though Chester may have made the entire story up as implied by revelations at the end of the novel. However, Chester seems personally convinced that the story is a complete truth at the time that he tells it and tells it in such a way that it resembles a ghost story, one that entrances the other characters until the truth about the subject that brought up the story is revealed. This is the closest there has ever been to an origin story for Bunnicula and his apparent powers, whether or not it was concocted entirely in Chester's imagination is never explained. The author has never produced an actual origin for him or his abilities, nor has he ever explicitly confirmed or denied whether or not Bunnicula is vampiric outside of occasional hints in the novels by way of Bunnicula's odd abilities and physical features. In the animated special, Bunnicula's name is written in the note itself, to avoid having the Monroes name him. The note is one of the few aspects of the novel to carry over into the animated special, as Bunnicula is found near a processing plant in the special. When Bunnicula goes into his vampiric form, he sprouts bat wings under his arms and his eyes turn yellow. His vampire powers include flight, hypnosis, levitation, and telekinesis. Chester's murder attempts do not take place in the special and he ultimately decides that the idea that Bunnicula is a vampire is \"ridiculous\", something which doesn't occur in the novels, which has a touch of irony since Bunnicula is blatantly shown using his vampiric powers and Chester was correct in his belief of Bunnicula's true nature.\n* '''Harold'''\n\nThe main character, Harold, despite Bunnicula being the title-bearing character, is an old, scruffy and loving dog under the Monroes' care. He narrates the books, sometimes claiming he would not even write the books if it wasn't for Bunnicula. He enjoys his life with the Monroe family, particularly with Toby, always being a diligent and loyal pet. His longtime friends are Chester, Bunnicula, and Howie, who also live in the Monroe household. Harold has a strong affection for [[chocolate]] [[cupcake]]s, as well as other typical snacks such as [[cheese]] [[Cracker (food)|crackers]] and [[fudge]], despite the potential risk of [[Theobromine poisoning#In animals|food poisoning due to chocolate consumption]]. He is a mongrel, but is part-[[Russian wolfhound]] and has pride in his bloodlines. He says that this is why he is able to recognize an obscure dialect of [[Transylvania]]n writing (albeit in a [[Cyrillic]] script as per the 1982 cartoon special) in the first book. In the first book, Harold sees Bunnicula for the first time, as well as seeing a bunny for the first time. While Bunnicula's vampiric activities do scare him a little, he holds no grudges against the bunny, even befriending him. Unluckily, Chester, who has an outrageously vivid imagination and a narrow mind, thinks Bunnicula is a ''real'' vampire and forces Harold to assist him to kill the rabbit. All attempts fail, and finally, Harold goes against Chester's crazy attempts to do away with Bunnicula. Throughout the series, Harold is portrayed as good-hearted, sensible, and kind. Harold remains unconvinced of Chester's belief that Bunnicula is a vampire regardless of some actual evidence that may support Chester's theories, however briefly seen or referenced. Despite everything, Harold never stops thinking of Chester as his best friend.\n* '''Chester'''\nThe highly imaginative, prideful [[Tabby cat|orange tabby]] who loves good literature and milk. He was given to Mr. Monroe as a birthday present, and the name \"Chester\" was derived from [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Ever since Bunnicula's arrival, Chester becomes increasingly convinced that the bunny could be a threat (\"Today vegetables, tomorrow the world!\" he exclaims in reference to Bunnicula's \"[[Hegemony|diabolical plans]]\" when trying to convince Harold of his belief that Bunnicula is a vampire), and becomes singlemindedly obsessed with controlling him. For a long time, out of jealousy Chester really wanted to kill or at least disable Bunnicula and has done the latter by drinking the bunny's vegetable juice or spreading garlic around to contain him. He once tried to kill Bunnicula by using a [[steak]] (not a ''stake''), a mistake he prefers not to dwell on. Another time, he led Harold and Howie on a chase around Centerville, \"[[murder]]ing\" [[Vampire pumpkins and watermelons|vampire vegetables]], which were, in fact, the leftover meals from Bunnicula. An apparent 'survivor' of the purge Chester leads them on appears to try sneaking up on Harold at the climax of ''The Celery Stalks at Midnight'', only to be spotted by Harold, who then asks Chester for a toothpick in order to 'kill' the offending object. It is never explicitly stated if Chester was playing a prank using one of the leftover vegetables that they hadn't \"destroyed\" or if this was an actual attempt at an attack by one of Bunnicula's 'minions'. Harold and Howie disagree with Chester's methods, as Chester is often paranoid. Harold mentions in ''Nighty-Nightmare'' that Chester's constant reading and watching horror movies have given him \"a reality leak that requires constant attention\". He usually calls both of his canine friends \"dolts\", \"[[simpleton]]s\", or \"[[idiot]]s\". He is known not to apologize for his errors that greatly affect Harold, instead referring to them as \"a slight misinterpretation in the facts.\" Despite having a tense relationship with Bunnicula, deep down he accepts him as one of the family, and in the final two books of the series, ''Bunnicula Strikes Again!'' and ''Bunnicula meets Edgar Allan Crow''', becomes friends with Bunnicula, claiming that by knowing the facts about vampires best, he can protect Bunnicula from himself.\n* '''Howie'''\nThe carefree and sometimes slightly dim [[Dachshund]] puppy who was adopted by the Monroes from Chateau Bow-Wow, making him the newest member of the family. He was the [[runt]] of the [[litter]] and his parents, Howard and Heather, were valuable long-haired Dachshunds (whom Chester secretly suspected of being werewolves). Howie's somewhat eerie howling has not changed the cat's mind on the matter. Howie usually does not understand the seriousness of matters, thinking that murdering vampire vegetables is a game and chasing Bunnicula is a race. He did not even know what a vampire was when Chester informed him, though he does not think Bunnicula is a danger. For an unknown reason, he calls Harold and Chester \"Uncle Harold\" and \"Pop\", respectively; while Harold is perfectly comfortable with his nickname, Chester is still not used to his own. Howie's hobbies include chewing things, eating and chasing cars (which he's not allowed to do). Despite his boldness, Howie was a bit unnerved by scary stories at first, then outgrew it after the pets' adventures in ''Bunnicula Strikes Again!'' Later, he decided he wanted to try writing too, and his first drafts turn out to be pretty good for a puppy's work.\n* '''Robert Monroe'''\nHe is the husband of Ann Monroe and the father of Pete and Toby. He works as a college professor of literature, and he often used Chester to practice his lectures, which enabled Chester to read as well. In the animated special, he is described by Harold as being a scientist, rather than a college professor, and works at the plant where Bunnicula is discovered.\n* '''Ann Monroe'''\nShe is Robert's wife and the mother of Pete and Toby. She thought up of the name Bunnicula by combining \"Bunny\" and \"Dracula\". She had previously tried to name him \"Bun-Bun\" and \"Fluffy\". Names like this seem to be a habit with her because Harold and Chester were both called \"Fluffy\" for a short time. In the books, she is a lawyer, but her profession is unmentioned in the animated special. She also does not name Bunnicula in the special, as the name is included in the note they find with him.\n* '''Peter \"Pete\" Monroe'''\nThe oldest of two boys who slacks off often. He's often selfish, and usually bullies his younger brother Toby and the pets, except for Bunnicula. Harold and Chester avoid him, Chester being largely indifferent, but Howie finds him intriguing, mainly because of the scary books he reads. The space under his bed is very messy, and in addition to keeping a stuffed animal named Puddikins under it for emergency hugs, many other stuff has turned up such as Oreos, dirty socks and a notebook that Harold gives to Howie.\n* '''Toby Monroe'''\nThe younger brother, and much more dignified and kinder than Pete. He likes to share his snacks with Harold during his late night readings and is adored by Harold, Chester, Bunnicula, and Howie. He cares a lot for the pets, and was known to slip pieces of food to Harold at dinner. Toby's family found Bunnicula abandoned at a movie theatre one night on an outing to the movies. Toby's family adopted Bunnicula after the family brought him home.\n* '''Sonnicula'''\nThe son of Bunnicula. He looked just like Bunnicula and was born during ''Nighty-Nightmare''. His mother was a rabbit brought by Pete's best friend Kyle. It was not said whether he inherited his father's vampiric appetite, but he sleeps during the day, just like Bunnicula. In the last book, he was adopted by Miles Tanner.\n* '''Miles Tanner \"M.T. Graves\"'''\nThe author of the \"Fleshcrawlers\" series, of which Peter is a fan. He lived temporarily at the Monroes' house when Peter won a contest allowing it. He shows interest in Bunnicula and carried his pet, Edgar Allan Crow, around. He had a pale face, long curly hair, a black cape, and was very attached to a black bag. The black bag was thought to contain Bunnicula (by Chester, of course) when Bunnicula escaped. The pets opened the bag, greatly embarrassing Miles Tanner in front of the company. The contents were stuffed animals. Miles admitted that they were to train him to overcome his fear of animals. He said he was scared of dogs, cats, and people. He wanted a rabbit because a rabbit never barked at him before. Therefore, he wants Bunnicula. In the end, he adopts Sonnicula, saying \"It won't be Bunnicula, but it will be fine.\" The Monroes are greatly relieved to still keep their amazing pet. In a letter, Miles says he will marry Ms. Pickles, Peter's school librarian and they shall be neighbors. The Monroe pets changed his mind towards animals.\n* '''Edgar Allan Crow'''\nA crow Miles adopted, found on his doorstep when he was a wounded baby. Edgar gives Miles company and Miles has said he can't do anything without him. Edgar, however, wants to go back to his own kind. He was seen courting another crow in the Monroes' place. Edgar learns to write and sends an e-mail to the Monroes. Edgar Allan Crow's name is a parody of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].\n* '''Mrs. Marjorie Pickles Tanner'''\nPete and Kyle's English teacher, who is also a fan of M.T. Graves and in fact his wife. She first met Tanner when she brought over a cake as an excuse to meet him before he came to visit Peter's school. Soon after the Monroes received a letter from Tanner announcing his engagement to Pete's teacher.\n* '''Ms. Kipper'''\nThe principal of Pete and Kyle's school.\n* '''Kyle'''\nPete's best friend. His rabbit is the mother of Sonnicula.\n\n==List of books==\n\n===''Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery''===\n{{main|Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery}}\n\nThe first ''Bunnicula'' story was written by Deborah (who died before the book was published) and James Howe, illustrated by Alan Daniel, and published by [[Atheneum Books]] in 1979 (98 pages). It has been reissued many times, perhaps all with the original illustrations.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/bunnicula-a-rabbit-tale-of-mystery/oclc/4498339/editions?start_edition=1&sd=desc&referer=di&se=yr&qt=sort_yr_desc&editionsView=true&fq= \"Formats and Editions of Bunnicula: a rabbit tale of mystery\" (newest first)]. [[WorldCat]]. Retrieved 2015-01-20.</ref>\n\n===''Howliday Inn''===\nWhen the Monroe family decides to leave for a vacation, they send Harold and Chester off to a kennel called Chateau Bow-Wow (A special boarding house for special cats and dogs). There, they meet the other inhabitants of the kennel: A frustrated poodle named Louise, an athletic bulldog, a mutt named Taxi, a crazy cat named Lyle, a flirtatious poodle named Georgette, and two dachshunds named Heather and Howard, who Chester is certain are werewolves. The owner of the kennel, Dr. Greenbriar, is taking the week off and the other staff, an aspiring vet named Jill and a comic-book reader named Harrison who hopes to make a million bucks before he is twenty-one, are overworked. Because they are overworked, they make a lot of mistakes, especially Jill. These mistakes include feeding the animals late and temporarily misplacing Chester's file. Harrison will later use this tendency to forget things to his advantage. Tensions are high between the two as a result of stress. In the midst of adapting to their temporary new lives, a mystery soon unfolds when Louise goes missing.\n\nAlthough the kennel workers decide she ran away, Chester becomes certain that foul play was involved. Just when he seems to have solved the mystery, Chester to vanishes. When investigating, Harold overhears Harrison, one of the kennel workers, reporting that he tested Chester's cat food and that it was laced with poison. Horrified, Harold attempts to continue Chester's work and solve the mystery. One evening, Harold finds the message \"Help Howls out now!\" scratched into his dog dish. Chester mysteriously returns later, then rounds up Harold, Taxi, and Lyle. He leads them to find Harrison attempting to capture Heather and Howard. The animals raise the alarm and Harrison is caught by the other kennel workers. Chester tells Harold later that Harrison caught wind that one of the animals in the shelter was very valuable. He first kidnapped Louise and then Chester thinking that it could have been them, but found out that it was the dachshunds, who were actually rare wire-haired dachshunds. He also learned that Heather was going to have puppies, making him even more determined to capture them all to get rich. When Dr. Greenbriar and Jill hear the dogs barking and find, first Lousie at Harrison's house with Max and Georgette, who sneaked out to find her, barking outside and then Harrison trying to capture the dachshunds with the other animals attacking him, he is tried and sentenced. The sentence is to go to university and pay for it by working at the zoo. When the Monroe family arrives after their vacation, they reveal that they're also adopting the runt of the dachshund litter, which they name Howie\u2014Pete named him this because the puppy's father's name was Howard.\n\n===''The Celery Stalks at Midnight''===\nBunnicula has gone missing and Chester begins to fear for the town again. This time, he believes that the vegetables that Bunnicula sucks dry could return as the rabbit's vampire slaves, which he will then use as an army to take over the town. Armed with a box of toothpicks to stab through the \"hearts\" of vegetables, he, Harold, and Howie set off to search the neighborhood for white vegetables. After some success, they witness Toby and Pete wearing dark robes and holding a group of frightened children prisoner. The pets fear that Bunnicula has begun to take over people as well and run to the nearby school, which is full of what they suspect are the rabbit's servants.\n\nAfter causing much mayhem (including Chester destroying a large white carrot, which he believes is the head of the [[undead]] vegetables), they are caught by the Monroes. It is revealed that there was a carnival at the school that day, and Toby and Pete and the other children were rehearsing for a play they were going to put on. The \"carrot\" that Chester destroyed was actually a carrot cake, shaped like a carrot and covered in cream cheese. Finally, Bunnicula was found at the school, entered in the pet show. The pets find out that Bunnicula spent the previous night in the garage, which was accidentally left open, which meant he did indeed leave the house to feed on vegetables.\n\nIn the end, [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s \"[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]\" is parodied when Chester finds an artichoke heart under his favorite chair. After telling Chester there's nothing to worry about and trying to fall asleep, Harold hears a faint thumping.... he opens his eyes to find the vegetable in question right in front of his nose, which leads him to ask if Chester has a toothpick handy. It is left ambiguous as to whether or not this is a prank by Chester or an actual attempt at a vampiric attack on Harold by the artichoke.\n\n===''Nighty Nightmare''===\nA.K.A. ''The Return Of Bunnicula''. While at their lakeside retreat of Boggy Lake and fishing with Harold, Mr. Monroe apparently begins to have a [[mid-life crisis]], and wants to do something exciting while they are there. They decide to go camping out in the woods; Harold only likes the idea because of [[s'mores]], and Chester is skeptical about going out due to it being the eve of [[Saint George's Day]], the one night of the year where evil monsters and spirits come out to prey. Upon going out into the woods, they meet two men; Bud (who constantly holds a [[knife]] out in plain sight for some reason) and Spud (described by Harold as having a [[potato]]-shaped head), along with their dog Teufel ([[German language|German]] for \"[[Devil]]\"), nicknamed \"Dawg\", a bulldog with a [[scar]] on his face and a long ribbon of drool constantly hanging from his lower lip. That night, they go out for a walk, and Dawg leads Harold, Chester, and Howie away from his masters and the Monroes in order to show them something \"neat\", getting them lost in the woods in the process.\n\nChester begins to suspect that Bud and Spud may plan to [[murder]] the Monroes and that Dawg is luring them away in order to keep them from interfering, and Harold slowly begins to believe him. Once they reach a house right in the middle of the woods, Chester tells a story about Bunnicula's origin in an attempt to lull Dawg to sleep and allow himself, Harold, and Howie to escape; he claims that Bunnicula is the child of two rabbits who were artificially transformed into vampires by a lonely vampiric scientist named Diabolicus, and that three humans that he turned into vampires live in the house right before them right now, continuing his work. While the plan is successful, Harold, Howie, and even Chester fall asleep along with Dawg, and awaken shortly before dawn due to the rain and constant [[nightmares]], presumably brought on by Chester's story, which is left open to interpretation by the end of the book as to whether or not Chester made the whole thing up or if it was based on actual 'fact' within the canon of the series, though Chester's belief that the house is an 'American house of Dr. E.A.D' which lead to the story, is proven to be mistaken by story's end.\n\nAfter they return to the Monroes' camp, only to find it trashed and deserted, Dawg reveals that the house they visited is his own, and that Bud and Spud (real names Buford and Spalding) live there with their mother. Buford is revealed to be an architect while Spalding is a practicing lawyer. The Monroes also stayed the night with them in order to get out of the rain, and are relieved that Harold, Howie, and Chester are unharmed. Bud and Spud give their mother a baby [[skunk]] they caught last night as an early [[birthday]] present, and everyone sings campfire songs while eating s'mores; all except for Chester, who sulks in a corner. It is also revealed that Pete had been using Bunnicula in a rabbit breeding project he had been working on and one of the baby rabbits looked like Bunnicula (indicating that it too might be a vampire rabbit).\n\n===''Return to Howliday Inn''===\nThe Monroe family again leaves Harold, Chester, and Howie at Chateau Bow-Wow. The pets quickly notice differences, including a new group of animals staying there (a weasel, two cats named Felony and Miss Demeanor, a sad Great Dane named Hamlet, a pair of homesick dogs, and a parrot named Ditto). Howie is thrilled to be at his birthplace; Chester is none too pleased. Soon, however, all of the animals are in for a shock\u2014They hear a female dog named Rosebud calling from the other side of the fence. When they dig at the dirt around the fence, they find a few bones and a dog collar. Rosebud tells them that she discovered a horrid secret about Chataeu Bow-Wow which sealed her fate and warns the animals to escape. Undaunted, Chester begins to investigate.\n\nAfter listening in on Ditto, he hears her repeated \"6, 1, 1, 1, 5\". Later, she repeats what appears to be the entire sequence of numbers: \"6, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2\". Upon hearing this, Felony and Miss Demeanor are thrilled. When asked, they reluctantly reveal that they wanted to sneak into the kennel worker's building to steal better food and believed that the code would get them in. Shortly after, a tearful kennel worker takes Hamlet into the building. Georgette is brought to Chataeu Bow-Wow and tells the animals the true story of Rosebud: She was alive and well and back with her owners. The bones were chicken bones and her collar had been lost prior. The animals enter the building and find Hamlet, who tells them that his old owner left him there a long time ago. He was now set to be put to sleep. Chester finds his owner's new address and they set off to bring Hamlet there. The new address turns out to be a nursing home, one which does not allow animals. The pets break in and in the chaos, it becomes clear that the patients love the arrival of the animals, who remind them of their old pets. Hamlet finds his old owner, and it is revealed that the owner was a ventriloquist, explaining how Hamlet caused \"Rosebud\" to speak. Using ventriloquism of their own, the pets and patients convince the staff of the nursing home to allow Hamlet to stay. When Harold, Chester, and Howie are picked up at the end, they fool the Monroes with the ventriloquism tricks they picked up.\n\n===''Bunnicula Strikes Again!''===\nChester has once again come to the crazy conclusion that Bunnicula is a threatening vampire. The cat starts drinking the rabbit's juice in the daytime so Bunnicula will die of starvation. Harold and Howie are upset, but once again Chester insists this is all for the best. One night, Harold notices Bunnicula crying while singing him a lullaby. Chester thinks he misses his mother, and in the next few days he leads the two dogs to search for her. This is unsuccessful, as she very likely is not around town. When Bunnicula becomes increasingly ill, either due to lack of food or to his lack of parental love, he is taken to the veterinarian, Chester, however, escapes and gets to the theater first. Before he can actually kill Bunnicula, the demolition starts, crushing both the cat and the rabbit under rubble. Harold and Howie manage to alert the Monroes and the other witnesses, and together they dig through the piles of fragments. They find Chester in a weakened state, but Bunnicula miraculously is completely unharmed. Chester comforts the rabbit, finally claiming that his attempts to murder Bunnicula were futile and that because he survived the demolition without a scratch, he is 'indestructible.' In the end, the Monroes return to their normal lives, and Bunnicula is at last happy because Chester has accepted him as one of the family.\n\n===''Bunnicula Meets Edgar Allan Crow''===\nA.K.A. ''Bunnicula vs The Monster Raven''. Pete writes to the author of his (and Howie's) favorite series, FleshCrawlers. He visits the Monroe household and stays in the guestroom, bringing with him his favorite pet crow, Edgar Allan Crow. Everyone is thrilled, except for Chester, who insists that the author, M.T. Graves, is suspicious. He notes that something bad always happens to the pets in Graves's books, and when he wrote back to Pete, he seemed especially interested in spending some \"quality time with the pets,\" particularly Bunnicula, whom Chester has now befriended. Harold and Howie aren't convinced, but Chester feels certain that there is a secret society amongst the crows, and Edgar is a messenger sent to help Graves transform Bunnicula into a bat. When Bunnicula escapes, the entire party follows him to catch him, and Harold and Howie begin to think that Chester may have been right. M.T. Graves is very careful about a black bag, and when Bunnicula is not found, Chester believes he is trapped in the bag. Harold dumps the bag, only to embarrass Graves in front of everyone because it was filled with stuffed animals. In the end, M.T. Graves tells them that he was a nervous boy when he was younger and was afraid of dogs and cats, so he figured he would stay at the Monroe's house so that he could conquer his phobia. Graves falls in love with Pete's school librarian and marries her. Graves releases Edgar because Edgar fell in love with another crow. Then he adopts Sonnicula, Bunnicula's son. After Graves left, Pete got a letter that said he was inspired to write two books from visiting the Monroes: one called ''Quoth the Raven'' about his relationship with Edgar, and another called ''The Excellently Weird Adventures of Charlie the Cat from Galaxy Nine'', inspired by Chester, who was less than thrilled to discover he was one of them, as he put it, \"psycho creatures from M.T. Graves' demented novels.\"\n\nJames Howe is mentioned when Pete says that all of the other kids wanted to choose authors like [[J.K. Rowling]] or James Howe.\n\n==Tales from the House of Bunnicula==\nA spin-off series centering around the writings of Howie, which involve Howie encountering a supernatural or extraterrestrial creature or event with his trusty friend, Delilah. The books also contain ''notes'' that Howie receives from Harold or Chester.
