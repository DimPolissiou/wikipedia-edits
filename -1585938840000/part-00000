Lundgren's breakthrough came in 1985, when he starred in ''[[Rocky IV]]'' as the imposing [[Soviet Union]] boxer [[Ivan Drago]]. Since then, he has starred in more than 40 films, almost all of them in the action genre.\n\nLundgren received a degree in [[chemical engineer]]ing from the [[KTH Royal Institute of Technology|Royal Institute of Technology]] in the early 1980s and a [[master's degree]] in chemical engineering from the [[University of Sydney]] in 1982. He holds the rank of 3rd ''[[Dan (rank)|dan]]'' [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[Kyokushin|Kyokushin karate]] and was European champion in 1980\u201381. While in Sydney, he became a bodyguard for Jamaican singer [[Grace Jones]] and began a relationship with her. He received a [[Fulbright scholarship]] to [[MIT]] and moved to Boston. Jones convinced him to leave the university and move to [[New York City]] to be with her and begin acting, where, after a short stint as a model and bouncer at the [[Manhattan]] nightclub [[The Limelight]], Lundgren got a small debut role as a [[KGB]] henchman in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[A View to a Kill]]''.\n\nAfter appearing in ''Rocky IV'', Lundgren portrayed [[He-Man]] in the 1987 [[science fantasy]] film ''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]'', Lt.

He reprised his role in ''[[The Expendables 2]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Expendables 3]]'' (2014). Also in 2014, he co-starred in ''[[Skin Trade (film)|Skin Trade]]'', an action thriller about human trafficking he co-wrote and produced. The film marks his third collaboration with [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]], the previous two being ''[[Showdown in Little Tokyo]]'' (1991) and ''[[Bridge of Dragons]]'' (1999).

As a result, Clinton held a meeting with scientists and cabinet officials to discuss the threat of bioterrorism. He was so impressed, that he asked the experts to meet with senior-level aides at the Department of Defense and in the Department of Health and Human Services. At that time, the government had stockpiles of medications for military personnel, but did not have them for civilians. Shortly after, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that Clinton surprised many in Washington at how fast he and his [[National Security Council (United States)|National Security Council]] had moved to change that.

In the episode, a pregnant woman, [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Paula Sievinen]] ([[Johanna Nurmimaa]]), was seemingly [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and a caf\u00e9 exploded during a wedding celebration, which implied death of many main characters. Many, including Finland's Minister of Communications [[Suvi Lind\u00e9n]], questioned the show's suitability for school children. FICORA (Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority) decided later that the episode was not suitable for children under the age of 11, but the show's programming slot was late enough to meet the regulations.<ref>http://www.ficora.fi/index/viestintavirasto/uutiset/2009/P_51.html FICORA's report concernig the episode (Finnish)</ref><ref>http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/Salatut+el%C3%A4m%C3%A4t+kirvoitti+keskustelun+v%C3%A4kivallasta/1135246466933 A news article about the controversy published by [[Helsingin Sanomat]] (Finnish)</ref> In 2013, the original main character [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Jenni Vainio]] played by [[Anu Palevaara]], was shot on front of the main house and it caused a lot of talk among the fans of the series. Jenni left the series after 14 years presence. However, producer Marko \u00c4ij\u00f6 said that the biggest sensation of the series was in the early days, when [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Kalle Laitela]], played by Pete Lattu, kissed another man. At that time, the channel MTV3 received over 40 meters of [[fax]] about the kiss.<ref>[[:fi:Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t(Finnish)]]</ref>\n\nDuring the series' entire run in Finland, a 30-minute episode has aired every weekday in an early-evening slot at 7:30 pm. A new season usually premieres in either late August or early September and concludes by the beginning of June. Normally, the series is on a hiatus during the Christmas holidays, approximately 3 or 4 weeks. The series' episodes are also available online at the website http://katsomo.fi/ for 30 days after their original airing.\n\n==Settings==\n''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t's'' main focus is the fictional street ''Pihlajakatu'', located in [[Ullanlinna]], Helsinki. Other locations include a high school, a hospital, ''Caf\u00e9 Moose'' and an inn, ''Amanda'', which contains the hotel, a restaurant and a gym ''Amadeus''.

In 2004, the theme song was replaced by an electronic version of the theme music. In 2014, the theme song was switched back to the original one, first heard on 1999. In 2019, the series got completely new theme song again.\n\n==Television ratings==\nSince its first episode aired in January 1999, it has been one of the most popular TV shows in Finland, regularly attracting around a [[million]] viewers (1/5 of Finland's population).

The final parts, up to 459, can be seen on the \"Lauri K\" channel on YouTube.\n\n==Themes==\nThe series has dealt with a wider range of subjects such as [[abortion]], [[drug abuse]], [[alcoholism]], [[homosexuality]], [[incest]], [[animal rights]], [[rape]], [[religious fanaticism]], [[gambling addiction]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[domestic violence]], [[cancer]], [[eating disorder]], [[school bullying]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and its effects to the family, the search of biological parents, [[stealing]] and [[racism]]; many episodes involving these themes have caused public debate.\n\nAn exceptionally widespread controversy was started by the season finale aired on 1 June 2009. In the episode, a pregnant woman, [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Paula Sievinen]] ([[Johanna Nurmimaa]]), was seemingly [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and a caf\u00e9 exploded during a wedding celebration, which implied death of many main characters. Many, including Finland's Minister of Communications [[Suvi Lind\u00e9n]], questioned the show's suitability for school children. FICORA (Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority) decided later that the episode was not suitable for children under the age of 11, but the show's programming slot was late enough to meet the regulations.<ref>http://www.ficora.fi/index/viestintavirasto/uutiset/2009/P_51.html FICORA's report concernig the episode (Finnish)</ref><ref>http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/Salatut+el%C3%A4m%C3%A4t+kirvoitti+keskustelun+v%C3%A4kivallasta/1135246466933 A news article about the controversy published by [[Helsingin Sanomat]] (Finnish)</ref> In 2013, the original main character [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Jenni Vainio]] played by [[Anu Palevaara]], was shot on front of the main house and it caused a lot of talk among the fans of the series. Jenni left the series after 14 years presence. However, producer Marko \u00c4ij\u00f6 said that the biggest sensation of the series was in the early days, when [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Kalle Laitela]], played by Pete Lattu, kissed another man. At that time, the channel MTV3 received over 40 meters of [[fax]] about the kiss.<ref>[[:fi:Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t(Finnish)]]</ref>\n\nDuring the series' entire run in Finland, a 30-minute episode has aired every weekday in an early-evening slot at 7:30 pm. A new season usually premieres in either late August or early September and concludes by the beginning of June. Normally, the series is on a hiatus during the Christmas holidays, approximately 3 or 4 weeks. The series' episodes are also available online at the website http://katsomo.fi/ for 30 days after their original airing.\n\n==Settings==\n''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t's'' main focus is the fictional street ''Pihlajakatu'', located in [[Ullanlinna]], Helsinki. Other locations include a high school, a hospital, ''Caf\u00e9 Moose'' and an inn, ''Amanda'', which contains the hotel, a restaurant and a gym ''Amadeus''. Former \"main caf\u00e9\" was ''Kentauri'' which, however, exploded during a wedding celebration in the season finale of the 11th season.\n\nAll of the houses and other locations featured in the show are filmed at the FremantleMedia studio in Konala, Helsinki. In real life, Pihlajakatu is Huvilakatu, which is located in Ullanlinna, Helsinki. ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4''t has also filmed scenes in [[Tampere]] and in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]. A few episodes have also been filmed in the [[Canary Islands]], [[Lithuania]] and [[London]].\n\n==Theme song==\nThe original theme song was called ''Tunteisiin'' and performed by Anna Hanski but in 2001, the theme was changed to a version performed by Jore Marjaranta. In 2004, the theme song was replaced by an electronic version of the theme music. In 2014, the theme song was switched back to the original one, first heard on 1999. In 2019, the series got completely new theme song again.\n\n==Television ratings==\nSince its first episode aired in January 1999, it has been one of the most popular TV shows in Finland, regularly attracting around a [[million]] viewers (1/5 of Finland's population). At the moment ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t'' is the highest-rated drama series in Finland, although its viewership has declined during the past few years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\"\n|-\n!

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, although, it depends on the life stage of G. garnhami whether these three parts can be seen. a characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often refered to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli). Often the membranes are very close together making to see the distinction between them. This structure is often also refered to as the tri-layered structure. Beneath the inner membrane a [[Basal lamina|basal (internal) lamina]] can be seen. This basal lamina seperates the epicytic foldings from the rest of the cel. These epicytic foldings form the outer surface of G. garnhami and hundreds of these can be observed at the surface enlarging the surface of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vivier |first1=E |last2=Petitprez |first2=A |title=The outer membrane complex and its development at the time of the formation of daughter cells in Toxoplasma gondii|journal=The Journal of cell biology |date=November 1969 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=329-42 |pmid=5344151|taal=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=M.

The [[Belgian Football Association|national association]] was founded in 1895 with the intention of bringing some order and organization to the sport. [[\u00c9vence Copp\u00e9e Trophy|The first match]] of the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]] was played on 1 May 1904, a 3\u20133 draw against [[France national football team|France]].\n\nTraditionally, the clubs [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] and [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] are the three most dominant domestic teams, all of them also having played and/or won one or more [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final(s). Except for Standard Li\u00e8ge and [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]], most professional clubs have Flemish backgrounds.\n\n== National style ==\nBoth the national football team and the top Belgium division have a reputation for physical play. This came as a result of a lack of technically skilled foreign players allowed to play in Belgium due to legal restrictions.  This changed after the [[Bosman ruling]] which forced the liberalization of the football player market in Europe. Did you know that if your butt is clean when you play football, people go out of the crowd and pull your pants down also your underwear and smother dirt on your butt in front of the cameras?  It happends  a little in front too if ya know what i mean.  jk jk.  In response, Belgian clubs began to buy unknown players from Eastern Europe, South America and Africa.  This had two contradictory consequences.  On the one hand, the national team was weakened by the reduced opportunity for native Belgium players to gain a spot on domestic teams.  On the other hand, the Jupiler League reinforced its status as an entry league for players who then move on to some of the greatest European clubs.<ref>{{cite web | last =Linhoff | first =Josef | title =Belgium: a Golden Generation is emerging | work =World Soccer | publisher =IPC Media | url =http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/belgium-a-golden-generation-is-emerging | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, some of the most talented players in Europe have played in Belgian clubs, including [[Yaya Tour\u00e9]], [[Jean-Pierre Papin]], [[Daniel Amokachi]], [[Antol\u00edn Alcaraz]] and [[David Rozehnal]] were discovered at [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]; [[Sunday Oliseh]] and [[Victor Ikpeba]] at [[RFC Li\u00e8ge]]; [[Jan Koller]], [[Nii Lamptey]] and [[Aruna Dindane]] at [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]]; and [[Mido (footballer)|Mido]] at [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]].\n\nOthers who began or launched their professional careers in Belgium include [[William Carvalho]], [[Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9]], [[Romaric (footballer)|Romaric]], [[Gervinho]], [[Didier Zokora]], [[Arthur Boka]], [[Ivica Dragutinovi\u0107]], [[Mario Stani\u0107]], [[Morten Olsen]], [[Dorinel Munteanu]], [[Andr\u00e9 Cruz]], [[Seol Ki-hyeon]], [[Kennet Andersson]], [[Klas Ingesson]], [[Aaron Mokoena]], [[Micha\u00ebl Ciani]], [[Nicol\u00e1s Pareja]], [[Oguchi Onyewu]], [[Rabiu Afolabi]], [[Cheick Tiot\u00e9]], [[Peter Odemwingie]], [[Joseph Yobo]], [[Ouwo Moussa Maazou]], [[Milan Jovanovi\u0107 (footballer, born 1981)|Milan Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Ognjen Vukojevi\u0107]], [[Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107]], [[Nikica Jelavi\u0107]], [[Demba Ba]], [[Dante (footballer)|Dante]], [[Bryan Ruiz]] and [[Rob Rensenbrink]].\n\nBecause of the physical nature of Belgian football, it has tended to primarily produce talented defensive players. These include [[Jean-Marie Pfaff]], [[Eric Gerets]], [[Leo Clijsters]], [[Michel Preud'homme]], [[Georges Gr\u00fcn]], [[Philippe Albert]], [[Franky Van Der Elst]], [[Vincent Kompany]] and [[Thomas Vermaelen]].

In 1926, the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]] decided to introduce matricule numbers to tell the clubs apart and assigned a matricule to each existing club by order of registration. In this manner, [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Antwerp]] was awarded matricule number 1 as the first to register. As such, the oldest clubs in Belgium typically have the lowest matricule numbers, although there are clubs which registered only years after their origination and as a result have a much higher matricule than would be expected. Many clubs, especially those with very low numbers, consider their matricule number part of their heritage and past and prominently feature it in their logo or even name. In case a club dissolves, the matricule number of this club is removed permanently and lost forever as numbers are never reused.\n\nIn case of mergers, the new club must decide which matricule number to keep, it normally begins the championship at the level where the former club with the same matricule number should have begun the season. Typically, mergers result in the most famous club's matricule being kept alive. However, it has often occurred that a club with a glorious past or even (multiple) championship titles had to merge with another less successful club in order to survive, often due to financial difficulties. In this case, the matricule number of the club, and the honours linked to it, were lost with the merger. As an examples, in the late 1990s, seven-time champion [[K. Beerschot V.A.C.|K. Beerschot VAC]] was struggling with financial difficulties in the [[Belgian Third Division|third division]] and merged with then first division neighbour club KFC Germinal Ekeren to survive. The new club was named [[K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot|KFC Germinal Beerschot Antwerpen]] and started in the first division with the matricule number of KFC Germinal Ekeren, but lost the honours of K Beerschot VAC. The new club did keep playing in the Beerschot stadium and wore the purple shirt for which Beerschot was famously known. Another famous example is that of five-time champion [[R. Daring Club Molenbeek|Daring Club de Bruxelles]]' merger with RR White into [[R.W.D. Molenbeek|R White Daring Molenbeek]] in 1973.\n\nFrom the 2010s, matricules have been sold and traded, with clubs wanting to take over the position in a (higher) series of another club acquiring these matricules in order to quickly move up one or more divisions. Examples include [[BX Brussels]], which acquired the matricule of Bleid-Gaume in 2013, with the intent to transform and move the club from Bleid to Brussels, over 200 kilometres away. The Royal Belgian Football Association therefore enforced a new rule in 2016, stating that after a takeover, a club cannot move more than 30 kilometres from its original location.\n\nFrom 2017, the Belgian FA enforced another rule, which allows clubs to buy back their old defunct matricule, which was first done by [[K Lyra-Lierse Berlaar|Lyra]] (matricule 7776) who acquired the matricule 52 of the old defunct [[K. Lyra|Lyra]]. In 2018, [[Oud-Heverlee Leuven]], which is the result of a merger of three clubs around the city of [[Leuven]], changed its matricule number 6142 back to number 18 to honour the glorious past of its eldest predecessor.\n\nThe first few matricule numbers are:\n#[[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]]\n#[[Daring Club de Bruxelles]] (no longer active)\n#[[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]\n#[[RFC Li\u00e9geois]]\n#[[R. L\u00e9opold Uccle Forestoise]]\n#[[Racing Club de Bruxelles]]\n#[[K.A.A. Gent]]\n#[[R.C.S. Vervi\u00e9tois]]\n#[[R. Dolhain F.C.]]\n#[[R. Union Saint-Gilloise]]\n\n=== Naming ===\nA Belgian club's name usually includes the name of the town where the club plays as well as a prefix and/or suffix.  Since Belgians speak three languages, French and Dutch being the main ones and German being the third official language, Belgian teams may use either language as the basis for their names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/923-Europe/4963-language-barrier|title=When Saturday Comes \u2013 Language barrier|author=WSC 267 May 09|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> For historical reasons, many Flemish clubs changed their names from French to Dutch between the beginning of the 20th century and the late 1960s. Additionally, many clubs have experienced frequent name changes. Reasons for these include a language change, a merger, an anniversary, etc. Because of the numerous mergers between Belgian clubs, team names sometimes combine several town names (such as [[K. Beringen-Heusden-Zolder]] or [[Sporting West Ingelmunster-Harelbeke]]) which reflect mergers. In recent history, clubs representing immigrant communities have come into existence and sometimes use names that are in neither of Belgium's official languages (the now defunct clubs T\u00fcrkgucun Ozburun and T\u00fcrkiyemspor Zaventem, or the still-existing Agrupaci\u00f3n Oviedo-Asturiana, existing only in a league outside the Belgian FA now, from Brussels, being examples).\n\nFinally, a team which exists for at least 50 years may add the prefix \"Royal\" to its name (either in [[English language|English]] or in the team's language). Before 1958, this right was given to any team that celebrated its 25th year of existence. Between 1958 and 1968, the rule was changed to grant the title to any team with at least 35 years of existence. Since 1968, the time limit has increased to 50 years.\n\nThe following is a partial list of common football club name prefixes and suffixes in Belgium's two main languages.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] (1976 and 1978)\n***[[KV Mechelen]] (1988)\n\n== Football in Belgium by province ==\nUnder the first four levels in the [[Belgian football league system|league system]], the competition is organized by province, with the notable exception of Brabant which comprises clubs from the provinces of [[Flemish Brabant]], [[Walloon Brabant]] and the [[Brussels Capital Region]].\n\n=== West Flanders ===\nAs of the 2019\u201320 season, five clubs from [[West Flanders]] play in the First Division A ([[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]], [[Cercle Brugge]], [[K.V. Kortrijk|KV Kortrijk]], [[K.V. Oostende|KV Oostende]] and [[S.V. Zulte Waregem|SV Zulte-Waregem]]), and one clubs plays in the First Division B ([[K.S.V. Roeselare|KSV Roeselare]]).\n\n=== East Flanders ===\nTwo clubs from [[East Flanders]] currently play in the First Division A ([[K.A.A. Gent|AA Gent]] and [[Waasland-Beveren]]). [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|KSC Lokeren]] were relegated from the First Division A after the [[2018\u201319 Belgian First Division A|2018-19 season]] and as such, they will compete in the First Division B in 2019-20.\n\n=== Antwerp ===\nThe province of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]] has an old tradition of football. The first Belgian clubs were established in the city of [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] (Antwerp Lyon's Club, A.S. Anvers-Borgerhout, and most notably [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], which is the country's oldest club and which is affectionately referred to as the \"Great Old\" by its supporters and the media).\n\nTwo clubs from this province currently play in the top flight: [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] and [[KV Mechelen]], while [[K.V.C. Westerlo|KVC Westerlo]] and [[K Beerschot VA|Beerschot]] play in the First Division B.\n\n=== Limburg ===\nTwo clubs from [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] currently play in the First Division A: [[K.R.C. Genk|KRC Genk]] and [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truiden]]. Additionally, one club represents the province in First Division B: [[Lommel SK]].\n\n=== Brussels ===\nTechnically-speaking, [[Brussels]] is not a province but rather an autonomous administrative (sub-)urban region within the province of [[Flemish Brabant]]. Only one currently active club from Brussels plays in First Division A, [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], also the country's most successful club to date.\n\nThe first-ever Belgian League Championship was made up out of seven teams, four of which were based in Brussels: [[Racing Club de Bruxelles|Racing Club]], [[L\u00e9opold Club de Bruxelles|L\u00e9opold Club Uccle]], [[Sporting Club de Bruxelles|Sporting Club]] and [[Union d'Ixelles]]. L\u00e9opold Club was a club for the nobility and bourgeoisie in Brussels and is still active after no less than four mergers between 1982 and 2001 (they are currently playing in the [[Belgian Promotion|Fourth Division]]). The latter two clubs ceased to exist in 1897 and 1901 respectively and were replaced by a new Brussels-based club ([[Union Saint-Gilloise|Royale Union Saint-Gilloise]]), which would become a dominant force in Belgian football during the following seasons, winning seven titles between 1903 and 1913. The club originally shared a rivalry with Racing Club and later [[R. Daring Club Molenbeek|Daring Club]], which would go on and win the title in 1912. Later, Anderlecht became their biggest rival for citywide bragging rights.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], Belgian football was dominated by clubs from Antwerp and Bruges. From the early 1930s, however, Union and Daring divided five titles between themselves. The rivalry between the two clubs has inspired a stage play named ''Bossemans et Coppenolle'' (\"Bossemans\" was the name of the Union head coach, \"Coppenolle\" his counterpart at Daring). Shortly after [[World War II]], Anderlecht replaced Union and Daring as the dominant team in Brussels. Its cross-city rivals at the time were, in succession, Union, Daring and Racing White, later renamed [[R.W.D. Molenbeek|R.W.D.M.]], still later named [[FC Brussels]]. The latter were liquidated in 2014 and revived a year later as [[RWDM47]]. [[R.W.S. Bruxelles|White Star Bruxelles]], a club from the Brussels suburban region, technically won promotion to the top flight after the [[2015\u201316 Belgian Second Division|2015-16 season]] but due to the club's debts, both the [[Royal Belgian Football Association|Belgian FA]] and the courts did not award them a licence to practice professional football. As a result, the club were relegated to the [[Belgian First Amateur Division|First Amateur Division]] and were ultimately wound up in October 2017.\n\n[[Union Saint-Gilloise|Royale Union Saint-Gilloise]], currently in the First Division B, is the only Brussels club at that level in 2019\u201320.\n\n=== Flemish Brabant ===\nOnly one club from [[Flemish Brabant]] is currently active in the top two divisions of Belgian football, [[Oud-Heverlee Leuven]], playing in the First Division B.\n\n=== Walloon Brabant ===\nAfter the [[2018\u201319 Belgian First Division B|2018-19 season]], [[A.F.C. Tubize|AFC Tubize]] were relegation to the [[Belgian First Amateur Division|First Amateur Division]] and as a result, no club from [[Walloon Brabant]] plays in the top two divisions of Belgian football in 2019-20.\n\n=== Hainaut ===\nTwo teams from [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] are currently playing in First Division A: [[Royal Excel Mouscron|Excel Mouscron]] and [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi SC]].\n\n=== Namur ===\nThe province of [[Namur (province)|Namur]] is, along with that of Luxembourg, the province with the least prestigious football history in Belgium. Currently, no clubs from the province of Namur are playing in the top two levels of Belgian football. Furthermore, no club from this province has ever played in the top flight.\n\n=== Li\u00e8ge ===\n[[RFC Li\u00e8ge]] won the first-ever Belgian title in 1896. The club struggled financially during the early years of the 21st century and was eventually dissolved in 2011. A new club was formed, which is currently competing in the [[Belgian First Amateur Division|First Amateur Division]].\n\nCurrently, two clubs from the province of [[Li\u00e8ge (province)|Li\u00e8ge]] are competing in First Division A, [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] and [[K.A.S. Eupen|KAS Eupen]]. The latter is the only club from the country's German-speaking region ever to have competed in the top flight. They first played at the top level in 2010\u201311 but were relegated after that season, before returning after the 2016\u201317 season. No team from the province is currently in the First Division B.\n\nHistorically, [[RFC Li\u00e8ge]] (five titles between 1895 and 1953) and [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] (ten titles between 1958 and 2009) are the province's most successful, well-known and popular clubs.\n\n=== Luxembourg ===\nOnly one club from the province of [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]] will plays in the top two levels of Belgian football: [[Excelsior Virton]], who won promotion to the First Division B after the [[2018\u201319 Belgian First Amateur Division|2018-19 season]]. No club from this province has ever played in the top flight. Former Belgian international [[Philippe Albert]] ([[Bouillon]]) and current international [[Thomas Meunier]] ([[Sainte-Ode]]) were born in the province.\n\n== League system ==\n{{Main article|Belgian football league system}}\nAs of the 2016\u201317 season, the Belgian football league pyramid has nine levels. The FA dramatically overhauled the league system after the 2015\u201316 season, reducing the number of professional teams to 24 and introducing a nationwide amateur league for the first time.\n\n'''Nationwide leagues:'''\n\n# [[Belgian First Division A|First Division A]] (renamed from \"Pro League\" after the 2015\u201316 season)\n# [[Belgian First Division B|First Division B]] \u2013 replaced the former Second Division for 2016\u201317\n# [[Belgian First Amateur Division|First Amateur Division]] \u2013 introduced for 2016\u201317\n\n'''Regional leagues:'''\n# [[Belgian Second Amateur Division|Second Amateur Division]] (three leagues, two for Flemish clubs and one for Francophone clubs, with Flemish teams assigned loosely on geographic location)\n# [[Belgian Third Amateur Division|Third Amateur Division]] (four leagues, two each for Flemish clubs and Francophone clubs, with all teams assigned loosely on geographic location)\n\n'''Provincial leagues:'''\n# Provincial Division 1\n# Provincial Division 2\n# Provincial Division 3\n# Provincial Division 4\n\nEach provincial subdivision of the FA runs its own 4-division league. Only teams that are geographically located in a certain province are allowed to compete in the corresponding provincial league. To include as well teams from the capital region of [[Brussels]] (which is not a [[Provinces of Belgium|province]] by itself and also does not belong to a province), teams from Brussels, [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Walloon Brabant]] are split into two similar leagues based on their language. As a result there are two \"provincial\" leagues corresponding to the former [[Province of Brabant]]: one Brabant \"provincial\" league for Flemish clubs (including all Flemish clubs from Brussels, Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant) and a Brabant \"provincial\" league for Francophone clubs (including all Francophone clubs from Brussels, Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant). The majority of the clubs from the Brussels capital region are Francophone, de-facto resulting in two provincial leagues roughly corresponding to Flemish Brabant one on hand; and Walloon Brabant and Brussels on the other hand.\n\n== European Competitions ==\n\n=== UEFA Champions League ===\nThe following teams have qualified for the group stage in the [[UEFA Champions League]]:\n\n*[[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] (6 times: [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1992\u201393]], [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League|2002\u201303]], [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|2003\u201304]], [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306]], [[2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League|2016\u201317]], [[2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League|2018\u201319]])\n*[[R.S.C.

Many amateur leagues exist in Belgium, most of them are region-bound or province-bound. Examples of amateur leagues with a long tradition include the KVV (Koninklijke Vlaamse Voetbalbond) organising provincial leagues in all Flemish provinces save for West-Vlaanderen; the MTSA for the area Dendermonde-Aalst-Denderstreek; the LVVB Melle for the area Wetteren-Ghent (with some clubs outside this area); the LVV Meetjesland for the Meetjesland area and few clubs from Ghent, the Corporative Leagues in several provinces mainly intended for company teams (although sometimes also including general amateur teams), the WALIVO in the Waasland area, the ABSSA and Travailliste leagues in Brussels and surrounding areas, \u2026 The system is complex as some of these regional leagues are affiliated to the Belgian FA (sometimes their member clubs receive a matricule number) but the leagues are totally separate from the league system in the leagues directly run by the Belgian FA (described above).<ref name=\"heraldscotland1\" /><ref>{{Citation | last =Adams | first =Tim | title =Why Belgium Is The Hottest Country in Football | work =Esquire | department =Culture: Features | publisher =Hearst Magazines UK | date =2013-08-24 | url =http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/features/3834/why-belgium-has-the-most-exciting-footballers-in-the-world/ | accessdate =2013-11-19 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130919103648/http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/features/3834/why-belgium-has-the-most-exciting-footballers-in-the-world/ | archive-date =2013-09-19 | url-status =dead }}</ref> Some other amateur leagues operate totally separate from the Belgian FA with no connection to the Belgian FA in any ways. Amateur leagues are in decline in some areas due to the competition from the general Belgian FA-run leagues and due to long travel distances being unpractical at amateur level. Several clubs who started in amateur leagues have made the transfer to the leagues run directly by the Belgian FA (starting at the lowest level). Some of these clubs even managed to, after a while, reach a relatively high level of the Belgian pyramid. Many amateur leagues in the past were tied to a political ideology, and Catholic, Socialist and Liberal amateur leagues existed. Nowadays most amateur leagues are based upon geographic area rather than on political ideologies.<ref>{{Citation | last =Da Saliva | first =Michael | coauthors = | title =Belgium's next generation of footballers on the rise | work =alpha |department=Sport: football | publisher =Al Nisr Publishing LLC | date =2013-04-02 | url =http://gulfnews.com/sport/football/belgium-s-next-generation-of-footballers-on-the-rise-1.1165695 | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Masters | first =James | title =2014 World Cup: Is Belgium football's coming force? | newspaper =CNN |department=World Sport | publisher =Cable News Network | date =2013-10-13 | url =http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/10/sport/football/football-belgium-dembele-world-cup/ | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Brassell | first =Andy | title =Vincent Kompany & Eden Hazard lead the Belgium revolution | newspaper =BBC |department=Football | publisher =BBC | date =2012-11-13 | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20052636 | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Mogan | first =Tony | title =Belgian Football's Lone Englishman Jonny Rowell on Life in European Football's Flourishing Nation | newspaper =International Business Times |department=Sports & Stars | publisher =International Business Times | date =2013-10-24 | url =http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/516688/20131024/jonny-rowell-belgium-begian-football-newcastle-united.htm | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref>\n\n== Indoor football ==\n\n{{Main article|Futsal in Belgium}}\n\nIn Belgium, the Belgian FA also runs a nationwide Futsal league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/futsaleuro/news/newsid=2041601.html|title=Degryse: Futsal EURO is special for Belgium|date=27 January 2014|work=UEFA.com|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> Clubs are given a matricule number as well, although a separate one than the matricule numbers assigned to the clubs in outdoor football. Usually the letter A is in front of the matricule number to indicate an indoor club. A separate indoor football league is organised by the BZVB (Belgische Zaalvoetbal Bond, translated as Belgian Indoor Football Association), this is not tied to the Belgian FA. Both of these leagues run at the same moment but without any interaction with each other.\n\nIn addition, Mini Football is popular in Belgium (this has different rules all together than Futsal) and this league is run by a separate FA dealing with mini football only.\n\n== Women's football ==\n{{Main article|Women's football in Belgium|Super League Vrouwenvoetbal}}\n{{see also|BeNe League}}\n\nBoth the Belgian FA and several regional amateur football leagues run a league for women. The league operated by the Belgian FA consists of three nationwide levels, with several levels per province below. The Belgian FA started to organise women's football in the early seventies, due to the UEFA obligating every member FA to organise leagues for women as well as for men. In the beginning the Belgian FA discouraged women to play football and advised them to opt for sports such as volleyball. The first season only existing clubs (with male teams) could enrol a female team in the league. As popularity of women's football grew and more and more teams wanted to play in the league, the Belgian FA dropped the above rule and accepted new clubs to affiliate who only focussed on ladies' football. These clubs are assigned matricule numbers just like any other club, and meanwhile women's football is fully integrated in the Belgian football structure. However, the league is not professional as yet (only a few female players have been full-time professionals) and the national team is amongst the weaker teams in Europe due to other countries such as Germany, Norway, Sweden having fully professional women's leagues. Clubs who have been successful in past or present in Belgian women's football include Brussels Dames '71 (currently the women's team of Anderlecht), Rapide Wezemaal, Astro Begijnendijk, Eva's Kumtich, Sinaai Girls, Standard F\u00e9mina Li\u00e8ge, Dames Eendracht Aalst (previously tied to the club KSC Eendracht Aalst which was also successful in men's football).\n\nIn the early 2010s, plans existed to develop a new super league where existing clubs with professional men's teams would enroll a women's team. Eventually, the Belgian and Dutch FAs launched a joint top-level league, the [[BeNe League]], in 2012. Before the launch of this league, several famous clubs had created women's teams, such as Club Brugge, Lierse SK, Germinal Beerschot Antwerpen, and St-Truidense VV. After the 2014\u201315 season, the two countries chose to disband the BeNe League and relaunch their own national top flights; the Dutch revived their women's [[Eredivisie (women)|Eredivisie]], while Belgium chose instead to create a totally new top flight, the [[Super League Vrouwenvoetbal|Super League]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of football stadiums in Belgium]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Association football in Belgium}}\n*{{in lang|en}} [http://users.skynet.be/pluto/Textbelgium/Teams.html RSSSF archive] \u2013 Belgian clubs history\n* {{in lang|en}} [http://www.league321.com/belgium-football.html League321.com] \u2013 Belgian Football League Tables, Records & Statistics Database.\n*{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.bsdb.be/ Belgian Soccer Database] \u2013 Extensive database about players, clubs, results and other historical statistics\n\n{{Football in Belgium}}\n{{Football in Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Football in Belgium| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox sport overview\n| boxwidth      = 250\n| title         = Football in Belgium\n| image         = \n| imagesize     = 240px\n| image_alt     = <!-- alt text, which will be seen when hovering over the image -->\n| caption       = \n| union         = [[Belgian Football Association]]\n| country       = Belgium\n| sport         = association football\n| noncountry    = <!-- other country this country represents -->\n| teamlabel1    = <!-- overrides the \"National team\" label with custom label -->\n| nationalteam  = [[Belgium national football team|men's national team]]\n| teamlabel2    = <!-- overrides the \"Representative team\" label with customer label -->\n| repteam       = <!-- overrides the representative team link, requires full wikitext syntax -->\n| nickname      = <!-- nicknames -->\n| first         = \n| registered    = \n| clubs         = \n| national_list = [[Belgian Cup]]\n| club_list     = [[Belgian First Division A]]<br>[[Belgian First Division B]]\n| intl_list     = [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] <br> [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] <br> [[UEFA Super Cup|Super Cup]] <br>[[FIFA Club World Cup]]<br>[[FIFA World Cup]] (National Team)<br> [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] (National Team)<br> [[UEFA Nations League]] (National Team)\n| match         = \n| league        = \n}}\n[[Image:Stade Roi Baudouin.JPG|thumb|[[King Baudouin Stadium]] in Brussels.]]\n\n[[Football (soccer)|Football]], a sport which has been played in [[Belgium]] since the end of the 19th century, is the country's most popular [[sport]]. The [[Belgian Football Association|national association]] was founded in 1895 with the intention of bringing some order and organization to the sport. [[\u00c9vence Copp\u00e9e Trophy|The first match]] of the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]] was played on 1 May 1904, a 3\u20133 draw against [[France national football team|France]].\n\nTraditionally, the clubs [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] and [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] are the three most dominant domestic teams, all of them also having played and/or won one or more [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final(s). Except for Standard Li\u00e8ge and [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]], most professional clubs have Flemish backgrounds.\n\n== National style ==\nBoth the national football team and the top Belgium division have a reputation for physical play. This came as a result of a lack of technically skilled foreign players allowed to play in Belgium due to legal restrictions.  This changed after the [[Bosman ruling]] which forced the liberalization of the football player market in Europe.  In response, Belgian clubs began to buy unknown players from Eastern Europe, South America and Africa.  This had two contradictory consequences.  On the one hand, the national team was weakened by the reduced opportunity for native Belgium players to gain a spot on domestic teams.  On the other hand, the Jupiler League reinforced its status as an entry league for players who then move on to some of the greatest European clubs.<ref>{{cite web | last =Linhoff | first =Josef | title =Belgium: a Golden Generation is emerging | work =World Soccer | publisher =IPC Media | url =http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/belgium-a-golden-generation-is-emerging | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, some of the most talented players in Europe have played in Belgian clubs, including [[Yaya Tour\u00e9]], [[Jean-Pierre Papin]], [[Daniel Amokachi]], [[Antol\u00edn Alcaraz]] and [[David Rozehnal]] were discovered at [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]; [[Sunday Oliseh]] and [[Victor Ikpeba]] at [[RFC Li\u00e8ge]]; [[Jan Koller]], [[Nii Lamptey]] and [[Aruna Dindane]] at [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]]; and [[Mido (footballer)|Mido]] at [[K.A.A.

These include [[Jean-Marie Pfaff]], [[Eric Gerets]], [[Leo Clijsters]], [[Michel Preud'homme]], [[Georges Gr\u00fcn]], [[Philippe Albert]], [[Franky Van Der Elst]], [[Vincent Kompany]] and [[Thomas Vermaelen]]. In comparison, only few attacking Belgian footballers have received international recognition: [[Enzo Scifo]], [[Jan Ceulemans]], [[Marc Degryse]], [[Luc Nilis]] and [[\u00c9mile Mpenza]].\n\nHowever, this latter trend is slowly starting to change, with Belgium producing such offensive talents as [[Romelu Lukaku]], [[Eden Hazard]], [[Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9]], [[Christian Benteke]], [[Kevin Mirallas]], [[Marouane Fellaini]], [[Kevin De Bruyne]] and [[Dries Mertens]], among others.<ref name=\"heraldscotland1\">{{cite news | last =Grant | first =Michael | coauthors = | title =Reassuringly expensive: the small nation with big-priced talent | newspaper =The Herald |department=Herald Scotland: Sport: Football | publisher =Herald & Times Group | date =2013-09-04 | url =http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/reassuringly-expensive-the-small-nation-with-big-priced-talent.22068370 | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =McBain | first =Steven | title =Just how good are Belgium looking for the World Cup?  | work =The Roar: Football | publisher =The Roar | date =2013-10-17 | url =http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/10/17/just-how-good-are-belgium-looking-for-the-world-cup/ | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =Stewart | first =Kyle | title =To fix the Socceroos, follow the Belgium blueprint | work =The Roar: Football | publisher =The Roar | date =2013-10-16 | url =http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/10/16/to-fix-the-socceroos-follow-the-belgium-blueprint/ | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Swain | first =Craig | title =Belgian FA official reveals secret of national side's success | newspaper =Daily Record and Sunday Mail |department=Sport: Football: Footblall News: Scotland football team | publisher =Dailyrecord.co.uk | date =2012-10-19 | url =http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/belgian-fa-official-reveals-secret-1386421 | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Moore | first =Glenn | title =Eden Hazard, Christian Benteke and Marouane Fellaini have ensured the Belgians are back \u2013 but was it down to luck or good planning?  | newspaper =The Independent |department=Sport: Football: World Cup 2014 | publisher =independent.co.uk | date =2013-09-05 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/eden-hazard-christian-benteke-and-marouane-fellaini-have-ensured-the-belgians-are-back--but-was-it-down-to-luck-or-good-planning-8799006.html | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Austin | first =Daniel | title =Belgium football climbs to back toward the top | newspaper =Calgary Sun |department=Sports | publisher =Canoe Sun Media | date =2013-09-11 | url =http://www.calgarysun.com/2013/09/11/belgium-football-climbs-to-back-toward-the-top | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =Quisquater | first =Julian | title =Belgian talent exposes U.

In 1926, the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]] decided to introduce matricule numbers to tell the clubs apart and assigned a matricule to each existing club by order of registration. In this manner, [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Antwerp]] was awarded matricule number 1 as the first to register. As such, the oldest clubs in Belgium typically have the lowest matricule numbers, although there are clubs which registered only years after their origination and as a result have a much higher matricule than would be expected. Many clubs, especially those with very low numbers, consider their matricule number part of their heritage and past and prominently feature it in their logo or even name. In case a club dissolves, the matricule number of this club is removed permanently and lost forever as numbers are never reused.\n\nIn case of mergers, the new club must decide which matricule number to keep, it normally begins the championship at the level where the former club with the same matricule number should have begun the season. Typically, mergers result in the most famous club's matricule being kept alive. However, it has often occurred that a club with a glorious past or even (multiple) championship titles had to merge with another less successful club in order to survive, often due to financial difficulties. In this case, the matricule number of the club, and the honours linked to it, were lost with the merger. As an examples, in the late 1990s, seven-time champion [[K. Beerschot V.A.C.|K. Beerschot VAC]] was struggling with financial difficulties in the [[Belgian Third Division|third division]] and merged with then first division neighbour club KFC Germinal Ekeren to survive. The new club was named [[K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot|KFC Germinal Beerschot Antwerpen]] and started in the first division with the matricule number of KFC Germinal Ekeren, but lost the honours of K Beerschot VAC. The new club did keep playing in the Beerschot stadium and wore the purple shirt for which Beerschot was famously known. Another famous example is that of five-time champion [[R. Daring Club Molenbeek|Daring Club de Bruxelles]]' merger with RR White into [[R.W.D. Molenbeek|R White Daring Molenbeek]] in 1973.\n\nFrom the 2010s, matricules have been sold and traded, with clubs wanting to take over the position in a (higher) series of another club acquiring these matricules in order to quickly move up one or more divisions. Examples include [[BX Brussels]], which acquired the matricule of Bleid-Gaume in 2013, with the intent to transform and move the club from Bleid to Brussels, over 200 kilometres away. The Royal Belgian Football Association therefore enforced a new rule in 2016, stating that after a takeover, a club cannot move more than 30 kilometres from its original location.\n\nFrom 2017, the Belgian FA enforced another rule, which allows clubs to buy back their old defunct matricule, which was first done by [[K Lyra-Lierse Berlaar|Lyra]] (matricule 7776) who acquired the matricule 52 of the old defunct [[K. Lyra|Lyra]]. In 2018, [[Oud-Heverlee Leuven]], which is the result of a merger of three clubs around the city of [[Leuven]], changed its matricule number 6142 back to number 18 to honour the glorious past of its eldest predecessor.\n\nThe first few matricule numbers are:\n#[[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]]\n#[[Daring Club de Bruxelles]] (no longer active)\n#[[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]\n#[[RFC Li\u00e9geois]]\n#[[R. L\u00e9opold Uccle Forestoise]]\n#[[Racing Club de Bruxelles]]\n#[[K.A.A. Gent]]\n#[[R.C.S. Vervi\u00e9tois]]\n#[[R. Dolhain F.C.]]\n#[[R. Union Saint-Gilloise]]\n\n=== Naming ===\nA Belgian club's name usually includes the name of the town where the club plays as well as a prefix and/or suffix.  Since Belgians speak three languages, French and Dutch being the main ones and German being the third official language, Belgian teams may use either language as the basis for their names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/923-Europe/4963-language-barrier|title=When Saturday Comes \u2013 Language barrier|author=WSC 267 May 09|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> For historical reasons, many Flemish clubs changed their names from French to Dutch between the beginning of the 20th century and the late 1960s. Additionally, many clubs have experienced frequent name changes. Reasons for these include a language change, a merger, an anniversary, etc. Because of the numerous mergers between Belgian clubs, team names sometimes combine several town names (such as [[K. Beringen-Heusden-Zolder]] or [[Sporting West Ingelmunster-Harelbeke]]) which reflect mergers. In recent history, clubs representing immigrant communities have come into existence and sometimes use names that are in neither of Belgium's official languages (the now defunct clubs T\u00fcrkgucun Ozburun and T\u00fcrkiyemspor Zaventem, or the still-existing Agrupaci\u00f3n Oviedo-Asturiana, existing only in a league outside the Belgian FA now, from Brussels, being examples).\n\nFinally, a team which exists for at least 50 years may add the prefix \"Royal\" to its name (either in [[English language|English]] or in the team's language). Before 1958, this right was given to any team that celebrated its 25th year of existence. Between 1958 and 1968, the rule was changed to grant the title to any team with at least 35 years of existence. Since 1968, the time limit has increased to 50 years.\n\nThe following is a partial list of common football club name prefixes and suffixes in Belgium's two main languages.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Kortrijk|KV Kortrijk]], [[K.V. Oostende|KV Oostende]] and [[S.V. Zulte Waregem|SV Zulte-Waregem]]), and one clubs plays in the First Division B ([[K.S.V. Roeselare|KSV Roeselare]]).\n\n=== East Flanders ===\nTwo clubs from [[East Flanders]] currently play in the First Division A ([[K.A.A. Gent|AA Gent]] and [[Waasland-Beveren]]). [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|KSC Lokeren]] were relegated from the First Division A after the [[2018\u201319 Belgian First Division A|2018-19 season]] and as such, they will compete in the First Division B in 2019-20.\n\n=== Antwerp ===\nThe province of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]] has an old tradition of football. The first Belgian clubs were established in the city of [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] (Antwerp Lyon's Club, A.S. Anvers-Borgerhout, and most notably [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], which is the country's oldest club and which is affectionately referred to as the \"Great Old\" by its supporters and the media).\n\nTwo clubs from this province currently play in the top flight: [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] and [[KV Mechelen]], while [[K.V.C. Westerlo|KVC Westerlo]] and [[K Beerschot VA|Beerschot]] play in the First Division B.\n\n=== Limburg ===\nTwo clubs from [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] currently play in the First Division A: [[K.R.C. Genk|KRC Genk]] and [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truiden]]. Additionally, one club represents the province in First Division B: [[Lommel SK]].\n\n=== Brussels ===\nTechnically-speaking, [[Brussels]] is not a province but rather an autonomous administrative (sub-)urban region within the province of [[Flemish Brabant]]. Only one currently active club from Brussels plays in First Division A, [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], also the country's most successful club to date.\n\nThe first-ever Belgian League Championship was made up out of seven teams, four of which were based in Brussels: [[Racing Club de Bruxelles|Racing Club]], [[L\u00e9opold Club de Bruxelles|L\u00e9opold Club Uccle]], [[Sporting Club de Bruxelles|Sporting Club]] and [[Union d'Ixelles]]. L\u00e9opold Club was a club for the nobility and bourgeoisie in Brussels and is still active after no less than four mergers between 1982 and 2001 (they are currently playing in the [[Belgian Promotion|Fourth Division]]). The latter two clubs ceased to exist in 1897 and 1901 respectively and were replaced by a new Brussels-based club ([[Union Saint-Gilloise|Royale Union Saint-Gilloise]]), which would become a dominant force in Belgian football during the following seasons, winning seven titles between 1903 and 1913. The club originally shared a rivalry with Racing Club and later [[R. Daring Club Molenbeek|Daring Club]], which would go on and win the title in 1912. Later, Anderlecht became their biggest rival for citywide bragging rights.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], Belgian football was dominated by clubs from Antwerp and Bruges. From the early 1930s, however, Union and Daring divided five titles between themselves. The rivalry between the two clubs has inspired a stage play named ''Bossemans et Coppenolle'' (\"Bossemans\" was the name of the Union head coach, \"Coppenolle\" his counterpart at Daring). Shortly after [[World War II]], Anderlecht replaced Union and Daring as the dominant team in Brussels. Its cross-city rivals at the time were, in succession, Union, Daring and Racing White, later renamed [[R.W.D. Molenbeek|R.W.D.M.]], still later named [[FC Brussels]]. The latter were liquidated in 2014 and revived a year later as [[RWDM47]]. [[R.W.S. Bruxelles|White Star Bruxelles]], a club from the Brussels suburban region, technically won promotion to the top flight after the [[2015\u201316 Belgian Second Division|2015-16 season]] but due to the club's debts, both the [[Royal Belgian Football Association|Belgian FA]] and the courts did not award them a licence to practice professional football. As a result, the club were relegated to the [[Belgian First Amateur Division|First Amateur Division]] and were ultimately wound up in October 2017.\n\n[[Union Saint-Gilloise|Royale Union Saint-Gilloise]], currently in the First Division B, is the only Brussels club at that level in 2019\u201320.\n\n=== Flemish Brabant ===\nOnly one club from [[Flemish Brabant]] is currently active in the top two divisions of Belgian football, [[Oud-Heverlee Leuven]], playing in the First Division B.\n\n=== Walloon Brabant ===\nAfter the [[2018\u201319 Belgian First Division B|2018-19 season]], [[A.F.C. Tubize|AFC Tubize]] were relegation to the [[Belgian First Amateur Division|First Amateur Division]] and as a result, no club from [[Walloon Brabant]] plays in the top two divisions of Belgian football in 2019-20.\n\n=== Hainaut ===\nTwo teams from [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] are currently playing in First Division A: [[Royal Excel Mouscron|Excel Mouscron]] and [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi SC]].\n\n=== Namur ===\nThe province of [[Namur (province)|Namur]] is, along with that of Luxembourg, the province with the least prestigious football history in Belgium. Currently, no clubs from the province of Namur are playing in the top two levels of Belgian football. Furthermore, no club from this province has ever played in the top flight.\n\n=== Li\u00e8ge ===\n[[RFC Li\u00e8ge]] won the first-ever Belgian title in 1896. The club struggled financially during the early years of the 21st century and was eventually dissolved in 2011. A new club was formed, which is currently competing in the [[Belgian First Amateur Division|First Amateur Division]].\n\nCurrently, two clubs from the province of [[Li\u00e8ge (province)|Li\u00e8ge]] are competing in First Division A, [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] and [[K.A.S. Eupen|KAS Eupen]]. The latter is the only club from the country's German-speaking region ever to have competed in the top flight. They first played at the top level in 2010\u201311 but were relegated after that season, before returning after the 2016\u201317 season. No team from the province is currently in the First Division B.\n\nHistorically, [[RFC Li\u00e8ge]] (five titles between 1895 and 1953) and [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] (ten titles between 1958 and 2009) are the province's most successful, well-known and popular clubs.\n\n=== Luxembourg ===\nOnly one club from the province of [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]] will plays in the top two levels of Belgian football: [[Excelsior Virton]], who won promotion to the First Division B after the [[2018\u201319 Belgian First Amateur Division|2018-19 season]]. No club from this province has ever played in the top flight. Former Belgian international [[Philippe Albert]] ([[Bouillon]]) and current international [[Thomas Meunier]] ([[Sainte-Ode]]) were born in the province.\n\n== League system ==\n{{Main article|Belgian football league system}}\nAs of the 2016\u201317 season, the Belgian football league pyramid has nine levels. The FA dramatically overhauled the league system after the 2015\u201316 season, reducing the number of professional teams to 24 and introducing a nationwide amateur league for the first time.\n\n'''Nationwide leagues:'''\n\n# [[Belgian First Division A|First Division A]] (renamed from \"Pro League\" after the 2015\u201316 season)\n# [[Belgian First Division B|First Division B]] \u2013 replaced the former Second Division for 2016\u201317\n# [[Belgian First Amateur Division|First Amateur Division]] \u2013 introduced for 2016\u201317\n\n'''Regional leagues:'''\n# [[Belgian Second Amateur Division|Second Amateur Division]] (three leagues, two for Flemish clubs and one for Francophone clubs, with Flemish teams assigned loosely on geographic location)\n# [[Belgian Third Amateur Division|Third Amateur Division]] (four leagues, two each for Flemish clubs and Francophone clubs, with all teams assigned loosely on geographic location)\n\n'''Provincial leagues:'''\n# Provincial Division 1\n# Provincial Division 2\n# Provincial Division 3\n# Provincial Division 4\n\nEach provincial subdivision of the FA runs its own 4-division league. Only teams that are geographically located in a certain province are allowed to compete in the corresponding provincial league. To include as well teams from the capital region of [[Brussels]] (which is not a [[Provinces of Belgium|province]] by itself and also does not belong to a province), teams from Brussels, [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Walloon Brabant]] are split into two similar leagues based on their language. As a result there are two \"provincial\" leagues corresponding to the former [[Province of Brabant]]: one Brabant \"provincial\" league for Flemish clubs (including all Flemish clubs from Brussels, Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant) and a Brabant \"provincial\" league for Francophone clubs (including all Francophone clubs from Brussels, Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant). The majority of the clubs from the Brussels capital region are Francophone, de-facto resulting in two provincial leagues roughly corresponding to Flemish Brabant one on hand; and Walloon Brabant and Brussels on the other hand.\n\n== European Competitions ==\n\n=== UEFA Champions League ===\nThe following teams have qualified for the group stage in the [[UEFA Champions League]]:\n\n*[[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] (6 times: [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1992\u201393]], [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League|2002\u201303]], [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|2003\u201304]], [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306]], [[2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League|2016\u201317]], [[2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League|2018\u201319]])\n*[[R.S.C.

Examples of amateur leagues with a long tradition include the KVV (Koninklijke Vlaamse Voetbalbond) organising provincial leagues in all Flemish provinces save for West-Vlaanderen; the MTSA for the area Dendermonde-Aalst-Denderstreek; the LVVB Melle for the area Wetteren-Ghent (with some clubs outside this area); the LVV Meetjesland for the Meetjesland area and few clubs from Ghent, the Corporative Leagues in several provinces mainly intended for company teams (although sometimes also including general amateur teams), the WALIVO in the Waasland area, the ABSSA and Travailliste leagues in Brussels and surrounding areas, \u2026 The system is complex as some of these regional leagues are affiliated to the Belgian FA (sometimes their member clubs receive a matricule number) but the leagues are totally separate from the league system in the leagues directly run by the Belgian FA (described above).<ref name=\"heraldscotland1\" /><ref>{{Citation | last =Adams | first =Tim | title =Why Belgium Is The Hottest Country in Football | work =Esquire | department =Culture: Features | publisher =Hearst Magazines UK | date =2013-08-24 | url =http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/features/3834/why-belgium-has-the-most-exciting-footballers-in-the-world/ | accessdate =2013-11-19 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130919103648/http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/features/3834/why-belgium-has-the-most-exciting-footballers-in-the-world/ | archive-date =2013-09-19 | url-status =dead }}</ref> Some other amateur leagues operate totally separate from the Belgian FA with no connection to the Belgian FA in any ways. Amateur leagues are in decline in some areas due to the competition from the general Belgian FA-run leagues and due to long travel distances being unpractical at amateur level. Several clubs who started in amateur leagues have made the transfer to the leagues run directly by the Belgian FA (starting at the lowest level). Some of these clubs even managed to, after a while, reach a relatively high level of the Belgian pyramid. Many amateur leagues in the past were tied to a political ideology, and Catholic, Socialist and Liberal amateur leagues existed. Nowadays most amateur leagues are based upon geographic area rather than on political ideologies.<ref>{{Citation | last =Da Saliva | first =Michael | coauthors = | title =Belgium's next generation of footballers on the rise | work =alpha |department=Sport: football | publisher =Al Nisr Publishing LLC | date =2013-04-02 | url =http://gulfnews.com/sport/football/belgium-s-next-generation-of-footballers-on-the-rise-1.1165695 | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Masters | first =James | title =2014 World Cup: Is Belgium football's coming force? | newspaper =CNN |department=World Sport | publisher =Cable News Network | date =2013-10-13 | url =http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/10/sport/football/football-belgium-dembele-world-cup/ | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Brassell | first =Andy | title =Vincent Kompany & Eden Hazard lead the Belgium revolution | newspaper =BBC |department=Football | publisher =BBC | date =2012-11-13 | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20052636 | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Mogan | first =Tony | title =Belgian Football's Lone Englishman Jonny Rowell on Life in European Football's Flourishing Nation | newspaper =International Business Times |department=Sports & Stars | publisher =International Business Times | date =2013-10-24 | url =http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/516688/20131024/jonny-rowell-belgium-begian-football-newcastle-united.htm | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}</ref>\n\n== Indoor football ==\n\n{{Main article|Futsal in Belgium}}\n\nIn Belgium, the Belgian FA also runs a nationwide Futsal league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/futsaleuro/news/newsid=2041601.html|title=Degryse: Futsal EURO is special for Belgium|date=27 January 2014|work=UEFA.com|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> Clubs are given a matricule number as well, although a separate one than the matricule numbers assigned to the clubs in outdoor football. Usually the letter A is in front of the matricule number to indicate an indoor club. A separate indoor football league is organised by the BZVB (Belgische Zaalvoetbal Bond, translated as Belgian Indoor Football Association), this is not tied to the Belgian FA. Both of these leagues run at the same moment but without any interaction with each other.\n\nIn addition, Mini Football is popular in Belgium (this has different rules all together than Futsal) and this league is run by a separate FA dealing with mini football only.\n\n== Women's football ==\n{{Main article|Women's football in Belgium|Super League Vrouwenvoetbal}}\n{{see also|BeNe League}}\n\nBoth the Belgian FA and several regional amateur football leagues run a league for women. The league operated by the Belgian FA consists of three nationwide levels, with several levels per province below. The Belgian FA started to organise women's football in the early seventies, due to the UEFA obligating every member FA to organise leagues for women as well as for men. In the beginning the Belgian FA discouraged women to play football and advised them to opt for sports such as volleyball. The first season only existing clubs (with male teams) could enrol a female team in the league. As popularity of women's football grew and more and more teams wanted to play in the league, the Belgian FA dropped the above rule and accepted new clubs to affiliate who only focussed on ladies' football. These clubs are assigned matricule numbers just like any other club, and meanwhile women's football is fully integrated in the Belgian football structure. However, the league is not professional as yet (only a few female players have been full-time professionals) and the national team is amongst the weaker teams in Europe due to other countries such as Germany, Norway, Sweden having fully professional women's leagues. Clubs who have been successful in past or present in Belgian women's football include Brussels Dames '71 (currently the women's team of Anderlecht), Rapide Wezemaal, Astro Begijnendijk, Eva's Kumtich, Sinaai Girls, Standard F\u00e9mina Li\u00e8ge, Dames Eendracht Aalst (previously tied to the club KSC Eendracht Aalst which was also successful in men's football).\n\nIn the early 2010s, plans existed to develop a new super league where existing clubs with professional men's teams would enroll a women's team. Eventually, the Belgian and Dutch FAs launched a joint top-level league, the [[BeNe League]], in 2012. Before the launch of this league, several famous clubs had created women's teams, such as Club Brugge, Lierse SK, Germinal Beerschot Antwerpen, and St-Truidense VV. After the 2014\u201315 season, the two countries chose to disband the BeNe League and relaunch their own national top flights; the Dutch revived their women's [[Eredivisie (women)|Eredivisie]], while Belgium chose instead to create a totally new top flight, the [[Super League Vrouwenvoetbal|Super League]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of football stadiums in Belgium]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Association football in Belgium}}\n*{{in lang|en}} [http://users.skynet.be/pluto/Textbelgium/Teams.html RSSSF archive] \u2013 Belgian clubs history\n* {{in lang|en}} [http://www.league321.com/belgium-football.html League321.com] \u2013 Belgian Football League Tables, Records & Statistics Database.\n*{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.bsdb.be/ Belgian Soccer Database] \u2013 Extensive database about players, clubs, results and other historical statistics\n\n{{Football in Belgium}}\n{{Football in Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Football in Belgium| ]]\n", "name_user": "69.124.194.40", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eNational style)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Belgium"}

This procedure, often known as ''the sequence rules'', is the heart of the CIP system.\n#Compare the [[atomic number]] (''Z'') of the atoms directly attached to the stereocenter; the group having the atom of higher atomic number receives higher priority.\n#If there is a tie, we must consider the atoms at distance 2 from the stereocenter\u2014as a list is made for each group of the atoms bonded to the one directly attached to the stereocenter. Each list is arranged in order of decreasing atomic number. Then the lists are compared atom by atom; at the earliest difference, the group containing the atom of higher atomic number receives higher priority.\n#If there is still a tie, each atom in each of the two lists is replaced with a sublist of the other atoms bonded to it (at distance 3 from the stereocenter), the sublists are arranged in decreasing order of atomic number, and the entire structure is again compared atom by atom. This process is repeated recursively, each time with atoms one bond farther from the stereocenter, until the tie is broken.\n\n====Isotopes====\nIf two groups differ only in [[isotope]]s, then the larger [[atomic mass]] is used to set the priority.\n\n====Double and triple bonds====\n[[File:Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Double Bond.png|thumb|This example showcases the \"divide and duplicate rule\" for double bonds. The vinyl group (C=C) or alkene portion has a higher priority over the alkane (C\u2212C) portion.]]\nIf an atom A is double-bonded to an atom B, A is treated as being singly bonded to two atoms: B and a \"ghost atom\" that is a duplicate of B (has the same atomic number) but is not attached to anything except A. When B is replaced with a list of attached atoms, A itself, but not its \"ghost\", is excluded in accordance with the general principle of not doubling back along a bond that has just been followed. A triple bond is handled the same way except that A and B are each connected to two ghost atoms of the other.<ref name=\"IUPAC\" />{{Rp|28}}\n\n==== Geometric isomers ====\nIf two substituents on an atom are [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|geometric isomers]] of each other, the ''Z''-isomer has higher priority than the ''E''-isomer.\n\n====Cyclic molecules====\nTo handle a molecule containing one or more [[Cyclic molecule|cycles]], one must first expand it into a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] (called a '''hierarchical digraph''') by traversing bonds in all possible paths starting at the stereocenter. When the traversal encounters an atom through which the current path has already passed, a ghost atom is generated in order to keep the tree finite. A single atom of the original molecule may appear in many places (some as ghosts, some not) in the tree.<ref name=\"ciprev1982\">{{cite journal |last1=Prelog |first1=Vladlmir |last2=Helmchen |first2=Guenter |title=Basic Principles of the CIP-System and Proposals for a Revision |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English |date=August 1982 |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=567\u2013583 |doi=10.1002/anie.198205671 }}</ref>{{rp|at=3}}\n\n=== Assigning descriptors ===\n\n==== Stereocenters: ''R''/''S'' ====\n[[File:CIP system example.svg|thumb|Two examples of stereocenters.

The priorities are assigned based on [[atomic number]] (''Z''): [[iodine]] (''Z'' = 53) > [[bromine]] (''Z'' = 35) > [[chlorine]] (''Z'' = 17) > [[fluorine]] (''Z'' = 9). Allowing fluorine (lowest priority) to point away from the viewer the rotation is clockwise hence the ''R'' assignment.\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"| [[File:L-serine-skeletal.png|center|120px]]\n| bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" valign=\"top\" | In the assignment of [[L-Serine|<small>L</small>-serine]] highest priority is given to the [[nitrogen]] atom (''Z'' = 7) in the [[amino group]] (NH<sub>2</sub>). Both the [[hydroxymethyl]] group (CH<sub>2</sub>OH) and the [[carboxylic acid]] group (COOH) have carbon atoms (''Z'' = 6) but priority is given to the latter because the carbon atom in the COOH group is connected to a second oxygen (''Z'' = 8) whereas in the CH<sub>2</sub>OH group [[carbon]] is connected to a [[hydrogen]] atom (''Z'' = 1). Lowest priority is given to the hydrogen atom and as this atom points away from the viewer the counterclockwise decrease in priority over the three remaining substituents completes the assignment as ''S''.  \n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"| [[File:(S)-Carvone.svg|center|80px]]\n|bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" valign=top| The stereocenter in [[Carvone|(''S'')-carvone]] is connected to one hydrogen atom (not shown, priority 4) and three carbon atoms. The [[isopropene|isopropenyl]] group has priority 1 (carbon atoms only) and for the two remaining carbon atoms priority is decided with the carbon atoms two bonds removed from the stereocenter, one part of the [[ketone|keto]] group (O, O, C, priority 2) and one part of an alkene (C, C, H, priority 3). The resulting counterclockwise rotation results in ''S''.\n|}\n\n== Describing multiple centers ==\nIf a compound has more than one stereocenter each center is denoted by either ''R'' or ''S''. For example, [[ephedrine]] exists with both (1''R'',2''S'') and (1''S'',2''R'') configuration, known as [[enantiomer]]s. This compound also exists with a (1''R'',2''R'') and (1''S'',2''S'') configuration. The last two stereoisomers are not ephedrine, but [[pseudoephedrine]]. All isomers are 2-methylamino-1-phenyl-1-propanol in systematic nomenclature. Pseudoephedrine is chemically distinct from ephedrine with only the three-dimensional configuration in space, as notated by the Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog rules. The two compounds, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, are [[diastereomers]], or stereoisomers that are not enantiomers. They have different names because, as diastereomers, they have different chemical properties.\n\nIn pairs of enantiomers, all descriptors are opposite: (''R'',''R'') and (''S'',''S''), or (''R'',''S'') and (''S'',''R''). Diastereomers have one descriptor in common: (''R'',''S'') and (''R'',''R''), or (''S'',''R'') and (''S'',''S''). This holds true for compounds with more than two stereocenters; if at least one descriptor is the same in both pairs, the compounds are diastereomers. If all the stereocenters are opposite, they are enantiomers.\n\n== Relative configuration ==\nThe relative configuration of two [[stereoisomer]]s may be denoted by the descriptors ''R'' and ''S'' with an [[asterisk]] (*). (''R''*,''R''*) means two centers having identical configurations, (''R'',''R'') or (''S'',''S''); (''R''*,''S''*) means two centers having opposite configurations, (''R'',''S'') or (''S'',''R''). To begin, the lowest-numbered (according to IUPAC systematic numbering) stereogenic center is given the ''R''* descriptor.\n\nTo designate two [[anomer]]s the relative stereodescriptors alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) are used. In the \u03b1 anomer the ''anomeric carbon atom'' and the ''reference atom'' do have opposite configurations (''R'',''S'') or (''S'',''R''), whereas in the \u03b2 anomer they are the same (''R'',''R'') or (''S'',''S'').<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=Relative Configuration|file=R05260}}</ref>\n\n== Faces ==\n[[Image:RefaceAndSiFace.png|400px|thumb|right|[[Acetophenone]] and [[\u03b1-phenylethanol]]]]\nStereochemistry also plays a role assigning ''faces'' to trigonal molecules such as [[ketone]]s. A [[nucleophile]] in a [[nucleophilic addition]] can approach the [[carbonyl]] group from two opposite sides or faces. When an achiral nucleophile attacks [[acetone]], both faces are identical and there is only one reaction product. When the nucleophile attacks [[butanone]], the faces are not identical (''[[enantiotopic]]'') and a [[Racemic mixture|racemic product]] results. When the nucleophile is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] molecule [[diastereoisomer]]s are formed. When one face of a molecule is shielded by substituents or geometric constraints compared to the other face the faces are called [[diastereotopic]]. The same rules that determine the stereochemistry of a stereocenter (''R'' or ''S'') also apply when assigning the face of a molecular group. The faces are then called the '''''Re''-face''' and '''''Si''-face'''. In the example displayed on the right, the compound [[acetophenone]] is viewed from the ''Re''-face. Hydride addition as in a reduction process from this side will form the (''S'')-enantiomer and attack from the opposite ''Si''-face will give the (''R'')-enantiomer.  However, one should note that adding a chemical group to the prochiral center from the ''Re''-face will not always lead to an (''S'')-stereocenter, as the priority of the chemical group has to be taken into account. That is, the absolute stereochemistry of the product is determined on its own and not by considering which face it was attacked from.  In the above-mentioned example, if [[chloride]] (''Z'' = 17) were added to the prochiral center from the ''Re''-face, this would result in an (''R'')-enantiomer.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Navbox stereochemistry}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priority Rules}}\n[[Category:Chemical nomenclature]]\n[[Category:Stereochemistry]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=February 2016}}\n<!--This article is in US English-->\n\n[[Image:CIP priority diagram.png|thumb|320px|right|An example of the prioritisation of structure within the CIP system.

This procedure, often known as ''the sequence rules'', is the heart of the CIP system.\n#Compare the [[atomic number]] (''Z'') of the atoms directly attached to the stereocenter; the group having the atom of higher atomic number receives higher priority.\n#If there is a tie, we must consider the atoms at distance 2 from the stereocenter\u2014as a list is made for each group of the atoms bonded to the one directly attached to the stereocenter. Each list is arranged in order of decreasing atomic number. Then the lists are compared atom by atom; at the earliest difference, the group containing the atom of higher atomic number receives higher priority.\n#If there is still a tie, each atom in each of the two lists is replaced with a sublist of the other atoms bonded to it (at distance 3 from the stereocenter), the sublists are arranged in decreasing order of atomic number, and the entire structure is again compared atom by atom. This process is repeated recursively, each time with atoms one bond farther from the stereocenter, until the tie is broken.\n\n====Isotopes====\nIf two groups differ only in [[isotope]]s, then the larger [[atomic mass]] is used to set the priority.\n\n====Double and triple bonds====\n[[File:Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Double Bond.png|thumb|This example showcases the \"divide and duplicate rule\" for double bonds. The vinyl group (C=C) or alkene portion has a higher priority over the alkane (C\u2212C) portion.]]\nIf an atom A is double-bonded to an atom B, A is treated as being singly bonded to two atoms: B and a \"ghost atom\" that is a duplicate of B (has the same atomic number) but is not attached to anything except A. When B is replaced with a list of attached atoms, A itself, but not its \"ghost\", is excluded in accordance with the general principle of not doubling back along a bond that has just been followed. A triple bond is handled the same way except that A and B are each connected to two ghost atoms of the other.<ref name=\"IUPAC\" />{{Rp|28}}\n\n==== Geometric isomers ====\nIf two substituents on an atom are [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|geometric isomers]] of each other, the ''Z''-isomer has higher priority than the ''E''-isomer.\n\n====Cyclic molecules====\nTo handle a molecule containing one or more [[Cyclic molecule|cycles]], one must first expand it into a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] (called a '''hierarchical digraph''') by traversing bonds in all possible paths starting at the stereocenter. When the traversal encounters an atom through which the current path has already passed, a ghost atom is generated in order to keep the tree finite. A single atom of the original molecule may appear in many places (some as ghosts, some not) in the tree.<ref name=\"ciprev1982\">{{cite journal |last1=Prelog |first1=Vladlmir |last2=Helmchen |first2=Guenter |title=Basic Principles of the CIP-System and Proposals for a Revision |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English |date=August 1982 |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=567\u2013583 |doi=10.1002/anie.198205671 }}</ref>{{rp|at=3}}\n\n=== Assigning descriptors ===\n\n==== Stereocenters: ''R''/''S'' ====\n[[File:CIP system example.svg|thumb|Two examples of stereocenters.

The two compounds, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, are [[diastereomers]], or stereoisomers that are not enantiomers. They have different names because, as diastereomers, they have different chemical properties.\n\nIn pairs of enantiomers, all descriptors are opposite: (''R'',''R'') and (''S'',''S''), or (''R'',''S'') and (''S'',''R''). Diastereomers have one descriptor in common: (''R'',''S'') and (''R'',''R''), or (''S'',''R'') and (''S'',''S''). This holds true for compounds with more than two stereocenters; if at least one descriptor is the same in both pairs, the compounds are diastereomers. If all the stereocenters are opposite, they are enantiomers.\n\n== Relative configuration ==\nThe relative configuration of two [[stereoisomer]]s may be denoted by the descriptors ''R'' and ''S'' with an [[asterisk]] (*). (''R''*,''R''*) means two centers having identical configurations, (''R'',''R'') or (''S'',''S''); (''R''*,''S''*) means two centers having opposite configurations, (''R'',''S'') or (''S'',''R''). To begin, the lowest-numbered (according to IUPAC systematic numbering) stereogenic center is given the ''R''* descriptor.\n\nTo designate two [[anomer]]s the relative stereodescriptors alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) are used. In the \u03b1 anomer the ''anomeric carbon atom'' and the ''reference atom'' do have opposite configurations (''R'',''S'') or (''S'',''R''), whereas in the \u03b2 anomer they are the same (''R'',''R'') or (''S'',''S'').<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=Relative Configuration|file=R05260}}</ref>\n\n== Faces ==\n[[Image:RefaceAndSiFace.png|400px|thumb|right|[[Acetophenone]] and [[\u03b1-phenylethanol]]]]\nStereochemistry also plays a role assigning ''faces'' to trigonal molecules such as [[ketone]]s. A [[nucleophile]] in a [[nucleophilic addition]] can approach the [[carbonyl]] group from two opposite sides or faces. When an achiral nucleophile attacks [[acetone]], both faces are identical and there is only one reaction product. When the nucleophile attacks [[butanone]], the faces are not identical (''[[enantiotopic]]'') and a [[Racemic mixture|racemic product]] results. When the nucleophile is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] molecule [[diastereoisomer]]s are formed. When one face of a molecule is shielded by substituents or geometric constraints compared to the other face the faces are called [[diastereotopic]]. The same rules that determine the stereochemistry of a stereocenter (''R'' or ''S'') also apply when assigning the face of a molecular group. The faces are then called the '''''Re''-face''' and '''''Si''-face'''. In the example displayed on the right, the compound [[acetophenone]] is viewed from the ''Re''-face. Hydride addition as in a reduction process from this side will form the (''S'')-enantiomer and attack from the opposite ''Si''-face will give the (''R'')-enantiomer.  However, one should note that adding a chemical group to the prochiral center from the ''Re''-face will not always lead to an (''S'')-stereocenter, as the priority of the chemical group has to be taken into account. That is, the absolute stereochemistry of the product is determined on its own and not by considering which face it was attacked from.  In the above-mentioned example, if [[chloride]] (''Z'' = 17) were added to the prochiral center from the ''Re''-face, this would result in an (''R'')-enantiomer.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Navbox stereochemistry}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priority Rules}}\n[[Category:Chemical nomenclature]]\n[[Category:Stereochemistry]]\n", "name_user": "SimonDeDanser", "label": "safe", "comment": "Ligancy = Coordination number", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Ingold%E2%80%93Prelog_priority_rules"}

After the ship was taken into custody by the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], Cinqu\u00e9 and his fellow Africans were eventually tried for mutiny and killing officers on the ship, in a case known as ''[[United States v. The Amistad]]''. This reached the U.S. Supreme Court, where Cinqu\u00e9 and his fellow Africans were found to have rightfully defended themselves from being enslaved through the illegal [[Atlantic slave trade]] and were released. Americans helped raise money for the return of 35 of the survivors to Sierra Leone.\n\n==Biography==\nCinqu\u00e9 was born [[circa|c.]] 1814 in what is now [[Sierra Leone]]. His exact date of birth remains unknown. He was a rice farmer, and married with three children, when he was captured illegally by [[African slave trade]]rs in 1839 and sold to [[Pedro Blanco (slave trader)|Pedro Blanco]], a Spanish slave trader. He was imprisoned on the Portuguese [[slave ship]] ''[[Tecora]]'', in violation of treaties prohibiting the international slave trade. Cinqu\u00e9 was taken to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], where he was sold with 110 others to [[Spain|Spaniard]]s Jos\u00e9 Ruiz and Pedro Montez.\n\nThe Spaniards arranged to transport the captives on the coastal [[schooner]] ''[[Amistad (ship)|Amistad]]'', with the intention of selling them as slaves at ports along the coast in Cuba for work at [[sugar plantation]]s. On June 30, Cinqu\u00e9 led a revolt, killing the captain and the cook of the ship; two slaves also died, and two sailors escaped. The Africans took Ruiz and Montez as prisoners, the merchants who had purchased them, and demanded that they direct the ship back to Sierra Leone. Instead, at night, they directed the navigator in the opposite direction, toward the Americas, in the hope of attracting the attention of one of their fellow Spaniards who would save their ship and regain control. The ship had an uneven course between the coasts of the United States and Africa. After about two months, ''Amistad'' reached United States waters near [[Long Island, New York]]. Members of the [[USS Washington (1837)|USS ''Washington'']] boarded the vessel. When they discovered what had happened (according to the Spaniards), they charged the Africans with [[mutiny]] and murder. The ship and the Mende were taken to [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] to await trial.\n\n[[File:Joseph Cinque.jpg|thumb|left|225px|A print of Cinqu\u00e9 that appeared in ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'' on August 31, 1839]]The two Spaniards claimed that the Africans had been born in Cuba and were already slaves at the time of their purchase, and were therefore legal property. Interpreters from [[Mende language|Mende]] to [[English language|English]] were found, who enabled the Africans to tell their story to attorneys and the court. Cinqu\u00e9 served as the group's informal representative.\n\nAfter the case was ruled in favor of the Africans in the district and circuit courts, the case was appealed by the Spanish parties, including its government, to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In March 1841, the Supreme Court ruled that the Africans mutinied to regain their freedom after being kidnapped and sold illegally. The advocacy of former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John Quincy Adams]],<ref>''[[The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution]]'', page 393-394</ref> together with [[Roger Sherman Baldwin]], was critical to the Africans' defense. The court ordered the Africans freed and returned to Africa, if they wished. This decision was against the protests of President [[Martin Van Buren]], who worried about relations with Spain and implications for domestic slavery.\n\nCinqu\u00e9 and the other Mende reached their homeland in 1842. In Sierra Leone, Cinqu\u00e9 encountered  civil war.  He and his company maintained contact with the local mission for a while, but Cinqu\u00e9 left to trade along the coast.

George and Harold wake up to find that their doubles from the slight future, along with Tony, Orlando, and Dawn, are gone. They search in their tree house, but find some of their old Dog Man comics and have a good laugh. Harold feels that he and George should make another Captain Underpants comic book, but George decides that he and Harold should scrap the Captain Underpants comics and do a comic book featuring Dog Man instead, hence this book.\n\nOne day, a cop named Officer Knight and his police dog Greg got seriously injured in an explosion by a bomb assembled by Petey the evil cat.

They have equilibrium shapes that froze in place some time ago, and do not match the shapes that equilibrium bodies would have at their current rotation rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/3389.html|title=Iapetus' peerless equatorial ridge|author=|date=|website=www.planetary.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Thus Ceres, at 950&nbsp;km in diameter, is the smallest body for which gravitational measurements indicate current hydrostatic equilibrium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2015/dps15-1112-ceres.html|title=DPS 2015: First reconnaissance of Ceres by Dawn|author=|date=|website=www.planetary.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Much larger objects, such as Earth's moon, are not near hydrostatic equilibrium today,<ref>Garrick-Bethell et al.

Saturn's moons may have been subject to a thermal history that would have produced equilibrium-like shapes in bodies too small for gravity alone to do so. Thus, at present it is unknown whether any trans-Neptunian objects smaller than Pluto and Eris are in hydrostatic equilibrium.<ref name=\"Grundy2019\" />  The IAU has not addressed this issue since these findings.\n\nThe majority of mid-sized TNOs up to about 900 or 1000&nbsp;km in diameter have significantly lower (1-1.2&nbsp;gm/ml) densities than larger bodies such as Pluto (1.86&nbsp;gm/ml). Brown had speculated that this was due to their composition, that they were almost entirely icy. However, Grundy et al. point out that there is no known mechanism or evolutionary pathway for mid-sized bodies to be icy while both larger and smaller objects are partially rocky. They demonstrated that at the prevailing temperatures of the Kuiper Belt, water ice is quite brittle and is thus strong enough to support open interior spaces (interstices) in objects of this size; they thus concluded that they have low densities for the same reason that smaller objects do\u2014because they have not compacted under self-gravity into fully solid objects, and thus the typical object smaller than 900 or 1000&nbsp;km in diameter is (pending some other formative mechanism) unlikely to be a dwarf planet.\n\n=== <span id=\"Probable per Tancredi\"></span>Tancredi's assessment ===\n\nIn 2010, [[Gonzalo Tancredi]] presented a report to the IAU evaluating a list of 46 candidates for dwarf planet status based on [[light-curve]]-amplitude analysis and the assumption that the object was more than {{convert|450|km|mi}} in diameter. Some diameters are measured, some are best-fit estimates, and others use an assumed albedo of 0.10. Of these, he identified 15 as dwarf planets by his criteria (including the 4 accepted by the IAU), with another 9 being considered possible.

Brown|Mike Brown]] considers a large number of trans-Neptunian bodies, ranked by estimated size, to be \"probably\" dwarf planets.<ref name=\"brown-list\"/> He did not consider asteroids, stating \"In the asteroid belt Ceres, with a diameter of 900&nbsp;km, is the only object large enough to be round\".<ref name=\"brown-list\" />\n\nThe terms for varying degrees of likelihood he split these into:\n*''Near certainty'': diameter estimated/measured to be over {{convert|900|km|mi}}. Sufficient confidence to say these must be in hydrostatic equilibrium, even if predominantly rocky.\n*''Highly likely'': diameter estimated/measured to be over {{convert|600|km|mi}}. The size would have to be \"grossly in error\" or they would have to be primarily rocky to not be dwarf planets.\n*''Likely'': diameter estimated/measured to be over {{convert|500|km|mi}}. Uncertainties in measurement mean that some of these will be significantly smaller and thus doubtful.\n*''Probably'': diameter estimated/measured to be over {{convert|400|km|mi}}. Expected to be dwarf planets, if they are icy, and that figure is correct.\n*''Possibly'': diameter estimated/measured to be over {{convert|200|km|mi}}. Icy moons transition from a round to irregular shape in the 200\u2013400&nbsp;km range, suggesting that the same figure holds true for [[Kuiper belt|KBOs]]. Thus, some of these objects could be dwarf planets.\n*''Probably not'': diameter estimated/measured to be under 200&nbsp;km. No icy moon under 200&nbsp;km is round, suggesting that the same is true for KBOs. The estimated size of these objects would have to be in error for them to be dwarf planets.\n\nBeside the five accepted by the IAU, the 'nearly certain' category includes {{dp|Gonggong}}, {{dp|Quaoar}}, {{dp|90377 Sedna}}, {{dp|Orcus}}, {{mpl|2002 MS|4}} and {{dp|Salacia}}.\n\n=== Grundy et al's assessment ===\nGrundy et al. propose that dark, low-density TNOs in the size range of approximately 400\u20131000&nbsp;km are transitional between smaller, porous (and thus low-density) bodies and larger, denser, brighter and geologically differentiated planetary bodies (such as dwarf planets). Bodies in this size range should have begun to collapse the interstitial spaces left over from their formation, but not fully, leaving some residual porosity.<ref name=\"Grundy2019\" />\n\nMany TNOs in the size range of 400\u20131000&nbsp;km have oddly low densities, in the range of 1.0\u20131.2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, that are substantially less than dwarf planets such as Pluto, Eris and Ceres, which have densities closer to 2. Brown has suggested that large low-density bodies must be composed almost entirely of water ice, since he presumed that bodies of this size would necessarily be solid. However, this leaves unexplained why TNOs both larger than 1000&nbsp;km and smaller than 400&nbsp;km, and indeed comets, are composed of a substantial fraction of rock, leaving only this size range to be primarily icy. Experiments with water ice at the relevant pressures and temperatures suggest that substantial porosity could remain in this size range, and it is possible that adding rock to the mix would further increase resistance to collapsing into a solid body. Bodies with internal porosity remaining from their formation could be at best only partially differentiated, in their deep interiors. (If a body had begun to collapse into a solid body, there should be evidence in the form of fault systems from when its surface contracted.) The higher albedos of larger bodies is also evidence of full differentiation, as such bodies were presumably resurfaced with ice from their interiors. Grundy et al. propose therefore that mid-size (< 1000&nbsp;km), low-density (< 1.4&nbsp;g/ml ) and low-albedo (< \u22480.2) bodies such as [[120347 Salacia|Salacia]], [[174567 Varda|Varda]], [[229762 G\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0|G\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0]] and {{mpl|55637|2002 UX|25}} are not differentiated planetary bodies like [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]], [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]. The boundary between the two populations would appear to be in the range of 900\u20131000&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Grundy2019\" />\n\nIf Grundy et al. are correct, then among known bodies in the outer Solar System only Pluto\u2013Charon, Eris, Haumea, Gonggong, Makemake, Quaoar, Orcus, Sedna, and perhaps Salacia (which was determined to have a higher density of 1.5&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> a few months after Grundy's assessment)<ref name=\"Grundy2019-2\">{{cite journal |last1=Grundy |first1=W.M. |last2=Noll |first2=K.S. |last3=Roe |first3=H.G. |last4=Buie |first4=M.W. |last5=Porter |first5=S.B. |last6=Parker |first6=A.H. |last7=Nesvorn\u00fd |first7=D. |last8=Levison |first8=H.F. |last9=Benecchi |first9=S.D. |last10=Stephens |first10=D.C. |last11=Trujillo |first11=C.A. |title=Mutual orbit orientations of transneptunian binaries |journal=Icarus |date=December 2019 |volume=334 |pages=62\u201378 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2019.03.035 |url=http://www2.lowell.edu/~grundy/abstracts/preprints/2019.TNB_orbits.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407052940/http://www2.lowell.edu/~grundy/abstracts/preprints/2019.TNB_orbits.pdf |archive-date=2019-04-07 }}</ref> are likely to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium at some point in their histories, and thus to possibly still be dwarf planets at present.\n\n== <span id=\"list\"></span>Likeliest dwarf planets ==\n\nThe assessments of the IAU, Tancredi et al., Brown and Grundy et al. for the dozen largest potential dwarf planets are as follows. For the IAU, the acceptance criteria were for naming purposes. Several of these objects had not yet been discovered when Tancredi et al. did their analysis. Brown's sole criterion is diameter; he accepts a great many more as highly likely to be dwarf planets (see below). Grundy et al. did not determine which bodies were dwarf planets, but rather which could not be. A red [[Image:X mark.svg|15px|No]] marks objects too dark or not dense enough to be solid bodies, a question mark the smaller bodies consistent with being differentiated (the question of current equilibrium was not addressed).\n\nIapetus, Earth's Moon, and Mimas are included for comparison, as none of these objects are in equilibrium today. Triton and Charon (which formed as TNO's and are likely in equilibrium) are also added for comparison.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| [[Minor planet designation|Designation]]\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| Measured mean<br />diameter {{small|([[kilometre|km]])}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| Density<br />{{small|(g/cm<sup>3</sup>)}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| Albedo\n!

They have equilibrium shapes that froze in place some time ago, and do not match the shapes that equilibrium bodies would have at their current rotation rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/3389.html|title=Iapetus' peerless equatorial ridge|author=|date=|website=www.planetary.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Thus Ceres, at 950&nbsp;km in diameter, is the smallest body for which gravitational measurements indicate current hydrostatic equilibrium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2015/dps15-1112-ceres.html|title=DPS 2015: First reconnaissance of Ceres by Dawn|author=|date=|website=www.planetary.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Much larger objects, such as Earth's moon, are not near hydrostatic equilibrium today,<ref>Garrick-Bethell et al.

Saturn's moons may have been subject to a thermal history that would have produced equilibrium-like shapes in bodies too small for gravity alone to do so. Thus, at present it is unknown whether any trans-Neptunian objects smaller than Pluto and Eris are in hydrostatic equilibrium.<ref name=\"Grundy2019\" />  The IAU has not addressed this issue since these findings.\n\nThe majority of mid-sized TNOs up to about 900 or 1000&nbsp;km in diameter have significantly lower (1-1.2&nbsp;gm/ml) densities than larger bodies such as Pluto (1.86&nbsp;gm/ml). Brown had speculated that this was due to their composition, that they were almost entirely icy. However, Grundy et al. point out that there is no known mechanism or evolutionary pathway for mid-sized bodies to be icy while both larger and smaller objects are partially rocky. They demonstrated that at the prevailing temperatures of the Kuiper Belt, water ice is quite brittle and is thus strong enough to support open interior spaces (interstices) in objects of this size; they thus concluded that they have low densities for the same reason that smaller objects do\u2014because they have not compacted under self-gravity into fully solid objects, and thus the typical object smaller than 900 or 1000&nbsp;km in diameter is (pending some other formative mechanism) unlikely to be a dwarf planet.\n\n=== <span id=\"Probable per Tancredi\"></span>Tancredi's assessment ===\n\nIn 2010, [[Gonzalo Tancredi]] presented a report to the IAU evaluating a list of 46 candidates for dwarf planet status based on [[light-curve]]-amplitude analysis and the assumption that the object was more than {{convert|450|km|mi}} in diameter. Some diameters are measured, some are best-fit estimates, and others use an assumed albedo of 0.10. Of these, he identified 15 as dwarf planets by his criteria (including the 4 accepted by the IAU), with another 9 being considered possible. To be cautious, he advised the IAU to \"officially\" accept as dwarf planets the top three not yet accepted: Sedna, Orcus, and Quaoar.<ref name=\"tancredi-2010\" /> Although the IAU had anticipated Tancredi's recommendations, {{as of|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|lc=yes}}, they have not responded.\n\n=== <span id=\"Probable per Brown\"></span>Brown's assessment ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"font-size: 0.9em; text-align: center; width: 350px; margin-top: 4px;\"\n!

Brown|Mike Brown]] considers a large number of trans-Neptunian bodies, ranked by estimated size, to be \"probably\" dwarf planets.<ref name=\"brown-list\"/> He did not consider asteroids, stating \"In the asteroid belt Ceres, with a diameter of 900&nbsp;km, is the only object large enough to be round\".<ref name=\"brown-list\" />\n\nThe terms for varying degrees of likelihood he split these into:\n*''Near certainty'': diameter estimated/measured to be over {{convert|900|km|mi}}. Sufficient confidence to say these must be in hydrostatic equilibrium, even if predominantly rocky.\n*''Highly likely'': diameter estimated/measured to be over {{convert|600|km|mi}}. The size would have to be \"grossly in error\" or they would have to be primarily rocky to not be dwarf planets.\n*''Likely'': diameter estimated/measured to be over {{convert|500|km|mi}}. Uncertainties in measurement mean that some of these will be significantly smaller and thus doubtful.\n*''Probably'': diameter estimated/measured to be over {{convert|400|km|mi}}. Expected to be dwarf planets, if they are icy, and that figure is correct.\n*''Possibly'': diameter estimated/measured to be over {{convert|200|km|mi}}. Icy moons transition from a round to irregular shape in the 200\u2013400&nbsp;km range, suggesting that the same figure holds true for [[Kuiper belt|KBOs]]. Thus, some of these objects could be dwarf planets.\n*''Probably not'': diameter estimated/measured to be under 200&nbsp;km. No icy moon under 200&nbsp;km is round, suggesting that the same is true for KBOs. The estimated size of these objects would have to be in error for them to be dwarf planets.\n\nBeside the five accepted by the IAU, the 'nearly certain' category includes {{dp|Gonggong}}, {{dp|Quaoar}}, {{dp|90377 Sedna}}, {{dp|Orcus}}, {{mpl|2002 MS|4}} and {{dp|Salacia}}.\n\n=== Grundy et al's assessment ===\nGrundy et al. propose that dark, low-density TNOs in the size range of approximately 400\u20131000&nbsp;km are transitional between smaller, porous (and thus low-density) bodies and larger, denser, brighter and geologically differentiated planetary bodies (such as dwarf planets). Bodies in this size range should have begun to collapse the interstitial spaces left over from their formation, but not fully, leaving some residual porosity.<ref name=\"Grundy2019\" />\n\nMany TNOs in the size range of 400\u20131000&nbsp;km have oddly low densities, in the range of 1.0\u20131.2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, that are substantially less than dwarf planets such as Pluto, Eris and Ceres, which have densities closer to 2. Brown has suggested that large low-density bodies must be composed almost entirely of water ice, since he presumed that bodies of this size would necessarily be solid. However, this leaves unexplained why TNOs both larger than 1000&nbsp;km and smaller than 400&nbsp;km, and indeed comets, are composed of a substantial fraction of rock, leaving only this size range to be primarily icy. Experiments with water ice at the relevant pressures and temperatures suggest that substantial porosity could remain in this size range, and it is possible that adding rock to the mix would further increase resistance to collapsing into a solid body. Bodies with internal porosity remaining from their formation could be at best only partially differentiated, in their deep interiors. (If a body had begun to collapse into a solid body, there should be evidence in the form of fault systems from when its surface contracted.) The higher albedos of larger bodies is also evidence of full differentiation, as such bodies were presumably resurfaced with ice from their interiors. Grundy et al. propose therefore that mid-size (< 1000&nbsp;km), low-density (< 1.4&nbsp;g/ml ) and low-albedo (< \u22480.2) bodies such as [[120347 Salacia|Salacia]], [[174567 Varda|Varda]], [[229762 G\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0|G\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0]] and {{mpl|55637|2002 UX|25}} are not differentiated planetary bodies like [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]], [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]].

For the IAU, the acceptance criteria were for naming purposes. Several of these objects had not yet been discovered when Tancredi et al. did their analysis. Brown's sole criterion is diameter; he accepts a great many more as highly likely to be dwarf planets (see below). Grundy et al. did not determine which bodies were dwarf planets, but rather which could not be. A red [[Image:X mark.svg|15px|No]] marks objects too dark or not dense enough to be solid bodies, a question mark the smaller bodies consistent with being differentiated (the question of current equilibrium was not addressed).\n\nIapetus, Earth's Moon, and Mimas are included for comparison, as none of these objects are in equilibrium today.

The first time, she and four children were all recaptured and returned to slavery. A few months later, Charity escaped again, taking only her two younger daughters with her, and reached her husband in New Jersey. Following her escape, Charity and Levin had 14 more children, of whom William was the youngest. Though these children were born in the free state of New Jersey, under Maryland and federal slave law, they were still legally slaves, as their mother was an escaped slave.

He met William Still there, but initially had no idea they were related. As William listened to Peter's story, he recognized the history his mother had told him many times. After learning that his older brother Levin was whipped to death for visiting his wife without permission, William shouted, \"What if I told you I was your brother!\" Later Peter and his mother were reunited after having been separated for 42 years.\n\nAnother of William's brothers was James Still. Born in New Jersey in 1812, James wanted to become a doctor but said he \"was not the right color to enter where such knowledge was dispensed.\" James studied herbs and plants and apprenticed himself to a white doctor to learn medicine. He became known as the \"Black Doctor of the Pines\", as he lived and practiced in the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]].

Her master sued him and five other African Americans for assault and kidnapping in a high-profile case in August 1855. Jane Johnson returned to Philadelphia from New York and testified in court as to her independence in choosing freedom, winning an acquittal for Still and four others, and reduced sentences for the last two men.\n\nIn 1859, Still challenged the segregation of the city's public transit system, which had separate seating for whites and blacks.<ref>[http://www.darbyhistory.com/Still-StreetcarStruggle.html \"William Still, Darby, and the Desegregation of Philadelphia Streetcars\"], Darby History.</ref> He kept lobbying and, in 1865, the Pennsylvania legislature passed a law to integrate streetcars across the state.<ref name=\"William still\">[http://stillfamily.library.temple.edu/timeline/william-still \"Timeline: The Life and Times of William Still (1821-1902)\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032317/http://stillfamily.library.temple.edu/timeline/William-still |date=2014-02-22 }}, ''William Still: an African-American Abolitionist'', Library, Temple University, accessed January 16, 2017.</ref>\n\n===Underground Railroad===\nOften called \"The Father of the [[Underground Railroad]]\", Still helped as many as 800 slaves escape to freedom.

The first time, she and four children were all recaptured and returned to slavery. A few months later, Charity escaped again, taking only her two younger daughters with her, and reached her husband in New Jersey. Following her escape, Charity and Levin had 14 more children, of whom William was the youngest.

He met William Still there, but initially had no idea they were related. As William listened to Peter's story, he recognized the history his mother had told him many times. After learning that his older brother Levin was whipped to death for visiting his wife without permission, William shouted, \"What if I told you I was your brother!\" Later Peter and his mother were reunited after having been separated for 42 years.\n\nAnother of William's brothers was James Still. Born in New Jersey in 1812, James wanted to become a doctor but said he \"was not the right color to enter where such knowledge was dispensed.\" James studied herbs and plants and apprenticed himself to a white doctor to learn medicine.
