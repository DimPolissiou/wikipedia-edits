Without copyright societies, it would be impossible for users like restaurants, malls and large events to collect licenses from individual copyright holders and negotiate terms with them. Copyright societies negotiate prices and create tariffs on behalf of the authors that they represent and offset the imbalance of power between the users and the copyright holders. The lobbying power of copyright societies is especially important in industries like the music industry, where authors and owners of copyright are often placed at a disadvantage.

Reduction of transaction costs and other benefits of collective management can be realised only when the copyright society has control over all or most of the copyrighted works in a particular industry.\n\n==In countries==\nCopyright law is territorial in nature, but copyrights are protected in multiple countries through international instruments such as the [[Berne Convention]] and the [[TRIPS Agreement]]. Along with licensing, copyright societies monitor the use of copyrighted works assigned to them and ensure that the copyright holders are fairly remunerated for such use. In order to monitor the use of copyrighted works abroad, societies enter into MoUs or international licensing agreements with their foreign counterparts in the industry and exchange information regarding the use of copyrighted materials.\n\nCollecting societies can sell blanket licences, which grant the right to perform their catalogue for a period of time. Such a licence might for example provide a broadcaster with a single annual authorisation encompassing thousands of songs owned by thousands of composers, lyricists and publishers. The societies also sell individual licenses for users who reproduce and distribute music. For example, [[Apple Computer|Apple]] must submit the download reports for the [[iTunes Store]], which are used to determine their royalty payments.\n\nThis acquisition is guided by the legal regime of the country. Some jurisdictions, such as Hungary, create legal monopolies, and ''de facto'' monopolies arise in others.<ref name=\":0\">Supra note 1, at p. 7</ref> Once rights are acquired, the copyright collective then has to collect data of uses of copyrighted works.

In order to do the business of issuing or granting license in respect of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works incorporated in a cinematograph films or sound recordings it is necessary that the organization be registered as a copyright society under Section 33. The proviso to section 33 sub clause 3 states ''\u2018Provided that the Central Government shall not ordinarily register more than one copyright society to do business in respect of the same class of works\u2019.'' This effectively creates a monopoly and mandates that only one copyright society can exist in a particular industry. This ensures concentration of bargaining power and equal terms of royalty in an industry.\n\nCopyright societies have to renew their registration under section 33 every five years and its registration can be cancelled at any time if the central government feels like it is being managed in a manner detrimental to the interests of the authors and other owners of the copyright. The major copyright societies in India are The Indian Performing Right Society Limited [IPRS]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iprs.org/cms/|title=IPRS|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> (for composers and publishers), [[Indian Reprographic Rights Organisation|Indian Reprographic Right Organisation]]  [IRRO]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irro.org.in|title=Indian Reprographic Rights Organisation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> (for literary organisations) and Indian Singers Rights Association [ISRA] (for performers). [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] [PPL] (for producers) was previously registered as a copyright society under S.33 of the Copyright Act but now mentions on its website that it licenses and transfers copyrights under S.18 and S.30 and functions as a company registered under the [[Companies Act 2013]]. PPL represents producers and record companies and is a major licensor of music to events and establishments. The ISRA and IPRS are registered copyright societies under S. 33 of the Copyright Act 1957. ISRA represents the interests of singers and aims to protect performer's rights as enshrined in S.38<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1667421/|title=Section 38 of the Copyrights Act of 1957|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and S.38A of the Copyrights Act 1957. IPRS represents composers, lyricists and publishers of music in India and is a registered copyright society under S.33 of the Copyright Act 1957.\n\nThe Screenwriters Association of India [SRAI]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.swaindia.org/index.php|title=Screenwriters Association of India|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> earlier known as [[Film Writers Association]] represents the interests of lyricists, screenwriters and novelists.

Recently an application for registration under S.33 was made by the Recorded Music Performance ltd which controls public performance and broadcasting rights of sound recordings of its member companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spicyip.com/2018/10/registration-of-rmpl-as-a-copyright-society-will-it-set-the-stage-for-new-repertoire-of-problems.html|title=Registration of RMPL as a Copyright Society \u2013 Will It Set the Stage for New Repertoire of Problems?|last=Agarwal|first=Pankhuri|date=|website=SpicyIP|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> RMPL has applied for registration as PPL is no longer operating as a copyright society under S.33 of the Copyrights Act 1957. The validity of PPL operating as a company has been debated and was considered by the 2014 case of ''Leopold cafe v. Novex Communication''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/44713127/|title=M/S. Leopold Cafe & Stores & Anr vs Novex Communications Pvt. Ltd on 17 July, 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=IndianKanoon|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in which the Bombay High Court that s.30 of the Copyright Act 1957 allows a duly authorised agent to issue licenses on behalf of authors and other owners, therefore organisations can perform the activities of a copyright society without being registered under S.33 but it will not be referred to as a copyright society and cannot issue licenses in its own name. PPL now operates as a Copyrights Organisation [CRO] and can only issue licenses as an agent, therefore it must issue licenses in the name of the copyright owners and not itself.\n\n=== United States and Canada ===\nIn the U.S. and Canada, groups that perform works such as music are called [[performance rights organisation]]s or PROs. Other organizations such as artists' rights groups license and collect royalties for the reproduction of paintings by living or recently deceased artists whose work has not yet entered the [[public domain]].  There are also collectives that collect royalties for copies from magazines and scholarly journals such as [[Access Copyright]] in Canada.\n\nIn the US, PROs ensure that rights holders are paid their share of public performance royalties, by issuing licenses to different companies and establishments and tracking where and how often the songs of their affiliates are performed at these public venues. An author can only be part of one PRO, as the five existing PROs in the US have distinct systems for tariffs and payment of royalty as they compete with each other in the market. The four major PROs in the music industry in the US are [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]], [[SESAC]], [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], and [[SoundExchange]]. In the US copyright collectives are registered companies that act as agents of the owners of the copyright. The websites of the PROs have their [[Memorandum of association]] and [[Articles of association]] and their tariff policies.\n\nThe validity of PROs was challenged in the 1979 anti-trust suit of ''[[Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, Inc.]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/441/1/|title=Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, Inc., 441 U.S. 1 (1979)|last=|first=|date=|website=Justicia- US Supreme Court|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in which CBS BMI and said that the tariffs decided by BMI were for blanket licenses and therefore amounted to price fixing. The court held in this case that the actions of PROs were not anti competitive as there was no bar on obtaining licenses from individual copyright holders.\n\nDigitisation and internet based music streaming services have majorly changed the music industry and the US copyright law has changed majorly to accommodate such innovation. [[Music Modernization Act]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/music-modernization/115/|title=Music Licensing Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> (MMA) was signed by [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] on 11 October 2018 as the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act of 2018. The MMA streamlines the music licensing process in order to make it easier for copyright holders to get paid when their music is streamed online through services like Spotify, Pandora and Apple Music. Songwriters and artists will receive royalties on songs recorded before 1972 and this will ensure that songwriters are paid by streaming services with a single mechanical licensing database overseen by music publishers and songwriters. The cost of creating and maintaining this database will be paid for by digital streaming services and the database and tariff will be determined by an authority created under the MMA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2823/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22music+modernization+act%22%5D%7D&r=2|title=Music Modernisation Act|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref> The mechanism provided under the act will determine unclaimed royalties due to music professionals and provide a consistent legal process to receive them. Previously, these unclaimed royalties were held by digital service providers like Spotify to the detriment of the authors. All of this will also ensure that artists are paid more and have a fair mechanism to approach for getting the money they are owed. This changes the scheme of S.115 of the US which governs compulsory licensing<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/licensing/sec_115.html|title=S.115 of the Copyright Act- Notice for compulsory licensing|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and allows the authority created under the act to issue blanket licenses for music to streaming services. While this does take away some agency of artists, there has been overwhelming support for this legislation from the music industry as it will ensure that licensing and royalty payments are transferred on a fair basis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/11/17963804/music-modernization-act-mma-copyright-law-bill-labels-congress|title=The Music Modernisation Act has become law|last=|first=|date=|work=The Verge|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers [ASCAP]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ascap.com|title=American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> has direct or indirect connections with copyright societies in over 30 countries. Once it receives information regarding unauthorised use of copyrighted works, the affiliated foreign copyright society collects the royalty on behalf of the copyright society representing the owner, and forwards payments to it.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Copyright]]\n* [[List of copyright collection societies]]\n* [[Private copying levy]]\n* [[Voluntary Collective Licensing]] \n* [[:Category:Copyright collection societies|Copyright collection societies (category)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Thomas Gergen]]: ''Die Verwertungsgesellschaft VG WORT: Genese und neue Herausforderungen'' In: Journal on European History of Law, London: STS Science Centre, Vol. 1, No. 2, pp.&nbsp;14 \u2013 19, (ISSN 2042-6402).\n\n[[Category:Copyright collection societies| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|private bodies|government bodies|copyright agency}}\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2014}}\nCopyrights can either be licensed or assigned<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf|title=Copyrights Basics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> by the owner of the copyright.

Along with licensing, copyright societies monitor the use of copyrighted works assigned to them and ensure that the copyright holders are fairly remunerated for such use. In order to monitor the use of copyrighted works abroad, societies enter into MoUs or international licensing agreements with their foreign counterparts in the industry and exchange information regarding the use of copyrighted materials.\n\nCollecting societies can sell blanket licences, which grant the right to perform their catalogue for a period of time. Such a licence might for example provide a broadcaster with a single annual authorisation encompassing thousands of songs owned by thousands of composers, lyricists and publishers. The societies also sell individual licenses for users who reproduce and distribute music. For example, [[Apple Computer|Apple]] must submit the download reports for the [[iTunes Store]], which are used to determine their royalty payments.\n\nThis acquisition is guided by the legal regime of the country. Some jurisdictions, such as Hungary, create legal monopolies, and ''de facto'' monopolies arise in others.<ref name=\":0\">Supra note 1, at p. 7</ref> Once rights are acquired, the copyright collective then has to collect data of uses of copyrighted works.

In order to do the business of issuing or granting license in respect of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works incorporated in a cinematograph films or sound recordings it is necessary that the organization be registered as a copyright society under Section 33. The proviso to section 33 sub clause 3 states ''\u2018Provided that the Central Government shall not ordinarily register more than one copyright society to do business in respect of the same class of works\u2019.'' This effectively creates a monopoly and mandates that only one copyright society can exist in a particular industry. This ensures concentration of bargaining power and equal terms of royalty in an industry.\n\nCopyright societies have to renew their registration under section 33 every five years and its registration can be cancelled at any time if the central government feels like it is being managed in a manner detrimental to the interests of the authors and other owners of the copyright. The major copyright societies in India are The Indian Performing Right Society Limited [IPRS]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iprs.org/cms/|title=IPRS|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> (for composers and publishers), [[Indian Reprographic Rights Organisation|Indian Reprographic Right Organisation]]  [IRRO]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irro.org.in|title=Indian Reprographic Rights Organisation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> (for literary organisations) and Indian Singers Rights Association [ISRA] (for performers).

PPL represents producers and record companies and is a major licensor of music to events and establishments.

PPL now operates as a Copyrights Organisation [CRO] and can only issue licenses as an agent, therefore it must issue licenses in the name of the copyright owners and not itself.\n\n=== United States and Canada ===\nIn the U.S. and Canada, groups that works perform works such as music are called [[performance rights organisation]]s or PROs. Other organizations such as artists' rights groups license and collect royalties for the reproduction of paintings by living or recently deceased artists whose work has not yet entered the [[public domain]].  There are also collectives that collect royalties for copies from magazines and scholarly journals such as [[Access Copyright]] in Canada.\n\nIn the US, PROs ensure that rights holders are paid their share of public performance royalties, by issuing licenses to different companies and establishments and tracking where and how often the songs of their affiliates are performed at these public venues. An author can only be part of one PRO, as the five existing PROs in the US have distinct systems for tariffs and payment of royalty as they compete with each other in the market. The four major PROs in the music industry in the US are [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]], [[SESAC]], [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], and [[SoundExchange]]. In the US copyright collectives are registered companies that act as agents of the owners of the copyright. The websites of the PROs have their [[Memorandum of association]] and [[Articles of association]] and their tariff policies.\n\nThe validity of PROs was challenged in the 1979 anti-trust suit of ''[[Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, Inc.]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/441/1/|title=Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, Inc., 441 U.S. 1 (1979)|last=|first=|date=|website=Justicia- US Supreme Court|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in which CBS BMI and said that the tariffs decided by BMI were for blanket licenses and therefore amounted to price fixing. The court held in this case that the actions of PROs were not anti competitive as there was no bar on obtaining licenses from individual copyright holders.\n\nDigitisation and internet based music streaming services have majorly changed the music industry and the US copyright law has changed majorly to accommodate such innovation. [[Music Modernization Act]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/music-modernization/115/|title=Music Licensing Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> (MMA) was signed by [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] on 11 October 2018 as the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act of 2018. The MMA streamlines the music licensing process in order to make it easier for copyright holders to get paid when their music is streamed online through services like Spotify, Pandora and Apple Music. Songwriters and artists will receive royalties on songs recorded before 1972 and this will ensure that songwriters are paid by streaming services with a single mechanical licensing database overseen by music publishers and songwriters. The cost of creating and maintaining this database will be paid for by digital streaming services and the database and tariff will be determined by an authority created under the MMA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2823/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22music+modernization+act%22%5D%7D&r=2|title=Music Modernisation Act|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref> The mechanism provided under the act will determine unclaimed royalties due to music professionals and provide a consistent legal process to receive them. Previously, these unclaimed royalties were held by digital service providers like Spotify to the detriment of the authors. All of this will also ensure that artists are paid more and have a fair mechanism to approach for getting the money they are owed. This changes the scheme of S.115 of the US which governs compulsory licensing<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/licensing/sec_115.html|title=S.115 of the Copyright Act- Notice for compulsory licensing|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and allows the authority created under the act to issue blanket licenses for music to streaming services. While this does take away some agency of artists, there has been overwhelming support for this legislation from the music industry as it will ensure that licensing and royalty payments are transferred on a fair basis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/11/17963804/music-modernization-act-mma-copyright-law-bill-labels-congress|title=The Music Modernisation Act has become law|last=|first=|date=|work=The Verge|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers [ASCAP]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ascap.com|title=American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> has direct or indirect connections with copyright societies in over 30 countries.

He was schooled initially at the small border village of [[More, Shropshire]] by a Mr Perkin, a close relative of his mother. [[Samuel Clarke (minister)|Samuel Clarke]], whose 1651 account is the basis for all later biographers, thought that it was from Perkin at More that Herring \"learned the Principles of Religion.\"<ref name=clarke462/> Clarke describes Perkin as a minister at ''More-chappel'' and these details have generally been accepted at face value.<ref name=odnb/> However, the [[Clergy of the Church of England database]] lists More as a [[parish church]] within the [[Diocese of Hereford]], not as a chapelry.<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=3295 CCEd Location ID: 3295.]</ref> [[Robert William Eyton|Eyton]], the pioneering historian of Shropshire, considered that More probably began as a chapelry of [[Lydbury North]] but \"became independent, at a period which the earliest Records fail to reach.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro11eytogoog#page/n320/mode/2up Eyton, p. 290.]</ref> CCEd does list some clergy at More in the 1580s and Perkin is not among them, although the database cannot be exhaustive. It does not note any parish school at More but there was one at nearby Lydbury, although records of staff seem to start only with the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=239242 CCEd Location ID: 239242.]</ref> The older [[Dictionary of National Biography]] avers that Perkin was a minister at ''Morechurch'':<ref name=dnb/> there is a Churchmoor, further east, in Lydbury North parish, but it is a hamlet with no chapel.\n\nHerring then moved to the family home at Coventry, where he attended the [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|Free Grammar School]]. Clarke credits his academic progress there to the then headmaster, whom he names as Reverend Master Tovey.<ref name=clarke462/> Even as a schoolboy he was noted for his piety. Clarke credits him with an early interest and delight in the [[Bible]] passages that deal with faith and repentance \u2013 themes typically of great concern to [[Protestant]]s. On play days, he and a few friends engaged in prayer and religious exercises before going out.\n\nIn May 1600 Herring was admitted as a scholar to [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]],<ref name=venn/> then a new, specifically Protestant institution. University records show he graduated [[Bachelor of Arts#United Kingdom and Ireland|BA]] in the academic year 1603-4: Clarke thought Herring returned to Coventry as a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]].<ref name=clarke462/> There he studied [[Divinity (academic discipline)|Divinity]] with the encouragement of [[Humphrey Fenn]], a noted advocate of Presbyterianism and formerly a client of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=9280|title=Fenn, Humphrey|first=Jan|last=Broadway}}</ref> Fenn had been suspended from his ministry since 1590 for his activities within a Warwickshire [[classis (ecclesiastical)|classis]] within the Church of England and had not regained his vicarage of [[Holy Trinity Church, Coventry]]. Herring, however, seems to have found opportunities to preach, winning considerable approval.<ref name=brook489/><ref name=clarke462/>\n\n==Calke==\n\nHerring was approaching the age to take up a parish ministry of his own, but this required [[Holy orders#Anglicanism|ordination]]. Number 36 of the [[Canon law (Church of England)|Book of Canons]], confirmed by the [[Convocations of Canterbury and York]] in 1604 and 1606 respectively, demanded that all candidates for ordination take a three-fold oath, accepting the royal supremacy, the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anglican.net/doctrines/1604-canon-law/#p1-3 |title=Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical, p. 3. |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1603|website=Anglican.net |access-date= 11 January 2016 |quote=}}</ref> The subscription book of the [[Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield]], which covered the area in Herring both lived and sought a living, summarised the oath as:\n\n<blockquote>The king is the only supreme governor under God of all things spiritual as well as temporal: the Book of Common Prayer, with the ordering of bishops priests and deacons, contains nothing contrary to the word of God: the Articles of Religion (1562) are agreeable to the word of God.<ref>Coulton, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHerring circumvented the requirement by securing ordination from an Irish bishop then visiting London. He was accompanied in this by other young Puritan men, including [[John Ball (Puritan)|John Ball]], a friend who was tutor to the children of Catherine and [[Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster|Robert Cholmondley]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n495/mode/2up Clarke, p.441-2.]</ref> Only after the ordination were the pair able to take up their first ecclesiastical appointments: Ball as curate of [[Whitmore, Staffordshire|Whitmore]] in [[Staffordshire]]; Herring as preacher at [[Calke]] in Derbyshire.\n\n[[File:Arthur Hildersham-Samuel Clarke.jpg|thumb|left|Arthur Hildersham, Puritan preacher, from Samuel Clarke's ''Generall Martyrologie'', 1651.

During the 1590s More took part in the religious exercises of the Hildersham circle, which included fasting, prayer, lectures and fellowship,<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#169 Rowe, p. 161.]</ref> and supported Darrell in the highly controversial work of [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcism]].<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#282 Rowe, p. 274.]</ref>\n{{Wiktionary pipe|donative#English|donative}}\n\nClarke considered Calke a relatively secure base for Herring because it was a [[Royal peculiar|peculiar jurisdiction]] exempt from episcopal authority, as well as bringing the support of a sympathetic patron. CCEd, citing a 1772 reference, makes clear that Calke was a donative, rather than a peculiar.<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=233327 CCEd Location ID: 233327.]</ref> ''[[Magna Britannia]]'', published in 1817, numbered Calke among nine Derbyshire parishes that were donatives<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/magna-britannia/vol5/xi-xvii Lysons and Lysons, p. xi-xvii.]</ref> before the Victorian abolition of these institutions. In a donative the [[advowson|patron]] had the right to make an appointment to the [[benefice#Church of England|benefice]] without reference to the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]]<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalla01phil#page/252/mode/2up Phillimore, p. 252-3.]</ref> \u2013 in this case the local [[diocesan bishop]].

Calke church was part of Calke [[manorial system|manor]] \u2013 a former monastic estate that passed into lay hands through the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Although later named [[Calke Abbey]], it had actually been a very small [[Augustinian]] priory, which was absorbed as a mere cell into its own daughter house, [[Repton Priory]]: under the founder's terms, the church had been given to the canons on condition they supply it with a priest.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/derbs/vol2/pp58-63 Page, pp. 58-63.]</ref> Robert Bainbridge bought the Calke estate in 1582<ref name=bainbridge>M.

He was a militant Protestant, three times MP for [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]], who was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] during March 1587 after he had demanded the execution of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and supported [[Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet|Anthony Cope's]] proposal for a radical reform of Church government: he and his friends made the mistake of continuing to argue outside the chamber of the House of Commons, where they were not protected by [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|parliamentary privilege]].<ref name=bainbridge/>\n[[File:Simeon Ashe.jpg|thumb|Simeon Ashe]]\nAlthough Calke was a very small settlement, then as now, it seems to have formed an ideal base for Herring's ministry, which was primarily one of [[preaching]]. Clarke remarks that \"God was pleased to set a broad scale to his Ministry.\"<ref name=clarke463/> A clear and powerful preacher, he drew an audience from up to twenty towns and villages, with Sunday congregations in good weather so large that many were forced to cluster around the windows to hear him. Some brought picnics and made a day of it, while others bought refreshments from the \"threepenny ordinary\" provided for strangers. The impact of his preaching on the region was increased by the practice of returning home in groups, singing [[psalm]]s and discussing the [[sermon]]. Clarke thought that the effectiveness of Herring's preaching as part of the Hildersham circle was proved by the very high retention of Puritan converts in the region, who remained with the cause through the \"broken dividing times\" that followed: presumably meaning the period of [[Thorough]] or [[absolute monarchy]], the [[English Civil War]] and the [[Regicide#The regicide of Charles I of England|Regicide]]. Herring seems to have had a profound influence over Simeon Ashe, later a moderate Presbyterian preacher and an intimate of important parliamentarian leaders, including [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke]] and [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester]]. Herring took the opportunity of a relatively stable period in his life to marry and start a family. His wife was Christian<ref name=odnb/> Gellibrand. The match was remembered in Puritan hagiography as particularly happy and mutually-supportive.<ref name=clarke463/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n500/mode/2up Brook, p. 490.]</ref>\n\nHerring's ministry at Calke seems to have lasted until 1618. Clarke thought he was \"forced from thence for Nonconformity by the Prelatical power, being informed against by ill-affected men.\"<ref name=clarke463/> He gives no details of how Herring could be removed from a donative. Barbara Coulton, a recent historian of Shrewsbury during this the period, gives 1617 as the year Herring was recruited by William Rowley of Shrewsbury,<ref name=coulton75>Coulton, p. 75.</ref> suggesting that he was attracted by a more influential post rather than driven out of Calke. This is supported by the baptism of Christian, a daughter of Herring, at [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]] as early as 1 February 1618.<ref>Coulton, p. 76.</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish15lichshro#page/4/mode/2up ''St Chad's parish register'', Volume 1, p. 4.]</ref> Herring's patron Bainbridge must by this time have been elderly, as he first sat in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] in 1571.<ref name=bainbridge/> He may have been in financial difficulties: although he had a vault prepared for his burial at Calke, he sold the estate only three years after Herring's departure and died before July 1623.\n\n==Shrewsbury==\n\nIn 1618 Herring took up residence in Shrewsbury, at the invitation of the corporation, as lecturer at St Alkmund's Church. This was not an incumbency: the vicar of St Alkmund's throughout Herring's time in Shrewsbury was Thomas Lloyd, who had been appointed in 1607.<ref name=ob279>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/278/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 279.]</ref> Lloyd was held in no great regard as a preacher and was paid \u00a35 to read [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]].<ref name=coulton78>Coulton, p. 78.</ref> Herring's lectureship did not require an oath before the bishop, as it was privately funded by a \u00a320 annuity. This was provided by [[Rowland Heylyn]], a merchant of Welsh ancestry, educated at [[Shrewsbury School]] and a former parishioner of St Alkmund's, who had become immensely wealthy and powerful in the [[Worshipful Company of Ironmongers]] in London.<ref name=coulton75/> Heylyn had two sisters living in Shrewsbury, Ann and Eleanor, who were married respectively to John Nicholls and Richard Hunt, powerful local politicians who were associates of William Rowley, described by Clarke as \"a wise religious man.\"<ref name=clarke464>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n519/mode/2up Clarke, p. 464.]</ref> It was Rowley who made the initial approach to Herring and acted throughout as his \"faithful friend.\" It seems that he initially accommodated the Herring family in his own mansion.<ref name=coulton78/> Rowley was a member of Shrewsbury's powerful [[Shrewsbury Drapers Company|Drapers' Company]] and Hunt was its warden.<ref name=coulton79>Coulton, p. 79.</ref> The company's hall was vacant and it was probably they who prevailed on the members to lease it to Herring for \u00a34 annually, the company reserving the right to use it for meetings but agreeing to pay for repairs.<ref name=ob279n4>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/278/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 279-80, note 4.]</ref>\n\nHerring was obliged to preach twice weekly: on Tuesday morning and at 1 pm on Sunday. This was to avoid offending the other clergy in the town by poaching their congregations.<ref name=clarke464/> In addition, he repeated the Sunday sermon that evening, alternating between the houses of three powerful Puritan merchants: Edward Jones, George Wright and Rowley. A specimen of his preaching, showing his [[hermeneutic]] method at the service of his Puritan audience, runs:\n:{{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|3:22b|KJV}}: ''All are yours.''\n\n<blockquote>Yours! Whose meaneth the apostle by ''yours''? The Christian Corinths, to whome this epistle was directed, and those words. And what meaneth hee by the word ''all''. The verse itself shewes you. \"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, \u2013 or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, ''All are yours.''\" And the expression is of a further latitude, v. 21. for all ''things'' are yours. All things therefore are the true Christian's. This is the truth that I am to teach you. Therefore, without any further coherence of these words with the former, or resolving the text into parts, (which is the ordinarie course of ministers,)  I must fall upon this; \u2013 all things are the true Christian's.<ref name=ob279n4/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:ThomasMorton.jpg|thumb|Thomas Morton]]\n\nHerring was subject to attack and controversy on both sides, conservative and radical, during his preaching ministry at Shrewsbury. As early as 1620, just after [[Thomas Morton (bishop)|Thomas Morton]] became Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, Herring was reported to the authorities for failure to use the prayer book and to receive or administer the sacraments.<ref name=odnb/> Morton had clashed with Puritan clergy in his former [[Diocese of Chester]] over ceremonial practices and the [[Declaration of Sports]]. His response had been [[eirenic]] in spirit,<ref name=coulton79/> if sometimes exacting and abrasive in person: he had, for example, given [[Thomas Paget (Puritan minister)|Thomas Paget]], a leading Lancashire Puritan minister, 10 shillings towards his legal expenses after compelling him to appear with a list of written arguments against signing with the cross in [[Infant baptism|baptism]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/defenceofchurchg00page#page/n13/mode/2up Thomas Paget, ''An Humble Advertisment (sic) to the high Court of Parliament'' p. 8. in John Paget: ''A Defence Of Church-Government, Exercised in Presbyteriall, Classicall, & Synodall Assemblies''.]</ref> Morton referred Herring to two neighbouring ministers for satisfaction and he made a written statement of his reservations. The two ministers supported Herring with a certificate to the bishop and he pronounced himself satisfied with Herring's integrity. However, the incident opened up a series of suspensions and reinstatements.<ref name=clarke465>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n519/mode/2up Clarke p. 465.]</ref> It seems that he continued to conduct private fasts and Bible expositions even during periods when his public ministry was made impossible. These would have been held in Draper's Hall, which was his own home.<ref name=coulton82>Coulton, p. 82.</ref>\n\nOpposition to Herring coalesced around Peter Studley, who was incumbent or [[curate]] of St Chad's from 1622<ref>Coulton, p. 80.</ref> and also took responsibility for St Julian's, which was very close.<ref name=coulton82/> His appointment seems to reflect the emergence on the corporation of a conservative opposition, which was able to appoint a second lecturer to St Alkmund's: Samuel Greaves, the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Berrington, Shropshire|Berrington]], who preached on Wednesday mornings for \u00a310 a year.<ref name=coulton83>Coulton, p. 83.</ref> An [[canonical visitation|episcopal visitation]] of 1626, possibly attended by Morton himself, found Studley at loggerheads with the town's Puritans and many of the complaints and counter-claims were directly related to Herring's preaching ministry. The congregation of St Julian's were up in arms because, they alleged, Studley deliberately timed services to prevent them attending preaching elsewhere, but refrained from preaching himself. Studley reported Rowley and Wright for holding preaching and prayer meetings in their homes on Sunday evenings, suggesting that the episcopal court should judge whether or not these constituted [[conventicle]]s.<ref name=coulton82/> However, Studley was also meeting fierce opposition from a more radical group of poorer parishioners, of whom the most prominent were [[Katherine Chidley]] and her family.<ref name=coulton83/> Chidley had led a group of women in refusing to take part in the [[churching of women]], which some Puritans found offensive and for which Studley demanded a fee. She arrived through her experiences at separatist conclusions and was later to write in justification of [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] or [[Congregationalist polity|Congregationalist]] tendency within Puritanism. Herring was opposed to this group, and Clarke reports his frequent observation:\n\n<blockquote>It is a sin of an high nature to unchurch a Nation at once, and that this would become the spring of many other fearful errours, for separation will eat like a Gangrene into the heart of Godlinesse. And he did pray, that they who would un-church others, might not be un-christianed themselves.<ref name=clarke465/></blockquote>\n\nHerring's opposition to separatism was also made manifest by his attendance at his local parish church, even though he had an appointment in a neighbouring parish. He attended the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] at [[St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury|St Mary's]], a royal peculiar<ref name=coulton82/> that was effectively controlled by the corporation. The vicar on Herring's arrival was William Bright, a nominee of the Puritan divine [[Laurence Chaderton]],<ref>Coulton, p. 77.</ref> and congenial to Herring. However, Bright died in October 1618 and was buried on the 29th of that month.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/56/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 56.]</ref> He was replaced, on Chaderton's recommendation,<ref name=coulton79/> with [[Samuel Browne (divine)|Samuel Browne]], a more moderate figure who nevertheless stoutly defended his church against episcopal interference.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=3696|title=Browne, Samuel|first=Elizabeth|last=Allen}}</ref> On 19 January 1620, the St Mary's parish register records the burial of \"A sonn, being not baptized, of Mr. Hearing, a Mynester of God's word.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/58/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 58.]</ref>  Later in the same year, on 17 December, the register records a baptism: \"Samuell, s. of Mr. Hearing, preacher of the Word.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/58/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 59.]</ref> These descriptions suggest concord between Browne and Herring.<ref name=coulton79/> Moreover, for the baptism of Dorcas on 30 January 1623 Herring is again described as a preacher of the Word,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/62/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 63.]</ref> and for Mary's on 6 February 1625 as \"Mynester,\" while Browne himself is described in the entry for his own daughter's baptism as \"publique preacher.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/66/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 67.]</ref> This suggests a looseness of terminology and a sense of equality and respect between the two clerics. The baptisms of two more children chart Herring's residence in the parish: for Joanna's on 19 August 1627 he is simply \"Mr. Jolynus Hearing.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/72/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 72.]</ref> However, after Browne's death in 1632 and the appointment of the Puritan James Betton to St Mary's,<ref name=coulton86/> the entry for Herring's son Theophilus on 5 September 1633 again uses the title \"Minister\".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/82/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 82.]</ref> As he continued a valued parishioner of St Mary's, Herring's position at St Alkmund's also became more secure. Heylyn operated through a group of Puritan ministers and businessmen who had established a body known as the [[Feoffees for Impropriations]], sometimes known as the Collectors of [[St Antholin, Budge Row|St Antholin]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/270/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 271-2.]</ref> to channel funds into Puritan preaching. Heylyn became a feoffee in 1626 and two years later oversaw the acquisition of the [[advowson]] of St Alkmund's and a lease on the tithes of St Mary's.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=13172|title=Heylyn, Rowland|first=Marc L.|last=Schwarz}}</ref> His distance from any radicalism strengthened his position, so that it was admitted even by his enemies:\n\n<blockquote>Though he be scrupulous in matter of ceremony, yet he is a loyal subject unto the King, and a true friend unto the state.<ref name=clarke464/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Worfield - Margaret Bromley 01.JPG|thumb|Effigy of Lady Margaret Bromley, [[Worfield]].]]\n\nHerring continued to make and maintain links with moderate Presbyterian preachers in the region and beyond, gaining recognition for Shrewsbury as the centre of a Puritan network.<ref name=odnb/> He brought his brother-in-law, Robert Nicolls of [[Wrenbury]], and Thomas Pierson of [[Brampton Bryan]] to preach in the town.<ref name=clarke464/> It is possible that Samuel Clarke, Herring's biographer, also visited Shrewsbury.<ref>Coulton p. 84.</ref> Along with John Ball, Pierson, Nicolls and Herring were part of a group who met for religious exercises in [[Sheriffhales]] at the home of Lady [[Margaret Bromley]],<ref name=clarke469>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clarke, p. 469.]</ref> widow from 1626 of the noted judge [[Edward Bromley|Sir Edward Bromley]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/TheVisitationOfShropshireV.28/VisitationshrophshiretAken1623_treswellVol28P1#page/n131/mode/2up ''Visitation of Shropshire'', p. 78.]</ref>\n[[File:William Laud.jpg|thumb|left|William Laud]]\nDuring the 1630s the bitterness of religious conflict at Shrewsbury intensified to a pitch that brought national attention and made Herring's position precarious. [[Robert Wright (bishop)|Bishop Wright's]] visitation of the town provided Studley with an opportunity for a triumphal reading  of ordinances on the decoration of churches, but also for a denunciation of his opponents that revealed the depth of opposition. Herring's supporters, Rowley and Wright, were now joined by [[Humphrey Mackworth (Parliamentarian)|Humphrey Mackworth]] as leaders of a group that refused to bow at the Name of Jesus and to kneel for communion, and so were counted as refusers of the Eucharist.<ref>Coulton, p. 85.</ref> Studley went on to write a savage denunciation of Puritanism, ''The Looking-Glass of Schisme'', claiming that religious nonconformity had influenced the commission of sensational murders at Clun.<ref name=coulton86>Coulton, p. 86.</ref> The furore in Shrewsbury attracted the attention of [[William Laud]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] himself. Laud proposed to use negotiations over the renewal of the town's charter to prize the town's main churches free of the corporation's control.<ref>Coulton, p. 87.</ref> He acknowledged Herring's role in the town's opposition with the comment: \"I will pickle up that Herring of Shrewsbury.\" Herring's response is reported as:\n\n<blockquote>If he will abuse his power, let it teach Christians the more to use their prayers. And be then prayed that the Non-conformists enemies might by observation that they have a good God to trust unto, when trampled upon by ill-despised men.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n521/mode/2up Clarke, p. 466.]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLaud instituted a visitation of the entire [[Province of Canterbury]] in 1635, with [[Nathaniel Brent]] conducting enquiries in the Lichfield diocese. Brent suspended Puritans at [[St Peter's Collegiate Church]] in Wolverhampton, before moving on to Shrewsbury, where he also came into conflict with local clergy.<ref name=coulton88>Coulton, p. 88.</ref> At some point in the early part of 1635 Herring and his family left Shrewsbury.\n\n==Wrenbury==\n[[File:St Margarets Wrenbury.jpg|thumb|St Margaret's Church Wrenbury, where Nicolls and Peartree were incumbents.]]\nHerring sought a home first in [[Wrenbury]], [[Cheshire]], where his wife's sister lived: Robert Nicolls, her husband and Herring's friend, had died at Sheriffhales in 1630.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n386/mode/2up Brook, p. 375.]</ref> Wrenbury had originally been part of the parish of [[St Mary's Church, Acton]], and its church was still in the gift of the vicar of Acton.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketch00urwi#page/138/mode/2up Urwick, p. 138.]</ref> The incumbent was William Peartree of [[Bury St Edmunds]], who had been suspended by Brent.<ref name=coulton88/> Herring had no formal appointment but lived privately as a parishioner, offering pastoral support by \"comforting afflicted consciences.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n521/mode/2up Clarke, p. 467.]</ref> Clarke claimed that Herring only moved to Wrenbury after despairing of his future in Shrewsbury, but it seems that he had not taken steps formally to terminate his lectureship or even his tenancy. On 14 April 1635 the Drapers' Company resolved to write to Herring about rent arrears of \u00a34 and to enquire whether he proposed to take up residence and preach before [[Midsummer]], after which time they would let his house to \"some brother of the company.\" It was duly leased on 17 September to John Betton, a draper.<ref name=ob279n4/>\n\n==Amsterdam==\n[[File:Tekening van kerk en begijnhof - Amsterdam - 20407839 - RCE.jpg|thumb|17th century print of the exterior of the English Reformed Church, from ''Beschrijvinge van Amsterdam'' by Tobias van Domselaer (1611-85).]]\nThis was a time of indecision for Herring. He received invitations to leave for [[New England]] but felt it was not for him.<ref name=clarke468>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clake, p. 468.]</ref> His reservations may have been connected with a letter Herring and thirteen other Puritan clerics sent in 1637 to ministers in New England, which raised the alarm about separatism among them.<ref name=odnb/> However, towards the end of 1636, some friends put forward his name to John Rulice or Rulitius, then a pastor<ref name=steven279>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n310/mode/2up Steven, p. 279.]</ref> of the [[English Reformed Church, Amsterdam]]. Rulice had been sent to London to find someone who might take over the responsibilities of [[John Paget (Puritan minister)|John Paget]],<ref name=clarke468/> the church's first pastor, now [[emeritus]]. The opportunity faced Herring with numerous issues and conflicts. Not only was he concerned to be leaving family and friends: he had a vast library of records, that might incriminate them, but were of great personal and religious value to himself and his cause. After much deliberation, he burnt most of this collection, fearing a search of his person ''en route'' or of his home after he had left. This he described as that \"Lesser martyrdom, wherein many of the best thoughts of his dearest friends were committed to flames.\" He was then forced to plan a secret journey, as Laud had forbidden clergy to travel abroad without a licence.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clarke, pp. 469-70.]</ref> After arranging a passage from [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], he made a will on 24 August 1637, leaving bequests for his wife and eight children. He then visited his sisters and set off for the coast with a brother-in-law, Oliver Bowles of [[Sutton, Bedfordshire]]. He avoided interception, reaching [[Rotterdam]] on 20 September and taking a wagon to Amsterdam the following day.<ref name=clarke470>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n525/mode/2up Clarke, p. 470.]</ref> He moved in with a friend, Whittaker, pending the arrival of his family and his remaining property.\n\nHerring delivered his first sermon on {{Bibleverse|Psalms|24:1|KJV}}: \"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.\" This met with great approval, securing his acceptance by the congregation. This paved the way for ratification by the Consistory of [[Holland]] and the [[Classis (ecclesiastical)|Classis]] of Amsterdam. From the outset, he took a full part in the liturgy and culture of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], keeping the fast decreed by the [[States General of the Netherlands]] for the success of the army at the [[Siege of Breda (1637)|Siege of Breda]]. The arrival of his family the following day was a further relief, allowing him to commit himself to the post. He was joined after a couple of years by Thomas Paget, John's brother, who also took preaching and pastoral responsibilities at the English Reformed Church.\n\nAmsterdam, then central to the wealth and culture of the [[Dutch Golden Age]] and a Protestant stronghold forged and tested in the [[Dutch Revolt]] and [[Thirty Years' war]], gave Herring at last an unrivalled platform. He was now part of a functioning presbyterian system,<ref name=odnb/> complete with a collegial ministry, much as he and moderate Puritans, like himself and the Pagets, had demanded for England. He was able to pronounce more or less freely on the situation at home, where [[Charles I of Scotland|Charles I's]] absolute monarchy ran into the crisis of the [[Bishops' War]], a prelude to the civil war in England. He prayed and spoke out for the establishment of a Presbyterian polity in England. He made a sharp distinction between the persons of the bishops, to whom he had no enmity, and their \"Pride and Prelatical rule.\"<ref name=clarke471>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n525/mode/2up Clarke, p. 471.]</ref> He continued to stress a middle position, troubled by the many fissile Independent and [[Baptist]] sects among the English exile community<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n300/mode/2up Steven, pp. 269-272.]</ref> in the Netherlands. When one of his sons returned to England, presumably around 1643, he warned him not to take part in any subversion of Presbyterian polity, saying \"I am sure it is the Government of Jesus Christ.\"<ref name=clarke471/>\n[[File:Passage of Newburn Ford.jpg|thumb|Victorian impression of the 1640 Scottish incursion into England.]]\nIn 1640 he welcomed the invasion of northern England by a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army expressing the hope that the Scots \"might be instruments of much good, but of no blood nor division between the two Nations.\" Clarke describes him as \"one of God's special Remembrancers, in behalf of England, begging fervently that the Lords and Commons in Parliament, might be preserved from the two destructive rocks of pride and self-interest.\" In May 1642, Lloyd died, leaving a vacancy at St Alkmund's. The Puritan party in Shrewsbury, headed by Rowley and Mackworth, invited Herring back to resume his ministry but he probably declined.<ref>Coulton, p. 90.</ref> In the event, the corporation proved supine at the commencement of hostilities and a [[Cavalier|royalist]] ''coup'' led by [[Francis Ottley]] allowed the king's field army to occupy Shrewsbury on 20 September.<ref>Coulton, p. 91-2.</ref> The next stage of campaigning led to the major but indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]], which Herring greeted with the prayer:\n\n<blockquote>Oh Lord wilt thou write Englands Reformation in red letters of her own blood; yet preserve thine own People, and maintaine thine own cause for Iesus Christs sake.<ref name=clarke471/></blockquote>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Samuel Clarke (minister).jpg|thumb|right|Samuel Clarke, biographer: a 1650 engraving attributed to [[Thomas Cross (engraver)|Thomas Cross]].]]\nHerring seems to have entered into a long illness and he was clearly troubled by periods of doubt as well as suffering, in the language of the time, assaults by Satan.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n527/mode/2up Clarke, p. 472.]</ref> His last reported words, after such a period of uncertainty, were: \"He is overcome, overcome, through the strength of my Lord and only Saviour Iesus, unto whom I am now going to keep a Sabbath in glory.\" He died the following morning, given by Clarke as Sunday 28 March 1644. The date is widely<ref name=odnb/><ref name=dnb/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n502/mode/2up Brook, p. 492.]</ref> but not universally accepted. William Steven in 1833 calculated Herring's ministry as lasting eight years from 1637, which implies he died in 1645.<ref name=steven279/> Coulton in 2010 noted that the corporation of Shrewsbury wrote to Herring again asking him to return, apparently in 1645, some months after the town fell to [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces.<ref>Coulton, p. 105.</ref> The corporation's invitation seems inconsistent with a death in 1644. Coulton is noncommital about the actual date, but points out that the register of the English Reformed Church shows he was certainly dead by 18 May 1645. The parishioners of Chad's parish in Shrewsbury subsequently switched their attention to Thomas Paget, Herring's co-pastor at Amsterdam, and in 1646 elected him their minister.<ref>Coulton, p. 106.</ref> Herring's will was proved by Christian, his widow on 26 March 1646.<ref name=odnb/>\n\nSamuel Clarke's biography of Herring, part of a set of Puritan studies appended to his ''Generall Martyrologie'', appeared as early as 1651, under the [[Commonwealth of England]], and is informed by many who knew Herring.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n\nHerring married Christian Gellibrand during the time he was preaching at Calke.  She was the third daughter of an English preacher who had served at [[Vlissingen]], and a granddaughter of John Oxenbridge, a celebrated Warwickshire Puritan minister:<ref name=clarke463/> hence she was a cousin of the [[John Oxenbridge]] who was a notable minister at [[Boston]], Massachusetts.  Christian outlived her husband by some years and was still alive and evidently in good standing with the Reformed community in 1651, when Clarke published his biography. One of her sisters married Robert Nicolls, minister at Wrenbury, another married Oliver Bowles of Sutton, Bedfordshire, and a third married one Barry of [[Cottesmore, Rutland]].

He was schooled initially at the small border village of [[More, Shropshire]] by a Mr Perkin, a close relative of his mother. [[Samuel Clarke (minister)|Samuel Clarke]], whose 1651 account is the basis for all later biographers, thought that it was from Perkin at More that Herring \"learned the Principles of Religion.\"<ref name=clarke462/> Clarke describes Perkin as a minister at ''More-chappel'' and these details have generally been accepted at face value.<ref name=odnb/> However, the [[Clergy of the Church of England database]] lists More as a [[parish church]] within the [[Diocese of Hereford]], not as a chapelry.<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=3295 CCEd Location ID: 3295.]</ref> [[Robert William Eyton|Eyton]], the pioneering historian of Shropshire, considered that More probably began as a chapelry of [[Lydbury North]] but \"became independent, at a period which the earliest Records fail to reach.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro11eytogoog#page/n320/mode/2up Eyton, p. 290.]</ref> CCEd does list some clergy at More in the 1580s and Perkin is not among them, although the database cannot be exhaustive. It does not note any parish school at More but there was one at nearby Lydbury, although records of staff seem to start only with the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=239242 CCEd Location ID: 239242.]</ref> The older [[Dictionary of National Biography]] avers that Perkin was a minister at ''Morechurch'':<ref name=dnb/> there is a Churchmoor, further east, in Lydbury North parish, but it is a hamlet with no chapel.\n\nHerring then moved to the family home at Coventry, where he attended the [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|Free Grammar School]]. Clarke credits his academic progress there to the then headmaster, whom he names as Reverend Master Tovey.<ref name=clarke462/> Even as a schoolboy he was noted for his piety. Clarke credits him with an early interest and delight in the [[Bible]] passages that deal with faith and repentance \u2013 themes typically of great concern to [[Protestant]]s. On play days, he and a few friends engaged in prayer and religious exercises before going out.\n\nIn May 1600 Herring was admitted as a scholar to [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]],<ref name=venn/> then a new, specifically Protestant institution. University records show he graduated [[Bachelor of Arts#United Kingdom and Ireland|BA]] in the academic year 1603-4: Clarke thought Herring returned to Coventry as a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]].<ref name=clarke462/> There he studied [[Divinity (academic discipline)|Divinity]] with the encouragement of [[Humphrey Fenn]], a noted advocate of Presbyterianism and formerly a client of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=9280|title=Fenn, Humphrey|first=Jan|last=Broadway}}</ref> Fenn had been suspended from his ministry since 1590 for his activities within a Warwickshire [[classis (ecclesiastical)|classis]] within the Church of England and had not regained his vicarage of [[Holy Trinity Church, Coventry]]. Herring, however, seems to have found opportunities to preach, winning considerable approval.<ref name=brook489/><ref name=clarke462/>\n\n==Calke==\n\nHerring was approaching the age to take up a parish ministry of his own, but this required [[Holy orders#Anglicanism|ordination]]. Number 36 of the [[Canon law (Church of England)|Book of Canons]], confirmed by the [[Convocations of Canterbury and York]] in 1604 and 1606 respectively, demanded that all candidates for ordination take a three-fold oath, accepting the royal supremacy, the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anglican.net/doctrines/1604-canon-law/#p1-3 |title=Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical, p. 3. |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1603|website=Anglican.net |access-date= 11 January 2016 |quote=}}</ref> The subscription book of the [[Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield]], which covered the area in Herring both lived and sought a living, summarised the oath as:\n\n<blockquote>The king is the only supreme governor under God of all things spiritual as well as temporal: the Book of Common Prayer, with the ordering of bishops priests and deacons, contains nothing contrary to the word of God: the Articles of Religion (1562) are agreeable to the word of God.<ref>Coulton, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHerring circumvented the requirement by securing ordination from an Irish bishop then visiting London. He was accompanied in this by other young Puritan men, including [[John Ball (Puritan)|John Ball]], a friend who was tutor to the children of Catherine and [[Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster|Robert Cholmondley]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n495/mode/2up Clarke, p.441-2.]</ref> Only after the ordination were the pair able to take up their first ecclesiastical appointments: Ball as curate of [[Whitmore, Staffordshire|Whitmore]] in [[Staffordshire]]; Herring as preacher at [[Calke]] in Derbyshire.\n\n[[File:Arthur Hildersham-Samuel Clarke.jpg|thumb|left|Arthur Hildersham, Puritan preacher, from Samuel Clarke's ''Generall Martyrologie'', 1651. Woodcut, artist unknown.]]\nHerring was recommended for the post at Calke by [[Arthur Hildersham]], the vicar of [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]], which was close by, although in [[Leicestershire]].<ref name=clarke463>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n517/mode/2up Clarke, p. 463.]</ref> In his early years he was both friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hildersham,<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#235 Rowe, p. 227.]</ref> part of a generation of younger disciples that included [[Simeon Ashe]] and Hildersham's own son, Samuel.<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#162 Rowe, p. 154.]</ref> Herring was not the first member of Hilderham's circle appointed to Calke: Robert Bainbridge, the patron, had earlier installed George More, a close associate of Hildersham and of [[John Darrell]]. During the 1590s More took part in the religious exercises of the Hildersham circle, which included fasting, prayer, lectures and fellowship,<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#169 Rowe, p. 161.]</ref> and supported Darrell in the highly controversial work of [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcism]].<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#282 Rowe, p. 274.]</ref>\n{{Wiktionary pipe|donative#English|donative}}\n\nClarke considered Calke a relatively secure base for Herring because it was a [[Royal peculiar|peculiar jurisdiction]] exempt from episcopal authority, as well as bringing the support of a sympathetic patron. CCEd, citing a 1772 reference, makes clear that Calke was a donative, rather than a peculiar.<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=233327 CCEd Location ID: 233327.]</ref> ''[[Magna Britannia]]'', published in 1817, numbered Calke among nine Derbyshire parishes that were donatives<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/magna-britannia/vol5/xi-xvii Lysons and Lysons, p. xi-xvii.]</ref> before the Victorian abolition of these institutions. In a donative the [[advowson|patron]] had the right to make an appointment to the [[benefice#Church of England|benefice]] without reference to the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]]<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalla01phil#page/252/mode/2up Phillimore, p. 252-3.]</ref> \u2013 in this case the local [[diocesan bishop]]. The church and the incumbent were exempt from ordinary jurisdiction:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalla01phil#page/254/mode/2up Phillimore, p. 254.]</ref> in a peculiar there is an ordinary jurisdiction but it does not belong to the local bishop. Calke church was part of Calke [[manorial system|manor]] \u2013 a former monastic estate that passed into lay hands through the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Although later named [[Calke Abbey]], it had actually been a very small [[Augustinian]] priory, which was absorbed as a mere cell into its own daughter house, [[Repton Priory]]: under the founder's terms, the church had been given to the canons on condition they supply it with a priest.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/derbs/vol2/pp58-63 Page, pp. 58-63.]</ref> Robert Bainbridge bought the Calke estate in 1582<ref name=bainbridge>M.

He was a militant Protestant, three times MP for [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]], who was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] during March 1587 after he had demanded the execution of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and supported [[Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet|Anthony Cope's]] proposal for a radical reform of Church government: he and his friends made the mistake of continuing to argue outside the chamber of the House of Commons, where they were not protected by [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|parliamentary privilege]].<ref name=bainbridge/>\n[[File:Simeon Ashe.jpg|thumb|Simeon Ashe]]\nAlthough Calke was a very small settlement, then as now, it seems to have formed an ideal base for Herring's ministry, which was primarily one of [[preaching]]. Clarke remarks that \"God was pleased to set a broad scale to his Ministry.\"<ref name=clarke463/> A clear and powerful preacher, he drew an audience from up to twenty towns and villages, with Sunday congregations in good weather so large that many were forced to cluster around the windows to hear him. Some brought picnics and made a day of it, while others bought refreshments from the \"threepenny ordinary\" provided for strangers. The impact of his preaching on the region was increased by the practice of returning home in groups, singing [[psalm]]s and discussing the [[sermon]]. Clarke thought that the effectiveness of Herring's preaching as part of the Hildersham circle was proved by the very high retention of Puritan converts in the region, who remained with the cause through the \"broken dividing times\" that followed: presumably meaning the period of [[Thorough]] or [[absolute monarchy]], the [[English Civil War]] and the [[Regicide#The regicide of Charles I of England|Regicide]]. Herring seems to have had a profound influence over Simeon Ashe, later a moderate Presbyterian preacher and an intimate of important parliamentarian leaders, including [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke]] and [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester]]. Herring took the opportunity of a relatively stable period in his life to marry and start a family. His wife was Christian<ref name=odnb/> Gellibrand. The match was remembered in Puritan hagiography as particularly happy and mutually-supportive.<ref name=clarke463/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n500/mode/2up Brook, p. 490.]</ref>\n\nHerring's ministry at Calke seems to have lasted until 1618. Clarke thought he was \"forced from thence for Nonconformity by the Prelatical power, being informed against by ill-affected men.\"<ref name=clarke463/> He gives no details of how Herring could be removed from a donative. Barbara Coulton, a recent historian of Shrewsbury during this the period, gives 1617 as the year Herring was recruited by William Rowley of Shrewsbury,<ref name=coulton75>Coulton, p. 75.</ref> suggesting that he was attracted by a more influential post rather than driven out of Calke. This is supported by the baptism of Christian, a daughter of Herring, at [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]] as early as 1 February 1618.<ref>Coulton, p. 76.</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish15lichshro#page/4/mode/2up ''St Chad's parish register'', Volume 1, p. 4.]</ref> Herring's patron Bainbridge must by this time have been elderly, as he first sat in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] in 1571.<ref name=bainbridge/> He may have been in financial difficulties: although he had a vault prepared for his burial at Calke, he sold the estate only three years after Herring's departure and died before July 1623.\n\n==Shrewsbury==\n\nIn 1618 Herring took up residence in Shrewsbury, at the invitation of the corporation, as lecturer at St Alkmund's Church. This was not an incumbency: the vicar of St Alkmund's throughout Herring's time in Shrewsbury was Thomas Lloyd, who had been appointed in 1607.<ref name=ob279>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/278/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 279.]</ref> Lloyd was held in no great regard as a preacher and was paid \u00a35 to read [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]].<ref name=coulton78>Coulton, p. 78.</ref> Herring's lectureship did not require an oath before the bishop, as it was privately funded by a \u00a320 annuity. This was provided by [[Rowland Heylyn]], a merchant of Welsh ancestry, educated at [[Shrewsbury School]] and a former parishioner of St Alkmund's, who had become immensely wealthy and powerful in the [[Worshipful Company of Ironmongers]] in London.<ref name=coulton75/> Heylyn had two sisters living in Shrewsbury, Ann and Eleanor, who were married respectively to John Nicholls and Richard Hunt, powerful local politicians who were associates of William Rowley, described by Clarke as \"a wise religious man.\"<ref name=clarke464>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n519/mode/2up Clarke, p. 464.]</ref> It was Rowley who made the initial approach to Herring and acted throughout as his \"faithful friend.\" It seems that he initially accommodated the Herring family in his own mansion.<ref name=coulton78/> Rowley was a member of Shrewsbury's powerful [[Shrewsbury Drapers Company|Drapers' Company]] and Hunt was its warden.<ref name=coulton79>Coulton, p. 79.</ref> The company's hall was vacant and it was probably they who prevailed on the members to lease it to Herring for \u00a34 annually, the company reserving the right to use it for meetings but agreeing to pay for repairs.<ref name=ob279n4>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/278/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 279-80, note 4.]</ref>\n\nHerring was obliged to preach twice weekly: on Tuesday morning and at 1 pm on Sunday. This was to avoid offending the other clergy in the town by poaching their congregations.<ref name=clarke464/> In addition, he repeated the Sunday sermon that evening, alternating between the houses of three powerful Puritan merchants: Edward Jones, George Wright and Rowley. A specimen of his preaching, showing his [[hermeneutic]] method at the service of his Puritan audience, runs:\n:{{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|3:22b|KJV}}: ''All are yours.''\n\n<blockquote>Yours! Whose meaneth the apostle by ''yours''? The Christian Corinths, to whome this epistle was directed, and those words. And what meaneth hee by the word ''all''. The verse itself shewes you. \"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, \u2013 or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, ''All are yours.''\" And the expression is of a further latitude, v. 21. for all ''things'' are yours. All things therefore are the true Christian's. This is the truth that I am to teach you. Therefore, without any further coherence of these words with the former, or resolving the text into parts, (which is the ordinarie course of ministers,)  I must fall upon this; \u2013 all things are the true Christian's.<ref name=ob279n4/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:ThomasMorton.jpg|thumb|Thomas Morton]]\n\nHerring was subject to attack and controversy on both sides, conservative and radical, during his preaching ministry at Shrewsbury. As early as 1620, just after [[Thomas Morton (bishop)|Thomas Morton]] became Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, Herring was reported to the authorities for failure to use the prayer book and to receive or administer the sacraments.<ref name=odnb/> Morton had clashed with Puritan clergy in his former [[Diocese of Chester]] over ceremonial practices and the [[Declaration of Sports]]. His response had been [[eirenic]] in spirit,<ref name=coulton79/> if sometimes exacting and abrasive in person: he had, for example, given [[Thomas Paget (Puritan minister)|Thomas Paget]], a leading Lancashire Puritan minister, 10 shillings towards his legal expenses after compelling him to appear with a list of written arguments against signing with the cross in [[Infant baptism|baptism]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/defenceofchurchg00page#page/n13/mode/2up Thomas Paget, ''An Humble Advertisment (sic) to the high Court of Parliament'' p. 8. in John Paget: ''A Defence Of Church-Government, Exercised in Presbyteriall, Classicall, & Synodall Assemblies''.]</ref> Morton referred Herring to two neighbouring ministers for satisfaction and he made a written statement of his reservations. The two ministers supported Herring with a certificate to the bishop and he pronounced himself satisfied with Herring's integrity. However, the incident opened up a series of suspensions and reinstatements.<ref name=clarke465>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n519/mode/2up Clarke p. 465.]</ref> It seems that he continued to conduct private fasts and Bible expositions even during periods when his public ministry was made impossible. These would have been held in Draper's Hall, which was his own home.<ref name=coulton82>Coulton, p. 82.</ref>\n\nOpposition to Herring coalesced around Peter Studley, who was incumbent or [[curate]] of St Chad's from 1622<ref>Coulton, p. 80.</ref> and also took responsibility for St Julian's, which was very close.<ref name=coulton82/> His appointment seems to reflect the emergence on the corporation of a conservative opposition, which was able to appoint a second lecturer to St Alkmund's: Samuel Greaves, the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Berrington, Shropshire|Berrington]], who preached on Wednesday mornings for \u00a310 a year.<ref name=coulton83>Coulton, p. 83.</ref> An [[canonical visitation|episcopal visitation]] of 1626, possibly attended by Morton himself, found Studley at loggerheads with the town's Puritans and many of the complaints and counter-claims were directly related to Herring's preaching ministry. The congregation of St Julian's were up in arms because, they alleged, Studley deliberately timed services to prevent them attending preaching elsewhere, but refrained from preaching himself. Studley reported Rowley and Wright for holding preaching and prayer meetings in their homes on Sunday evenings, suggesting that the episcopal court should judge whether or not these constituted [[conventicle]]s.<ref name=coulton82/> However, Studley was also meeting fierce opposition from a more radical group of poorer parishioners, of whom the most prominent were [[Katherine Chidley]] and her family.<ref name=coulton83/> Chidley had led a group of women in refusing to take part in the [[churching of women]], which some Puritans found offensive and for which Studley demanded a fee. She arrived through her experiences at separatist conclusions and was later to write in justification of [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] or [[Congregationalist polity|Congregationalist]] tendency within Puritanism. Herring was opposed to this group, and Clarke reports his frequent observation:\n\n<blockquote>It is a sin of an high nature to unchurch a Nation at once, and that this would become the spring of many other fearful errours, for separation will eat like a Gangrene into the heart of Godlinesse. And he did pray, that they who would un-church others, might not be un-christianed themselves.<ref name=clarke465/></blockquote>\n\nHerring's opposition to separatism was also made manifest by his attendance at his local parish church, even though he had an appointment in a neighbouring parish. He attended the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] at [[St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury|St Mary's]], a royal peculiar<ref name=coulton82/> that was effectively controlled by the corporation. The vicar on Herring's arrival was William Bright, a nominee of the Puritan divine [[Laurence Chaderton]],<ref>Coulton, p. 77.</ref> and congenial to Herring. However, Bright died in October 1618 and was buried on the 29th of that month.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/56/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 56.]</ref> He was replaced, on Chaderton's recommendation,<ref name=coulton79/> with [[Samuel Browne (divine)|Samuel Browne]], a more moderate figure who nevertheless stoutly defended his church against episcopal interference.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=3696|title=Browne, Samuel|first=Elizabeth|last=Allen}}</ref> On 19 January 1620, the St Mary's parish register records the burial of \"A sonn, being not baptized, of Mr. Hearing, a Mynester of God's word.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/58/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 58.]</ref>  Later in the same year, on 17 December, the register records a baptism: \"Samuell, s. of Mr. Hearing, preacher of the Word.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/58/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 59.]</ref> These descriptions suggest concord between Browne and Herring.<ref name=coulton79/> Moreover, for the baptism of Dorcas on 30 January 1623 Herring is again described as a preacher of the Word,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/62/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 63.]</ref> and for Mary's on 6 February 1625 as \"Mynester,\" while Browne himself is described in the entry for his own daughter's baptism as \"publique preacher.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/66/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 67.]</ref> This suggests a looseness of terminology and a sense of equality and respect between the two clerics. The baptisms of two more children chart Herring's residence in the parish: for Joanna's on 19 August 1627 he is simply \"Mr. Jolynus Hearing.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/72/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 72.]</ref> However, after Browne's death in 1632 and the appointment of the Puritan James Betton to St Mary's,<ref name=coulton86/> the entry for Herring's son Theophilus on 5 September 1633 again uses the title \"Minister\".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/82/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 82.]</ref> As he continued a valued parishioner of St Mary's, Herring's position at St Alkmund's also became more secure. Heylyn operated through a group of Puritan ministers and businessmen who had established a body known as the [[Feoffees for Impropriations]], sometimes known as the Collectors of [[St Antholin, Budge Row|St Antholin]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/270/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 271-2.]</ref> to channel funds into Puritan preaching. Heylyn became a feoffee in 1626 and two years later oversaw the acquisition of the [[advowson]] of St Alkmund's and a lease on the tithes of St Mary's.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=13172|title=Heylyn, Rowland|first=Marc L.|last=Schwarz}}</ref> His distance from any radicalism strengthened his position, so that it was admitted even by his enemies:\n\n<blockquote>Though he be scrupulous in matter of ceremony, yet he is a loyal subject unto the King, and a true friend unto the state.<ref name=clarke464/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Worfield - Margaret Bromley 01.JPG|thumb|Effigy of Lady Margaret Bromley, [[Worfield]].]]\n\nHerring continued to make and maintain links with moderate Presbyterian preachers in the region and beyond, gaining recognition for Shrewsbury as the centre of a Puritan network.<ref name=odnb/> He brought his brother-in-law, Robert Nicolls of [[Wrenbury]], and Thomas Pierson of [[Brampton Bryan]] to preach in the town.<ref name=clarke464/> It is possible that Samuel Clarke, Herring's biographer, also visited Shrewsbury.<ref>Coulton p. 84.</ref> Along with John Ball, Pierson, Nicolls and Herring were part of a group who met for religious exercises in [[Sheriffhales]] at the home of Lady [[Margaret Bromley]],<ref name=clarke469>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clarke, p. 469.]</ref> widow from 1626 of the noted judge [[Edward Bromley|Sir Edward Bromley]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/TheVisitationOfShropshireV.28/VisitationshrophshiretAken1623_treswellVol28P1#page/n131/mode/2up ''Visitation of Shropshire'', p. 78.]</ref>\n[[File:William Laud.jpg|thumb|left|William Laud]]\nDuring the 1630s the bitterness of religious conflict at Shrewsbury intensified to a pitch that brought national attention and made Herring's position precarious. [[Robert Wright (bishop)|Bishop Wright's]] visitation of the town provided Studley with an opportunity for a triumphal reading  of ordinances on the decoration of churches, but also for a denunciation of his opponents that revealed the depth of opposition. Herring's supporters, Rowley and Wright, were now joined by [[Humphrey Mackworth (Parliamentarian)|Humphrey Mackworth]] as leaders of a group that refused to bow at the Name of Jesus and to kneel for communion, and so were counted as refusers of the Eucharist.<ref>Coulton, p. 85.</ref> Studley went on to write a savage denunciation of Puritanism, ''The Looking-Glass of Schisme'', claiming that religious nonconformity had influenced the commission of sensational murders at Clun.<ref name=coulton86>Coulton, p. 86.</ref> The furore in Shrewsbury attracted the attention of [[William Laud]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] himself. Laud proposed to use negotiations over the renewal of the town's charter to prize the town's main churches free of the corporation's control.<ref>Coulton, p. 87.</ref> He acknowledged Herring's role in the town's opposition with the comment: \"I will pickle up that Herring of Shrewsbury.\" Herring's response is reported as:\n\n<blockquote>If he will abuse his power, let it teach Christians the more to use their prayers. And be then prayed that the Non-conformists enemies might by observation that they have a good God to trust unto, when trampled upon by ill-despised men.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n521/mode/2up Clarke, p. 466.]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLaud instituted a visitation of the entire [[Province of Canterbury]] in 1635, with [[Nathaniel Brent]] conducting enquiries in the Lichfield diocese. Brent suspended Puritans at [[St Peter's Collegiate Church]] in Wolverhampton, before moving on to Shrewsbury, where he also came into conflict with local clergy.<ref name=coulton88>Coulton, p. 88.</ref> At some point in the early part of 1635 Herring and his family left Shrewsbury.\n\n==Wrenbury==\n[[File:St Margarets Wrenbury.jpg|thumb|St Margaret's Church Wrenbury, where Nicolls and Peartree were incumbents.]]\nHerring sought a home first in [[Wrenbury]], [[Cheshire]], where his wife's sister lived: Robert Nicolls, her husband and Herring's friend, had died at Sheriffhales in 1630.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n386/mode/2up Brook, p. 375.]</ref> Wrenbury had originally been part of the parish of [[St Mary's Church, Acton]], and its church was still in the gift of the vicar of Acton.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketch00urwi#page/138/mode/2up Urwick, p. 138.]</ref> The incumbent was William Peartree of [[Bury St Edmunds]], who had been suspended by Brent.<ref name=coulton88/> Herring had no formal appointment but lived privately as a parishioner, offering pastoral support by \"comforting afflicted consciences.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n521/mode/2up Clarke, p. 467.]</ref> Clarke claimed that Herring only moved to Wrenbury after despairing of his future in Shrewsbury, but it seems that he had not taken steps formally to terminate his lectureship or even his tenancy. On 14 April 1635 the Drapers' Company resolved to write to Herring about rent arrears of \u00a34 and to enquire whether he proposed to take up residence and preach before [[Midsummer]], after which time they would let his house to \"some brother of the company.\" It was duly leased on 17 September to John Betton, a draper.<ref name=ob279n4/>\n\n==Amsterdam==\n[[File:Tekening van kerk en begijnhof - Amsterdam - 20407839 - RCE.jpg|thumb|17th century print of the exterior of the English Reformed Church, from ''Beschrijvinge van Amsterdam'' by Tobias van Domselaer (1611-85).]]\nThis was a time of indecision for Herring. He received invitations to leave for [[New England]] but felt it was not for him.<ref name=clarke468>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clake, p. 468.]</ref> His reservations may have been connected with a letter Herring and thirteen other Puritan clerics sent in 1637 to ministers in New England, which raised the alarm about separatism among them.<ref name=odnb/> However, towards the end of 1636, some friends put forward his name to John Rulice or Rulitius, then a pastor<ref name=steven279>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n310/mode/2up Steven, p. 279.]</ref> of the [[English Reformed Church, Amsterdam]]. Rulice had been sent to London to find someone who might take over the responsibilities of [[John Paget (Puritan minister)|John Paget]],<ref name=clarke468/> the church's first pastor, now [[emeritus]]. The opportunity faced Herring with numerous issues and conflicts. Not only was he concerned to be leaving family and friends: he had a vast library of records, that might incriminate them, but were of great personal and religious value to himself and his cause. After much deliberation, he burnt most of this collection, fearing a search of his person ''en route'' or of his home after he had left. This he described as that \"Lesser martyrdom, wherein many of the best thoughts of his dearest friends were committed to flames.\" He was then forced to plan a secret journey, as Laud had forbidden clergy to travel abroad without a licence.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clarke, pp. 469-70.]</ref> After arranging a passage from [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], he made a will on 24 August 1637, leaving bequests for his wife and eight children. He then visited his sisters and set off for the coast with a brother-in-law, Oliver Bowles of [[Sutton, Bedfordshire]]. He avoided interception, reaching [[Rotterdam]] on 20 September and taking a wagon to Amsterdam the following day.<ref name=clarke470>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n525/mode/2up Clarke, p. 470.]</ref> He moved in with a friend, Whittaker, pending the arrival of his family and his remaining property.\n\nHerring delivered his first sermon on {{Bibleverse|Psalms|24:1|KJV}}: \"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.\" This met with great approval, securing his acceptance by the congregation. This paved the way for ratification by the Consistory of [[Holland]] and the [[Classis (ecclesiastical)|Classis]] of Amsterdam. From the outset, he took a full part in the liturgy and culture of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], keeping the fast decreed by the [[States General of the Netherlands]] for the success of the army at the [[Siege of Breda (1637)|Siege of Breda]]. The arrival of his family the following day was a further relief, allowing him to commit himself to the post. He was joined after a couple of years by Thomas Paget, John's brother, who also took preaching and pastoral responsibilities at the English Reformed Church.\n\nAmsterdam, then central to the wealth and culture of the [[Dutch Golden Age]] and a Protestant stronghold forged and tested in the [[Dutch Revolt]] and [[Thirty Years' war]], gave Herring at last an unrivalled platform. He was now part of a functioning presbyterian system,<ref name=odnb/> complete with a collegial ministry, much as he and moderate Puritans, like himself and the Pagets, had demanded for England. He was able to pronounce more or less freely on the situation at home, where [[Charles I of Scotland|Charles I's]] absolute monarchy ran into the crisis of the [[Bishops' War]], a prelude to the civil war in England. He prayed and spoke out for the establishment of a Presbyterian polity in England. He made a sharp distinction between the persons of the bishops, to whom he had no enmity, and their \"Pride and Prelatical rule.\"<ref name=clarke471>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n525/mode/2up Clarke, p. 471.]</ref> He continued to stress a middle position, troubled by the many fissile Independent and [[Baptist]] sects among the English exile community<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n300/mode/2up Steven, pp. 269-272.]</ref> in the Netherlands. When one of his sons returned to England, presumably around 1643, he warned him not to take part in any subversion of Presbyterian polity, saying \"I am sure it is the Government of Jesus Christ.\"<ref name=clarke471/>\n[[File:Passage of Newburn Ford.jpg|thumb|Victorian impression of the 1640 Scottish incursion into England.]]\nIn 1640 he welcomed the invasion of northern England by a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army expressing the hope that the Scots \"might be instruments of much good, but of no blood nor division between the two Nations.\" Clarke describes him as \"one of God's special Remembrancers, in behalf of England, begging fervently that the Lords and Commons in Parliament, might be preserved from the two destructive rocks of pride and self-interest.\" In May 1642, Lloyd died, leaving a vacancy at St Alkmund's. The Puritan party in Shrewsbury, headed by Rowley and Mackworth, invited Herring back to resume his ministry but he probably declined.<ref>Coulton, p. 90.</ref> In the event, the corporation proved supine at the commencement of hostilities and a [[Cavalier|royalist]] ''coup'' led by [[Francis Ottley]] allowed the king's field army to occupy Shrewsbury on 20 September.<ref>Coulton, p. 91-2.</ref> The next stage of campaigning led to the major but indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]], which Herring greeted with the prayer:\n\n<blockquote>Oh Lord wilt thou write Englands Reformation in red letters of her own blood; yet preserve thine own People, and maintaine thine own cause for Iesus Christs sake.<ref name=clarke471/></blockquote>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Samuel Clarke (minister).jpg|thumb|right|Samuel Clarke, biographer: a 1650 engraving attributed to [[Thomas Cross (engraver)|Thomas Cross]].]]\nHerring seems to have entered into a long illness and he was clearly troubled by periods of doubt as well as suffering, in the language of the time assaults by Satan.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n527/mode/2up Clarke, p. 472.]</ref> His last reported words, after such a period of uncertainty, were: \"He is overcome, overcome, through the strength of my Lord and only Saviour Iesus, unto whom I am now going to keep a Sabbath in glory.\" He died the following morning, given by Clarke as Sunday 28 March 1644. The date is widely<ref name=odnb/><ref name=dnb/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n502/mode/2up Brook, p. 492.]</ref> but not universally accepted. William Steven in 1833 calculated Herring's ministry as lasting eight years from 1637, which implies he died in 1645.<ref name=steven279/> Coulton in 2010 noted that the corporation of Shrewsbury wrote to Herring again asking him to return, apparently in 1645, some months after the town fell to [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces.<ref>Coulton, p. 105.</ref> The corporation's invitation seems inconsistent with a death in 1644. Coulton is noncommital about the actual date, but points out that the register of the English Reformed Church shows he was certainly dead by 18 May 1645. The parishioners of Chad's parish in Shrewsbury subsequently switched their attention to Thomas Paget, Herring's co-pastor at Amsterdam, and in 1646 elected him their minister.<ref>Coulton, p. 106.</ref> Herring's will was proved by Christian, his widow on 26 March 1646.<ref name=odnb/>\n\nSamuel Clarke's biography of Herring, part of a set of Puritan studies appended to his ''Generall Martyrologie'', appeared as early as 1651, under the [[Commonwealth of England]], and is informed by many who knew Herring.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n\nHerring married Christian Gellibrand during the time he was preaching at Calke.  She was the third daughter of an English preacher who had served at [[Vlissingen]], and a granddaughter of John Oxenbridge, a celebrated Warwickshire Puritan minister:<ref name=clarke463/> hence she was a cousin of the [[John Oxenbridge]] who was a notable minister at [[Boston]], Massachusetts.  Christian outlived her husband by some years and was still alive and evidently in good standing with the Reformed community in 1651, when Clarke published his biography. One of her sisters married Robert Nicolls, minister at Wrenbury, another married Oliver Bowles of Sutton, Bedfordshire, and a third married one Barry of [[Cottesmore, Rutland]].
