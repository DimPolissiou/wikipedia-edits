It is the country's largest urban centre. It is situated on the Atlantic Ocean coast at the mouth of the [[Demerara River]] and it was nicknamed the \"Garden City of the Caribbean\".\n\nGeorgetown serves primarily as a retail and administrative centre. It also serves as a financial services centre. The city recorded a population of 200,500 in the 2016 census.<ref name=census/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Wesleyan Mission Premises, George-Town, Demerara (VII, p.1, January 1950) - Copy.jpg|thumb|280px|Wesleyan Mission Premises, George-Town, Demerara (1850)<ref name=Offering1850>{{cite journal|title=Wesleyan Mission Premises, George-Town, Demerara|journal=Wesleyan Juvenile Offering|date=January 1850|volume=VII|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a1wEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=19 November 2015|publisher=Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society|location=London}}</ref>]]\nThe city of Georgetown began as a small town in the 18th century. Originally, the capital of the [[Demerara-Essequibo]] colony was located on Borselen Island in the [[Demerara River]] under the administration of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. When the colony was captured by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1781, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Kingston chose the mouth of the Demerara River for the establishment of a town which was situated between Plantations [[Werk-en-rust]] and Vlissengen.\n\nIt was the French who made it a capital city when they colonized it in 1782. The French called the capital Longchamps. When the town was restored to the Dutch in 1784, it was renamed [[Stabroek, Guyana|Stabroek]] after [[Nicolaas Geelvinck]], Lord of Stabroek, and president of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. Eventually the town expanded and covered the estates of Vlissengen, La Bourgade and Eve Leary to the North, and Werk-en-rust and La Repentir to the South.\n[[File:Kingston Georgetown 19 Century.jpg|thumb|280px|A view of the Kingston section of Georgetown in the 19th century.]]\n\nIt was renamed Georgetown on 29 April 1812 in honour of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. On 5 May 1812 an ordinance was passed to the effect that the town formerly called Stabroek, with districts extending from La Penitence to the bridges in Kingston and entering upon the road to the military camps, shall be called Georgetown.\n\nThe ordinance provided that the various districts of Georgetown shall be known by their own names.  The supervision of Georgetown was to be done by a committee chosen by the governor and Court of Policy.  Estimates of expenditure were to be prepared.\n\nBy 1806 the owner of Vlissingen asked to be exempted from the responsibility of maintaining the road which is now called Camp Street, but the Court refused the request.  In 1810 the maintenance of the roads in the area called Georgetown cost 11,000 guilders per annum.\n\nThe governing body of Georgetown was once a Board of Police.  The Board of Police was chosen by the governor and the Court of Policy.  It came into existence as the result of disputes among various organisations which controlled the districts. The board met monthly but what was discussed is not on the records between 1825 and 1837. Newspapers in the colony were prohibited by law from reporting public matters.\n\nThe post of Commissary of Police was not regarded as important.  People elected to the board invariably declined to attend meetings and never gave reasons for their refusal. It was, therefore, decided that individuals elected to the board were bound to serve for two years, or suffer a penalty of 1,000 guilders. The Board of Police was abolished when an ordinance was passed to establish a mayor and town council.\n\nGeorgetown gained official city status on 24 August 1842 during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nThe names of Georgetown's wards and streets reflect the influence of the Dutch, French and English who administered the town at different periods of history.\n\nCummingsburg was originally named Plantation La Bourgade by its first owner, Jacques Salignac. It was laid out in streets and building lots by its second proprietor, Thomas Cuming, a Scotsman, from whom it gets its current name. He made a presentation of the Militia Parade Ground and Promenade Gardens to the town as a gift. Carmichael Street was named after General [[Hugh Lyle Carmichael]] who served as governor from 1812 to 1813. He died in March 1813 and was buried in the Officers' Cemetery, Eve Leary.\n\nWater Street was so called because it ran along the riverside and formed the original river dam. High Street formed the leading road from the East Bank to the East Coast of Demerara. The part of High Street that ran through Cummingsburg was called Main Street. Camp Street received its name because it was the road which led to the camp or garrison at the northern end of the city. Kingston got its name from King George of England. It was part of Pln. Eve Leary which was named after the wife or daughter of its owner, Cornelis Leary. Some of the streets of Kingston have military names because the garrison used to be located there, e.g. Parade Street, Barrack Street and Fort Street.\n\nLacytown was another leasehold portion of Plantation Vlissengen. Luke M. Hill* states that it was named after the lessee, George Lacy, who was related to the family of General Sir De Lacy Evans (sic. -  General Sir George de Lacy Evans GCB), a Crimean war hero. The owner of Vlissengen was Joseph Bourda, Member of the Court of Policy. After his son and heir disappeared at sea, the government claimed the property under the authority of the Vlissengen Ordinance of 1876. A new district of Bourda was laid out and Lacytown was improved by the Board of Vlissengen Commissioners.\n\nBourda Street and the ward of Bourda were named after Joseph Bourda, Member of the Court of Policy and former owner of Pln. Vlissengen. It was laid out by the Commissioner of Vlissengen in 1879. The [[Bourda Cemetery, Guyana|Bourda Cemetery]] holds the remains of many citizens of Georgetown. Only those persons who owned family vaults or burial rights in the enclosed ground used it.\n\nIn 1945 a large fire (The Great Fire) broke out in the city, causing widespread damage.\n\n*Reference: Luke M. Hill - The Nomenclature of Georgetown in Timehri: The Journal of the Royal Agricultural and Commercial Society of British Guiana (Third Series) Vol.1, January 1911, p.&nbsp;42\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGeorgetown is located on Guyana's Atlantic coast on the east bank of Demerara River estuary. The terrain in this part of the country where the city is located is flat coastal plains. The city is surrounded by a blanket of cane fields along with marshy swamps, and savannah lands on its east and south. The elevation of the land is one metre below the high tide level. This low elevation is protected by a retaining wall known as the seawall to keep the ocean out and an innovative network of canals with kokers to drain the city of excess water. Guyana has 10 administrative regions with 4 natural regions.\n\n=== Climate ===\nGeorgetown has a year-round hot trade-wind [[tropical rainforest climate]]. Relative humidity fluctuates throughout the year with the highest occurring in May, June, August and December\u2013January; these months are usually the rainiest part of the year. Between the months of September to November relative humidity is lower ushering in the drier season.\n\nGeorgetown does not truly have a [[dry season]] \u2013 monthly precipitation in all 12 months is above {{convert|60|mm|in}}. Because of its location Georgetown's temperatures are moderated by the North-East [[trade winds]] blowing in from the North Atlantic and so it rarely sees temperatures above 31 degrees Celsius.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Georgetown (1961\u20131990)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 28.6\n|Feb high C = 28.9\n|Mar high C = 29.2\n|Apr high C = 29.5\n|May high C = 29.4\n|Jun high C = 29.2\n|Jul high C = 29.6\n|Aug high C = 30.2\n|Sep high C = 30.8\n|Oct high C = 30.8\n|Nov high C = 30.2\n|Dec high C = 29.1\n|year high C = 29.6\n|Jan mean C = 26.1\n|Feb mean C = 26.4\n|Mar mean C = 26.7\n|Apr mean C = 27.0\n|May mean C = 26.8\n|Jun mean C = 26.5\n|Jul mean C = 26.6\n|Aug mean C = 27.0\n|Sep mean C = 27.5\n|Oct mean C = 27.6\n|Nov mean C = 27.2\n|Dec mean C = 26.4\n|year mean C = 26.8\n|Jan low C = 23.6\n|Feb low C = 23.9\n|Mar low C = 24.2\n|Apr low C = 24.4\n|May low C = 24.3\n|Jun low C = 23.8\n|Jul low C = 23.5\n|Aug low C = 23.8\n|Sep low C = 24.2\n|Oct low C = 24.4\n|Nov low C = 24.2\n|Dec low C = 23.8\n|year low C = 24.0\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 185.2\n|Feb rain mm = 88.5\n|Mar rain mm = 111.0\n|Apr rain mm = 140.5\n|May rain mm = 285.5\n|Jun rain mm = 327.7\n|Jul rain mm = 268.0\n|Aug rain mm = 201.4\n|Sep rain mm = 97.5\n|Oct rain mm = 107.2\n|Nov rain mm = 185.9\n|Dec rain mm = 261.9\n|year rain mm = 2260.3\n|Jan rain days = 16\n|Feb rain days = 10\n|Mar rain days = 10\n|Apr rain days = 12\n|May rain days = 19\n|Jun rain days = 23\n|Jul rain days = 21\n|Aug rain days = 15\n|Sep rain days = 9\n|Oct rain days = 9\n|Nov rain days = 12\n|Dec rain days = 18\n|year rain days = 174\n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan sun = 201.0\n|Feb sun = 208.6\n|Mar sun = 219.7\n|Apr sun = 197.9\n|May sun = 178.8\n|Jun sun = 156.7\n|Jul sun = 201.6\n|Aug sun = 233.7\n|Sep sun = 229.8\n|Oct sun = 235.3\n|Nov sun = 210.9\n|Dec sun = 186.6\n|year sun = 2460.6\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name = NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REGIII/BG/81001.TXT\n| title = Georgetown Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = April 23, 2015}}</ref>\n|date=August 2011}}\n\n== The capital city ==\n[[File:Parliament Georgetown Guyana.JPG|thumb|300px|Parliament Building]]\n[[File:Cottage of city Georgetown.jpg|thumb|300px|The High Court]]\nGeorgetown is the seat of the central Government of Guyana. All executive departments are located in the city. [[Parliament Building, Guyana|Parliament Building]], Guyana's Legislative Building, is also found in Georgetown and so is the Court of Appeals, Guyana's highest judicial court.\n\nThe [[State House, Guyana|State House]] (the official residence of the head of state), as well as the offices and residence of the head of government, are both located in the city. Georgetown is the capital city as well as the main economic base of Guyana.\n\n== Economy ==\n\nGeorgetown is Guyana's largest urban centre, containing a large portion of its commerce. Within the metro area there is the [[CARICOM]] headquarters, the Administrative Arm of the Caribbean Regional Integration Organisation. Georgetown also is home to a [[seaport]].  Guyana's international airport, [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport| Cheddi Jagan International Airport/Timehri]], an hour south of Georgetown is a destination for [[Caribbean Airlines]] (the airline formerly known as [[BWIA]] or \"\"bwee\"\"), [[LIAT]], [[META - Mesquita Transportes Aereos|META]], and Travel Span GT.\n\nCloser to the city is the newly expanded [[Ogle Airport]], with a terminal facility geared to handle regional, international and inter-Caricom flights, connecting CARICOM states with the CARICOM Secretariat. The city has many highway projects under construction although the four-lane East Coast Highway was completed in 2005. Georgetown accounts for a large portion of Guyana's GDP.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport]] (formerly Timehri Airport) acts as the major air transportation hub for the city, which is located on the right bank of the Demerara River, 41 kilometres south of Georgetown. Direct international flights as well as connecting service from [[New York City]], [[Miami]], [[Toronto]], [[Panama City, Panama]], [[Bridgetown]], [[Port of Spain]], [[Paramaribo]], [[Aruba]] and [[Cura\u00e7ao]] are flown.  All scheduled passenger jet service for Georgetown is operated via this international airport.\n\nClose-in [[Ogle Airport]] also serves Georgetown.  [[Leeward Islands Air Transport]] ([[LIAT]]) operates scheduled passenger flights from Ogle with [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] regional propjet aircraft nonstop to [[Port of Spain]] and [[Barbados]] as well as direct to other Caribbean islands.  Helicopters also use this airport for support of offshore oil and gas exploration activities.\n\nThere is a regular coach service between Georgetown and Boa Vista in [[Brazil]], and once-daily connections to [[Paramaribo]], [[Suriname]] via a ferry crossing on the [[Corentyne River]]. Transportation can be by bus, car, or boat. The [[Demerara Harbour Bridge]] is a major crossing point.  The [[Berbice Bridge]] located to the east near [[New Amsterdam, Guyana]] is also transfer point to get to Georgetown or anywhere else.  Most of the West Coast, East Bank, East Coast and Berbice, Guyana are served by numerous private buses.  Taxi service is available almost everywhere along the coast including in large numbers in Georgetown. A number of highways have been newly constructed and the government is working to rehabilitate all roads in the country.\n\n=== Cost of living ===\nElectricity prices are about US$0.33 per unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gplinc.com/information/rates |title=Electricity Rates &#124; GPL Inc |publisher=GPL Inc. |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607034732/http://www.gplinc.com/information/rates |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> A domestic gas bottle (or gas cylinder) is over US$20.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baiganchoka.com/blog/impact-of-increased-cost-of-living-in-guyana/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729040357/http://www.baiganchoka.com/blog/impact-of-increased-cost-of-living-in-guyana/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 July 2012 |title=Impact of Increased Cost of Living in Guyana |publisher=Baiganchoka |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nGeorgetown recorded a population of 118,363 in the 2012 Guyanese census, down 12 percent from the 134,497 people counted in the 2002 census.<ref name=census/> In 2002, about 70,962 (53%) listed themselves as [[Black people|Black]]/[[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]; 31,902 (24%) as [[Mixed Race|mixed]]; 26,542 (20%) as [[Indian people|East Indian]];  1,441 (1.1%) as [[Amerindian]]; 1075 (0.8%) as [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]; 475 (0.35%) as [[Chinese people|Chinese]]; 2,265 (1.7%) as \"don't know/not stated\"; 196 (0.15%) as [[white people|white]] not of Portuguese descent; 35 as \"other\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/ |title=Bureau of Statistics \u2013 Guyana |publisher=Statisticsguyana.gov.gy |date= |accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Points of interest==\n[[File:St georges.jpg|thumb|210px|St. George's Anglican Cathedral]]\n\nGeorgetown is laid out in a north\u2013south, east\u2013west grid, interlaced with canals protected by [[kokers]], or sluices, built by the Dutch and later the British that provide drainage to a city that lies {{convert|3|ft|m|order=flip}} below high-tide level.

Bel Air Park, Bel Air Gardens, Lamaha Gardens and Bel Air Springs are well known ultimately as places for the rich and powerful. Most residents here are high ranking executives or government officials. These close gated neighbourhoods of the city are mostly concentrated in the northeastern part towards Greater Georgetown and the Atlantic.\n\nGreater Georgetown contains some notable places such as:\n\n*The University of Guyana (Headquarters)\n*[[The Cyril Potter College of Education]]\n*[[Secretariat of the Caribbean Community|The Caribbean Community Secretariat]] (Headquarters of CARICOM)\n*The Guyana International Conference Centre\n*Ocean View International Hotel\n*Guyana Sugar Corporation (Headquarters of the country's largest corporation)\n*Ogle Airport (Guyana's local air transport facility)\n\n'''South Georgetown''' \u2013 incorporated communities of neighbourhoods along the eastern bank of the Demerara River such as [[Pattensen, Turkeyen (Sophia)|Sophia]], Roxanne Burnham Gardens, Albouystown, and Agricola. Those are well known and highly regarded poor areas of the city.  Some areas such as Houston Estates, Ruimvelt and Thirst Park have retained high levels of affluence.\n\n=== City neighbourhoods===\n[[File:Dwelling in city.jpg|thumb|300px|A Colonial era residence in Georgetown.]]\nKnown for its historic importance, Georgetown remains the administrative centre for the central Government.\n\nNorth of Georgetown lies Main Street, where the head of state's official residence can be found along with several other important Government buildings, including the Ministry of Finance. East of Georgetown stretches towards the Avenue of the Republic, where Georgetown's city hall building is located, as well as the St. George's Cathedral. Also on the east side is Brickdam, which is the single most concentrated area of executive departments and agencies. The Ministries of Health, Education, Home Affairs, Housing and Water are all located on Brickdam.\n\nWest of Stabroek Market is the Port of Georgetown, the largest and busiest shipping point in Guyana.\nStabroek Market itself contains the Ministry of Labour as well as the Ministry of Human Services and Social Security. It is also the host facility for the equally famous Stabroek markets.\n\n*Regent Street \u2013 Georgetown's premier shopping district.\n*Sheriff Street \u2013 Guyana's main entertainment area; contains most of the city's clubs, bars and restaurants.\n\n=== Suburbs ===\n[[File:Smaller Providence Stadium inside.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Providence Stadium]] hosted several [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] matches, replacing [[Bourda]] as the national stadium and [[cricket test|test]] venue]]\n[[File:Georgetown28022007.jpg|thumb|300px|The International Conference Centre]]\nSuburban Georgetown consists of Greater Georgetown and Uptown Georgetown and contains the following suburbs of the city:\n\n*Republic Park\n*Nandy Park\n*Providence\n*Felicity\n*Bel Air\n*Vreed en Hoop\n*Kingston\n*Queenstown\n*Alberttown\n*Subryanville\n*Lamaha Gardens\n\n== Crime ==\nArmed robberies occur regularly in Georgetown, especially in businesses and shopping districts.<ref>[https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=16163 \"Guyana 2014 Crime and Safety Report\", Overseas Security Advisory Council, US State Department, 15 August 2014.]</ref> Particularly high crime areas of Georgetown include Tiger Bay, Albouystown, Sophia, all of south Georgetown, [[Buxton, Guyana|Buxton]] and Agricola.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/guyana/safety-and-security|title=Safety and security - Guyana travel advice|publisher=}}</ref> Robberies are a daily occurrence in the [[Stabroek Market]] area.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> A number of assaults have taken place in the [[Guyana Botanical Gardens|botanical garden]].<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n==Utilities==\n*Power is supplied by the state-owned and controlled [[Guyana Power and Light]].\n*Water and solid waste disposal is handled by state-owned Guyana Water Incorporated.\n*Telephone and high-speed Internet access are supplied by U.S.-owned Guyana Telephone & Telegraph Company.\n*Cellular services are also provided by [[Digicel]] and U.S.-owned Guyana Telephone & Telegraph Company.\n*Satellite television services are offered by Sky Digital Networks (Guyana) Inc.\n*Satellite television services are offered by DirecTV Caribbean.\n*Wireless Internet and Communication services are provided by Java Technologies and Globespan Technology.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Sudesh Fitzgerald]], professional darts player, born in Georgetown\n* [[R.

and the [[capital (political)|capital]] of [[Guyana]], located in Region 4, which is also known as the [[Demerara-Mahaica]] region. It is the country's largest urban centre. It is situated on the Atlantic Ocean coast at the mouth of the [[Demerara River]] and it was nicknamed the \"Garden City of the Caribbean\".\n\nGeorgetown serves primarily as a retail and administrative centre. It also serves as a financial services centre. The city recorded a population of 200,500 in the 2016 census.<ref name=census/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Wesleyan Mission Premises, George-Town, Demerara (VII, p.1, January 1950) - Copy.jpg|thumb|280px|Wesleyan Mission Premises, George-Town, Demerara (1850)<ref name=Offering1850>{{cite journal|title=Wesleyan Mission Premises, George-Town, Demerara|journal=Wesleyan Juvenile Offering|date=January 1850|volume=VII|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a1wEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=19 November 2015|publisher=Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society|location=London}}</ref>]]\nThe city of Georgetown began as a small town in the 18th century. Originally, the capital of the [[Demerara-Essequibo]] colony was located on Borselen Island in the [[Demerara River]] under the administration of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. When the colony was captured by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1781, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Kingston chose the mouth of the Demerara River for the establishment of a town which was situated between Plantations [[Werk-en-rust]] and Vlissengen.\n\nIt was the French who made it a capital city when they colonized it in 1782. The French called the capital Longchamps. When the town was restored to the Dutch in 1784, it was renamed [[Stabroek, Guyana|Stabroek]] after [[Nicolaas Geelvinck]], Lord of Stabroek, and president of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. Eventually the town expanded and covered the estates of Vlissengen, La Bourgade and Eve Leary to the North, and Werk-en-rust and La Repentir to the South.\n[[File:Kingston Georgetown 19 Century.jpg|thumb|280px|A view of the Kingston section of Georgetown in the 19th century.]]\n\nIt was renamed Georgetown on 29 April 1812 in honour of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. On 5 May 1812 an ordinance was passed to the effect that the town formerly called Stabroek, with districts extending from La Penitence to the bridges in Kingston and entering upon the road to the military camps, shall be called Georgetown.\n\nThe ordinance provided that the various districts of Georgetown shall be known by their own names.  The supervision of Georgetown was to be done by a committee chosen by the governor and Court of Policy.  Estimates of expenditure were to be prepared.\n\nBy 1806 the owner of Vlissingen asked to be exempted from the responsibility of maintaining the road which is now called Camp Street, but the Court refused the request.  In 1810 the maintenance of the roads in the area called Georgetown cost 11,000 guilders per annum.\n\nThe governing body of Georgetown was once a Board of Police.  The Board of Police was chosen by the governor and the Court of Policy.  It came into existence as the result of disputes among various organisations which controlled the districts. The board met monthly but what was discussed is not on the records between 1825 and 1837. Newspapers in the colony were prohibited by law from reporting public matters.\n\nThe post of Commissary of Police was not regarded as important.  People elected to the board invariably declined to attend meetings and never gave reasons for their refusal. It was, therefore, decided that individuals elected to the board were bound to serve for two years, or suffer a penalty of 1,000 guilders. The Board of Police was abolished when an ordinance was passed to establish a mayor and town council.\n\nGeorgetown gained official city status on 24 August 1842 during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nThe names of Georgetown's wards and streets reflect the influence of the Dutch, French and English who administered the town at different periods of history.\n\nCummingsburg was originally named Plantation La Bourgade by its first owner, Jacques Salignac. It was laid out in streets and building lots by its second proprietor, Thomas Cuming, a Scotsman, from whom it gets its current name. He made a presentation of the Militia Parade Ground and Promenade Gardens to the town as a gift. Carmichael Street was named after General [[Hugh Lyle Carmichael]] who served as governor from 1812 to 1813. He died in March 1813 and was buried in the Officers' Cemetery, Eve Leary.\n\nWater Street was so called because it ran along the riverside and formed the original river dam. High Street formed the leading road from the East Bank to the East Coast of Demerara. The part of High Street that ran through Cummingsburg was called Main Street. Camp Street received its name because it was the road which led to the camp or garrison at the northern end of the city. Kingston got its name from King George of England. It was part of Pln. Eve Leary which was named after the wife or daughter of its owner, Cornelis Leary. Some of the streets of Kingston have military names because the garrison used to be located there, e.g. Parade Street, Barrack Street and Fort Street.\n\nLacytown was another leasehold portion of Plantation Vlissengen. Luke M. Hill* states that it was named after the lessee, George Lacy, who was related to the family of General Sir De Lacy Evans (sic. -  General Sir George de Lacy Evans GCB), a Crimean war hero. The owner of Vlissengen was Joseph Bourda, Member of the Court of Policy. After his son and heir disappeared at sea, the government claimed the property under the authority of the Vlissengen Ordinance of 1876. A new district of Bourda was laid out and Lacytown was improved by the Board of Vlissengen Commissioners.\n\nBourda Street and the ward of Bourda were named after Joseph Bourda, Member of the Court of Policy and former owner of Pln. Vlissengen. It was laid out by the Commissioner of Vlissengen in 1879. The [[Bourda Cemetery, Guyana|Bourda Cemetery]] holds the remains of many citizens of Georgetown. Only those persons who owned family vaults or burial rights in the enclosed ground used it.\n\nIn 1945 a large fire (The Great Fire) broke out in the city, causing widespread damage.\n\n*Reference: Luke M. Hill - The Nomenclature of Georgetown in Timehri: The Journal of the Royal Agricultural and Commercial Society of British Guiana (Third Series) Vol.1, January 1911, p.&nbsp;42\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGeorgetown is located on Guyana's Atlantic coast on the east bank of Demerara River estuary. The terrain in this part of the country where the city is located is flat coastal plains. The city is surrounded by a blanket of cane fields along with marshy swamps, and savannah lands on its east and south. The elevation of the land is one metre below the high tide level. This low elevation is protected by a retaining wall known as the seawall to keep the ocean out and an innovative network of canals with kokers to drain the city of excess water. Guyana has 10 administrative regions with 4 natural regions.\n\n=== Climate ===\nGeorgetown has a year-round hot trade-wind [[tropical rainforest climate]]. Relative humidity fluctuates throughout the year with the highest occurring in May, June, August and December\u2013January; these months are usually the rainiest part of the year. Between the months of September to November relative humidity is lower ushering in the drier season.\n\nGeorgetown does not truly have a [[dry season]] \u2013 monthly precipitation in all 12 months is above {{convert|60|mm|in}}. Because of its location Georgetown's temperatures are moderated by the North-East [[trade winds]] blowing in from the North Atlantic and so it rarely sees temperatures above 31 degrees Celsius.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Georgetown (1961\u20131990)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 28.6\n|Feb high C = 28.9\n|Mar high C = 29.2\n|Apr high C = 29.5\n|May high C = 29.4\n|Jun high C = 29.2\n|Jul high C = 29.6\n|Aug high C = 30.2\n|Sep high C = 30.8\n|Oct high C = 30.8\n|Nov high C = 30.2\n|Dec high C = 29.1\n|year high C = 29.6\n|Jan mean C = 26.1\n|Feb mean C = 26.4\n|Mar mean C = 26.7\n|Apr mean C = 27.0\n|May mean C = 26.8\n|Jun mean C = 26.5\n|Jul mean C = 26.6\n|Aug mean C = 27.0\n|Sep mean C = 27.5\n|Oct mean C = 27.6\n|Nov mean C = 27.2\n|Dec mean C = 26.4\n|year mean C = 26.8\n|Jan low C = 23.6\n|Feb low C = 23.9\n|Mar low C = 24.2\n|Apr low C = 24.4\n|May low C = 24.3\n|Jun low C = 23.8\n|Jul low C = 23.5\n|Aug low C = 23.8\n|Sep low C = 24.2\n|Oct low C = 24.4\n|Nov low C = 24.2\n|Dec low C = 23.8\n|year low C = 24.0\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 185.2\n|Feb rain mm = 88.5\n|Mar rain mm = 111.0\n|Apr rain mm = 140.5\n|May rain mm = 285.5\n|Jun rain mm = 327.7\n|Jul rain mm = 268.0\n|Aug rain mm = 201.4\n|Sep rain mm = 97.5\n|Oct rain mm = 107.2\n|Nov rain mm = 185.9\n|Dec rain mm = 261.9\n|year rain mm = 2260.3\n|Jan rain days = 16\n|Feb rain days = 10\n|Mar rain days = 10\n|Apr rain days = 12\n|May rain days = 19\n|Jun rain days = 23\n|Jul rain days = 21\n|Aug rain days = 15\n|Sep rain days = 9\n|Oct rain days = 9\n|Nov rain days = 12\n|Dec rain days = 18\n|year rain days = 174\n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan sun = 201.0\n|Feb sun = 208.6\n|Mar sun = 219.7\n|Apr sun = 197.9\n|May sun = 178.8\n|Jun sun = 156.7\n|Jul sun = 201.6\n|Aug sun = 233.7\n|Sep sun = 229.8\n|Oct sun = 235.3\n|Nov sun = 210.9\n|Dec sun = 186.6\n|year sun = 2460.6\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name = NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REGIII/BG/81001.TXT\n| title = Georgetown Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = April 23, 2015}}</ref>\n|date=August 2011}}\n\n== The capital city ==\n[[File:Parliament Georgetown Guyana.JPG|thumb|300px|Parliament Building]]\n[[File:Cottage of city Georgetown.jpg|thumb|300px|The High Court]]\nGeorgetown is the seat of the central Government of Guyana.

Guyana's international airport, [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport| Cheddi Jagan International Airport/Timehri]], an hour south of Georgetown is a destination for [[Caribbean Airlines]] (the airline formerly known as [[BWIA]] or \"\"bwee\"\"), [[LIAT]], [[META - Mesquita Transportes Aereos|META]], and Travel Span GT.\n\nCloser to the city is the newly expanded [[Ogle Airport]], with a terminal facility geared to handle regional, international and inter-Caricom flights, connecting CARICOM states with the CARICOM Secretariat. The city has many highway projects under construction although the four-lane East Coast Highway was completed in 2005. Georgetown accounts for a large portion of Guyana's GDP.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport]] (formerly Timehri Airport) acts as the major air transportation hub for the city, which is located on the right bank of the Demerara River, 41 kilometres south of Georgetown. Direct international flights as well as connecting service from [[New York City]], [[Miami]], [[Toronto]], [[Panama City, Panama]], [[Bridgetown]], [[Port of Spain]], [[Paramaribo]], [[Aruba]] and [[Cura\u00e7ao]] are flown.  All scheduled passenger jet service for Georgetown is operated via this international airport.\n\nClose-in [[Ogle Airport]] also serves Georgetown.  [[Leeward Islands Air Transport]] ([[LIAT]]) operates scheduled passenger flights from Ogle with [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] regional propjet aircraft nonstop to [[Port of Spain]] and [[Barbados]] as well as direct to other Caribbean islands.  Helicopters also use this airport for support of offshore oil and gas exploration activities.\n\nThere is a regular coach service between Georgetown and Boa Vista in [[Brazil]], and once-daily connections to [[Paramaribo]], [[Suriname]] via a ferry crossing on the [[Corentyne River]]. Transportation can be by bus, car, or boat. The [[Demerara Harbour Bridge]] is a major crossing point.  The [[Berbice Bridge]] located to the east near [[New Amsterdam, Guyana]] is also transfer point to get to Georgetown or anywhere else.  Most of the West Coast, East Bank, East Coast and Berbice, Guyana are served by numerous private buses.  Taxi service is available almost everywhere along the coast including in large numbers in Georgetown. A number of highways have been newly constructed and the government is working to rehabilitate all roads in the country.\n\n=== Cost of living ===\nElectricity prices are about US$0.33 per unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gplinc.com/information/rates |title=Electricity Rates &#124; GPL Inc |publisher=GPL Inc. |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607034732/http://www.gplinc.com/information/rates |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> A domestic gas bottle (or gas cylinder) is over US$20.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baiganchoka.com/blog/impact-of-increased-cost-of-living-in-guyana/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729040357/http://www.baiganchoka.com/blog/impact-of-increased-cost-of-living-in-guyana/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 July 2012 |title=Impact of Increased Cost of Living in Guyana |publisher=Baiganchoka |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nGeorgetown recorded a population of 118,363 in the 2012 Guyanese census, down 12 percent from the 134,497 people counted in the 2002 census.<ref name=census/> In 2002, about 70,962 (53%) listed themselves as [[Black people|Black]]/[[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]; 31,902 (24%) as [[Mixed Race|mixed]]; 26,542 (20%) as [[Indian people|East Indian]];  1,441 (1.1%) as [[Amerindian]]; 1075 (0.8%) as [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]; 475 (0.35%) as [[Chinese people|Chinese]]; 2,265 (1.7%) as \"don't know/not stated\"; 196 (0.15%) as [[white people|white]] not of Portuguese descent; 35 as \"other\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/ |title=Bureau of Statistics \u2013 Guyana |publisher=Statisticsguyana.gov.gy |date= |accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Points of interest==\n[[File:St georges.jpg|thumb|210px|St. George's Anglican Cathedral]]\n\nGeorgetown is laid out in a north\u2013south, east\u2013west grid, interlaced with canals protected by [[kokers]], or sluices, built by the Dutch and later the British that provide drainage to a city that lies {{convert|3|ft|m|order=flip}} below high-tide level.

Bel Air Park, Bel Air Gardens, Lamaha Gardens and Bel Air Springs are well known ultimately as places for the rich and powerful. Most residents here are high ranking executives or government officials. These close gated neighbourhoods of the city are mostly concentrated in the northeastern part towards Greater Georgetown and the Atlantic.\n\nGreater Georgetown contains some notable places such as:\n\n*The University of Guyana (Headquarters)\n*[[The Cyril Potter College of Education]]\n*[[Secretariat of the Caribbean Community|The Caribbean Community Secretariat]] (Headquarters of CARICOM)\n*The Guyana International Conference Centre\n*Ocean View International Hotel\n*Guyana Sugar Corporation (Headquarters of the country's largest corporation)\n*Ogle Airport (Guyana's local air transport facility)\n\n'''South Georgetown''' \u2013 incorporated communities of neighbourhoods along the eastern bank of the Demerara River such as [[Pattensen, Turkeyen (Sophia)|Sophia]], Roxanne Burnham Gardens, Albouystown, and Agricola. Those are well known and highly regarded poor areas of the city.  Some areas such as Houston Estates, Ruimvelt and Thirst Park have retained high levels of affluence.\n\n=== City neighbourhoods===\n[[File:Dwelling in city.jpg|thumb|300px|A Colonial era residence in Georgetown.]]\nKnown for its historic importance, Georgetown remains the administrative centre for the central Government.\n\nNorth of Georgetown lies Main Street, where the head of state's official residence can be found along with several other important Government buildings, including the Ministry of Finance.

His paintings are frequently [[abstract art|abstract]] and often contain fragments of his poetry therein. His paintings have been featured in galleries worldwide, and many of the paintings of the artist he portrayed in ''[[A Perfect Murder]]'' are his own.\n\nMortensen experiments with his poetry and music by mixing the two art forms. He has collaborated with guitarist [[Buckethead]] on several albums, mostly released on his own label (Perceval Press) or TDRS Music.

According to the Special Extended Edition DVD of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Mortensen was a last-minute replacement for [[Stuart Townsend]], and would not have taken the part of Aragorn had it not been for his son's enthusiasm for the [[J.

His paintings have been featured in galleries worldwide, and many of the paintings of the artist he portrayed in ''[[A Perfect Murder]]'' are his own.\n\nMortensen experiments with his poetry and music by mixing the two art forms. He has collaborated with guitarist [[Buckethead]] on several albums, mostly released on his own label (Perceval Press) or TDRS Music. Viggo was first introduced to Buckethead's work while working on sounds for an educational CD on Greek mythology. The finished product included a guitar part by Buckethead, which caught Viggo's ear and led him to initiate contact with the guitarist.

The [[1872 Liberal Republican convention]] nominated Greeley, a New York newspaper publisher, and wrote a platform calling for [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]] and an end to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] leaders believed that their only hope of defeating Grant was to unite around Greeley, and the [[1872 Democratic National Convention]] nominated the Liberal Republican ticket.\n\nDespite the union between the Liberal Republicans and Democrats, Greeley proved to be an ineffective campaigner and Grant remained widely popular. Grant decisively won re-election, carrying 31 of the 37 states, including several [[Southern United States|Southern]] states that would not again vote Republican until the 20th century. Grant would be the last incumbent to win a second term until [[William McKinley]]'s victory in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 presidential election]], and his [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|popular vote margin]] of 11.8% was the largest margin between [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] and [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]].\n\nOn November 29, 1872, after the popular vote was counted, but before the Electoral College cast its votes, Greeley died. As a result, electors previously committed to Greeley voted for four different candidates for president and eight different candidates for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. It was the last instance until the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] in which more than one presidential elector voted for a candidate to whom [[Faithless elector|they were not pledged]].\n\n== Nominations ==\n\n=== Republican Party nomination ===\n{{Main|1872 Republican National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Republican Disc.png|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''Republican Party Ticket, 1872'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#CE2029; width:200px;\"| [[Ulysses S.

Accepting the Liberal platform meant the Democrats had accepted the [[New Departure (Democrats)|New Departure]] strategy, which rejected the anti-Reconstruction platform of 1868. They realized that to win the election they had to look forward, not try to re-fight the Civil War.<ref>Dunning 198</ref> Also, they realized they would only split the anti-Grant vote if they nominated a candidate other than Greeley. However, Greeley's long reputation as the most aggressive antagonist of the Democratic party, its principles, its leadership, and its activists cooled Democrats' enthusiasm for the nominee. \n\nSome Democrats were worried that backing Greeley would effectively bring the party to extinction, much like the moribund [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] had been doomed by endorsing the [[Know Nothing]] candidacy of [[Millard Fillmore]] in [[1856 United States presidential election|1856]], though others felt that the Democrats were in a much stronger position on a regional level than the Whigs had been at the time of their demise, and predicted (correctly, as it turned out) that the Liberal Republicans would not be viable in the long-term due to their lack of distinctive positions compared to the main Republican Party. A sizable minority led by [[James A. Bayard, Jr.|James A. Bayard]] sought to act independently of the Liberal Republican ticket, but the bulk of the party agreed to endorse Greeley's candidacy. The convention, which lasted only six hours stretched over two days, is the shortest major political party convention in history.\n\nThe Liberal Republican Party fused with the Democratic Party in all states except for Louisiana and Texas. In states where Republicans were stronger, the Liberal Republicans fielded a majority of the joint slate of candidates for lower offices; while in states where Democrats were stronger, the Democrats fielded the most candidates. In many states, such as Ohio, each party nominated half of a joint slate of candidates. Even initially reluctant Democratic leaders like [[Thomas F. Bayard]] came to support Greeley.<ref name=\"Ross 1910\">Ross (1910)</ref>\n\n=== Other nominations ===\n\n==== Labor Reform Party ====\nPresidential Candidates:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; width:200px;\"| [[Charles O'Conor (American politician)|Charles O'Conor]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; width:200px;\"| [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]]\n|-  \n| \n|-\n| [[File:Charles OConor - Brady-Handy.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n| [[File:JudgeDDavis.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|-\n| [[Lawyer]] from [[New York (state)|New York]]<br /><small>''(Declined Nomination)''</small>\n| [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court]] from [[Illinois]]<br /><small>''(Nominee \u2013 Withdrew on June 24, 1872)''</small>\n|}\n\nThe Labor Reform Party had only been organized in 1870, with its first National Convention meeting held in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, on February 22, 1872. Initially, there was a fair amount of discussion as to whether the party should actually nominate anyone for the presidency at that time, or if they should wait at least for the Liberal Republicans to nominate their own ticket first. Every motion to that effect lost, and a number of ballots were taken that resulted in the nomination of [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], who was the frontrunner for the Liberal Republican nomination at that time. [[Joel Parker (politician)|Joel Parker]], the Governor of New Jersey, was nominated for vice-president.\n\nWhile Davis did not decline the nomination of the Labor Reform party, he decided to hinge his campaign in large part on the success of attaining the Liberal Republican nomination, so that he might at least have their resources behind him. After their convention, in which he failed to attain the nomination, Davis telegraphed the Labor Reform party and informed them of his intention to withdraw from the presidential contest entirely. Joel Parker soon followed suit.\n\nA second convention was called on August 22 in Philadelphia, where it was decided, rather than making the same mistake again, that the party would cooperate with the new [[Straight-Out Democratic Party]] that had recently formed. After the election, the various state affiliates grew less and less active, and by the following year, the party ceased to exist.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n | last = Bewig\n | first = Matthew S.

Without time to choose a substitute, the party ran the two candidates anyway.

Both Liberal Republicans and Democrats were disappointed in their candidate Greeley. As wits asked, \"Why turn out a knave just to replace him with a fool?\"<ref>Dunning 197</ref> A poor campaigner with little political experience, Greeley's career as a newspaper editor gave his opponents a long history of eccentric public positions to attack. With memories of his victories in the Civil War to run on, Grant was unassailable. Grant also had a large campaign budget to work with. One historian was quoted saying, \"Never before was a candidate placed under such great obligation to men of wealth as was Grant.\" A large portion of Grant's campaign funds came from [[entrepreneurs]], including [[Jay Cooke]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], [[Alexander Turney Stewart]], [[Henry Hilton]], and John Astor.<ref>{{cite book | title = Guide to U.S. Elections | edition = Fifth | volume = Volume 1 | date = November 17, 2005 | publisher = CQ Press | isbn = 1-56802-981-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/guidetouselectio00cqpr }}</ref>\n\n==== Women's suffrage ====\nThis was the first election after the formation of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)|American Woman Suffrage Association]] in 1869. As a result, protests for [[women's suffrage]] became more prevalent. The [[National Woman's Suffrage Association]] held its annual convention in New York City on May 9, 1872. Some of the delegates supported [[Victoria Woodhull]], who had spent the year since the previous NWSA annual meeting touring the New York City environs and giving speeches on why women should be allowed to vote. The delegates selected Victoria Woodhull to run for president, and named [[Frederick Douglass]] for vice- president. He did not attend the convention and never acknowledged the nomination, though he would serve as a presidential elector in the United States Electoral College for the State of New York. Woodhull gave a series of speeches around New York City during the campaign. Her finances were very thin, and when she borrowed money from supporters, she often was unable to repay them. On the day before the election, Woodhull was arrested for \"publishing an obscene newspaper\" and so was unable to cast a vote for herself. Woodhull was ineligible to be president on Inauguration Day, not because she was a woman (the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and the law were silent on the issue), but because she would not reach the constitutionally prescribed minimum age of 35 until September 23, 1873; historians have debated whether to consider her activities a true election campaign. Woodhull and Douglass are not listed in \"Election results\" below, as the ticket received a negligible percentage of the popular vote and no electoral votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=26851|title=Our Campaigns \u2013 Candidate \u2013 Victoria C.

Subsequently, 63 of Greeley's electors cast their votes for other Democrats: 18 of them cast their presidential votes for Greeley's running mate, Benjamin Gratz Brown, and 45 cast their presidential votes for three non-candidates. \n\nOf the 2,171 counties making returns, Grant won in 1,335 while Greeley carried 833. Three counties were split evenly between Grant and Greeley.\n\n=== Disputed votes ===\nDuring the joint session of Congress for the counting of the electoral vote on February 12, 1873, various objections were raised to some of the results.

Most Liberal Republican Congressmen eventually joined the Democratic Party. Outside of the South, some Liberal Republicans sought the creation of a new party opposed to Republicans, but Democrats were unwilling to abandon their old party affiliation and even relatively successful efforts like Wisconsin's [[Reform Party (19th-century Wisconsin)|Reform Party]] collapsed. Even the strong Missouri Liberal Republican Party collapsed as the Democrats re-established themselves as the major opposition party to the Republicans. In the following years, former Liberal Republicans became members in good standing of both major parties.<ref>Ross, pp. 192-239</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Presidency of Ulysses S.

Despite a split in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], incumbent [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] defeated [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] nominee [[Horace Greeley]]. The election is notable for being the only presidential election in which a major party nominee died during the election process.\n\nGrant was unanimously re-nominated at the [[1872 Republican National Convention]], but his intra-party opponents organized the Liberal Republican Party and held their own convention. The [[1872 Liberal Republican convention]] nominated Greeley, a New York newspaper publisher, and wrote a platform calling for [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]] and an end to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] leaders believed that their only hope of defeating Grant was to unite around Greeley, and the [[1872 Democratic National Convention]] nominated the Liberal Republican ticket.\n\nDespite the union between the Liberal Republicans and Democrats, Greeley proved to be an ineffective campaigner and Grant remained widely popular. Grant decisively won re-election, carrying 31 of the 37 states, including several [[Southern United States|Southern]] states that would not again vote Republican until the 20th century. Grant would be the last incumbent to win a second term until [[William McKinley]]'s victory in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 presidential election]], and his [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|popular vote margin]] of 11.8% was the largest margin between [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] and [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]].\n\nOn November 29, 1872, after the popular vote was counted, but before the Electoral College cast its votes, Greeley died. As a result, electors previously committed to Greeley voted for four different candidates for president and eight different candidates for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. It was the last instance until the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] in which more than one presidential elector voted for a candidate to whom [[Faithless elector|they were not pledged]].\n\n== Nominations ==\n\n=== Republican Party nomination ===\n{{Main|1872 Republican National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Republican Disc.png|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''Republican Party Ticket, 1872'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#CE2029; width:200px;\"| [[Ulysses S.

Because of its strong desire to defeat Ulysses S. Grant, the Democratic Party also nominated the Liberal Republicans' Greeley/Brown ticket<ref name=\"Convention\">{{cite book | title = Official Proceedings of the National Democratic Convention, Held at Baltimore, July 9, 1872 | publisher = Rockwell & Churchill, Printers | year = 1872 | location = Boston | url = https://archive.org/details/officialproceed01convgoog}}</ref> and adopted their platform.<ref name=\"Boller\">{{cite book | author = Paul F.

Accepting the Liberal platform meant the Democrats had accepted the [[New Departure (Democrats)|New Departure]] strategy, which rejected the anti-Reconstruction platform of 1868. They realized that to win the election they had to look forward, not try to re-fight the Civil War.<ref>Dunning 198</ref> Also, they realized they would only split the anti-Grant vote if they nominated a candidate other than Greeley. However, Greeley's long reputation as the most aggressive antagonist of the Democratic party, its principles, its leadership, and its activists cooled Democrats' enthusiasm for the nominee. \n\nSome Democrats were worried that backing Greeley would effectively bring the party to extinction, much like the moribund [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] had been doomed by endorsing the [[Know Nothing]] candidacy of [[Millard Fillmore]] in [[1856 United States presidential election|1856]], though others felt that the Democrats were in a much stronger position on a regional level than the Whigs had been at the time of their demise, and predicted (correctly, as it turned out) that the Liberal Republicans would not be viable in the long-term due to their lack of distinctive positions compared to the main Republican Party. A sizable minority led by [[James A. Bayard, Jr.|James A. Bayard]] sought to act independently of the Liberal Republican ticket, but the bulk of the party agreed to endorse Greeley's candidacy. The convention, which lasted only six hours stretched over two days, is the shortest major political party convention in history.\n\nThe Liberal Republican Party fused with the Democratic Party in all states except for Louisiana and Texas. In states where Republicans were stronger, the Liberal Republicans fielded a majority of the joint slate of candidates for lower offices; while in states where Democrats were stronger, the Democrats fielded the most candidates. In many states, such as Ohio, each party nominated half of a joint slate of candidates. Even initially reluctant Democratic leaders like [[Thomas F. Bayard]] came to support Greeley.<ref name=\"Ross 1910\">Ross (1910)</ref>\n\n=== Other nominations ===\n\n==== Labor Reform Party ====\nPresidential Candidates:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; width:200px;\"| [[Charles O'Conor (American politician)|Charles O'Conor]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; width:200px;\"| [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]]\n|-  \n| \n|-\n| [[File:Charles OConor - Brady-Handy.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n| [[File:JudgeDDavis.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|-\n| [[Lawyer]] from [[New York (state)|New York]]<br /><small>''(Declined Nomination)''</small>\n| [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court]] from [[Illinois]]<br /><small>''(Nominee \u2013 Withdrew on June 24, 1872)''</small>\n|}\n\nThe Labor Reform Party had only been organized in 1870, with its first National Convention meeting held in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, on February 22, 1872. Initially, there was a fair amount of discussion as to whether the party should actually nominate anyone for the presidency at that time, or if they should wait at least for the Liberal Republicans to nominate their own ticket first. Every motion to that effect lost, and a number of ballots were taken that resulted in the nomination of [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], who was the frontrunner for the Liberal Republican nomination at that time. [[Joel Parker (politician)|Joel Parker]], the Governor of New Jersey, was nominated for vice-president.\n\nWhile Davis did not decline the nomination of the Labor Reform party, he decided to hinge his campaign in large part on the success of attaining the Liberal Republican nomination, so that he might at least have their resources behind him. After their convention, in which he failed to attain the nomination, Davis telegraphed the Labor Reform party and informed them of his intention to withdraw from the presidential contest entirely. Joel Parker soon followed suit.\n\nA second convention was called on August 22 in Philadelphia, where it was decided, rather than making the same mistake again, that the party would cooperate with the new [[Straight-Out Democratic Party]] that had recently formed. After the election, the various state affiliates grew less and less active, and by the following year, the party ceased to exist.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n | last = Bewig\n | first = Matthew S.

They nominated as presidential candidate [[Charles O'Conor (American politician)|Charles O'Conor]], who declined their nomination by telegram; as vice president they nominated [[John Quincy Adams II]]. Without time to choose a substitute, the party ran the two candidates anyway. They received 0.36% of the [[indirect election|popular vote]]s, and no [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes.\n\n== General election ==\n\n=== Campaign ===\nGrant's administration and his [[Radical Republican]] supporters had been widely accused of corruption, and the Liberal Republicans demanded civil service reform and an end to the Reconstruction process, including withdrawal of federal troops from the [[Southern United States|South]]. Both Liberal Republicans and Democrats were disappointed in their candidate Greeley. As wits asked, \"Why turn out a knave just to replace him with a fool?\"<ref>Dunning 197</ref> A poor campaigner with little political experience, Greeley's career as a newspaper editor gave his opponents a long history of eccentric public positions to attack. With memories of his victories in the Civil War to run on, Grant was unassailable. Grant also had a large campaign budget to work with. One historian was quoted saying, \"Never before was a candidate placed under such great obligation to men of wealth as was Grant.\" A large portion of Grant's campaign funds came from [[entrepreneurs]], including [[Jay Cooke]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], [[Alexander Turney Stewart]], [[Henry Hilton]], and John Astor.<ref>{{cite book | title = Guide to U.S. Elections | edition = Fifth | volume = Volume 1 | date = November 17, 2005 | publisher = CQ Press | isbn = 1-56802-981-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/guidetouselectio00cqpr }}</ref>\n\n==== Women's suffrage ====\nThis was the first election after the formation of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)|American Woman Suffrage Association]] in 1869. As a result, protests for [[women's suffrage]] became more prevalent. The [[National Woman's Suffrage Association]] held its annual convention in New York City on May 9, 1872. Some of the delegates supported [[Victoria Woodhull]], who had spent the year since the previous NWSA annual meeting touring the New York City environs and giving speeches on why women should be allowed to vote. The delegates selected Victoria Woodhull to run for president, and named [[Frederick Douglass]] for vice- president. He did not attend the convention and never acknowledged the nomination, though he would serve as a presidential elector in the United States Electoral College for the State of New York. Woodhull gave a series of speeches around New York City during the campaign. Her finances were very thin, and when she borrowed money from supporters, she often was unable to repay them. On the day before the election, Woodhull was arrested for \"publishing an obscene newspaper\" and so was unable to cast a vote for herself. Woodhull was ineligible to be president on Inauguration Day, not because she was a woman (the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and the law were silent on the issue), but because she would not reach the constitutionally prescribed minimum age of 35 until September 23, 1873; historians have debated whether to consider her activities a true election campaign. Woodhull and Douglass are not listed in \"Election results\" below, as the ticket received a negligible percentage of the popular vote and no electoral votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=26851|title=Our Campaigns \u2013 Candidate \u2013 Victoria C. Woodhull|publisher=}}</ref> In addition, several suffragists would attempt to vote in the election. [[Susan B. Anthony]] was arrested when she tried to vote and was fined $100 in a [[Trial of Susan B. Anthony|widely publicized trial]].\n\n=== Results ===\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1872Colorbrewer.gif|thumb|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning candidate in each county. Shades of red are for Grant (Republican) and shades of blue are for Greeley (Liberal Republican/Democratic).]]\nGrant won an easy re-election over Greeley, with a popular vote margin of 11.8% and 763,000 votes. \n\nGrant also won the electoral college with 286 electoral votes; while Greeley won 66 electoral votes, he died on November 29, 1872, twenty-four days after the election and before any of his pledged electors (from Texas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Maryland) could cast their votes. Subsequently, 63 of Greeley's electors cast their votes for other Democrats: 18 of them cast their presidential votes for Greeley's running mate, Benjamin Gratz Brown, and 45 cast their presidential votes for three non-candidates. \n\nOf the 2,171 counties making returns, Grant won in 1,335 while Greeley carried 833. Three counties were split evenly between Grant and Greeley.\n\n=== Disputed votes ===\nDuring the joint session of Congress for the counting of the electoral vote on February 12, 1873, various objections were raised to some of the results. However, unlike the objections which would be made in [[1876 United States presidential election|1877]], these had no impact on the outcome of the election. <ref>{{cite book| author=United States Congress| others=42nd Congress, 3rd Session, February 12| title=Senate Journal| url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj06845))| accessdate=March 23, 2006| year=1873| pages=334\u2013346}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!State\n!Voters\n!Winning candidate\n!Outcome\n!Reason\n!Electors counted\n|-\n| Arkansas\n| 6\n|rowspan=2| Grant\n|rowspan=2| Votes rejected \n|rowspan=2| Various irregularities, including allegations of electoral fraud\n|rowspan=2| No\n|-\n| Louisiana\n| 8\n|-\n| Georgia\n| 3 (of 11)\n| Greeley\n| Votes rejected\n| Ballots cast for Horace Greeley as President, but were cast after Greeley had died and he was thus ineligible for the office of President\n| Yes (votes for B.

Most Liberal Republican Congressmen eventually joined the Democratic Party. Outside of the South, some Liberal Republicans sought the creation of a new party opposed to Republicans, but Democrats were unwilling to abandon their old party affiliation and even relatively successful efforts like Wisconsin's [[Reform Party (19th-century Wisconsin)|Reform Party]] collapsed. Even the strong Missouri Liberal Republican Party collapsed as the Democrats re-established themselves as the major opposition party to the Republicans. In the following years, former Liberal Republicans became members in good standing of both major parties.<ref>Ross, pp. 192-239</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Presidency of Ulysses S.

Until the 20th century it was thought to depict [[Ludovico Sforza]], a [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]] and employer of Leonardo. During a 1904\u20131905 restoration, the removal of overpainting revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]], indicated that the sitter may be a musician.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary records of its [[commission (art)|commission]] exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars believe it was likely completed by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait contains the dark background portrait typical of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has been housed at the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672. Over the centuries, many Italian musicians and politicians to have been proposed as the sitter. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} The portrait depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}\n\n===The musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Detail of the musical score]]The man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint]]ed brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}} The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defend Leonardo, claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=239}}\n\n===The musical score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} Drawings from [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]] with Leonardo's own music notational style do not share a resemblance to the music in the painting.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} Suggesting that the music is not by him, which leaves the composer and the significance of the music, unknown.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and date===\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|upright=1.0|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.{{sfn|Kemp|2003}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}} This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Wallace}} But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}}\n\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].{{sfn|Kemp|2003}} The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this newly gained dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}}\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to remain in Milan, and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before are unknown but it was listed with a description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but at the time was thought to be a Leonardo portrait of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\nThese assumptions were taken without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding a [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}} Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Possible subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

Scholars at the [[National Gallery]] have suggested that [[Francesco Napoletano]]'s drawing of ''Portrait of a Youth in Profile'' and Leonardo's drawing of a ''Bust of a Youth in Profile'' depict the same figure as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|National Gallery|2011|p=5}} However the identity of the sitter himself remains unknown and not only have various candidates been proposed but even the idea that the subject is simply anonymous has also been explored.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n===Franchinus Gaffurius===\nThroughout the 20th century, the leading candidate, suggested by [[Luca Beltrami]] in 1906, was [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], a priest, music theorist and  court musician for [[Ludovico Sforza]] and ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of [[Milan Cathedral]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} Gaffurius and Leonardo were known to have been friends, both entering the Duke's service only a year or two apart from each other. In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=31}} Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum.

Marani's theory in 2000,{{sfn|Marani|2000|p=165}} [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[lute|lutist]], actor, lyricist and singer, has been the most widely accepted identity of the musician.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} In 1482, Migliarotti and Leonardo left [[Florence]] together for [[Milan]] to serve in the court of [[Ludovico Sforza]], the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]].{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} Furthermore, Leonardo is thought to have taught Migliarotti the [[lute]] and [[lyre]] and known to be friends.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}{{sfn|Harr\u00e1n|2001}} During the painting's conception, Migliarotti would have been in his late teens or early twenties, making him a fitting candidate to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, in a 1482 inventory from the [[Codex Atlanticus]]{{#tag:ref|Folio 888 recto (ex 324 recto) to be exact.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}} Leonardo listed \"a portrait of Atalante with his face raised.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{#tag:ref|Alternatively translated as: \"a portrait of Atalante with his upturned face.\"{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} or \"a head portrayed from Atalante who raises his face.\"{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}|group=n}} This has been considered by many to have been some kind of study or start of the later ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\nThe only issues with this theory are that the subject's face is not raised, as Leonardo wrote in his notes, and this note was written 3 years prior to the earliest estimated date of completion{{#tag:ref|The earliest being 1485 with the latest at 1490.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}}{{sfn|Syson|2011}}{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}|group=n}} for the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} However, these are by no means outstanding issues, as Leonardo was known to make numerous revisions and often took many years to complete a painting.{{sfn|Kalb|2019}}{{sfn|Selvaggio|2018}}{{#tag:ref|Often, like ''The Portrait of a Musician'', not even finishing his paintings.{{sfn|Cotter|2019}}|group=n}} Therefore, since the widespread rejection of Franchinus Gaffurius as the leading candidate, Migliarotti is now considered the most likely.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}\n\n===Josquin des Prez===\nIn 1972, [[Josquin des Prez]], French singer and composer, was suggested as the subject by [[Belgian]] musicologist, Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Josquin worked in the service of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] during various periods of the 1480s,{{sfn|Macey|2001}} consequently working at the same time as Leonardo.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune proposed that the words on the [[sheet music|musical score]] where the abbreviations of \"Cont,\" \"Cantuz,\" and \"A Z\" appear in reference to the words \"[[Contratenor]],\" \"Cantuz\" and [[Alto|Altuz]]. She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}}\n\nThis theory has been strongly discredited as the notation in the painting being largely illegible, while many composers of the time were writing the same forms in this manner.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues as those of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making the young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]] unlikely to be Josquin.{{sfn|Macey|2001}}\n\n===Gaspar van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested in 2019 that the sitter's identity is [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, and they where likely knew each other due to their shared employer.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n===Others===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}} [[Francesco Canova da Milano]], an Italian [[lute]]nist and composer, has also been suggested as the subject since he was an important musician also working in [[Milan]] when Leonardo was there.{{sfn|Wallace}} However, there is no strong evidence to support this claim.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}{{sfn|Wallace}} The a Dutch illustrator [[Siegfried Woldhek]]  proposed that ''Portrait of a Musician'' is one of three self portraits by Leonardo, {{sfn|Woldhek|2008}} although this theory is considered highly improbable.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nGiven the lack of contemporary records, scholars have proposed various theories. A number believed that the tension in the subject's face is due to intense thought on music that was either just performed, about to be performed or being performed.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} The painting has also been proposed as representative of Leonardo's self proclaimed ideology in the superiority of painting over other art forms like [[poetry]], [[sculpture]] and [[music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}} Leonardo famously declared in the beginning of his uncompleted ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Libro de pittura]]'', \n\n{{Quote\n|text=How Music Ought to be Called the Sister and Junior to Painting. Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThese words seemingly disapprove of music for its ephemeral nature, and positions painting as having a materiel, permanent physical quality. This theory suggests that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}}\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was simply moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commission a portrait himself.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n*{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |authorlink1=Kenneth Clark |last2=Kemp |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Kemp (art historian) |year=1989\n |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |language=English |location=City of Westminster, London, England |isbn=978-0140169829 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXifCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PR99&dq=martin%20kemp%20%22portrait%20of%20a%20musician%22&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref={{sfnRef|Clark|1989}}}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fagnart |first=Laure |editor-last1=Lindmayr-Brandl |editor-first1=Andrea |editor-last2=Kolb |editor-first2=Paul |year=2019\n |chapter=Gaspar Depicted?

Until the 20th century it was thought to depict [[Ludovico Sforza]], a [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]] and employer of Leonardo. During a 1904\u20131905 restoration, the removal of overpainting revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]], indicated that the sitter may be a musician.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary records of its [[commission (art)|commission]] exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars believe it was likely completed by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait contains the dark background portrait typical of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has been housed at the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672. Over the centuries, many Italian musicians and politicians to have been proposed as the sitter. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} The portrait depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}\n\n===The musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Detail of the musical score]]The man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint]]ed brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}} The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defend Leonardo, claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=239}}\n\n===The musical score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} Comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music, from drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to the music in the painting shows little resemblance.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} Suggesting that the music is not by him, which leaves the composer and the significance of the music, unknown.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and date===\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|upright=1.0|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.{{sfn|Kemp|2003}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}} This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Wallace}} But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}}\n\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].{{sfn|Kemp|2003}} The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}}\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to remain in Milan, and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before are unknown but it was listed with a description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but at the time was thought to be a Leonardo portrait of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\nThese assumptions were taken without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding a [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}} Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Possible subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

Scholars at the [[National Gallery]] have suggested that [[Francesco Napoletano]]'s drawing of ''Portrait of a Youth in Profile'' and Leonardo's drawing of a ''Bust of a Youth in Profile'' depict the same figure as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|National Gallery|2011|p=5}} However the identity of the sitter himself remains unknown and not only have various candidates been proposed but even the idea that the subject is simply anonymous has also been explored.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n===Franchinus Gaffurius===\nThroughout the 20th century, the leading candidate, suggested by [[Luca Beltrami]] in 1906, was [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], a priest, music theorist and  court musician for [[Ludovico Sforza]] and ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of [[Milan Cathedral]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} Gaffurius and Leonardo were known to have been friends, both entering the Duke's service only a year or two apart from each other. In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=31}} Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This may be to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}}|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\nThe theory has been disproven from the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C. Marani's theory in 2000,{{sfn|Marani|2000|p=165}} [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[lute|lutist]], actor, lyricist and singer, has been the most widely accepted identity of the musician.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} In 1482, Migliarotti and Leonardo left [[Florence]] together for [[Milan]] to serve in the court of [[Ludovico Sforza]], the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]].{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} Furthermore, Leonardo is thought to have taught Migliarotti the [[lute]] and [[lyre]] and known to be friends.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}{{sfn|Harr\u00e1n|2001}} During the painting's conception, Migliarotti would have been in his late teens or early twenties, making him a fitting candidate to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, in a 1482 inventory from the [[Codex Atlanticus]]{{#tag:ref|Folio 888 recto (ex 324 recto) to be exact.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}} Leonardo listed \"a portrait of Atalante with his face raised.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{#tag:ref|Alternatively translated as: \"a portrait of Atalante with his upturned face.\"{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} or \"a head portrayed from Atalante who raises his face.\"{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}|group=n}} This has been considered by many to have been some kind of study or start of the later ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\nThe only issues with this theory are that the subject's face is not raised, as Leonardo wrote in his notes, and this note was written 3 years prior to the earliest estimated date of completion{{#tag:ref|The earliest being 1485 with the latest at 1490.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}}{{sfn|Syson|2011}}{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}|group=n}} for the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} However, these are by no means outstanding issues, as Leonardo was known to make numerous revisions and often took many years to complete a painting.{{sfn|Kalb|2019}}{{sfn|Selvaggio|2018}}{{#tag:ref|Often, like ''The Portrait of a Musician'', not even finishing his paintings.{{sfn|Cotter|2019}}|group=n}} Therefore, since the widespread rejection of Franchinus Gaffurius as the leading candidate, Migliarotti is now considered the most likely.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}\n\n===Josquin des Prez===\nIn 1972, [[Josquin des Prez]], French singer and composer, was suggested as the subject by [[Belgian]] musicologist, Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Josquin worked in the service of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] during various periods of the 1480s,{{sfn|Macey|2001}} consequently working at the same time as Leonardo.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune proposed that the words on the [[sheet music|musical score]] where the abbreviations of \"Cont,\" \"Cantuz,\" and \"A Z\" appear in reference to the words \"[[Contratenor]],\" \"Cantuz\" and [[Alto|Altuz]]. She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}}\n\nThis theory has been strongly discredited as the notation in the painting being largely illegible, while many composers of the time were writing the same forms in this manner.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues as those of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making the young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]] unlikely to be Josquin.{{sfn|Macey|2001}}\n\n===Gaspar van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested in 2019 that the sitter's identity is [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, and they where likely knew each other due to their shared employer.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n===Others===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}} [[Francesco Canova da Milano]], an Italian [[lute]]nist and composer, has also been suggested as the subject since he was an important musician also working in [[Milan]] when Leonardo was there.{{sfn|Wallace}} However, there is no strong evidence to support this claim.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}{{sfn|Wallace}} The a Dutch illustrator [[Siegfried Woldhek]]  proposed that ''Portrait of a Musician'' is one of three self portraits by Leonardo, {{sfn|Woldhek|2008}} although this theory is considered highly improbable.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nGiven the lack of contemporary records, scholars have proposed various theories. A number believed that the tension in the subject's face is due to intense thought on music that was either just performed, about to be performed or being performed.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} The painting has also been proposed as representative of Leonardo's self proclaimed ideology in the superiority of painting over other art forms like [[poetry]], [[sculpture]] and [[music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}} Leonardo famously declared in the beginning of his uncompleted ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Libro de pittura]]'', \n\n{{Quote\n|text=How Music Ought to be Called the Sister and Junior to Painting. Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThese words seemingly disapprove of music for its ephemeral nature, and positions painting as having a materiel, permanent physical quality. This theory suggests that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}}\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was simply moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commission a portrait himself.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n*{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |authorlink1=Kenneth Clark |last2=Kemp |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Kemp (art historian) |year=1989\n |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |language=English |location=City of Westminster, London, England |isbn=978-0140169829 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXifCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PR99&dq=martin%20kemp%20%22portrait%20of%20a%20musician%22&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref={{sfnRef|Clark|1989}}}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fagnart |first=Laure |editor-last1=Lindmayr-Brandl |editor-first1=Andrea |editor-last2=Kolb |editor-first2=Paul |year=2019\n |chapter=Gaspar Depicted?

It was established in February 1927 (or 1929 {{cn|date=February 2016}}) by French journalist '''Maurice de Waleffe''' (1874-1946<ref>[http://comitemissfrancejraibaut.fr/historique/]</ref>), who also created, in 1920, what by 1927 had become the [[Miss France]] pageant. Miss Europa was first held at the [[Paris Opera]] with participants from 18 countries. \n\nThe contest was interrupted by the onset of [[World War II]] but later re-established by '''Mr. Zeigler''' (of the Moulin Rouge) and '''Claude Berr'''. Most contestants won their respective national contests for [[Miss World]], and participated as supplemental training for their respective competitions. After the death of Berr, Roger Zeigler sold the license for the pageant to '''Endemol France''', part of the Dutch television production company [[Endemol]], in 2003. Current Miss Europe titleholder is Andrea de las Heras from Spain, who was crowned in Hotel Martinez in May 2019 during Cannes Festival.   \n\n==Titleholders==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 0 1em 0 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

1954-55]]\n'''Miss Europe''' is a [[beauty pageant]] with female contestants from all over [[Europe]]. It was established in February 1927 (or 1929 {{cn|date=February 2016}}) by French journalist '''Maurice de Waleffe''' (1874-1946<ref>[http://comitemissfrancejraibaut.fr/historique/]</ref>), who also created, in 1920, what by 1927 had become the [[Miss France]] pageant. Miss Europa was first held at the [[Paris Opera]] with participants from 18 countries. \n\nThe contest was interrupted by the onset of [[World War II]] but later re-established by '''Mr. Zeigler''' (of the Moulin Rouge) and '''Claude Berr'''. Most contestants won their respective national contests for [[Miss World]], and participated as supplemental training for their respective competitions. After the death of Berr, Roger Zeigler sold the license for the pageant to '''Endemol France''', part of the Dutch television production company [[Endemol]], in 2003. Current Miss Europe titleholder is Andrea de las Heras from Spain, who was crowned in Hotel Martinez in May 2019 during Cannes Festival.   \n\n==Titleholders==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 0 1em 0 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Copyright protection for fictional characters", "text_new": "{{essay-like|date=May 2017}}\n{{main|Copyright}}\n[[Copyright]] protection is available to the creators of a range of works including literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works. Recognition of [[fictional characters]] as works eligible for copyright protection has come about with the understanding that characters can be separated from the original works they were embodied in and acquire a new life by featuring in subsequent works.<ref>Paul Goldstein, ''Copyright: Principles, Law And Practice'' (OUP 1989)158.</ref>\n\n== United States ==\n{{main|Copyright law of the United States}}\n\nIn the United States, in order to avail of copyright protection, a work must be [[Threshold of originality|original]] that is, it must involve an element of creativity,<ref>F''eist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Services Co.'', 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991).</ref>  and must be fixed in a tangible medium.<ref>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102.</ref>  Further, there can be no copyright in mere ideas and facts, but only in the unique expression of the same.<ref>''Mannion v. Coors Brewing Co''., 377 F.Supp.2d 444 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).</ref>  [[Copyright Act of 1976|US Copyright Statute of 1976]] does not explicitly mention fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and their copyrightability is a product of common law. Historically, the Courts granted copyright protection to characters as parts of larger protected work and not as independent creations. They were regarded as \u2018components in a copyrighted works\u2019 and eligible for protection as thus.<ref>''Walt Disney Prods. v. Air Pirates'', 581 F.2d 751, 754 (9th Cir. 1978).</ref> Recognition of characters as independent works distinct to the plot in which they were embodied came about only in 1930 in the case of [[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.|Nichols v. Universal Pictures]].<ref>45 F.2d 119, 121, 7 USPQ 84 (2d Cir. 1930).</ref>\nFollowing ''Nichols'', the American judiciary has evolved two main tests to determine whether a character in a work can be eligible for copyright protection.\n\n=== Well-delineated test ===\n\nIn ''Nichols'', the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied protection to the plaintiff's characters on the grounds that they were not \u201cdistinctly delineated\u201d, but poorly developed. The plaintiff's characters of the Jewish gentleman and the poor Irish catholic girl he loved were regarded to be no more than mere \u2018prototypes\u2019. Justice Hand held that the less developed the character, the less the copyrightability of the same. Copyright protection shall therefore be enjoyed by a character provided it is well delineated. By applying this test, copyright protection was held to subsist in the character of [[Tarzan]] because it was found to be \u201csufficiently delineated.\u201d <ref>''Burroughs v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.'', 683 F.2d 610 (2d Cir. 1982).</ref> Similarly, the character of [[Superman]] was held to found to be well delineated by virtue of embodying original literary expressions and incidents, and therefore deserving of copyright.<ref>''Detective Comics, Inc. v. Burns Publications'', 111 F.2d 432; 434 (2d Cir. 1940)</ref>\n\nUnder this approach, a three-step test is required to be followed. Firstly, the character must possess physical and conceptual attributes. Secondly, the character must be \u201csufficiently delineated\u201d to be identified as the same character across multiple occasions. He must therefore show consistent traits.  Lastly, the character must be \u201cespecially distinctive\u201d and \u201ccontain some unique elements of expression.<ref>''Halicki Films, LLC v. Sanderson Sales & Mktg.'', 547 F.3d 1213, 1224 (9th Cir.2008).</ref> The consistency of a character's traits and attributes is considered as the key factor for  whether the character qualifies for copyright protection.<ref>''DC Comics v. Towle'', 989 F. Supp. 2d 948 (C.D. Cal. 2013).</ref>\n\n=== Story being told test ===\n\nThe second approach was propounded by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in ''Warner Bros. v. Columbia Broadcast Systems.'' <ref>216 F.2d 945, 950 (9th Cir. 1954).</ref> The Ninth Circuit court ruled that a character can avail of copyright protection only if it \u201cconstitutes the story being told\u201d. In this case, the character in question, Sam Spade of the [[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|Maltese Falcon]] detective novel, was held to be a \u201cmere vehicle\u201d for carrying the story forward. Accordingly, copyright protection did not prevail. The holding in ''Warner Bros.'' case came to be known as the ''Sam Spade Test'', this approach does not allow for copyright protection if the character is a \u201cmere chessman in the game of storytelling.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, if the character is central to the story, then it will be copyrightable. In the case of ''Universal City Studios v. Kamar Industries''<ref>217 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 1162 (S.D. Tex. 1982).</ref> this test was applied to hold that E.T was a distinctive character around whom the story in the movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T the Extra Terrestrial]]'' revolved. Therefore, the copyright in E.T was held to be enjoyed by Universal Studios, and the defendants were held liable for a violation of the Studios\u2019 copyright by the manufacturing and sale of goods under the title \u2018E.T Home Phones\u2019.\n\nThe American judiciary has followed both these tests. There have also been a number of instances where the Court has used both the tests in its analysis. For instance, in ''[[Anderson v. Stallone|Anderson v Stallone]]'',<ref>11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989).</ref>  it was held that the character [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] played by movie star [[Sylvester Stallone|Sylvester Stallone]] in the eponymous movie franchise had come to be identified with certain physical traits and mannerisms that qualified as a well delineated character. Further, this \u2018highly developed\u2019 character was held to constitute the story being told.

Supp. 89, 91 (S.D.N.Y. 1977).</ref>\n\n=== Other sources of protection ===\n\nProtection of fictional characters may also be derived from certain alternative sources in American law.\n\n'''[[United States trademark law|Trademark Law:]]''' Trademark rights may be enjoyed in a fictional character and can be enforced as such. To determine the infringement of the trademark it must be shown that the fictional character has acquired a \u201csecondary meaning\u201d, and that there is a likelihood of confusion to be caused to the public by the defendant's mark which is deceptively similar to the original.<ref>''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v.

Under the [[Trademark dilution|doctrine of dilution]], the plaintiff can seek relief for whittling away of the value of character.

The statute  does not recognise fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and protection for the same is derived from judge-made law.\n\nThe first instance where this issue was brought into light was in the case of ''Malayala Manorama v VT Thomas''.<ref>AIR 1989 Ker 49.</ref> The Kerala High Court held that the defendant owned the copyright in his cartoon characters that he had created before entering into the plaintiff's employment.\n\nSubsequently, the Delhi High Court in ''Raja Pocket Books v Radha Pocket Books''<ref>1997 (40) DRJ 791.</ref> found that the plaintiff's copyright in his comic character the herpetologist \u2018Nagraj\u2019 had been infringed by the defendant's character \u2018Nagesh\u2019 based on the semantic and phonetic similarities in their respective characters\u2019 names, as well as in their visual representations and conceptual characteristics.<br />\n \nHowever, the Court in ''VT Thomas'' did not discuss independent copyright in characters as this case was concerned with the issue of ownership of copyright.<ref>Shan Kohli, 'Can Literary Characters Be Copyrighted?: Criticism Of The \u201cStory Being Told\u201d Test And The Indian Status \u2013II' SPICY IP (April 14, 2016) available at https://spicyip.com/2016/04/can-literary-characters-be-copyrighted-a-reformulation-of-the-especially-distinctive-test-ii.html.</ref> Further, the comparative analysis in ''Raja Pocket Books'' to arrive at a conclusion of infringement was undertaken by the Court without firstly stating that copyright subsisted in the plaintiff's character.<ref>Id.</ref>\n\nTherefore, in India, it can be implied that copyright protection is available to fictional characters, but the judiciary is yet to lay down any criteria for availing this protection.<ref>Inika Charles, 'Copyright-ing Fictional Characters: Bombay HC Permits Release of \u2018Rangoon\u2019'SPICY IP (March 6, 2017) https://spicyip.com/2017/03/copyright-ing-fictional-characters-bombay-hc-permits-release-of-rangoon.html.</ref>\n\n=== Alternate protection ===\n\nIn India, recourse can be had to [[Indian trademark law|trademark law]] which recognises that fictional characters enjoy goodwill, and provides relief for cases of \u2018character merchandising\u2019.

In this case, the characters in the plaintiff's were found not have acquired an independent recognition as a commodity, and therefore the suit for character merchandising by the defendants failed.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Copyright law]]\n[[Category:Intellectual property law]]\n[[Category:Intangible assets]]\n[[Category:Copyright infringement]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=May 2017}}\n{{main|Copyright}}\n[[Copyright]] protection is available to the creators of a range of works including literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works.

Coors Brewing Co''., 377 F.Supp.2d 444 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).</ref>  [[Copyright Act of 1976|US Copyright Statute of 1976]] does not explicitly mention fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and their copyrightability is a product of common law. Historically, the Courts granted copyright protection to characters as parts of larger protected work and not as independent creations. They were regarded as \u2018components in a copyrighted works\u2019 and eligible for protection as thus.<ref>''Walt Disney Prods. v. Air Pirates'', 581 F.2d 751, 754 (9th Cir. 1978).</ref> Recognition of characters as independent works distinct to the plot in which they were embodied came about only in 1930 in the case of [[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.|Nichols v. Universal Pictures]].<ref>45 F.2d 119, 121, 7 USPQ 84 (2d Cir. 1930).</ref>\nFollowing ''Nichols'', the American judiciary has evolved two main tests to determine whether a character in a work can be eligible for copyright protection.\n\n=== Well-delineated test ===\n\nIn ''Nichols'', the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied protection to the plaintiff's characters on the grounds that they were not \u201cdistinctly delineated\u201d, but poorly developed. The plaintiff's characters of the Jewish gentleman and the poor Irish catholic girl he loved were regarded to be no more than mere \u2018prototypes\u2019. Justice Hand held that the less developed the character, the less the copyrightability of the same. Copyright protection shall therefore be enjoyed by a character provided it is well delineated. By applying this test, copyright protection was held to subsist in the character of [[Tarzan]] because it was found to be \u201csufficiently delineated.\u201d <ref>''Burroughs v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.'', 683 F.2d 610 (2d Cir. 1982).</ref> Similarly, the character of [[Superman]] was held to found to be well delineated by virtue of embodying original literary expressions and incidents, and therefore deserving of copyright.<ref>''Detective Comics, Inc. v. Burns Publications'', 111 F.2d 432; 434 (2d Cir. 1940)</ref>\n\nUnder this approach, a three-step test is required to be followed. Firstly, the character must possess physical and conceptual attributes. Secondly, the character must be \u201csufficiently delineated\u201d to be identified as the same character across multiple occasions. He must therefore show consistent traits.  Lastly, the character must be \u201cespecially distinctive\u201d and \u201ccontain some unique elements of expression.<ref>''Halicki Films, LLC v. Sanderson Sales & Mktg.'', 547 F.3d 1213, 1224 (9th Cir.2008).</ref> The consistency of a character's traits and attributes is considered as the key factor for  whether the character qualifies for copyright protection.<ref>''DC Comics v. Towle'', 989 F. Supp. 2d 948 (C.D. Cal. 2013).</ref>\n\n=== Story being told test ===\n\nThe second approach was propounded by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in ''Warner Bros. v. Columbia Broadcast Systems.'' <ref>216 F.2d 945, 950 (9th Cir. 1954).</ref> The Ninth Circuit court ruled that a character can avail of copyright protection only if it \u201cconstitutes the story being told\u201d. In this case, the character in question, Sam Spade of the [[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|Maltese Falcon]] detective novel, was held to be a \u201cmere vehicle\u201d for carrying the story forward. Accordingly, copyright protection did not prevail. The holding in ''Warner Bros.'' case came to be known as the ''Sam Spade Test'', this approach does not allow for copyright protection if the character is a \u201cmere chessman in the game of storytelling.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, if the character is central to the story, then it will be copyrightable. In the case of ''Universal City Studios v. Kamar Industries''<ref>217 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 1162 (S.D. Tex. 1982).</ref> this test was applied to hold that E.T was a distinctive character around whom the story in the movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T the Extra Terrestrial]]'' revolved. Therefore, the copyright in E.T was held to be enjoyed by Universal Studios, and the defendants were held liable for a violation of the Studios\u2019 copyright by the manufacturing and sale of goods under the title \u2018E.T Home Phones\u2019.\n\nThe American judiciary has followed both these tests. There have also been a number of instances where the Court has used both the tests in its analysis. For instance, in ''[[Anderson v. Stallone|Anderson v Stallone]]'',<ref>11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989).</ref>  it was held that the character [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] played by movie star [[Sylvester Stallone|Sylvestor Stallone]] in the eponymous movie franchise had come to be identified with certain physical traits and mannerisms that qualified as a well delineated character. Further, this \u2018highly developed\u2019 character was held to constitute the story being told. Similarly, the character of [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] was awarded copyright protection on the grounds of being both sufficiently delineated as well as central to the story being told.<ref>''Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer v. American Honda'', 900 F. Supp. 1287 (C.D. Cal. 1995).</ref> The fact that the character had been played by multiple actors was not held to be relevant since the characteristics associated with Bond had remain consistent across sixteen films.\n\n=== Visual and literary characters ===\n\nCopyright protection is available to both characters that have been solely described in writing, as well as characters depicted in a visual or graphic form.<ref>Amanda Schreyer, 'An Overview Of Legal Protection For Fictional Characters', 6 CYBARIS IP L.

It came about at a convention on 8 Cendana Street at March 13, 1970. Through this recreational site, she hoped to cultivate national pride in more Indonesian people.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/> A project called \"Indonesian Miniature Project\" was started by Harapan Kita Foundation in 1972. The concept of this culture-based recreational area was inspired by Indonesia's unparalleled natural riches and local folk diversity.\n\n==Characteristics==\nTMII was originally located on a public area of 145 ha, as farms and fields. Later, the team was able to convert these fields into a suitable location for the construction. The [[topography]] of TMII is rather hilly, consistent with what the builders required. The team claimed the advantage of utilizing this uneven terrain was the ability to create interesting and diverse landscapes and enclosures, as well as reflecting the various characteristics of the Indonesian environment.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/>\n\n==Parts of TMII==\n[[File:Taman Mini Indonesia Indah Map en.svg|center|900px]]\n\n===Venues of Indonesian Provinces===\n[[File:Jaipongan Langit Biru 03.jpg|thumb|The [[Jaipongan]] dance performance in West Java pavilion in TMII.]]\n[[File:Indonesia in miniature, Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.jpg|thumb|The miniature of [[Indonesian Archipelago]] in the center lake viewed from the cable car.]]\n[[File:TMII West Sumatra.jpg|thumb|[[West Sumatra]] pavilion in TMII.]]\n\nSince each Indonesian province maintains its own unique and distinct cultures, shelters, attire and dialects, TMII built a model of each of the houses from Indonesian provinces. TMII attempted not only to reconstruct the homes of the various provinces, but also to create a realistic model of the environment and shelters of the various people of Indonesia.<ref name='TMIIanj'>[http://www.tamanmini.com/anjungan/ Anjungan]</ref> The venues, which are situated around the main lake in a similar fashion to the different islands of the [[Indonesian archipelago]], are thematically divided into six areas in respect to the main islands of Indonesia; [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Kalimantan]] ([[Borneo]]), [[Sulawesi]], the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]]. Each pavilions featured in typical [[vernacular]] [[Indonesian architecture]] of each provinces. Examples of Indonesian traditional vernacular houses are: [[Joglo]] and Omah Kudus [[Javanese people|Javanese]] houses of [[Central Java]] and [[Yogyakarta]] pavilion; [[Minangkabau people|Minang]] [[Rumah Gadang]] of [[West Sumatra]] pavilion; [[Malay houses]] of [[Jambi]] and [[Riau]] provinces; [[Toraja]]n [[Tongkonan]] and Bugis house of [[South Sulawesi]] pavilion; and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] house compound with intricately carved [[candi bentar]] split gate and [[Paduraksa|kori agung]] gate.\n\nIt also displays various traditional costumes, wedding costumes, dance costumes, also ethnography artifacts such as weapons and daily tools, models of traditional architecture are in display to describes the way of life of its people. Each provinces pavilions also equipped with small stage, amphitheatre or auditorium for traditional dance performances, traditional music performances or traditional ceremonies that usually held in Sundays. Some of these pavilions also equipped with cafeterias featuring traditional [[Indonesian cuisine]]s and also souvenir shops offering various handicrafts, T-shirts and souvenirs.\n\nSince 1975 until the 2000s, the original design of TMII consist of a model of the houses from the 27 provinces of Indonesia, including [[East Timor]]. But after the secession of East Timor from Indonesia in 2002, the East Timor pavilion changed its status to become the Museum of East Timor. Also since Indonesia now consist of [[Provinces of Indonesia|33 provinces]], currently the new province pavilions of [[Bangka Belitung]], [[Banten]], [[West Sulawesi]], [[North Maluku]], [[Gorontalo (province)|Gorontalo]], [[Riau Islands]], and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] is being built in northeast part of the park.\n\nAfter the recognition of [[Indonesian Chinese]] [[Chinese culture|culture]] as the integral part of Indonesian culture in 2000, the new [[Indonesian Chinese]] pavilion and a [[Confucian temple]] was built within the park.\n\n===Religious Buildings===\nThe religious buildings of several official faiths is meant to showcase the inter-faiths tolerance and religious harmony of Indonesia.

It is operated by Yayasan Harapan Kita, a foundation established by [[Siti Hartinah]], the first lady during most of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] and wife of [[Suharto]], and still run by Suharto's descendants since his death. It has an area of about {{convert|250|acre|ha|order=flip}}. The park is a synopsis of [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian culture]], with virtually all aspects of daily life in Indonesia's 26 (in 1975) [[Provinces of Indonesia|provinces]] encapsulated in separate pavilions with the collections of ''[[rumah adat]]'' as the example of [[Indonesian architecture|Indonesian vernacular architecture]], [[National costume of Indonesia|clothing]], [[Dance in Indonesia|dances]] and [[Traditions of Indonesia|traditions]] are all depicted impeccably.

It came about at a convention on 8 Cendana Street at March 13, 1970. Through this recreational site, she hoped to cultivate national pride in more Indonesian people.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/> A project called \"Indonesian Miniature Project\" was started by Harapan Kita Foundation in 1972. The concept of this culture-based recreational area was inspired by Indonesia's unparalleled natural riches and local folk diversity.\n\n==Characteristics==\nTMII was originally located on a public area of 145 ha, as farms and fields. Later, the team was able to convert these fields into a suitable location for the construction. The [[topography]] of TMII is rather hilly, consistent with what the builders required. The team claimed the advantage of utilizing this uneven terrain was the ability to create interesting and diverse landscapes and enclosures, as well as reflecting the various characteristics of the Indonesian environment.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/>\n\n==Parts of TMII==\n[[File:Taman Mini Indonesia Indah Map en.svg|center|900px]]\n\n===Venues of Indonesian Provinces===\n[[File:Jaipongan Langit Biru 03.jpg|thumb|The [[Jaipongan]] dance performance in West Java pavilion in TMII.]]\n[[File:Indonesia in miniature, Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.jpg|thumb|The miniature of [[Indonesian Archipelago]] in the center lake viewed from the cable car.]]\n[[File:TMII West Sumatra.jpg|thumb|[[West Sumatra]] pavilion in TMII.]]\n\nSince each Indonesian province maintains its own unique and distinct cultures, shelters, attire and dialects, TMII built a model of each of the houses from Indonesian provinces. TMII attempted not only to reconstruct the homes of the various provinces, but also to create a realistic model of the environment and shelters of the various people of Indonesia.<ref name='TMIIanj'>[http://www.tamanmini.com/anjungan/ Anjungan]</ref> The venues, which are situated around the main lake in a similar fashion to the different islands of the [[Indonesian archipelago]], are thematically divided into six areas in respect to the main islands of Indonesia; [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Kalimantan]] ([[Borneo]]), [[Sulawesi]], the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]]. Each pavilions featured in typical [[vernacular]] [[Indonesian architecture]] of each provinces. Examples of Indonesian traditional vernacular houses are: [[Joglo]] and Omah Kudus [[Javanese people|Javanese]] houses of [[Central Java]] and [[Yogyakarta]] pavilion; [[Minangkabau people|Minang]] [[Rumah Gadang]] of [[West Sumatra]] pavilion; [[Malay houses]] of [[Jambi]] and [[Riau]] provinces; [[Toraja]]n [[Tongkonan]] and Bugis house of [[South Sulawesi]] pavilion; and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] house compound with intricately carved [[candi bentar]] split gate and [[Paduraksa|kori agung]] gate.\n\nIt also displays various traditional costumes, wedding costumes, dance costumes, also ethnography artifacts such as weapons and daily tools, models of traditional architecture are in display to describes the way of life of its people. Each provinces pavilions also equipped with small stage, amphitheatre or auditorium for traditional dance performances, traditional music performances or traditional ceremonies that usually held in Sundays. Some of these pavilions also equipped with cafeterias featuring traditional [[Indonesian cuisine]]s and also souvenir shops offering various handicrafts, T-shirts and souvenirs.\n\nSince 1975 until the 2000s, the original design of TMII consist of a model of the houses from the 27 provinces of Indonesia, including [[East Timor]]. But after the secession of East Timor from Indonesia in 2002, the East Timor pavilion changed its status to become the Museum of East Timor. Also since Indonesia now consist of [[Provinces of Indonesia|33 provinces]], currently the new province pavilions of [[Bangka Belitung]], [[Banten]], [[West Sulawesi]], [[North Maluku]], [[Gorontalo (province)|Gorontalo]], [[Riau Islands]], and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] is being built in northeast part of the park.\n\nAfter the recognition of [[Indonesian Chinese]] [[Chinese culture|culture]] as the integral part of Indonesian culture in 2000, the new [[Indonesian Chinese]] pavilion and a [[Confucian temple]] was built within the park.\n\n===Religious Buildings===\nThe religious buildings of several official faiths is meant to showcase the inter-faiths tolerance and religious harmony of Indonesia.
