{"title_page": "Separation of variables", "text_new": "{{Differential equations}}\n[[File:First Order proportional differential equation.png|thumb]]\nIn [[mathematics]], '''separation of variables''' (also known as the '''Fourier method''') is any of several methods for solving ordinary and [[partial differential equation]]s, in which algebra allows one to rewrite an equation so that each of two variables occurs on a different side of the equation.\n\n== Ordinary differential equations (ODE) ==\n\nSuppose a differential equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = g(x)h(f(x))</math>\n\nwhich we can write more simply by letting <math>y = f(x)</math>:\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx}=g(x)h(y).</math>\n\nAs long as ''h''(''y'') \u2260 0, we can rearrange terms to obtain:\n\n:<math>{dy \\over h(y)} = g(x) \\, dx,</math>\n\nso that the two variables ''x'' and ''y'' have been separated. ''dx'' (and ''dy'') can be viewed, at a simple level, as just a convenient notation, which provides a handy mnemonic aid for assisting with manipulations. A formal definition of ''dx'' as a [[differential (infinitesimal)]] is somewhat advanced.\n\n=== Alternative notation ===\n\nThose who dislike [[Leibniz's notation]] may prefer to write this as\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{h(y)} \\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x),</math>\n\nbut that fails to make it quite as obvious why this is called \"separation of variables\". Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to <math>x</math>, we have\n\n:<math>\\int \\frac{1}{h(y)} \\frac{dy}{dx} \\, dx = \\int g(x) \\, dx, \\qquad\\qquad (1) </math>\n\nor equivalently,\n\n:<math>\\int \\frac{1}{h(y)} \\, dy = \\int g(x) \\, dx </math>\n\nbecause of the [[integration by substitution|substitution rule for integrals]].\n\nIf one can evaluate the two integrals, one can find a solution to the differential equation.

Finally, we can get\n: <math>u_{n}(t)=e^{-\\alpha\\frac{n^{2}\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} t} \\left (b_{n}+\\int_{0}^{t}h_{n}(s)e^{\\alpha\\frac{n^{2}\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} s} \\, ds \\right).</math>\n\nIf the boundary condition is nonhomogeneous, then the expansion of {{EqNote|9}} and {{EqNote|10}} is no longer valid. One has to find a function ''v'' that satisfies the boundary condition only, and subtract it from ''u''. The function ''u-v'' then satisfies homogeneous boundary condition, and can be solved with the above method.\n\n=== Example: mixed derivatives ===\n\nFor some equations involving mixed derivatives, the equation does not separate as easily as the heat equation did in the first example above, but nonetheless separation of variables may still be applied. Consider the two-dimensional [[biharmonic equation]]\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^4 u}{\\partial x^4} + 2\\frac{\\partial^4 u}{\\partial x^2\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^4 u}{\\partial y^4} = 0.</math>\n\nProceeding in the usual manner, we look for solutions of the form\n\n:<math>u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)</math>\n\nand we obtain the equation\n\n:<math>\\frac{X^{(4)}(x)}{X(x)} + 2\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} + \\frac{Y^{(4)}(y)}{Y(y)} = 0.</math>\n\nWriting this equation in the form\n\n:<math>E(x) + F(x)G(y) + H(y) = 0,</math>\n\nwe see that the derivative with respect to ''x'' and ''y'' eliminates the first and last terms, so that\n\n:<math>F'(x)G'(y) = 0,</math>\n\ni.e. either ''F(x)'' or ''G(y)'' must be a constant, say -\u03bb. This further implies that either <math>-E(x)=F(x)G(y)+H(y)</math> or <math>-H(y)=E(x)+F(x)G(y)</math> are constant. Returning to the equation for ''X'' and ''Y'', we have two cases\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    X''(x) &= -\\lambda_1X(x) \\\\\n    X^{(4)}(x) &= \\mu_1X(x) \\\\\n    Y^{(4)}(y) - 2\\lambda_1Y''(y) &= -\\mu_1Y(y)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    Y''(y) &= -\\lambda_2Y(y) \\\\\n    Y^{(4)}(y) &= \\mu_2Y(y) \\\\\n    X^{(4)}(x) - 2\\lambda_2X''(x) &= -\\mu_2X(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich can each be solved by considering the separate cases for <math>\\lambda_i<0, \\lambda_i=0, \\lambda_i>0</math> and noting that <math>\\mu_i=\\lambda_i^2</math>.\n\n=== Curvilinear coordinates ===\n\nIn [[orthogonal curvilinear coordinates]], separation of variables can still be used, but in some details different from that in Cartesian coordinates. For instance, regularity or periodic condition may determine the eigenvalues in place of boundary conditions. See [[spherical harmonics#Laplace's spherical harmonics|spherical harmonics]] for example.\n\n== Matrices ==\nThe matrix form of the separation of variables is the [[Kronecker sum]].\n\nAs an example we consider the 2D [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] on a [[regular grid]]:\n\n:<math>L = \\mathbf{D_{xx}}\\oplus\\mathbf{D_{yy}}=\\mathbf{D_{xx}}\\otimes\\mathbf{I}+\\mathbf{I}\\otimes\\mathbf{D_{yy}}, \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{D_{xx}} </math> and <math>\\mathbf{D_{yy}} </math> are 1D discrete Laplacians in the ''x''- and ''y''-directions, correspondingly, and <math>\\mathbf{I} </math> are the identities of appropriate sizes.

Finally, we can get\n: <math>u_{n}(t)=e^{-\\alpha\\frac{n^{2}\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} t} \\left (b_{n}+\\int_{0}^{t}h_{n}(s)e^{\\alpha\\frac{n^{2}\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} s} \\, ds \\right).</math>\n\nIf the boundary condition is nonhomogeneous, then the expansion of {{EqNote|9}} and {{EqNote|10}} is no longer valid. One has to find a function ''v'' that satisfies the boundary condition only, and subtract it from ''u''. The function ''u-v'' then satisfies homogeneous boundary condition, and can be solved with the above method.\n\n=== Example: mixed derivatives ===\n\nFor some equations involving mixed derivatives, the equation does not separate as easily as the heat equation did in the first example above, but nonetheless separation of variables may still be applied. Consider the two-dimensional [[biharmonic equation]]\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^4 u}{\\partial x^4} + 2\\frac{\\partial^4 u}{\\partial x^2\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^4 u}{\\partial y^4} = 0.</math>\n\nProceeding in the usual manner, we look for solutions of the form\n\n:<math>u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)</math>\n\nand we obtain the equation\n\n:<math>\\frac{X^{(4)}(x)}{X(x)} + 2\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} + \\frac{Y^{(4)}(y)}{Y(y)} = 0.</math>\n\nWriting this equation in the form\n\n:<math>E(x) + F(x)G(y) + H(y) = 0,</math>\n\nwe see that the derivative with respect to ''x'' and ''y'' eliminates the first and last terms, so that\n\n:<math>F'(x)G'(y) = 0,</math>\n\ni.e. either ''F(x)'' or ''G(y)'' must be a constant, say -\u03bb. This further implies that either <math>-E(x)=F(x)G(y)+H(y)</math> or <math>-H(y)=E(x)+F(x)G(y)</math> are constant. Returning to the equation for ''X'' and ''Y'', we have two cases\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    X''(x) &= -\\lambda_1X(x) \\\\\n    X^{(4)}(x) &= \\mu_1X(x) \\\\\n    Y^{(4)}(y) - 2\\lambda_1Y''(y) &= -\\mu_1Y(y)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    Y''(y) &= -\\lambda_2Y(y) \\\\\n    Y^{(4)}(y) &= \\mu_2Y(y) \\\\\n    X^{(4)}(x) - 2\\lambda_2X''(x) &= -\\mu_2X(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich can each be solved by considering the separate cases for <math>\\lambda_i<0, \\lambda_i=0, \\lambda_i>0</math> and noting that <math>\\mu_i=\\lambda_i^2</math>.\n\n=== Curvilinear coordinates ===\n\nIn [[orthogonal curvilinear coordinates]], separation of variables can still be used, but in some details different from that in Cartesian coordinates. For instance, regularity or periodic condition may determine the eigenvalues in place of boundary conditions. See [[spherical harmonics#Laplace's spherical harmonics|spherical harmonics]] for example.\n\n== Matrices ==\nThe matrix form of the separation of variables is the [[Kronecker sum]].\n\nAs an example we consider the 2D [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] on a [[regular grid]]:\n\n:<math>L = \\mathbf{D_{xx}}\\oplus\\mathbf{D_{yy}}=\\mathbf{D_{xx}}\\otimes\\mathbf{I}+\\mathbf{I}\\otimes\\mathbf{D_{yy}}, \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{D_{xx}} </math> and <math>\\mathbf{D_{yy}} </math> are 1D discrete Laplacians in the ''x''- and ''y''-directions, correspondingly, and <math>\\mathbf{I} </math> are the identities of appropriate sizes. See the main article [[Kronecker sum of discrete Laplacians]] for details.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Inseparable differential equation]]\n\n== References ==\n*{{Cite book\n| first1 = Andrei D.\n| last1 = Polyanin\n| title = Handbook of Linear Partial Differential Equations for Engineers and Scientists\n| publisher = [[CRC Press|Chapman & Hall/CRC]]\n| date = 2001-11-28\n| location = Boca Raton, FL\n| isbn = 1-58488-299-9\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n| first1 = Tyn\n| last1 = Myint-U\n| first2 = Lokenath\n| last2 = Debnath\n|author-link2=Lokenath Debnath\n| isbn = 978-0-8176-4393-5\n| title = Linear Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers\n| location = Boston, MA\n| year = 2007\n| publisher = [[Birkh\u00e4user|Birkh\u00e4user Boston]]\n| doi = 10.1007/978-0-8176-4560-1\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| last = Teschl\n| first = Gerald\n| author-link = Gerald Teschl\n| title = Ordinary Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems\n| series = [[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]]\n| volume = 140\n| publisher = [[American Mathematical Society]]\n| location = Providence, RI\n| year = 2012\n| isbn = 978-0-8218-8328-0\n| url = http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~gerald/ftp/book-ode/\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{springer|title=Fourier method|id=p/f041070}}\n* {{mathworld2 |urlname=SeparationofVariables |title=Separation of variables|urlname2=DifferentialEquation|title2=Differential Equation|author=John Renze, [[Eric W.

Uttar Pradesh is one of the six states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the [[Vidhan Sabha]] (Legislative Assembly) and the [[Vidhan Parishad]] (Legislative Council). The Vidhan Parishad is a permanent House, consisting of 100 members.\n\n==History==\nThe Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad came into existence by the Government of India Act of 1935. The former and previous Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Anandiben Patel, was previously an elected member of it. The Legislative Council consisted of 60 members. The term of a member of the Council was nine years with one-third of its members retiring after every three years. The Houses enjoyed the right of electing their Presiding Officers known as the President. The first meeting of the Legislative Council was held on 29 July 1937. Sir Sitaram and Begum Aijaz Rasul were elected the President and the Vice-President of the Legislative Council respectively. Sir Sitaram was in office until 9 March 1949. Chandra Bhal became the next Chairman on 10 March 1949.\n\nAfter the independence and adoption of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] on 26 January 1950 Chandra Bhal was re-elected the Chairman of the Legislative Council and served until 5 May 1958. Sri Nizamuddin was elected the Deputy Chairman of the Council on 27 May 1952. He served until 1964.\n\n==Nominations and election==\nWhen, under the provisions of the [[Government of India Act 1935]], the Legislative Council came into existence in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], it comprised 60 members. On 26 January 1950, the total membership of the Vidhan Parishad (legislative council) of [[Uttar Pradesh]] state was increased from 60 to 72.  With the Constitution  (Seventh Amendment) Act 1956, the strength of the Council was enhanced to 108. After the reorganisation of Uttar Pradesh state in November 2000 and the creation of [[Uttarakhand]] state, this strength has now reduced to 100.\n\nThe present composition of the Vidhan Parishad is as follows: \n* 10 members are nominated by the governor of Uttar Pradesh.\n* 38 members are elected by the [[Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] members.\n* 36 members are elected by the Local bodies.\n* 8 members are elected by the teachers.\n* 8 members are elected by the graduates.\n\n==Term==\nMembers are now elected or nominated for six years and one-third of them retire on the expiration of every second year, so a member continues as such for six years. The vacant seats are filled up by fresh elections and nominations (by Governor) at the beginning of every third year. The retiring members are also eligible for re-election and re-nomination any number of times. The Presiding Officers of Vidhan Parishad are Chairman and Deputy Chairman. [[Ramesh Yadav]] is the current Chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council.\n\n==Constituencies and members==\n''See here the [[List of members of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council]]''\n\nThe following are the constituencies of the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/delup.htm|title=The Delimitation of Council Constituencies (Uttar Pradesh) Order, 1951|publisher=Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India|access-date=2009-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619084058/http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/delup.htm|archive-date=2009-06-19|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Elected from Graduates Constituencies===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\" style=\"width: 90%;\"\n|-\n! #\n!

Uttar Pradesh is one of the six states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the [[Vidhan Sabha]] (Legislative Assembly) and the [[Vidhan Parishad]] (Legislative Council). The Vidhan Parishad is a permanent House, consisting of 100 members.\n\n==History==\nThe Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad came into existence by the Government of India Act of 1935. The former and previous Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Anandiben Patel, was previously an elected member of it. The Legislative Council consisted of 60 members. The term of a member of the Council was nine years with one-third of its members retiring after every three years. The Houses enjoyed the right of electing their Presiding Officers known as the President. The first meeting of the Legislative Council was held on 29 July 1937. Sir Sitaram and Begum Aijaz Rasul were elected the President and the Vice-President of the Legislative Council respectively. Sir Sitaram was in office until 9 March 1949. Chandra Bhal became the next Chairman on 10 March 1949.\n\nAfter the independence and adoption of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] on 26 January 1950 Chandra Bhal was re-elected the Chairman of the Legislative Council and served until 5 May 1958. Sri Nizamuddin was elected the Deputy Chairman of the Council on 27 May 1952. He served until 1964.\n\n==Nominations and election==\nWhen, under the provisions of the [[Government of India Act 1935]], the Legislative Council came into existence in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], it comprised 60 members. On 26 January 1950, the total membership of the Vidhan Parishad (legislative council) of [[Uttar Pradesh]] state was increased from 60 to 72.  With the Constitution  (Seventh Amendment) Act 1956, the strength of the Council was enhanced to 108. After the reorganisation of Uttar Pradesh state in November 2000 and the creation of [[Uttarakhand]] state, this strength has now reduced to 100.\n\nThe present composition of the Vidhan Parishad is as follows: \n* 10 members are nominated by the governor of Uttar Pradesh.\n* 38 members are elected by the [[Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] members.\n* 36 members are elected by the Local bodies.\n* 8 members are elected by the teachers.\n* 8 members are elected by the graduates.\n\n==Term==\nMembers are now elected or nominated for six years and one-third of them retire on the expiration of every second year, so a member continues as such for six years. The vacant seats are filled up by fresh elections and nominations (by Governor) at the beginning of every third year. The retiring members are also eligible for re-election and re-nomination any number of times. The Presiding Officers of Vidhan Parishad are Chairman and Deputy Chairman. [[Ramesh Yadav]] is the current Chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council.\n\n==Constituencies and members==\n''See here the [[List of members of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council]]''\n\nThe following are the constituencies of the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/delup.htm|title=The Delimitation of Council Constituencies (Uttar Pradesh) Order, 1951|publisher=Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India|access-date=2009-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619084058/http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/delup.htm|archive-date=2009-06-19|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Elected from Graduates Constituencies===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\" style=\"width: 90%;\"\n|-\n! #\n!

The SWORD area gets a temporary peace.\n\nHowever, [[High&Low#Kuryu Group|Kuryu Group]] does not give up its plan of building a [[casino]] in the SWORD area. To fight their mutual enemies, Cobra of [[High&Low#Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad)|Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad)]] suggests the five SWORD gangs should ally. However, as their leader Smoky's illness takes a turn for the worse, [[High&Low#Rude Boys|Rude Boys]] members who attend the summit of SWORD leaders in place of Smoky refuse the plan, saying that it's more important for them to survive. [[High&Low#White Rascals|White Rascals]]' leader Rocky refuses to ally too, maintaining that they only want to protect women. The plan of alliance therefore fails.\n\nRocky refuses the plan for his own reason. The vicious man he has a feud with, [[High&Low#DOUBT|Doubt]]'s leader Ranmaru Hayashi has got out of prison, Rocky does not want the other SWORD gangs to get involved in the feud between them. Ranmaru Hayashi came prepared, with his money and the fierce Prison Gang he calls from the prison, he almost destroys White Rascals and injures Rocky. Cobra offers Rocky his help, but Rocky insists that one should rely on his own when he can.\n\nMeanwhile, another fight against the casino plan has begun. After the death of their older brother Takeru, [[High&Low#The Amamiya Brothers|Masaki and Hiroto Amamiya]] gives the [[USB flash drive|USB]] with proof of politicians taking bribes from the Kuryu Group to Kohaku, who deeply regrets the mistakes he has made and wants to expose the evil of the Kuryu Group. Kuryu Group becomes aware of their plans of publicising information in the USB, and they send Genji Kuki, vice leader of Kurosakikai, to kill the Kohaku and his right arm man Tsukumo. \n\nTo end the feud between themselves and the alliance of Doubt and the Prison Gang, the White Rascals head to the fatal battle. When they are almost killed by their powerful enemy, Cobra, and other SWORD members, come to their rescue with the determination to protect the SWORD area as a whole from their enemies. At the same time, Kohaku,&nbsp; Tsukumo and the Amamiya brothers have to fight the formidable killer Genji Kuki.\n\nThe biggest fight that will determine the future of the SWORD area begins. The SWORD gangs repulse the attacks of their enemies at walls, but their true enemy, the Kuryu Group, has not yet been defeated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Takanori Iwata]] as Cobra, leader of [[High&Low#Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad)|Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad)]], and a member of the former legendary gang [[High&Low|Mugen]].

A small, single-track railway connects Dezhou with [[Dongying]] city as well.\n\nThe main expressway passing Dezhou is the [[G3 Beijing\u2013Taipei Expressway|G3 Beijing-Taipei Expressway]], running north\u2013south from it; other provincial expressways, as well as National Highway 104 and 105 offer connections in other directions for Dezhou\n\n==Tourism==\n{{main|Tourism in the People's Republic of China}}\nDezhou's biggest historical attraction is the tomb of [[Sultan Paduka Pahala]] of [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] (Philippines), who died in Dezhou on his return journey from a visit to the [[Yongle Emperor]] in 1417.<ref name=\":0\" /> The tomb is well preserved and has been declared a national heritage site.

Now part of the ancient city wall of Tang Dynasty still exists in the south of the region. Before the [[Three Kingdoms]] formed, one of the three emperors [[Liu Bei]] used to be the chief of the county, together with his fellows Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. In addition, it is the hometown of [[Dongfang Shuo]] (\u4e1c\u65b9\u6714), the most well-known adviser during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] ; In Tang Dynasty, a major figure of Chinese calligraphy, [[Yan Zhenqing]], once took office as the administrator of the county. Today, a memorial hall for the two historic figures is built in the People's Park of Lingxian, where a lot of materials of Dongfang Shuo and stone inscriptions of Yan Zhenqing are preserved.\n\nFor tourist attractions, there is also a famous temple in Qingyun County.

It is not clear how commonly, if at all, the word was used as an ethnonym in Old High German.\n\nUsed as a noun, ''ein diutscher'' in the sense of \"a German\" emerges in [[Middle High German]], attested from the second half of the 12th century.<ref>\ne.g. [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]. See [[Matthias von Lexer|Lexer]], ''Mittelhochdeutsches Handw\u00f6rterbuch'' (1872\u20131878), s.v. \"Diutsche\".\nThe Middle High German [[Song of Roland]] (ca. 1170) has  ''in diutisker erde'' (65.6) for \"in the German realm, in Germany\".\nThe phrase ''in t\u00fctschem land'', whence the modern ''[[Deutschland]]'', is attested in the late 15th century (e.g. [[Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg]], [[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]], see Grimm, ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'', s.v. \"Deutsch\").</ref>\n\nThe [[Old French]] term ''alemans'' is taken from the name of the [[Alamanni]]. It was loaned into [[Middle English]] as ''almains'' in the early 14th century. The word ''Dutch'' is attested in English from the 14th century, denoting continental West Germanic (\"Dutch\" and \"German\") dialects and their speakers.<ref>''OED'', s.v. [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/58711?rskey=gu9Opa] \"Dutch, adj., n., and adv.\"</ref>\n\nWhile in most [[Romance languages]] the Germans have been named from the Alamanni (in what became [[Swabia]]) (some, like standard [[Italian language|Italian]] ''tedeschi'', retain an older borrowing of the [[exonym and endonym|endonym]], while the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] 'germani' stems from the historical correlation with the ancient region of [[Germania]]), the [[Old Norse]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] names for the Germans were taken from that of the [[Saxons]]. In [[Slavic languages]], the Germans were given the name of   ''{{lang|sla|n\u011bm\u044cci}} '' (singular ''{{lang|sla|n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c}}''), originally meaning \"mute.\"\n\nThe English term ''Germans'' is only attested from the mid-16th century, based on the classical Latin term ''Germani'' used by [[Julius Caesar]] and later [[Tacitus]].

The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nTheologian [[Martin Luther|Luther]], who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most admired German poets and authors are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A.

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states.

Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire.

Nationalism and Pan-Germanism became almost taboo because they had been used so destructively by the Nazis. Indeed, the word \"Volksdeutscher\" in reference to ethnic Germans naturalized during WWII later developed into a mild epithet.\n\nFrom the 1960s, Germany also saw increasing immigration, especially from Turkey, under an official programme aimed at encouraging \"[[Gastarbeiter]]\" or guestworkers to the country to provide labour during the post-war economic boom years. Although it had been expected that such workers would return home, many settled in Germany, with their descendants becoming German citizens.<ref name=\"Spiegel\">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/at-home-in-a-foreign-country-german-turks-struggle-to-find-their-identity-a-795299.html At Home in a Foreign Country: German Turks Struggle to Find Their Identity], Spiegel Online.</ref>\n\n===1990\u2013present===\n{{Further|German reunification}}\n\nHowever, [[German reunification]] in 1990 revived the old debates.

The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its [[Nazi]] past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed\u2014and not represented\u2014by [[Nazism]].<ref name=\"Heilbrunn\"/> The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy.

It is not clear how commonly, if at all, the word was used as an ethnonym in Old High German.\n\nUsed as a noun, ''ein diutscher'' in the sense of \"a German\" emerges in [[Middle High German]], attested from the second half of the 12th century.<ref>\ne.g. [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]. See [[Matthias von Lexer|Lexer]], ''Mittelhochdeutsches Handw\u00f6rterbuch'' (1872\u20131878), s.v. \"Diutsche\".\nThe Middle High German [[Song of Roland]] (ca. 1170) has  ''in diutisker erde'' (65.6) for \"in the German realm, in Germany\".\nThe phrase ''in t\u00fctschem land'', whence the modern ''[[Deutschland]]'', is attested in the late 15th century (e.g. [[Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg]], [[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]], see Grimm, ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'', s.v. \"Deutsch\").</ref>\n\nThe [[Old French]] term ''alemans'' is taken from the name of the [[Alamanni]]. It was loaned into [[Middle English]] as ''almains'' in the early 14th century. The word ''Dutch'' is attested in English from the 14th century, denoting continental West Germanic (\"Dutch\" and \"German\") dialects and their speakers.<ref>''OED'', s.v.

In [[Slavic languages]], the Germans were given the name of   ''{{lang|sla|n\u011bm\u044cci}} '' (singular ''{{lang|sla|n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c}}''), originally meaning \"mute.\"\n\nThe English term ''Germans'' is only attested from the mid-16th century, based on the classical Latin term ''Germani'' used by [[Julius Caesar]] and later [[Tacitus]].

Along the trade routes, Hanseatic trade stations became centers of the German culture. [[German town law]] ''(Stadtrecht)'' was promoted by the presence of large, relatively wealthy German populations, their influence and political power. Thus people who would be considered \"Germans\", with a common culture, language, and [[worldview]] different from that of the surrounding rural peoples, colonized trading towns as far north of present-day Germany as [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] (in [[Norway]]), [[Stockholm]] (in [[Sweden]]), and [[Vyborg]] (now in Russia). The Hanseatic League was not exclusively German in any ethnic sense: many towns who joined the league were outside the Holy Roman Empire and a number of them may only loosely be characterized as ''German''. The Empire itself was not entirely German either. It had a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual structure, some of the smaller ethnicities and languages used at different times were Dutch, Italian, French, Czech and Polish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/ausstellungen/heiliges-roemisches-reich/index_3.html|title=Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation|website=Dhm.de|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the [[Middle Ages]], large numbers of [[Jews]] lived in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and had assimilated into German culture, including many Jews who had previously assimilated into French culture and had spoken a mixed Judeo-French language.<ref name=\"Ulrich Ammon 2006\">Ulrich Ammon, Norbert Dittmar, Klaus J.

The [[Thirty Years' War]], a series of conflicts fought mainly in the territory of modern Germany, weakened the coherence of the Holy Roman Empire, leading to the emergence of different, smaller German states known as ''[[Kleinstaaterei]]'' in [[18th-century Germany]].\n\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] were the cause of the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and ultimately the cause for the quest for a German [[nation state]] in 19th-century [[German nationalism]]. After the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Prussia]] emerged as two competitors. Austria, trying to remain the dominant power in Central Europe, led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna.

The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nTheologian [[Martin Luther|Luther]], who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most admired German poets and authors are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A.

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states.

Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire.

Indeed, the word \"Volksdeutscher\" in reference to ethnic Germans naturalized during WWII later developed into a mild epithet.\n\nFrom the 1960s, Germany also saw increasing immigration, especially from Turkey, under an official programme aimed at encouraging \"[[Gastarbeiter]]\" or guestworkers to the country to provide labour during the post-war economic boom years. Although it had been expected that such workers would return home, many settled in Germany, with their descendants becoming German citizens.<ref name=\"Spiegel\">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/at-home-in-a-foreign-country-german-turks-struggle-to-find-their-identity-a-795299.html At Home in a Foreign Country: German Turks Struggle to Find Their Identity], Spiegel Online.</ref>\n\n===1990\u2013present===\n{{Further|German reunification}}\n\nHowever, [[German reunification]] in 1990 revived the old debates. The fear of nationalistic misuse of Pan-Germanism nevertheless remains strong. But the overwhelming majority of Germans today are not chauvinistic in nationalism, but in 2006 and again in 2010, the [[German National Football Team]] won third place in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]s, ignited a positive scene of German pride, enhanced by success in sport.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F074398-0021, Bonn, Pressekonferenz Bundestagswahlkampf, Kohl.jpg|left|thumb|[[Helmut Kohl]] played a principal role in the German reunification.]]\n\nFor decades after the Second World War, any national symbol or expression was a taboo.<ref name=\"Proud German\">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/541844|title=Proud German? | work=The Economist | date=24 March 2001}}</ref> However, the Germans are becoming increasingly patriotic.<ref name=\"Proud German\"/><ref name=\"generationaldynamics.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.generationaldynamics.com/cgi-bin/D.PL?xct=gd.e060623 |title=Are Germans now proud to be the Germans? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129212013/http://www.generationaldynamics.com/cgi-bin/D.PL?xct=gd.e060623 |archivedate=29 January 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> During a study in 2009, in which some 2,000 German citizens age 14 and upwards filled out a questionnaire, nearly 60% of those surveyed agreed with the sentiment \"I'm proud to be German.\" And 78%, if free to choose their nation, would opt for German nationality with \"near or absolute certainty\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/757-where-germans-dare |title=National Identity \u2013 Where Germans dare |publisher=Presseurop.eu |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref> Another study in 2009, carried out by the Identity Foundation in D\u00fcsseldorf, showed that 73% of the Germans were proud of their country, twice more than 8 years earlier.

And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position at the center of the Continent.\"<ref name=\"Heilbrunn\"/> Heilbrunn believes that the adage, \"what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union\" has been supplanted by a new mentality\u2014what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its [[Nazi]] past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed\u2014and not represented\u2014by [[Nazism]].<ref name=\"Heilbrunn\"/> The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister [[Radek Sikorski]]'s effusive praise for his country's western neighbor.<ref name=\"Heilbrunn\"/> This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Demographics of Germany]]\n* [[Anti-German sentiment]]\n* [[Die Deutschen]], ZDF's documentary television series\n* [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]\n* [[Genetic history of Europe]]\n* [[German eastward expansion]]\n* [[List of Alsatians and Lorrainians]]\n* [[List of Austrians]]\n* [[List of ancient Germanic peoples]]\n* [[List of Swiss people]]\n* [[List of terms used for Germans]]\n* [[Names for the German language]]\n* [[Organised persecution of ethnic Germans]]\n\n{{Portal bar|Ancient Germanic culture|Germany|Austria|Switzerland|Luxembourg|Germans}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* Bryce, Benjamin.

They speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the most widely spoken [[Austroasiatic language]]. They comprised 85% of the population of the country at the 2019 census, and are officially known as '''Kinh''' to distinguish them from other ethnic groups of Vietnam. The earliest recorded name for the ancient Vietnamese people appears as ''[[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t|L\u1ea1c]]'' or ''[[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t]].\n \nAlthough Vietnam geographically and linguistically considered Southeast Asian, the Vietnamese are within the [[East Asian cultural sphere]] due to the [[Chinese domination of Vietnam]]. They are culturally most similar to neighboring southern Han Chinese subgroups and southern Chinese ethnic minorities intermediate to them. The word ''Vi\u1ec7t'' derives from ''[[Baiyue|B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t]]'' ('Baiyue' in Chinese) and ''Nam'' means \"south\". \"Baiyue\" was a name used by the [[Han Chinese]] in ancient times to describe various southern non-Chinese peoples. Together, Vietnam means \"to the south of the Viet\", as Vietnam is located south of the ''[[Baiyue|B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t]]''.\n\n==Origins==\nWritten history knows the ancient Vietnamese people first simply as the L\u1ea1c or [[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t]], and the country of [[Vietnam]] as [[V\u0103n Lang]].

They married and had one hundred eggs, from which hatched one hundred children. Their eldest son ruled as the [[H\u00f9ng king]].\n\n===First Vietnamese===\nHistorians believe that the earliest Vietnamese people gradually moved from the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago through the Malay Peninsula and Thailand until they settled on the edges of the Red River in the Tonkin Delta.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Archaeologists follow a path of stone tools from the Late [[Pleistocene]] across Java, Malaysia, Thailand and north to Myanmar. These stone tools are thought to be the first human tools used in Southeast Asia. Archaeologists believe that at this time the Himalayas, a chain of mountains in northern Myanmar and China, created an icy barrier which isolated the people of Southeast Asia. During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (25,000-18,000 BCE), ocean levels dropped significantly. This resulted in the exposure of the shallow areas surrounding the coasts and islands of Southeast Asia - today known as the [[Sunda Shelf]].\n\nIt is generally thought{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that the exposed Sunda Shelf looked like a giant salt plain, and that perhaps people ventured out across this area to settle on other coasts or islands. Later, when the glaciers melted, the Sunda Shelf again disappeared under water. Because it is a relatively shallow body of water, it has always provided a safe area for traders and travelers in small boats to pass safely without the threat of high or choppy seas. In this way, the geography of the area has had a lot to do with the way in which cultures developed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} As the map indicates, outside the Sunda Shelf are deep ocean basins which were not often crossed until heavier and wider Chinese vessels (massive vessels from the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279), which dwarfed later European man-of-war sailing ships) could traverse these deep and sometimes dangerous seas.\n\nAs the glaciers melted and the seas near these coasts rose, traders and other travelers who wanted to migrate to other areas, or perhaps to proselytize religion, used boats as transport. For the next 4,000 years, until 8000 BCE, people also moved across the mainland of Southeast Asia towards the Tonkin Delta, some stopping and settling along the way. Eventually, the descendants of these migratory peoples entered the Neolithic Age (from around 8000-800 BCE), when humans started to use simple stone tools.  Remains of these people and the [[Hoabinhian]] culture have been found in the H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh Caves along the Red River and in the Tonkin Delta. In the [[Neolithic#Middle Neolithic|Middle Neolithic]] Period (2500\u20132000 BCE), more people appeared in the area of present-day Vietnam and settled at another location called [[B\u1eafc S\u01a1n District|B\u1eafc S\u01a1n]], in a central area of the Tonkin Delta. These people were probably somewhat taller and lighter-skinned than the Hoabinhian [[negrito]]s; they excelled in the art of [[basket weaving]] as well as in the manufacturing and use of polished double-edged stone tools.\n\n===Earlier Vietnamese groups===\n[[File:World 500 BCE showing Van Lang.png|right|thumb|Map of [[V\u0103n Lang]], 500&nbsp;BC]]\nSometime after the advent of the societies found at H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh and B\u1eafc S\u01a1n, another group of people developed a culture in what is modern [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]], where an aspect of their religion was manifested in large mounds of mollusk shells which had been collected from the [[Red River Delta]]. Bodies had been buried under these piles of shells in a seated position with bent knees - in the same position as many buried bodies found throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. This signifies to archaeologists that these early people had an advanced society based on fishing and that their religion was oriented toward the sea. At a location further south of the [[Tonkin]] Delta, in the central region of Vietnam's coast, remains of another culture have been found at Sa Hu\u1ef3nh. The [[Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture]] existed from about 4000 to 1000 BCE. Tools, ornamental beads, and funerary jars have also been found at these archaeological sites. These jars were usually located at the water's edge and probably signified a dead person's journey out to sea.\n\nThroughout Southeast Asia, the Neolithic Period can be considered the period in which organized societies developed. During this period the Vietnamese people spread across a large area from the foothills of the [[Annamite Range]] to the eastern coast of [[Northern Vietnam]]. It is thought that they lived in small communities with groups of extended families living in a simple communal way. The growing of rice, their staple food, had developed into two distinct methods, shifting cultivation, done on a dry field, usually in upland areas, and wet rice cultivation, which involved the construction of dikes around rivers that collected water into knee-deep ponds in which the rice was grown.\n\n===Cultural and historical influences===\n\n====North====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}} \nBefore the Chinese actually annexed Vietnam, groups from present-day southern China began to move into the Tonkin Delta<!--What is the Tonkin Delta?--> in order to start new lives after being forced to leave their homelands. Thus, around the 3rd century BC, changes in China began to heavily influence the [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture]] which was thriving in Vietnam. One important series of changes occurred along the Yangtze River in southern China. According to historians, in 333 BC, three cultures, the [[Shu (state)|Shu]], the Ch'u, and the [[Yue (state)|Yueh]] began to fight among themselves, causing the Yueh to move south in small scattered kingdoms. At the same time, the central power of northern China, the Ch'in Dynasty, began to split so that a large number of princes and members of the aristocracy also moved south to start their own small kingdoms. [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] \u8d8a gave the name \"[[Viet]]\".\n[[File:Town Dress of Women from Tonkin, Woman from Tonkin, Cult Objects, Riflemen from Tonkin.JPG|thumb|People of [[Tonkin]], 1861-1880]]\nThe people of the Red River civilizations, also known as Lac society, began to feel the effects of these newcomers who gradually moved into their homelands. Many historians believe that it was not difficult for the Yueh to be incorporated into Lac society. However, the Au Lac lords began to fight with the Ch'in princes. While they were involved in this fighting, another group from the northwest, the Thuc (who had once been the Shu of the Yangtze River) took advantage of weakness in the area and asserted their authority. The legendary [[C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel]], the remains of which can still be seen today. [[An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng]]'s arrival explains the origins of the legendary [[\u00c2u L\u1ea1c]] kingdom which is usually associated with the height of \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture. [[Vietnamese language]] may be representative of these influences.\n\n====South====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}\nVietnam today is characterized by two major river deltas, the [[Red River Delta]] in the north and the [[Mekong Delta]] in the south. In prehistoric times, before the ethnic Vietnamese moved southward, another [[Indianized kingdom]] formed along the coasts north of the Mekong Delta. It was composed of Malayo-Polynesian people and was highly influenced by Indian and Indonesian traders and religious people. This area developed into the kingdom of [[Champa]] which was similar to other Hindu-Buddhist civilizations which were being formed in Indonesia, [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], and [[Cambodia]].\n[[File:Nam Tien.PNG|180px|right|thumb|Map of Vietnam showing the conquest of the south (the ''Nam ti\u1ebfn, 1069\u20131757'')]]\n\n[[Champa]] did not become an established kingdom until 192 AD after which time it became quite advanced with walled cities, books and archives, palaces, and monuments, many of which were built by slaves. [[Cham people|Residents of Champa]] were able to grow two crops of rice per year with a sophisticated system of irrigation which was overseen by a water chief, someone selected to monitor the irrigation ditches and canals. While some cities in Champa remained centers of religion and trade, this kingdom was mostly made up of small territories in river valleys and on coastal plains, each with a local ruler who was seen by his subjects as a representative of the gods. The height of Cham civilization occurred during the 6th to 8th centuries. At this time, much trading occurred between the Chams and the highlanders who needed salt as well as with coastal villages in Vietnam and with China. Important trade items included elephant and rhinoceros tusks, cardamom, bee wax, aromatic woods and [[betel nut]]. However, when times were not going well in the small coastal city-states, the people turned to looting and pirating in other coastal towns of Champa and Vietnam. After centuries of these pirate raids, the Vietnamese began to fight back and eventually conquered Champa, but not before many aspects of Cham society were incorporated into the societies of Vietnam Cham society is organized in a cluster of City-States, not very different from ancient Greece, in contrast of centralized Vietnamese society influenced by China in the north.\n\n===Prehistoric mythology===\nThe movement and changing cultures of early Vietnam are explained through myths which give historians insight into what might have happened in the Dong Son era. The most well-known origin myth says the first Vietnamese people originated from the marriage of a dragon father and a fairy mother who had 100 sons. Because the dragon was a water creature and the fairy was a land creature, they decided they could no longer stay together. The fairy mother took 50 sons to the highlands, and the dragon father took 50 sons to the coast. One of the sons who went with the dragon father became the founder of the Hung Dynasty which is thought to have existed from as early as 2769 BC until 100 AD. The 50 sons who went to the coast are considered to be the people of the Lac Kingdom. According to historians and archaeologists, the Lac people were coastal people who had developed a sophisticated wet rice agricultural society from as early as 1500 BC. The Hungs, as depicted in the mythology, were [[mountain people]] who are believed to have had a reciprocal agreement with the Lac Kingdom so that the Hungs protected the Lacs from aggressive mountain groups in return for rice and other crops grown on the coastal plains of the Red River. These mythological stories, which in many cases can be matched with archaeological remains, tell of the joining of fire and water, or the earth people and the water people. The joining of these two elements has both historical and religious meaning.<ref>[[Paul Mus]], \"Vi\u00eat Nam.

Later this symbol was changed to the dragon following Chinese mythology. These origin myths were not written down by the Vietnamese people until about the 13th century AD, long after the Vietnamese had been colonized by the Chinese.<ref>Thanh H. Vuong, \"Th\u00e9orie des contextes et relations internationales: d\u00e9part de la premi\u00e8re Guerre d'Indochine\", dans \u00c9tudes Internationales, Vol. XVII, No. 3, pp, 571-597, septembre 1986</ref> \n[[File:Hanoi conducteur de pp.jpg|thumb|Rickshaw in [[Hanoi]] in the 19th century]]\nOrigin myths also show how the early Vietnamese people saw themselves in terms of their environment. Since water and sun were the most important elements of nature, they were incorporated into their mythology in a way which gave the people and the elements a common origin. Much of early Vietnamese religion involved nature and human relationships with their surroundings. The early Vietnamese people compared the soil, the water, and the sun to God in [[animism]]. In these elements there was energy which benefited the people and the greater power to help or to destroy. At times this power was compared to that of a child who may cause great destruction without even realizing it. In the earliest times people believed in ghosts and spirits which were thought to dwell in every tree, stone, mountain, cloud, stream, and animal. Rocks and mountains were thought to be able to multiply. These spirits were said to be the wandering souls of the dead, the ancestors of the people who had settled nearby. This type of religion is known as an ancestor cult. Because the ancestor spirits were the medium between living people and the greater forces of nature, they had to be honored in rituals and sacrifices in order to maintain harmony between the elements, the spirits, the ancestors, and the people. Later, as the Vietnamese people were converted to [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and then [[Confucianism]] by the Chinese, most villagers maintained these original beliefs\u2014especially those involving [[ancestor cult]] and incorporated them into the new religions. This is an example of \"creative borrowing\" by a people while their own culture remains a strong underlying force.<ref>Thanh H.

In 208 BC, [[Zhao Tuo]], a former [[Qin dynasty]] general from China, allied with the leaders of the Yue in the area of modern-day [[Guangdong]] and declared himself king of the [[Nanyue]] \"Southern Yue\". He defeated An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng and combined \u00c2u L\u1ea1c with his territories in southern China.\n\n==Diaspora==\n{{Main|Overseas Vietnamese}}\n[[File:San Jose Tet parade, 2009.jpg|thumb|Vietnamese [[T\u1ebft|New Year]] parade, San Jose, California]]\nOriginally from northern Vietnam and southern China, the Vietnamese have conquered much of the land belonging to the former [[Champa]] Kingdom and [[Khmer Empire]] over the centuries. They are the dominant ethnic group in most provinces of Vietnam, and constitute a significant portion of the population of [[Cambodia]].\n\nBeginning around the sixteenth century, groups of Vietnamese migrated to Cambodia and China for commerce and political purposes. Descendants of Vietnamese migrants in China form the [[Gin people|Gin]] ethnic group in the country and primarily reside in and around [[Guangxi Province]].

There was also a significant representation of Vietnamese students in France during this period, primarily consisting of members of the elite class. A large number of Vietnamese also migrated to France as workers, especially during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], when France recruited soldiers and locals of its colonies to help with war efforts in Metropolitan France.

The majority of Vietnamese is '''Kinh people''' ({{lang|vi|ng\u01b0\u1eddi Kinh}}) who are an [[East Asian]] [[ethnic group]] native to present-day northern [[Vietnam]] and southern China, their [[nation state]]. They speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the most widely spoken [[Austroasiatic language]]. They comprised 85% of the population of the country at the 2019 census, and are officially known as '''Kinh''' to distinguish them from other ethnic groups of Vietnam. The earliest recorded name for the ancient Vietnamese people appears as ''[[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t|L\u1ea1c]]'' or ''[[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t]].\n \nAlthough Vietnam geographically and linguistically considered Southeast Asian, the Vietnamese are within the [[East Asian cultural sphere]] due to the [[Chinese domination of Vietnam]]. They are culturally most similar to neighboring southern Han Chinese subgroups and southern Chinese ethnic minorities intermediate to them. The word ''Vi\u1ec7t'' derives from ''[[Baiyue|B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t]]'' ('Baiyue' in Chinese) and ''Nam'' means \"south\". \"Baiyue\" was a name used by the [[Han Chinese]] in ancient times to describe various southern non-Chinese peoples. Together, Vietnam means \"to the south of the Viet\", as Vietnam is located south of the ''[[Baiyue|B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t]]''.\n\n==Origins==\nWritten history knows the ancient Vietnamese people first simply as the L\u1ea1c or [[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t]], and the country of [[Vietnam]] as [[V\u0103n Lang]]. Archaeological evidence of the [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture]] (also known as Lac Society) is the result of society from the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nThe Vietnamese or Kinh people are an Austroasiatic people and lived originally in the area of today northern Vietnam and southeastern China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/991634/filename/Ferlus2009_Dongsonian_JSEALS.pdf|title=HAL-SHS - Sciences de l'Homme et de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 - Accueil|website=hal.archives-ouvertes.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref> From there, several Austroasiatic tribes migrated to Southeast Asia and parts of today Indonesia and eastern India.

SarDesai claimed that Vietnamese people were thought for a long time to have come from [[Tibet]], but SarDesai said that more modern hypotheses indicate that the today Vietnamese people are a mixture of northern and southern mongoloid groups. SarDesai said that today Vietnamese are a mix of the [[Baiyue|Yue]](Viet) people and some [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] people(see [[Cham people]]).

They married and had one hundred eggs, from which hatched one hundred children. Their eldest son ruled as the [[H\u00f9ng king]].\n\n===First Vietnamese===\nHistorians believe that the earliest Vietnamese people gradually moved from the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago through the Malay Peninsula and Thailand until they settled on the edges of the Red River in the Tonkin Delta.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Archaeologists follow a path of stone tools from the Late [[Pleistocene]] across Java, Malaysia, Thailand and north to Myanmar. These stone tools are thought to be the first human tools used in Southeast Asia. Archaeologists believe that at this time the Himalayas, a chain of mountains in northern Myanmar and China, created an icy barrier which isolated the people of Southeast Asia. During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (25,000-18,000 BCE), ocean levels dropped significantly. This resulted in the exposure of the shallow areas surrounding the coasts and islands of Southeast Asia - today known as the [[Sunda Shelf]].\n\nIt is generally thought{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that the exposed Sunda Shelf looked like a giant salt plain, and that perhaps people ventured out across this area to settle on other coasts or islands. Later, when the glaciers melted, the Sunda Shelf again disappeared under water. Because it is a relatively shallow body of water, it has always provided a safe area for traders and travelers in small boats to pass safely without the threat of high or choppy seas. In this way, the geography of the area has had a lot to do with the way in which cultures developed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} As the map indicates, outside the Sunda Shelf are deep ocean basins which were not often crossed until heavier and wider Chinese vessels (massive vessels from the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279), which dwarfed later European man-of-war sailing ships) could traverse these deep and sometimes dangerous seas.\n\nAs the glaciers melted and the seas near these coasts rose, traders and other travelers who wanted to migrate to other areas, or perhaps to proselytize religion, used boats as transport. For the next 4,000 years, until 8000 BCE, people also moved across the mainland of Southeast Asia towards the Tonkin Delta, some stopping and settling along the way. Eventually, the descendants of these migratory peoples entered the Neolithic Age (from around 8000-800 BCE), when humans started to use simple stone tools.  Remains of these people and the [[Hoabinhian]] culture have been found in the H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh Caves along the Red River and in the Tonkin Delta. In the [[Neolithic#Middle Neolithic|Middle Neolithic]] Period (2500\u20132000 BCE), more people appeared in the area of present-day Vietnam and settled at another location called [[B\u1eafc S\u01a1n District|B\u1eafc S\u01a1n]], in a central area of the Tonkin Delta. These people were probably somewhat taller and lighter-skinned than the Hoabinhian [[negrito]]s; they excelled in the art of [[basket weaving]] as well as in the manufacturing and use of polished double-edged stone tools.\n\n===Earlier Vietnamese groups===\n[[File:World 500 BCE showing Van Lang.png|right|thumb|Map of [[V\u0103n Lang]], 500&nbsp;BC]]\nSometime after the advent of the societies found at H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh and B\u1eafc S\u01a1n, another group of people developed a culture in what is modern [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]], where an aspect of their religion was manifested in large mounds of mollusk shells which had been collected from the [[Red River Delta]]. Bodies had been buried under these piles of shells in a seated position with bent knees - in the same position as many buried bodies found throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. This signifies to archaeologists that these early people had an advanced society based on fishing and that their religion was oriented toward the sea. At a location further south of the [[Tonkin]] Delta, in the central region of Vietnam's coast, remains of another culture have been found at Sa Hu\u1ef3nh. The [[Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture]] existed from about 4000 to 1000 BCE. Tools, ornamental beads, and funerary jars have also been found at these archaeological sites. These jars were usually located at the water's edge and probably signified a dead person's journey out to sea.\n\nThroughout Southeast Asia, the Neolithic Period can be considered the period in which organized societies developed. During this period the Vietnamese people spread across a large area from the foothills of the [[Annamite Range]] to the eastern coast of [[Northern Vietnam]]. It is thought that they lived in small communities with groups of extended families living in a simple communal way. The growing of rice, their staple food, had developed into two distinct methods, shifting cultivation, done on a dry field, usually in upland areas, and wet rice cultivation, which involved the construction of dikes around rivers that collected water into knee-deep ponds in which the rice was grown.\n\n===Cultural and historical influences===\n\n====North====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}} \nBefore the Chinese actually annexed Vietnam, groups from present-day southern China began to move into the Tonkin Delta<!--What is the Tonkin Delta?--> in order to start new lives after being forced to leave their homelands. Thus, around the 3rd century BC, changes in China began to heavily influence the [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture]] which was thriving in Vietnam. One important series of changes occurred along the Yangtze River in southern China. According to historians, in 333 BC, three cultures, the [[Shu (state)|Shu]], the Ch'u, and the [[Yue (state)|Yueh]] began to fight among themselves, causing the Yueh to move south in small scattered kingdoms. At the same time, the central power of northern China, the Ch'in Dynasty, began to split so that a large number of princes and members of the aristocracy also moved south to start their own small kingdoms. [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] \u8d8a gave the name \"[[Viet]]\".\n[[File:Town Dress of Women from Tonkin, Woman from Tonkin, Cult Objects, Riflemen from Tonkin.JPG|thumb|People of [[Tonkin]], 1861-1880]]\nThe people of the Red River civilizations, also known as Lac society, began to feel the effects of these newcomers who gradually moved into their homelands. Many historians believe that it was not difficult for the Yueh to be incorporated into Lac society. However, the Au Lac lords began to fight with the Ch'in princes. While they were involved in this fighting, another group from the northwest, the Thuc (who had once been the Shu of the Yangtze River) took advantage of weakness in the area and asserted their authority. The legendary [[C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel]], the remains of which can still be seen today. [[An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng]]'s arrival explains the origins of the legendary [[\u00c2u L\u1ea1c]] kingdom which is usually associated with the height of \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture. [[Vietnamese language]] may be representative of these influences.\n\n====South====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}\nVietnam today is characterized by two major river deltas, the [[Red River Delta]] in the north and the [[Mekong Delta]] in the south. In prehistoric times, before the ethnic Vietnamese moved southward, another [[Indianized kingdom]] formed along the coasts north of the Mekong Delta. It was composed of Malayo-Polynesian people and was highly influenced by Indian and Indonesian traders and religious people. This area developed into the kingdom of [[Champa]] which was similar to other Hindu-Buddhist civilizations which were being formed in Indonesia, [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], and [[Cambodia]].\n[[File:Nam Tien.PNG|180px|right|thumb|Map of Vietnam showing the conquest of the south (the ''Nam ti\u1ebfn, 1069\u20131757'')]]\n\n[[Champa]] did not become an established kingdom until 192 AD after which time it became quite advanced with walled cities, books and archives, palaces, and monuments, many of which were built by slaves. [[Cham people|Residents of Champa]] were able to grow two crops of rice per year with a sophisticated system of irrigation which was overseen by a water chief, someone selected to monitor the irrigation ditches and canals. While some cities in Champa remained centers of religion and trade, this kingdom was mostly made up of small territories in river valleys and on coastal plains, each with a local ruler who was seen by his subjects as a representative of the gods. The height of Cham civilization occurred during the 6th to 8th centuries. At this time, much trading occurred between the Chams and the highlanders who needed salt as well as with coastal villages in Vietnam and with China. Important trade items included elephant and rhinoceros tusks, cardamom, bee wax, aromatic woods and [[betel nut]]. However, when times were not going well in the small coastal city-states, the people turned to looting and pirating in other coastal towns of Champa and Vietnam. After centuries of these pirate raids, the Vietnamese began to fight back and eventually conquered Champa, but not before many aspects of Cham society were incorporated into the societies of Vietnam Cham society is organized in a cluster of City-States, not very different from ancient Greece, in contrast of centralized Vietnamese society influenced by China in the north.\n\n===Prehistoric mythology===\nThe movement and changing cultures of early Vietnam are explained through myths which give historians insight into what might have happened in the Dong Son era. The most well-known origin myth says the first Vietnamese people originated from the marriage of a dragon father and a fairy mother who had 100 sons. Because the dragon was a water creature and the fairy was a land creature, they decided they could no longer stay together. The fairy mother took 50 sons to the highlands, and the dragon father took 50 sons to the coast. One of the sons who went with the dragon father became the founder of the Hung Dynasty which is thought to have existed from as early as 2769 BC until 100 AD. The 50 sons who went to the coast are considered to be the people of the Lac Kingdom. According to historians and archaeologists, the Lac people were coastal people who had developed a sophisticated wet rice agricultural society from as early as 1500 BC. The Hungs, as depicted in the mythology, were [[mountain people]] who are believed to have had a reciprocal agreement with the Lac Kingdom so that the Hungs protected the Lacs from aggressive mountain groups in return for rice and other crops grown on the coastal plains of the Red River. These mythological stories, which in many cases can be matched with archaeological remains, tell of the joining of fire and water, or the earth people and the water people.

Later this symbol was changed to the dragon following Chinese mythology. These origin myths were not written down by the Vietnamese people until about the 13th century AD, long after the Vietnamese had been colonized by the Chinese.<ref>Thanh H. Vuong, \"Th\u00e9orie des contextes et relations internationales: d\u00e9part de la premi\u00e8re Guerre d'Indochine\", dans \u00c9tudes Internationales, Vol. XVII, No. 3, pp, 571-597, septembre 1986</ref> \n[[File:Hanoi conducteur de pp.jpg|thumb|Rickshaw in [[Hanoi]] in the 19th century]]\nOrigin myths also show how the early Vietnamese people saw themselves in terms of their environment. Since water and sun were the most important elements of nature, they were incorporated into their mythology in a way which gave the people and the elements a common origin. Much of early Vietnamese religion involved nature and human relationships with their surroundings. The early Vietnamese people compared the soil, the water, and the sun to God in [[animism]]. In these elements there was energy which benefited the people and the greater power to help or to destroy. At times this power was compared to that of a child who may cause great destruction without even realizing it. In the earliest times people believed in ghosts and spirits which were thought to dwell in every tree, stone, mountain, cloud, stream, and animal. Rocks and mountains were thought to be able to multiply. These spirits were said to be the wandering souls of the dead, the ancestors of the people who had settled nearby. This type of religion is known as an ancestor cult. Because the ancestor spirits were the medium between living people and the greater forces of nature, they had to be honored in rituals and sacrifices in order to maintain harmony between the elements, the spirits, the ancestors, and the people. Later, as the Vietnamese people were converted to [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and then [[Confucianism]] by the Chinese, most villagers maintained these original beliefs\u2014especially those involving [[ancestor cult]] and incorporated them into the new religions. This is an example of \"creative borrowing\" by a people while their own culture remains a strong underlying force.<ref>Thanh H.

They are the dominant ethnic group in most provinces of Vietnam, and constitute a significant portion of the population of [[Cambodia]].\n\nBeginning around the sixteenth century, groups of Vietnamese migrated to Cambodia and China for commerce and political purposes.

There was also a significant representation of Vietnamese students in France during this period, primarily consisting of members of the elite class. A large number of Vietnamese also migrated to France as workers, especially during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], when France recruited soldiers and locals of its colonies to help with war efforts in Metropolitan France. The wave of migrants to France during World War I formed the first major presence of Vietnamese people in France and the Western world.<ref name=diaspora>[http://eglasie.mepasie.org/divers-horizons/1995-10-16-la-diaspora-vietnamienne-en-france-un-cas La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000103/http://eglasie.mepasie.org/divers-horizons/1995-10-16-la-diaspora-vietnamienne-en-france-un-cas |date=2013-12-03 }} (in French)</ref>\n\nWhen Vietnam gained its independence from France in 1954, a number of Vietnamese loyal to the colonial government also migrated to France.

He was influenced by [[rock and roll]] and the early works of [[The Beatles]], which led to him playing in several rock groups in the 1960s such as [[The Rockin' Vickers]]. He worked as a [[Road crew|roadie]] for [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Nice]] before joining the [[space rock]] band [[Hawkwind]] in 1971, singing lead vocals on their hit \"[[Silver Machine]]\". In 1975, he was fired from Hawkwind after an arrest for drug possession; that same year, he became the founder, lead singer, bassist, and songwriter of Mot\u00f6rhead. The band's success peaked around 1980 and 1981, including the hit single \"[[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]]\" and the chart-topping live album ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]''.\n\nLemmy continued to record and tour regularly with Mot\u00f6rhead until his death on 28 December 2015 in [[Los Angeles]], where he had lived since 1990. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer two days before his death. Alongside his music career, he had minor roles and cameos in film and television.

By chance, the bass player didn't show up and left his equipment in the van. He often said, \"Their bass player was pretty much saying 'please steal my gig!' So I stole his gig.\" Lemmy quickly developed a distinctive style that was strongly shaped by his early experience as a rhythm guitarist, often using [[double stop]]s and chords rather than the single note lines preferred by most bassists. His bass work was a distinctive part of the Hawkwind sound during his tenure, perhaps best documented on the double live album ''[[Space Ritual]]''. He also provided the lead vocals on several songs, including the band's biggest UK chart single, \"[[Silver Machine]]\", which reached #3 in 1972.\n\nIn May 1975, during a North American tour, Lemmy was arrested at the Canadian border in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Ontario, on drug possession charges.

He was influenced by [[rock and roll]] and the early works of [[The Beatles]], which led to him playing in several rock groups in the 1960s such as [[The Rockin' Vickers]]. He worked as a [[Road crew|roadie]] for [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Nice]] before joining the [[space rock]] band [[Hawkwind]] in 1971, singing lead vocals on their hit \"[[Silver Machine]]\". In 1975, he was fired from Hawkwind after an arrest for drug possession; that same year, he became the founder, lead singer, bassist, and songwriter of Mot\u00f6rhead. The band's success peaked around 1980 and 1981, including the hit single \"[[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]]\" and the chart-topping live album ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]''.\n\nLemmy continued to record and tour regularly with Mot\u00f6rhead until his death on 28 December 2015 in [[Los Angeles]], where he had lived since 1990. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer two days before his death. Alongside his music career, he had minor roles and cameos in film and television. He was well known for his hard-living lifestyle, which included [[chain-smoking]] and the daily consumption of high amounts of alcohol and [[amphetamine]]s.\n\n== Early life ==\nLemmy was born on 24 December 1945 in the [[Burslem]] area of [[Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire]].{{sfn|Kilmister|Garza|2012|p=5}}<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2009/09/08/lemmy_book_feature.shtml |title=Lemmy: White Line Fever |date=8 September 2009 |website=[[BBC News]] Stoke and Staffordshire |access-date=22 August 2014}}</ref> When he was three months old, his father, an ex-[[Royal Air Force]] chaplain and concert pianist,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Overkill: The Story of Motorhead |first=Joel |last=McIver |publisher=Omnibus Press |date=2011 |isbn=978-1-84938-619-7}}</ref> separated from his mother.

He had no previous experience as a bass guitarist, and was cajoled into joining immediately before a benefit gig in [[Notting Hill]] by bandmate Michael \"Dik Mik\" Davies, to have two members who enjoyed amphetamines.{{sfn|Kilmister|Garza|2012|p=71}} Lemmy states that he originally auditioned for Hawkwind as a guitarist, but on the morning of the Notting Hill gig, they decided not to get another guitarist. By chance, the bass player didn't show up and left his equipment in the van. He often said, \"Their bass player was pretty much saying 'please steal my gig!' So I stole his gig.\" Lemmy quickly developed a distinctive style that was strongly shaped by his early experience as a rhythm guitarist, often using [[double stop]]s and chords rather than the single note lines preferred by most bassists. His bass work was a distinctive part of the Hawkwind sound during his tenure, perhaps best documented on the double live album ''[[Space Ritual]]''. He also provided the lead vocals on several songs, including the band's biggest UK chart single, \"[[Silver Machine]]\", which reached #3 in 1972.\n\nIn May 1975, during a North American tour, Lemmy was arrested at the Canadian border in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Ontario, on drug possession charges. The border police mistook the [[amphetamine]] he was carrying for cocaine and he spent five days in jail before being released without charge.

Lemmy and Took were friends, and Took was the stepfather to Lemmy's son Paul.

The linguist Mei W. Lee-Smith calls this the \"Tangwang language\" ({{lang-zh|\u5510\u6c6a\u8bdd}}), based on the names of the two largest villages (Tangjia and Wangjia, parts of Tangwang [[Towns of China|Town]]) where it is spoken and argues it is a [[creole language|creolized language]].\n<ref name=lee>{{citation |last1=Lee-Smith|first1=Mei W. |contribution=The Tangwang language |author2=International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1996 |isbn=978-3-11-013417-9 |title=Atlas of languages of intercultural communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas, Volume 2, Part 1.

Besides Dongxiang loanwords, Tangwang also has a substantial number of Arabic and Persian loanwords.<ref name=lee/>\n\nLike Standard Mandarin, Tangwang is a tonal language, but grammatical particles, which are typically borrowed from Mandarin, but are used in the way Dongxiang morphemes would be used in Dongxiang, don't carry tones.<ref name=lee/>\n\nFor example, while the Mandarin plural suffix ''-men'' (\u4eec) has only very restricted usage (it can be used with personal pronouns and some nouns related to people),  Tangwang uses it, in the form ''-m'', universally, the way Dongxiang would use its plural suffix ''-la''. Mandarin pronoun ''ni'' (\u4f60) can be used in Tangwang as a possessive suffix (meaning \"your\").\nUnlike Mandarin, but like Dongxiang, Tangwang has grammatical cases as well (however only four of them, unlike eight in Dongxiang).<ref name=lee/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Bao\n|first=Saren

The linguist Mei W. Lee-Smith calls this the \"Tangwang language\" ({{lang-zh|\u5510\u6c6a\u8bdd}}), based on the names of the two largest villages (Tangjia and Wangjia, parts of Tangwang [[Towns of China|Town]]) where it is spoken and argues it is a [[creole language|creolized language]].\n<ref name=lee>{{citation |last1=Lee-Smith|first1=Mei W. |contribution=The Tangwang language |author2=International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1996 |isbn=978-3-11-013417-9 |title=Atlas of languages of intercultural communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas, Volume 2, Part 1.

Besides Dongxiang loanwords, Tangwang also has a substantial number of Arabic and Persian loanwords.<ref name=lee/>\n\nLike Standard Mandarin, Tangwang is a tonal language, but grammatical particles, which are typically borrowed from Mandarin, but are used in the way Dongxiang morphemes would be used in Dongxiang, don't carry tones.<ref name=lee/>\n\nFor example, while the Mandarin plural suffix ''-men'' (\u4eec) has only very restricted usage (it can be used with personal pronouns and some nouns related to people),  Tangwang uses it, in the form ''-m'', universally, the way Dongxiang would use its plural suffix ''-la''. Mandarin pronoun ''ni'' (\u4f60) can be used in Tangwang as a possessive suffix (meaning \"your\").\nUnlike Mandarin, but like Dongxiang, Tangwang has grammatical cases as well (however only four of them, unlike eight in Dongxiang).<ref name=lee/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Bao\n|first=Saren (\u5305\u8428\u4ec1)\n|year=2006\n|script-title=zh:\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u89e6\u770b\u4e1c\u4e61\u8bed\u548c\u4e34\u590f\u8bdd\u7684\u8bed\u5e8f\u53d8\u5316\n|trans-title=Sequential Changes in Dongxiang Language and Linxia Dialects from the View of Linguistic Contact\n|journal=Journal of the Second Northwest University for Nationalities (Social Science Edition)\n|issue=2\n|issn=1008-2883\n|url=http://www.ilib2.com/A-ISSN~1008-2883(2006)02-0035-05.html\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713010344/http://www.ilib2.com/A-ISSN~1008-2883(2006)02-0035-05.html\n|archive-date=2011-07-13\n}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Cheng\n|first=Joyce\n|date=2013-05-10\n|title=Dongxiang \u2013 people of the northwest\n|website=GBTIMES\n|url=http://gbtimes.com/life/dongxiang-people-northwest\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428013606/http://gbtimes.com/life/dongxiang-people-northwest\n|archive-date=2016-04-28\n}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Field\n|first=Kenneth Lynn\n|year=1997\n|title=A grammatical overview of Santa Mongolian\n|series=PhD dissertation\n|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara\n|url=http://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/Field_Santa.pdf\n}}\n* {{citation\n|author=People's Daily\n|date=2012-08-08\n|title=Chinese Ethnic Groups\uff1a\u4e1c\u4e61\u65cf\uff08D\u014dngxi\u0101ng z\u00fa \uff09The Dongxiang ethnic minority\n|url=http://cn.hujiang.com/new/p411605\n|access-date=2016-02-12\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Baker\n|first=Craig\n|date=April 2000\n|title=The Dongxiang Language and People\n|url=http://journal.acs-cam.org.uk/data/archive/2013/201302-article4.pdf\n|access-date=2016-02-12\n|url-status=dead\n}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Chuluu\n|first=\u00dcjiyediin (Chaolu Wu)\n|date=November 1994\n|title=Introduction, Grammar, and Sample Sentences for Dongxiang\n|publisher=University of Pennsylvania\n|location=Philadelphia, PA\n|series=SINO-PLATONIC \n|url=http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp055_dongxiang_language.pdf\n}}\n* {{citation\n|last1=Jorigt\n|first1=G.\n|last2=Stuart\n|first2=Kevin\n|year=1998\n|title=Problems Concerning Mongolian Case\n|journal=Central Asiatic Journal\n|volume=42\n|issue=1\n|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag\n|pages=110\u2013122\n|jstor=41928140\n}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Kim\n|first=Stephen S.\n|chapter=Santa\n|pages=346\u2013363\n|year=2003\n|title=The Mongolic Languages\n|editor-last=Janhunen\n|editor-first=Juha\n|series=Routledge Language Family Series\n|isbn=978-0-203-98791-9\n}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Ma\n|first=Guozhong (\u9a6c\u56fd\u5fe0)\n|year=2001\n|script-title=zh:\u4e1c\u4e61\u8bed\u6c49\u8bed\u8bcd\u5178\n|trans-title=Dongxiang-Chinese Dictionary\n|publisher=Gansu Nationalities Publishing House (\u7518\u8083\u6c11\u65cf\u51fa\u7248\u793e)\n|location=Lanzhou\n|isbn=978-7-5421-0767-1\n}}\n* {{citation\n|last1=Wei\n|first1=Li Xue\n|title=Population and Culture of the Mongols, Tu, Baoan, Dongxiang, and Yugu in Gansu\n|last2=Stuart\n|first2=Kevin\n|year=1989\n|journal=Mongolian Studies\n|volume=12\n|issue=The Owen Lattimore Memorial Issue\n|publisher=Mongolia Society\n|pages=71\u201393\n|jstor=43194234\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~corff/im/Sprache/Dongxiang.html The Dongxiang Mongols and Their Language]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7hJFFXWf0I An example of the Dongxiang language being spoken]\n\n{{Languages of China}}\n{{Mongolic languages}}\n\n[[Category:Agglutinative languages]]\n[[Category:Languages of China]]\n[[Category:Southern Mongolic languages]]\n[[Category:Dongxiang people]]\n[[Category:Subject\u2013object\u2013verb languages]]\n", "name_user": "SiDeD127", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_language"}

This occurred at the twilight of the Yuan dynasty. East Linxia was described as a land of \"thorns and yellow earth\". The author estimated a number of 100,000 Mongolian Muslims.

This occurred at the twilight of the Yuan dynasty. East Linxia was described as a land of \"thorns and yellow earth\". The author estimated a number of 100,000 Mongolian Muslims.

They are known as the Duor by other communities occupying the savanna lands of the [[White Nile]]. The Bari speak the [[Bari language]] as a mother tongue, which belongs to the [[Nilotic]] family.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Richard Buchta - Bari men II.jpg|thumb|Late 1870s portrait of Bari man]]\n[[File:Richard Buchta - Bari homestead.jpg|thumb|Bari homestead late 1870s]]\nThe Bari of the Nile are sedentary agro-pastoralist. They exploit the [[savanna]] lands along the river Nile, and up to 40 miles east and west of the Nile. The Bari economy is based on subsistence [[mixed farming]]; their domestic livestock (small and large) are mainly raised for supplementing food, but mostly as a socio-economic and financial investment. Notably, livestock are exchanged as gifts in marriages, and other social functions or sacrificed in celebrations, and funerals; and whenever the need arises they are sold for cash.\n\nThe Bari are consistently under pressure: now from modern urbanization annexing their green lands and infusing different cultures into their lifestyles; and historically the Baris have been devastated by [[slave traders]], and forced by Belgians (especially from the [[Lado Enclave]]) into labor camps and used as porters to carry ivory tusks to the Atlantic coast. The two [[Sudanese Civil War (disambiguation)|Sudanese Civil War]]s (1955\u20131973; 1983\u20132005) have also affected the Bari social, economic and financial dynamics.\n\nWar (intertribal or resisting foreigners) is not alien to Bari history. Generally, the Bari have co-existed well with the neighboring ethnic groups, but have had to pick up arms to defend their land against slave traders, and plundering warriors. There is documentation of Bari resistance against invasion by [[Dinka]], [[Azande]] (Zande), and numerous encounters with [[Turkish people|Turkish]] slave traders.\n\nTraditionally the Baris believe in one almighty God and existence of powerful spirits (good and evil). Today the Bari's demography is made up of Christians (Catholics and Protestants), Muslims, and followers of traditional religions (not organized).\n\nIn the past it was a fashion among the Bari to undergo initiation ceremonies. Both boys and girls subjected themselves to removal of lower front teeth. The girls, in addition got tattoos: around the belly area, the flank, the back, and the face (on the temple) in the form of arrow shapes, or simple flowers.\n\nAlong the banks of the Nile, in the heart of the Bari land, lies the historical villages of Mongalla, [[Lado, South Sudan|Lado]], [[Gondokoro]] (Kondokoro), and [[Rejaf]] (Rageef). The capital city of [[South Sudan]], the town of [[Juba]], is also in the Bari land, situated ten miles to the south of Gondokoro, and seven miles to the north of Rejaf.\n\n==Origin of the Bari==\nBased on Bari folklore, the Bari people settled in their current lands prior to the end of the grand trans-migration in Africa. By the time the [[Luo (family of ethnic groups)|Luo]] ethnic groups invaded and migrated through the Bari lands about 1650, the Bari were already sedentary agro-pastoralists, living, and trading with the neighboring ethnic groups.\n\n==Bari forced into slavery==\nThe second Expedition to discover the source of the White Nile entered the Bari lands on 24 January 1841. Unfortunately with this progress in the quest for knowledge, came undesirable invaders in the form of European and Turkish traders looking for slaves and ivory. This was the first time Bari encountered Europeans travellers. The Bari were lucky in this encounter, as the Turkish army assigned to protect the Nile explorers behaved, unlike the brutality they unleashed on the ethnic groups ([[Mondari]], Dinka, [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]]) to the north of the Bari, [[pojulu Tribe|Pojulu]], Kakwa to the South and [[Kuku people|Kuku]] to the South-East. However, subsequent expeditions were different.\n\nThe third expedition (1841\u201342) to discover the source of the White Nile also discovered that Ivory was abundant in the Bari area. From thence onwards, the rush for ivory tusks in the White Nile valley escalated. Initially, both European and Arab traders began sponsoring trips to Gondokoro for ivory. And for a decade the Bari freely sold ivory tusks and other artefacts to the traders without intimidation, and no incidents of slavery was reported by that point in time.\n\nIn April 1854, the peaceful relationship between the traders/explorers and the Bari came to an end when a Turkish trader, without provocation, fired his guns into a crowd of Bari at [[Gondokoro]]. Accordingly, the Bari mounted a counterattack that was devastating to both sides. Subsequent to this the Bari became defensive and less friendly, and the traders (mostly Arabs, and Turks) resorted to violent means to procure ivory tusks, but also started taking people (young men and women) as slaves. Girls were raped, or taken as wives by force. Some of the merchants even built fortified depots near Gondokoro where people were kept awaiting shipment down the White Nile.\n\nDiaries of European missionaries{{which|date=July 2015}} in the region, indicate that in the market of Cairo (Egypt), the number of slaves to be sold to Europe from the White Nile area increased from 6,000 between 1858 and 1862, to approximately 12,000-15,000 per annum. These numbers reflected mostly, Bari, Dinka, and Mundari; but also included people of other ethnic groups neighboring the Bari, and beyond were hunting for elephant tusks was intense during that time. By 1863 when Sir [[Samuel White Baker]] arrived at Gondokoro, also on an expedition to discover the sources of the Nile, boats of buccaneers (even one flying an American flag) were anchoring at Gondokoro, with the sole purpose of picking up slaves to the new world. By 1865 about 3000 slaves at any one time could be found waiting at Gondokoro to be carried down the Nile.\n\nBaker returned in 1869 with the express purpose of stamping out the slave trade. By this time, the Bari people and land were already devastated. Bari folklore tells us of how long ago the land flanking the Nile was full of strings of villages spread out to the horizon, as far as the eye could see. Baker concurs, in his book \"Ismailia\" (1874),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Sir Samuel White, Pasha|title=Ismailia, A Narrative of the Expedition to Central Africa for the Suppression of the Slave Trade|url=https://archive.org/details/ismailianarrativ02bakeiala|date=1874|publisher=Macmillan and Co.}}</ref> that this had been so when he first visited the area. However he describes how, by the time of his next expedition, the slave traders had reduced the Bari villages to a miserable few. Neither could he obtain co-operation from the Bari, who had been persuaded by Abou Saood, the chief slaver of Agad and Company, who had a government monopoly for trade and slaving, that it was in their best interests to help the slavers and hinder Baker.\n\nEver since then, recovery has been difficult, considering also the fact that the civil wars in 1955-1973; and 1983-2005 have further taken their toll on the Bari.\n\n==Courtship and marriage==\nIn the past, it was not uncommon for the Bari to use intermarriage to form bonds between two families. Although these [[arranged marriage|arrangements]] were sometimes made when the children were very young, the [[bride price]] was not necessarily paid until the betrothed children reached marrying age.  Today, marriage among the Bari more often involves a period of courtship followed by consent of the families involved.\n\nAfter a period of courtship, the male suitor usually declares his intent to marry (''nyara'' in [[Bari language|Bari]]) by presenting himself at the house of the girl's parents, accompanied by a few close relatives and friends. Before the wedding ceremony (''budu'', typically several months later), the families meet in the bride's parents' house to negotiate the bride price that the bridegroom is obligated to offer; the parents of the bride and bridegroom are never directly involved in these negotiations, though they may be involved indirectly and behind the scenes.  Because the Bari have long been agro-[[pastoralism|pastoralists]], the bride price is traditionally paid in the form of live animals. A typical bride price might be composed of two dozen cattle and 40 head of sheep and goats.  When the use of animals is too difficult, such as in the case of drought or natural disaster, bride prices in the form of cash may also be acceptable.  Behaviors considered disrespectful may increase the bride price during negotiations (though it is also possible for civil courts to get involved); these can include premarital sex, eloping, and aggression towards in-laws.  Once the negotiations are successful, both families bless the marriage and commence in a feast that involves drinking and dancing. After the feast, the bridegroom returns home alone, but after about two weeks, the bride arrives to take charge of her house.\n\nFor Bari who have converted to Christianity, an additional step occurs wherein the marriage also receives a church blessing. Ideally, this would occur before the husband and wife begin living together.  However, because of the financial burden of having both a Bari traditional wedding feast ''and'' a Christian wedding ceremony, the trend has been to first have the traditional feast and then put off the Christian wedding for a year or longer while the couple saves up money for the occasion.  This can be problematic when couples do not also wait to have children, which may be perceived as producing children out of wedlock.  While the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u201365) declaration opened the door for adaptation of some African traditional practices into the church, this has not yet led to the formation of a single wedding ceremony for Bari Christians.\n\n==Bari language==\nThe Bari people speak the [[Bari language]] as a mother tongue. It belongs to the [[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern Nilotic]] subdivision of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family.<ref name=\"Ethnbfa\">{{cite web|title=Bari|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/bfa|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nBari is a [[tone language]]. It has [[vowel harmony]], subject-verb-object word order, and agglutinative verbal morphology with some suppletion.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Bari people}}\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Bari (tribe)}}\n*Crabites, Pierre.

They are known as the Duor by other communities occupying the savanna lands of the [[White Nile]]. The Bari speak the [[Bari language]] as a mother tongue, which belongs to the [[Nilotic]] family.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Richard Buchta - Bari men II.jpg|thumb|Late 1870s portrait of Bari man]]\n[[File:Richard Buchta - Bari homestead.jpg|thumb|Bari homestead late 1870s]]\nThe Bari of the Nile are sedentary agro-pastoralist. They exploit the [[savanna]] lands along the river Nile, and up to 40 miles east and west of the Nile. The Bari economy is based on subsistence [[mixed farming]]; their domestic livestock (small and large) are mainly raised for supplementing food, but mostly as a socio-economic and financial investment. Notably, livestock are exchanged as gifts in marriages, and other social functions or sacrificed in celebrations, and funerals; and whenever the need arises they are sold for cash.\n\nThe Bari are consistently under pressure: now from modern urbanization annexing their green lands and infusing different cultures into their lifestyles; and historically the Baris have been devastated by [[slave traders]], and forced by Belgians (especially from the [[Lado Enclave]]) into labor camps and used as porters to carry ivory tusks to the Atlantic coast. The two [[Sudanese Civil War (disambiguation)|Sudanese Civil War]]s (1955\u20131973; 1983\u20132005) have also affected the Bari social, economic and financial dynamics.\n\nWar (intertribal or resisting foreigners) is not alien to Bari history.
