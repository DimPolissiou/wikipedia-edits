After erasing mob witness Johnny Casteleone ([[Robert Pastorelli]]), Kruger is given a new assignment by his boss, Chief Arthur Beller ([[James Coburn]]), to protect Lee Cullen ([[Vanessa L. Williams]]), a senior executive at Cyrez Corporation, a defense contractor. Lee warned the FBI that top-level Cyrez executives covered up the creation of a top secret [[Railgun|electromagnetic pulse rifle]] and plan to sell the weapon on the black market.\n\nIn an FBI sting operation, Lee accesses the Cyrez mainframe and downloads data on the EM rifle onto two discs: one for the FBI and one for her own protection. Vice President William Donohue ([[James Cromwell]]), her boss, detects Lee's intrusion and orders her into his office. After finding Lee's hidden camera and threatening her with a pistol, Donohue commits suicide in front of her. Lee delivers the disc to the FBI but, disillusioned by their broken promise to guarantee her safety, refuses Kruger's protection offer. The FBI's disc is replaced with a fake by a mole working for [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] Daniel Harper ([[Andy Romano]]), the conspiracy's mastermind.\n\nThat night, Lee's house is attacked by a mercenary team led by J. Scar ([[Mark Rolston]]) sent by Cyrez' corrupt CEO, Eugene Morehart ([[Gerry Becker]]). Kruger rescues Lee and hides her in [[New York City]], keeping her location secret even from WITSEC. Kruger learns from his mentor, Marshal Robert DeGuerin ([[James Caan]]), that several witnesses have been murdered because a mole in WITSEC is leaking information and they must relocate their witnesses. Along with Agents Calderon ([[Nick Chinlund]]) & Schiff ([[Michael Papajohn]]) & newcomer Deputy Monroe ([[Danny Nucci]]), they raid a remote cabin and kill mercenaries holding DeGuerin's witness hostage, but DeGuerin discreetly kills her when the mercenary leader reveals DeGuerin as the mole. Flying back to DC, Kruger, now suspicious of DeGuerin, warns Lee to relocate. DeGuerin drugs Kruger long enough to trace the warning call to NYC and kill Monroe using Kruger's gun, framing him as the mole. Revealing he, Calderon, and Schiff are corrupt, DeGuerin explains he is the go-between for the black market buyer, and Kruger [[HALO jump|escapes]] from the plane to rescue Lee from DeGuerin's mercenaries. Kruger saves Cullen from Scar at [[Central Park Zoo]], who pursues them; Kruger releases several alligators that devour Scar and other mercenaries. DeGuerin has Kruger and Lee branded as fugitives.\n\nKruger and Lee enlist Casteleone's help and penetrate the Cyrez building. Using a mainframe backdoor in Donohue's terminal, they decrypt Lee's second disc. It reveals that a huge shipment of EM rifles is at the [[Baltimore]] docks and will be delivered to [[Russian Mafia]] boss Sergei Ivanovich Petrofsky ([[Olek Krupa]]), who plans to sell the weapons overseas to [[terrorism|terrorists]]. A Cyrez operative pinpoints their whereabouts and remotely destroys the disc; DeGuerin kidnaps Lee and takes her to the docks as the shipment is being loaded onto Petrofsky's Russian freighter.\n\nCasteleone contacts his mobster cousin Tony Two-Toes ([[Joe Viterelli]]) & his two associates to help Kruger raid the docks. They kill Petrovsky, his henchmen, and DeGuerin's mercenaries. In a struggle atop a shipping container, DeGuerin holds Lee hostage, but Kruger frees her and destroys the lock on the [[container crane]], dropping DeGuerin and the container to the ground and exposing the presence of the EM rifles. Kruger rescues the critically wounded DeGuerin, leaving him to be detained by Beller and the authorities and proving his and Lee's innocence.\n\nWeeks later, Kruger brings Lee to a hearing for DeGuerin, Harper, and Morehart, who are indicted for treason. With little confidence that her testimony could secure their convictions, Kruger and Lee publicly fake their deaths in a car explosion. In the back of a limo, DeGuerin congratulates Harper on their deaths and says that they should go back into black-market business as soon as possible, but looks astonished when Harper says that he assumed DeGuerin had killed them. The men are confused, then shocked as their limo stops on a train track and the driver \u2013 actually Casteleone \u2013 locks the doors and exits the vehicle. Kruger calls DeGuerin and tells him, \"You've just been erased\" as they see a train heading right for them. They can't escape before the train slams into the limo, killing all three. Kruger waves goodbye to Casteleone and walks over to Lee in a waiting car, telling her \"they caught a train.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as US Marshal John Kruger\n* [[James Caan]] as US Marshal Robert DeGuerin\n* [[Vanessa Williams]] as Lee Cullen\n* [[James Coburn]] as WITSEC Chief Arthur Beller\n* [[Robert Pastorelli]] as Johnny Casteleone\n* [[James Cromwell]] as William Donohue, Vice President of International Division at Cyrez and Cullen's supervisor \n* [[Danny Nucci]] as WITSEC Deputy Monroe\n* [[Andy Romano]] as [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] Daniel Harper\n* [[Joe Viterelli]] as Tony Two-Toes\n* [[Olek Krupa]] as Sergei Ivanovich Petrovsky\n* [[Gerry Becker]] as Eugene Morehart\n* [[Nick Chinlund]] as Agent Calderon\n* [[Michael Papajohn]] as Agent Schiff\t\n* [[K.

The film follows a U.S Marshal of WITSEC who protects a senior operative testifying about an illegal arms deal and is forced to fight his former allies when one of the players is revealed to be a mole inside WITSEC.\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $242 million against a budget of $100 million. It received mixed reviews from critics, but they praised Williams and Schwarzenegger's performances, the action sequences and the visual effects. It was released in the United States on June 21, 1996 and was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]] in 1997. It was also one of the first major films released on [[DVD]], being part of the Japanese launch lineup of [[Warner Home Video]]'s debut of the format on December 20, 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videodiscovery.com/vdyweb/dvd/dvdfaq.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970329103433/http://www.videodiscovery.com/vdyweb/dvd/dvdfaq.html|title=DVD Frequently Asked Questions (with answers!)|accessdate=October 17, 2019|first=Jim|last=Taylor|work=Video Discovery|date=March 21, 1997|archivedate=March 29, 1997|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Kruger ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) \u2013 a top [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] for the [[WITSEC|Witness Security Protection Program]] (WITSEC) \u2013 specializes in \"erasing\" high-profile witnesses: faking their deaths to protect them from anyone that might silence them. After erasing mob witness Johnny Casteleone ([[Robert Pastorelli]]), Kruger is given a new assignment by his boss, Chief Arthur Beller ([[James Coburn]]), to protect Lee Cullen ([[Vanessa L. Williams]]), a senior executive at Cyrez Corporation, a defense contractor. Lee warned the FBI that top-level Cyrez executives covered up the creation of a top secret [[Railgun|electromagnetic pulse rifle]] and plan to sell the weapon on the black market.\n\nIn an FBI sting operation, Lee accesses the Cyrez mainframe and downloads data on the EM rifle onto two discs: one for the FBI and one for her own protection. Vice President William Donohue ([[James Cromwell]]), her boss, detects Lee's intrusion and orders her into his office. After finding Lee's hidden camera and threatening her with a pistol, Donohue commits suicide in front of her. Lee delivers the disc to the FBI but, disillusioned by their broken promise to guarantee her safety, refuses Kruger's protection offer. The FBI's disc is replaced with a fake by a mole working for [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] Daniel Harper ([[Andy Romano]]), the conspiracy's mastermind.\n\nThat night, Lee's house is attacked by a mercenary team led by J. Scar ([[Mark Rolston]]) sent by Cyrez' corrupt CEO, Eugene Morehart ([[Gerry Becker]]). Kruger rescues Lee and hides her in [[New York City]], keeping her location secret even from WITSEC. Kruger learns from his mentor, Marshal Robert DeGuerin ([[James Caan]]), that several witnesses have been murdered because a mole in WITSEC is leaking information and they must relocate their witnesses. Along with Agents Calderon ([[Nick Chinlund]]) & Schiff ([[Michael Papajohn]]) & newcomer Deputy Monroe ([[Danny Nucci]]), they raid a remote cabin and kill mercenaries holding DeGuerin's witness hostage, but DeGuerin discreetly kills her when the mercenary leader reveals DeGuerin as the mole. Flying back to DC, Kruger, now suspicious of DeGuerin, warns Lee to relocate. DeGuerin drugs Kruger long enough to trace the warning call to NYC and kill Monroe using Kruger's gun, framing him as the mole. Revealing he, Calderon, and Schiff are corrupt, DeGuerin explains he is the go-between for the black market buyer, and Kruger [[HALO jump|escapes]] from the plane to rescue Lee from DeGuerin's mercenaries. Kruger saves Cullen from Scar at [[Central Park Zoo]], who pursues them; Kruger releases several alligators that devour Scar and other mercenaries. DeGuerin has Kruger and Lee branded as fugitives.\n\nKruger and Lee enlist Casteleone's help and penetrate the Cyrez building. Using a mainframe backdoor in Donohue's terminal, they decrypt Lee's second disc. It reveals that a huge shipment of EM rifles is at the [[Baltimore]] docks and will be delivered to [[Russian Mafia]] boss Sergei Ivanovich Petrofsky ([[Olek Krupa]]), who plans to sell the weapons overseas to [[terrorism|terrorists]]. A Cyrez operative pinpoints their whereabouts and remotely destroys the disc; DeGuerin kidnaps Lee and takes her to the docks as the shipment is being loaded onto Petrofsky's Russian freighter.\n\nCasteleone contacts his mobster cousin Tony Two-Toes ([[Joe Viterelli]]) & his two associates to help Kruger raid the docks. They kill Petrovsky, his henchmen, and DeGuerin's mercenaries. In a struggle atop a shipping container, DeGuerin holds Lee hostage, but Kruger frees her and destroys the lock on the [[container crane]], dropping DeGuerin and the container to the ground and exposing the presence of the EM rifles. Kruger rescues the critically wounded DeGuerin, leaving him to be detained by Beller and the authorities and proving his and Lee's innocence.\n\nWeeks later, Kruger brings Lee to a hearing for DeGuerin, Harper, and Morehart, who are indicted for treason. With little confidence that her testimony could secure their convictions, Kruger and Lee publicly fake their deaths in a car explosion. In the back of a limo, DeGuerin congratulates Harper on their deaths and says that they should go back into black-market business as soon as possible, but looks astonished when Harper says that he assumed DeGuerin had killed them. The men are confused, then shocked as their limo stops on a train track and the driver \u2013 actually Casteleone \u2013 locks the doors and exits the vehicle. Kruger calls DeGuerin and tells him, \"You've just been erased\" as they see a train heading right for them. They can't escape before the train slams into the limo, killing all three. Kruger waves goodbye to Casteleone and walks over to Lee in a waiting car, telling her \"they caught a train.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as US Marshal John Kruger\n* [[James Caan]] as US Marshal Robert DeGuerin\n* [[Vanessa Williams]] as Lee Cullen\n* [[James Coburn]] as WITSEC Chief Arthur Beller\n* [[Robert Pastorelli]] as Johnny Casteleone\n* [[James Cromwell]] as William Donohue, Vice President of International Division at Cyrez and Cullen's supervisor \n* [[Danny Nucci]] as WITSEC Deputy Monroe\n* [[Andy Romano]] as [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] Daniel Harper\n* [[Joe Viterelli]] as Tony Two-Toes\n* [[Olek Krupa]] as Sergei Ivanovich Petrovsky\n* [[Gerry Becker]] as Eugene Morehart\n* [[Nick Chinlund]] as Agent Calderon\n* [[Michael Papajohn]] as Agent Schiff\t\n* [[K.

The action took place in the waters off the west coast of [[Brittany]] on 16\u201317 June 1795 (28\u201329 Prairial an III of the [[French Republican Calendar]]).\n\nA British naval squadron under Vice-Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] began operating off Brittany on 7 June; in the following week he attacked a French merchant convoy and captured several ships. In response, Vice-amiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] led the main French fleet out of port to attack the British, who were spotted on 16 June. Heavily outnumbered, Cornwallis turned away from the French and attempted to escape into open water, with the French fleet in pursuit. After a full day's chase the British squadron lost speed, due to poorly loaded holds on two of their ships, and the French vanguard pulled within range on the morning of 17 June. Unwilling to abandon his rearguard, Cornwallis counter-attacked with the rest of his squadron. A fierce combat developed, culminating in Cornwallis interposing his flagship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}} between the British and French forces.\n\nCornwallis's determined resistance, and his squadron's signals to a group of unknown ships spotted in the distance, led Villaret de Joyeuse to believe that the main British [[Channel Fleet]] was approaching. Villaret therefore broke off the battle on the evening of 17 June and ordered his ships to withdraw. This allowed Cornwallis to escape; he returned to port at [[Plymouth]] with his squadron battered but intact. Villaret withdrew to an anchorage off [[Belle \u00cele]], close to the naval base at [[Brest, France|Brest]]. The French fleet was discovered there by the main British Channel Fleet on 22 June and defeated at the ensuing [[Battle of Groix]], losing three ships of the line. Villaret was criticised by contemporaries for failing to press the attack on Cornwallis's force, whilst the British admiral was praised and rewarded for his defiance in the face of overwhelming French numerical superiority. The battle has since been considered by British historians to be one of the most influential examples \"of united courage and coolness to be found in [British] naval history\".<ref name=\"EPB230\"/>\n\n==Background==\nBy the late spring of 1795 Britain and France had been at war for more than two years, with the British [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Channel Fleet]], known at the time as the \"Western Squadron\" exerting superiority in the campaign for dominance in the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the [[Western Approaches]].<ref name=\"RG16\"/> The British, led first by [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] and then by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Lord Bridport]] sailing from their bases at [[Plymouth]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Torbay]], maintained an effective distant [[blockade]] against the French naval bases on the Atlantic, especially the large harbour of [[Brest, France|Brest]] in [[Brittany]].<ref name=\"RG46\">Gardiner, p. 46</ref> Although French squadrons could occasionally put to sea without interception, the main French fleet had suffered a series of setbacks in the preceding two years, most notably at the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]] in 1794 at which the fleet lost seven [[ships of the line]] and then during the ''[[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]]'' during the winter of 1794\u20131795 when five ships of the line were wrecked during a sortie into the Bay of Biscay at the height of the Atlantic winter storm season.<ref name=\"RG16\">Gardiner, p. 16</ref>\n\nThe damage the French Trans-Atlantic fleet had suffered in the winter operation took months to repair and it was not in a condition to sail again until June 1795, although several squadrons had put to sea in the meanwhile. One such squadron consisted of three ships of the line and a number of frigates under Contre-Amiral [[Jean Gaspard Vence]] sent to [[Bordeaux]] to escort a merchant convoy up the coast to Brest.<ref name=\"WLC255\">Clowes, p. 255</ref> The British Channel Fleet had briefly sortied from Torbay in February in response to the ''Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver'' and subsequently retired to [[Spithead]], from where a squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates were sent on 30 May to patrol the approaches to Brest and to watch the French fleet. The force consisted of the 100-gun [[first-rate]] ship of the line [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|HMS ''Royal Sovereign'']], the 74-gun ships of the line [[HMS Mars (1794)|HMS ''Mars'']], [[HMS Triumph (1764)|HMS ''Triumph'']], [[HMS Brunswick (1790)|HMS ''Brunswick'']] and [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']], the frigates [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|HMS ''Phaeton'']] and [[HMS Pallas (1793)|HMS ''Pallas'']] and the small [[brig|brig-sloop]] [[HMS Kingfisher (1782)|HMS ''Kingfisher'']], under the overall command of Vice-Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] in ''Royal Sovereign''.<ref name=\"WJ237\">James, p. 237</ref> Cornwallis was a highly experienced naval officer who had been in service with the Navy since 1755 and fought in the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American Revolutionary War]], including the significant naval victories over the French at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in 1759 and the [[Battle of the Saintes]] in 1782.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==Operations off Belle \u00cele==\nCornwallis led his squadron southwest, rounding [[Ushant]] on the night of 7\u20138 June and cruising southwards down the Breton coast past the [[Penmarch|Penmarck]] Rocks.<ref name=\"WJ237\"/> At 10:30 that morning, Captain [[Erasmus Gower|Sir Erasmus Gower]] on ''Triumph'' signalled that he could see six sails to the northeast. Cornwallis turned the squadron to investigate, and discovered the small squadron under Vence in command of a large merchant convoy. Vence initially held his course when Cornwallis's squadron appeared, in the belief that they were French. When he realised his mistake at 12:00, he ordered his ships to make all sail towards the anchorage in the shelter of the fortified island of [[Belle \u00cele]].<ref name=\"EPB229\">Brenton, p. 229</ref> Vence's squadron made rapid progress towards the anchorage, but Cornwallis had sent his faster ships ahead, ''Phaeton'', ''Kingfisher'' and ''Triumph'' in the lead, while ''Brunswick'', which had been badly loaded when at anchor in Spithead and thus was unable to sail smoothly, fell far behind.<ref name=\"WJ237\"/> The leading British ships were able to fire on Vence's force at a distance, and attacked the trailing merchant ships and their frigate escorts, forcing a French frigate to abandon a merchant ship it had under tow, but could not bring Vence to action without the support of the slower vessels in Cornwallis's squadron.<ref name=\"WLC256\">Clowes, p. 256</ref>  As a result, all of the French warships and all but eight of the merchant vessels were safely anchored at Belle \u00cele. ''Triumph'' and ''Phaeton'' both advanced on the anchored ships, but came under heavy fire from batteries on the island and found that the water was too shallow and the passage too uncertain to risk their ships. ''Phaeton'' lost one man killed and seven wounded before Cornwallis called off the attack.<ref name=\"LG1\"/>\n\nTaking his eight prizes laden with wine and brandy, Cornwallis retired to the sheltered anchorage of Palais Road, close to Belle \u00cele, where the squadron remained until 9 June. In the evening, Cornwallis took advantage of a fresh breeze to sail his ships out into the Bay of Biscay and around the Ushant headland, reaching the [[Scilly Isles]] on 11 June and sending ''Kingfisher'' back to Spithead with the French prizes and two American merchant ships seized in French waters.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13790|page=655|date=23 June 1795}}</ref> Cornwallis then ordered the squadron to turn back to the blockade of Brest in the hope of encountering Vence in more favourable circumstances. At Brest, messages had arrived warning that Vence and the convoy were \"blockaded\" at Belle \u00cele and the French commander was instructed to rescue him. In fact, as was pointed out by a number of officers in the French fleet including Vice-amiral [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Tr\u00e9marec|Kerguelen]], the anchorage at Belle \u00cele could never be effectively blockaded as it was too open to block all potential approaches and too close to the major port of [[Lorient]] and therefore a rescue was unnecessary.<ref name=\"WJ238\">James, p. 238</ref> This advice was ignored, and Vice-amiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] sailed from Brest on 12 June with the ships that were anchored in Brest Roads ready for sea. Villaret's fleet consisted of nine ships of the line, nine frigates (including two ships of the line [[razee]]d into 50-gun frigates) and four [[corvette]]s.<ref name=\"WLC256\"/>\n\nOn 15 June, the French fleet encountered Vence's squadron sailing off the island of [[Groix]] near [[Lorient]], and the two joined, Vence having sent the remainder of his convoy safely to Brest while Villaret was ''en route''. Turning north back towards Brest, the French fleet was off Penmarck Point at 10:30 on 16 June with the wind in the northwest, when sails were spotted to the northwest.<ref name=\"WJ238\"/> This force was Cornwallis's squadron, returning to Belle \u00cele in search of Vence. Sighting his numerically inferior opponent to windward, Villaret immediately ordered his fleet to advance on the British force while Cornwallis, anticipating Vence's merchant convoy and not immediately apprehending the danger his squadron was in, sent ''Phaeton'' to investigate the sails on the horizon.<ref name=\"NT121\">Tracy, p. 121</ref>\n\n==Retreat==\n[[File:First Battle of Groix PU5491.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|''Admiral Cornwallis's Retreat from the French Fleet'', 1802, [[National Maritime Museum]]|alt=]]\n{{See also|Order of Battle in the Biscay campaign of June 1795}}\nCaptain [[Robert Stopford (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Stopford]] on ''Phaeton'' signaled to Cornwallis that the French fleet contained 30 vessels, but did not return to join Cornwallis, causing the British admiral to misunderstand the signal to mean that the French ships, while more numerous than his own, were of inferior strength. Under this misapprehension, Cornwallis, who could only see the ship's sails rather than their hulls, ordered his squadron to advance on the French fleet.<ref name=\"NT121\"/> Stopford subsequently signaled the exact composition of Villaret's fleet at 11:00 and Cornwallis, realising his error, issued urgent orders for his squadron to haul away to the southwest, [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]] to starboard in an effort to escape pursuit with ''Brunswick'' leading the line, followed by ''Royal Sovereign'', ''Bellerophon'', ''Triumph'' and ''Mars''.<ref name=\"WLC257\">Clowes, p. 257</ref>  ''Phaeton'' was sent to scout ahead, while ''Pallas'' was ordered to keep company with ''Royal Sovereign'' in order to relay Cornwallis's signals to the rest of the squadron.<ref name=\"LG2\"/> Villaret had immediately ordered his fleet to give chase, and the French followed the British south westwards into the Atlantic, taking advantage of the strengthening wind.<ref name=\"EPB229\"/>\n\nAt 14:00 Villaret split his forces, one division sailing northwards to take advantage of the breeze coming off the land, while the other maintained passage to the south. Cornwallis tacked his squadron at 06:00 and 17:00, but Villaret de Joyeuse's plan worked well and a shift in the wind at 18:00 allowed the northern squadron to weather and the southern to lay up, the British squadron now lying directly between them about {{convert|9|nmi|km}} from either French division.<ref name=\"WJ239\">James, p. 239</ref> During the night the chase continued into the Atlantic, the British squadron struggling to maintain formation due to the slow speed of two members: ''Brunswick''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sailing deficiencies had already been noted, but it became clear that ''Bellerophon'' was similarly suffering. In an effort to decrease the weight of the ships and thus increase their speed and allow them to keep pace with the rest of the squadron, captains [[Lord Charles Fitzgerald]] and [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Lord Cranstoun]] ordered the anchors, boats and much of the provisions and fresh water carried aboard to be thrown over the side: ''Bellerophon'' was sailing so slowly that Cranstoun even ordered four [[carronades]] to be jettisoned with a large amount of roundshot.<ref name=\"WJ239\"/>\n\nDuring the night Villaret had split his forces further, creating a windward division of three ships of the line and five frigates, a centre division of five ships of the line and four frigates and the lee division of four ships of the line, five frigates and three smaller vessels.<ref name=\"WLC257\"/> Of these forces, the weather division was closest to Cornwallis's squadron and at 09:00 the leading French ship ''[[French ship Z\u00e9l\u00e9 (1764)|Z\u00e9l\u00e9]]'' began to fire on the British rearguard ship, ''Mars'' under Captain [[Sir Charles Cotton, 5th Baronet|Sir Charles Cotton]]. Cotton returned fire with his [[Chase gun|stern-chasers]], but was unable to prevent the 40-gun frigate ''[[French frigate Virginie (1794)|Virginie]]'' from approaching his ship's port quarter and firing repeated [[broadside]]s at ''Mars''. The rest of the French frigates held station to windward of the British force without approaching within range.<ref name=\"EPB229\"/> Concerned that ''Bellerophon'', which was close to the developing action, might lose a sail, a loss that Cranstoun would be unable to replace, Cornwallis ordered ''Triumph'' and ''Royal Sovereign'' to fall back and allow ''Bellerophon'' to join ''Brunswick'' in the vanguard.<ref name=\"WJ240\">James, p. 240</ref>\n\n[[File:Cornwallis-IMG 5904.JPG|thumb|First phase: the two squadrons fight each other]]\n[[File:Cornwallis-IMG 5900.jpg|thumb|Second phase: the French attacking HMS ''Mars '']]\n[[File:Cornwallis-IMG 5901.jpg|thumb|Last phase: the French squadron withdrawing]]\nFollowing the reorganisation, the entire British squadron was now within range of the leading French ships, all firing at Villaret's advancing line. To facilitate the positioning of more cannon in the stern of the vessels, the British captains ordered their men to cut holes in the stern planks: so many were cut that several ships needed extensive repairs in the aftermath of the action and ''Triumph'' especially had much of her stern either cut or shot away.<ref name=\"WLC258\">Clowes, p. 258</ref> At 13:30 the British fire achieved some success when ''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'' fell back with damaged rigging, allowing the second French ship to take up the position at the head of the line. This ship, which had been firing distantly on the British force for half an hour, opened a heavy fire on ''Mars'' as did a number of following French ships over the ensuing hours, including [[French ship Droits de l'Homme (1794)|''Droits de l\u2019Homme'']], [[HMS Belleisle (1795)|''Formidable'']] and [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']].<ref name=\"CR207\">Rouvier, p. 207</ref> This combined attack left ''Mars'' badly damaged in the rigging and sails, causing the ship to slow. Cotton's ship now seemed at serious risk of falling into the midst of the French fleet and being overwhelmed, while Captain Gower's ''Triumph'' was also badly damaged by French shot.<ref name=\"WJ240\"/><ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Bates\n  | first =Ian M.\n  | title =Champion of the Quarterdeck: Admiral Sir Erasmus Gower (1742-1814).\n  | publisher = Sage Old Books\n  |year=2017\n  | isbn =9780958702126\n  | pages =209\u2013214 }}</ref> Seeing the danger his rearguard was in, Cornwallis took decisive action, ordering Cotton to turn away from the French and swinging ''Royal Sovereign'' southwards, he led ''Triumph'' to ''Mars''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s rescue, drawing close alongside and engaging the leading French ships with a series of broadsides from his powerful first rate.<ref name=\"WLC257\"/> The raking fire of ''Royal Sovereign'' caused the four French ships closing on ''Mars'' to retreat, and gradually the entire French fleet fell back, distant firing continuing until 18:10 when the French fell out of range, although they continued in pursuit of the battered and weakened British squadron.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>{{Cref2|Note A}}\n\nAt 18:40, suddenly and for no immediately apparent reason, Villaret ordered his ships to haul their wind and turn back towards the east, breaking off contact. By the time the sun set a few hours later, the French had almost disappeared over the eastern horizon as the British continued westwards.<ref name=\"WJ241\">James, p. 241</ref> Although the order to abandon the action has subsequently been much debated, the cause of Villaret's retreat was in fact the actions of the frigate ''Phaeton'', which Cornwallis had sent ahead of the squadron as a scout early on 17 June. After progressing several miles ahead of the British squadron, Stopford had signalled that there were unknown sails to the northwest, followed by signals indicating four ships in sight and then one for a full fleet, highlighted by firing two cannon. Stopford had been careful to ensure that the French ships could see and read his signals, which were in a code that the French were known to have broken, and Villaret knew well that the only French fleet in those waters was the one he led. He therefore assumed that ''Phaeton'' could see the Channel Fleet beyond the northern horizon, a force significantly more powerful than his own.<ref name=\"WLC259\"/> Stopford compounded the ruse at 15:00 by making a string of nonsensical signals to the non-existent fleet before notifying Cornwallis at 16:30, again in plain sight, that the fleet was composed of allied ships of the line. He completed the operation by raising the [[Dutch flag]]  and signalling for the non-existent fleet to join with Cornwallis. It is not clear to what extent Villaret was taken in by this charade, the French fleet continuing their attack without pause, until at 18:00 when a number of sails appeared on the northwest horizon. At this point ''Phaeton'' wore round to return to Cornwallis, and Villaret, now convinced that the strangers, which were in reality a small convoy of merchant vessels, were the vanguard of the Channel Fleet, abandoned the chase.<ref name=\"RW60\">Woodman, p. 60</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"such a retreat . . . reflects as much honour on the abilities of the man who conducted it, as would the achievement of the most splendid victory.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''[[The Naval Chronicle]]'', Vol. VII, pp.&nbsp;20\u201325<ref name=\"NT123\">Tracy, p. 123</ref>\n|}\nWith the French fleet out of sight, Cornwallis ordered his squadron north against the northeast wind, returning through the English Channel to [[Plymouth]] for repairs. ''Phaeton'' was sent ahead with despatches intended to warn Lord Bridport that the French fleet was at sea and inform him of Cornwallis's safety.<ref name=\"WJ243\"/> However, Bridport had already sailed on 12 June with 15 ships of the line as a cover for a secondary force detailed to [[Invasion of France (1795)|land a British and French Royalist army]] at [[Quiberon Bay]], and the main British fleet was already off Brest when the action between Cornwallis and Villaret de Joyeuse was fought.<ref name=\"WJ244\">James, p. 244</ref> The ships of Cornwallis's squadron had all suffered damage, especially ''Triumph'' and ''Mars'': ''Triumph'' had to have extensive repairs to its stern, which had been heavily cut away during the action. Historian [[Edward Pelham Brenton]] credits this action with influencing [[Robert Seppings]] in his future designs of ships of the line, providing rounded sterns that offered a wider field of fire at pursuing warships.<ref name=\"EPB230\"/> Casualties were light however, with just 12 men wounded on ''Mars'' and no other losses on the remainder of the squadron.<ref name=\"WJ241\"/>\n\nThe French fleet was only lightly damaged and had only taken light casualties of 29 men killed and wounded. Villaret continued the fleet's passage eastwards, rounding Penmarck Point and entering [[Audierne]] Bay on the passage north towards Brest when the region was hit by a fierce 27-hour [[gale]], driving the French fleet southwards and dispersing them across the coastline. Over the ensuing days Villaret was able to reconstitute his fleet in the anchorage off Belle \u00cele where Vence had laid up on 8 June.<ref name=\"WLC260\">Clowes, p. 260</ref>  When the fleet was all assembled, Villaret again ordered it to sail north in an effort to regain Brest. His fleet had originally sailed from Brest in such a rush due to the perceived danger to Vence's squadron that it was only carrying 15 days worth of provisions on board and had now been at sea for ten days, making a return to Brest a priority.<ref name=\"WJ238\"/> At 03:30 on 22 June, as the French fleet passed north along the coast, the British Channel Fleet appeared to the northwest, Bridport having discovered the French fleet absent from Brest and cast southwards to protect the Quiberon invasion convoy.<ref name=\"WLC260\"/>\n\nVillaret considered the newly arrived British fleet to be significantly superior to his own and retreated before it, sailing towards the French coast with the intention of sheltering in the protected coastal waters around the island of [[Groix]] and returning to Brest from this position.<ref name=\"WJ245\">James, p. 245</ref> Bridport instructed his fleet to pursue the French force, and a chase developed lasting the day of 22 June and into the early morning of 23 June, when Bridport's leading ships caught the stragglers at the rear of Villaret's fleet off the island. In a sharp engagement known as the [[Battle of Groix]], three ships were overrun and attacked, suffering heavy damage and casualties before surrendering.<ref name=\"WLC263\">Clowes, p. 263</ref> Others were damaged, but at 08:37, with most of his fleet still unengaged and the French scattered along the coast, Bridport suddenly called off the action and instructed his ships to gather their prizes and retire, a decision that was greatly criticised by contemporary officers and later historians.<ref name=\"RW61\">Woodman, p. 61</ref>\n\nIn France, Villaret's failure to press his attack against Cornwallis's squadron was blamed on a number of factors, including accusations that the captains of the French ships leading the attack had deliberately disobeyed orders to engage the British and that they were unable to effectively manoeuvre their vessels.<ref name=\"WLC259\">Clowes, p. 259</ref> It was also insisted by several of the French officers present that the sails on the northwest horizon really had been Bridport's fleet and that this was the only factor that had induced them to disengage.<ref name=\"WJ242\">James, p. 242</ref> Villaret placed much of the blame on Captain [[Jean-Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Aved-Magnac|Jean Magnac]] of ''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'', whom he accused of withdrawing from the action prematurely and disobeying orders. Magnac was later [[court-martial]]ed and dismissed from the French Navy.<ref name=\"CR208\">Rouvier, p. 208</ref> In Britain, the battle was celebrated as one of the most notable actions of the early years of the conflict, an attitude encouraged by the modesty of Cornwallis's dispatch to the [[Admiralty]], which when describing how he had faced down an entire French fleet at the climax of the action wrote only that the French had \"made a Shew of a more ferious attack upon the Mars . . . and obliged me to bear up for her Support {{sic}}.\" He did however subsequently note of his men that\n\n{{quote|\"Indeed I shall ever feel the Impression which the good Conduct of the Captains, Officers, Seamen, Marines and Soldiers in the Squadron has made on my Mind; and it was the greatest Pleasure I ever received to see the Spirit manifested by the Men, who, instead of being cast down at seeing Thirty sail of the Enemy's Ships attacking our little Squadron, were in the highest Spirits imaginable . . .

The action took place in the waters off the west coast of [[Brittany]] on 16\u201317 June 1795 (28\u201329 Prairial an III of the [[French Republican Calendar]]).\n\nA British naval squadron under Vice-Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] began operating off Brittany on 7 June; in the following week he attacked a French merchant convoy and captured several ships. In response, Vice-amiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] led the main French fleet out of port to attack the British, who were spotted on 16 June. Heavily outnumbered, Cornwallis turned away from the French and attempted to escape into open water, with the French fleet in pursuit. After a full day's chase the British squadron lost speed, due to poorly loaded holds on two of their ships, and the French vanguard pulled within range on the morning of 17 June. Unwilling to abandon his rearguard, Cornwallis counter-attacked with the rest of his squadron. A fierce combat developed, culminating in Cornwallis interposing his flagship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}} between the British and French forces.\n\nCornwallis's determined resistance, and his squadron's signals to a group of unknown ships spotted in the distance, led Villaret de Joyeuse to believe that the main British [[Channel Fleet]] was approaching. Villaret therefore broke off the battle on the evening of 17 June and ordered his ships to withdraw. This allowed Cornwallis to escape; he returned to port at [[Plymouth]] with his squadron battered but intact. Villaret withdrew to an anchorage off [[Belle \u00cele]], close to the naval base at [[Brest, France|Brest]]. The French fleet was discovered there by the main British Channel Fleet on 22 June and defeated at the ensuing [[Battle of Groix]], losing three ships of the line. Villaret was criticised by contemporaries for failing to press the attack on Cornwallis's force, whilst the British admiral was praised and rewarded for his defiance in the face of overwhelming French numerical superiority. The battle has since been considered by British historians to be one of the most influential examples \"of united courage and coolness to be found in [British] naval history\".<ref name=\"EPB230\"/>\n\n==Background==\nBy the late spring of 1795 Britain and France had been at war for more than two years, with the British [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Channel Fleet]], known at the time as the \"Western Squadron\" exerting superiority in the campaign for dominance in the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the [[Western Approaches]].<ref name=\"RG16\"/> The British, led first by [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] and then by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Lord Bridport]] sailing from their bases at [[Plymouth]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Torbay]], maintained an effective distant [[blockade]] against the French naval bases on the Atlantic, especially the large harbour of [[Brest, France|Brest]] in [[Brittany]].<ref name=\"RG46\">Gardiner, p. 46</ref> Although French squadrons could occasionally put to sea without interception, the main French fleet had suffered a series of setbacks in the preceding two years, most notably at the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]] in 1794 at which the fleet lost seven [[ships of the line]] and then during the ''[[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]]'' during the winter of 1794\u20131795 when five ships of the line were wrecked during a sortie into the Bay of Biscay at the height of the Atlantic winter storm season.<ref name=\"RG16\">Gardiner, p. 16</ref>\n\nThe damage the French Trans-Atlantic fleet had suffered in the winter operation took months to repair and it was not in a condition to sail again until June 1795, although several squadrons had put to sea in the meanwhile. One such squadron consisted of three ships of the line and a number of frigates under Contre-Amiral [[Jean Gaspard Vence]] sent to [[Bordeaux]] to escort a merchant convoy up the coast to Brest.<ref name=\"WLC255\">Clowes, p. 255</ref> The British Channel Fleet had briefly sortied from Torbay in February in response to the ''Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver'' and subsequently retired to [[Spithead]], from where a squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates were sent on 30 May to patrol the approaches to Brest and to watch the French fleet. The force consisted of the 100-gun [[first-rate]] ship of the line [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|HMS ''Royal Sovereign'']], the 74-gun ships of the line [[HMS Mars (1794)|HMS ''Mars'']], [[HMS Triumph (1764)|HMS ''Triumph'']], [[HMS Brunswick (1790)|HMS ''Brunswick'']] and [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']], the frigates [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|HMS ''Phaeton'']] and [[HMS Pallas (1793)|HMS ''Pallas'']] and the small [[brig|brig-sloop]] [[HMS Kingfisher (1782)|HMS ''Kingfisher'']], under the overall command of Vice-Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] in ''Royal Sovereign''.<ref name=\"WJ237\">James, p. 237</ref> Cornwallis was a highly experienced naval officer who had been in service with the Navy since 1755 and fought in the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American Revolutionary War]], including the significant naval victories over the French at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in 1759 and the [[Battle of the Saintes]] in 1782.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==Operations off Belle \u00cele==\nCornwallis led his squadron southwest, rounding [[Ushant]] on the night of 7\u20138 June and cruising southwards down the Breton coast past the [[Penmarch|Penmarck]] Rocks.<ref name=\"WJ237\"/> At 10:30 that morning, Captain [[Erasmus Gower|Sir Erasmus Gower]] on ''Triumph'' signalled that he could see six sails to the northeast. Cornwallis turned the squadron to investigate, and discovered the small squadron under Vence in command of a large merchant convoy. Vence initially held his course when Cornwallis's squadron appeared, in the belief that they were French. When he realised his mistake at 12:00, he ordered his ships to make all sail towards the anchorage in the shelter of the fortified island of [[Belle \u00cele]].<ref name=\"EPB229\">Brenton, p. 229</ref> Vence's squadron made rapid progress towards the anchorage, but Cornwallis had sent his faster ships ahead, ''Phaeton'', ''Kingfisher'' and ''Triumph'' in the lead, while ''Brunswick'', which had been badly loaded when at anchor in Spithead and thus was unable to sail smoothly, fell far behind.<ref name=\"WJ237\"/> The leading British ships were able to fire on Vence's force at a distance, and attacked the trailing merchant ships and their frigate escorts, forcing a French frigate to abandon a merchant ship it had under tow, but could not bring Vence to action without the support of the slower vessels in Cornwallis's squadron.<ref name=\"WLC256\">Clowes, p. 256</ref>  As a result, all of the French warships and all but eight of the merchant vessels were safely anchored at Belle \u00cele. ''Triumph'' and ''Phaeton'' both advanced on the anchored ships, but came under heavy fire from batteries on the island and found that the water was too shallow and the passage too uncertain to risk their ships. ''Phaeton'' lost one man killed and seven wounded before Cornwallis called off the attack.<ref name=\"LG1\"/>\n\nTaking his eight prizes laden with wine and brandy, Cornwallis retired to the sheltered anchorage of Palais Road, close to Belle \u00cele, where the squadron remained until 9 June. In the evening, Cornwallis took advantage of a fresh breeze to sail his ships out into the Bay of Biscay and around the Ushant headland, reaching the [[Scilly Isles]] on 11 June and sending ''Kingfisher'' back to Spithead with the French prizes and two American merchant ships seized in French waters.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13790|page=655|date=23 June 1795}}</ref> Cornwallis then ordered the squadron to turn back to the blockade of Brest in the hope of encountering Vence in more favourable circumstances. At Brest, messages had arrived warning that Vence and the convoy were \"blockaded\" at Belle \u00cele and the French commander was instructed to rescue him. In fact, as was pointed out by a number of officers in the French fleet including Vice-amiral [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Tr\u00e9marec|Kerguelen]], the anchorage at Belle \u00cele could never be effectively blockaded as it was too open to block all potential approaches and too close to the major port of [[Lorient]] and therefore a rescue was unnecessary.<ref name=\"WJ238\">James, p. 238</ref> This advice was ignored, and Vice-amiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] sailed from Brest on 12 June with the ships that were anchored in Brest Roads ready for sea. Villaret's fleet consisted of nine ships of the line, nine frigates (including two ships of the line [[razee]]d into 50-gun frigates) and four [[corvette]]s.<ref name=\"WLC256\"/>\n\nOn 15 June, the French fleet encountered Vence's squadron sailing off the island of [[Groix]] near [[Lorient]], and the two joined, Vence having sent the remainder of his convoy safely to Brest while Villaret was ''en route''. Turning north back towards Brest, the French fleet was off Penmarck Point at 10:30 on 16 June with the wind in the northwest, when sails were spotted to the northwest.<ref name=\"WJ238\"/> This force was Cornwallis's squadron, returning to Belle \u00cele in search of Vence. Sighting his numerically inferior opponent to windward, Villaret immediately ordered his fleet to advance on the British force while Cornwallis, anticipating Vence's merchant convoy and not immediately apprehending the danger his squadron was in, sent ''Phaeton'' to investigate the sails on the horizon.<ref name=\"NT121\">Tracy, p. 121</ref>\n\n==Retreat==\n[[File:First Battle of Groix PU5491.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|''Admiral Cornwallis's Retreat from the French Fleet'', 1802, [[National Maritime Museum]]|alt=]]\n{{See also|Order of Battle in the Biscay campaign of June 1795}}\nCaptain [[Robert Stopford (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Stopford]] on ''Phaeton'' signaled to Cornwallis that the French fleet contained 30 vessels, but did not return to join Cornwallis, causing the British admiral to misunderstand the signal to mean that the French ships, while more numerous than his own, were of inferior strength. Under this misapprehension, Cornwallis, who could only see the ship's sails rather than their hulls, ordered his squadron to advance on the French fleet.<ref name=\"NT121\"/> Stopford subsequently signaled the exact composition of Villaret's fleet at 11:00 and Cornwallis, realising his error, issued urgent orders for his squadron to haul away to the southwest, [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]] to starboard in an effort to escape pursuit with ''Brunswick'' leading the line, followed by ''Royal Sovereign'', ''Bellerophon'', ''Triumph'' and ''Mars''.<ref name=\"WLC257\">Clowes, p. 257</ref>  ''Phaeton'' was sent to scout ahead, while ''Pallas'' was ordered to keep company with ''Royal Sovereign'' in order to relay Cornwallis's signals to the rest of the squadron.<ref name=\"LG2\"/> Villaret had immediately ordered his fleet to give chase, and the French followed the British south westwards into the Atlantic, taking advantage of the strengthening wind.<ref name=\"EPB229\"/>\n\nAt 14:00 Villaret split his forces, one division sailing northwards to take advantage of the breeze coming off the land, while the other maintained passage to the south. Cornwallis tacked his squadron at 06:00 and 17:00, but Villaret de Joyeuse's plan worked well and a shift in the wind at 18:00 allowed the northern squadron to weather and the southern to lay up, the British squadron now lying directly between them about {{convert|9|nmi|km}} from either French division.<ref name=\"WJ239\">James, p. 239</ref> During the night the chase continued into the Atlantic, the British squadron struggling to maintain formation due to the slow speed of two members: ''Brunswick''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sailing deficiencies had already been noted, but it became clear that ''Bellerophon'' was similarly suffering. In an effort to decrease the weight of the ships and thus increase their speed and allow them to keep pace with the rest of the squadron, captains [[Lord Charles Fitzgerald]] and [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Lord Cranstoun]] ordered the anchors, boats and much of the provisions and fresh water carried aboard to be thrown over the side: ''Bellerophon'' was sailing so slowly that Cranstoun even ordered four [[carronades]] to be jettisoned with a large amount of roundshot.<ref name=\"WJ239\"/>\n\nDuring the night Villaret had split his forces further, creating a windward division of three ships of the line and five frigates, a centre division of five ships of the line and four frigates and the lee division of four ships of the line, five frigates and three smaller vessels.<ref name=\"WLC257\"/> Of these forces, the weather division was closest to Cornwallis's squadron and at 09:00 the leading French ship ''[[French ship Z\u00e9l\u00e9 (1764)|Z\u00e9l\u00e9]]'' began to fire on the British rearguard ship, ''Mars'' under Captain [[Sir Charles Cotton, 5th Baronet|Sir Charles Cotton]]. Cotton returned fire with his [[Chase gun|stern-chasers]], but was unable to prevent the 40-gun frigate ''[[French frigate Virginie (1794)|Virginie]]'' from approaching his ship's port quarter and firing repeated [[broadside]]s at ''Mars''. The rest of the French frigates held station to windward of the British force without approaching within range.<ref name=\"EPB229\"/> Concerned that ''Bellerophon'', which was close to the developing action, might lose a sail, a loss that Cranstoun would be unable to replace, Cornwallis ordered ''Triumph'' and ''Royal Sovereign'' to fall back and allow ''Bellerophon'' to join ''Brunswick'' in the vanguard.<ref name=\"WJ240\">James, p. 240</ref>\n\n[[File:Cornwallis-IMG 5904.JPG|thumb|First phase: the two squadrons fight each other]]\n[[File:Cornwallis-IMG 5900.jpg|thumb|Second phase: the French attacking HMS ''Mars '']]\n[[File:Cornwallis-IMG 5901.jpg|thumb|Last phase: the French squadron withdrawing]]\nFollowing the reorganisation, the entire British squadron was now within range of the leading French ships, all firing at Villaret's advancing line. To facilitate the positioning of more cannon in the stern of the vessels, the British captains ordered their men to cut holes in the stern planks: so many were cut that several ships needed extensive repairs in the aftermath of the action and ''Triumph'' especially had much of her stern either cut or shot away.<ref name=\"WLC258\">Clowes, p. 258</ref> At 13:30 the British fire achieved some success when ''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'' fell back with damaged rigging, allowing the second French ship to take up the position at the head of the line. This ship, which had been firing distantly on the British force for half an hour, opened a heavy fire on ''Mars'' as did a number of following French ships over the ensuing hours, including [[French ship Droits de l'Homme (1794)|''Droits de l\u2019Homme'']], [[HMS Belleisle (1795)|''Formidable'']] and [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']].<ref name=\"CR207\">Rouvier, p. 207</ref> This combined attack left ''Mars'' badly damaged in the rigging and sails, causing the ship to slow. Cotton's ship now seemed at serious risk of falling into the midst of the French fleet and being overwhelmed, while Captain Gower's ''Triumph'' was also badly damaged by French shot.<ref name=\"WJ240\"/><ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Bates\n  | first =Ian M.\n  | title =Champion of the Quarterdeck: Admiral Sir Erasmus Gower (1742-1814).\n  | publisher = Sage Old Books\n  |year=2017\n  | isbn =9780958702126\n  | pages =209\u2013214 }}</ref> Seeing the danger his rearguard was in, Cornwallis took decisive action, ordering Cotton to turn away from the French and swinging ''Royal Sovereign'' southwards, he led ''Triumph'' to ''Mars''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s rescue, drawing close alongside and engaging the leading French ships with a series of broadsides from his powerful first rate.<ref name=\"WLC257\"/> The raking fire of ''Royal Sovereign'' caused the four French ships closing on ''Mars'' to retreat, and gradually the entire French fleet fell back, distant firing continuing until 18:10 when the French fell out of range, although they continued in pursuit of the battered and weakened British squadron.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>{{Cref2|Note A}}\n\nAt 18:40, suddenly and for no immediately apparent reason, Villaret ordered his ships to haul their wind and turn back towards the east, breaking off contact. By the time the sun set a few hours later, the French had almost disappeared over the eastern horizon as the British continued westwards.<ref name=\"WJ241\">James, p. 241</ref> Although the order to abandon the action has subsequently been much debated, the cause of Villaret's retreat was in fact the actions of the frigate ''Phaeton'', which Cornwallis had sent ahead of the squadron as a scout early on 17 June. After progressing several miles ahead of the British squadron, Stopford had signalled that there were unknown sails to the northwest, followed by signals indicating four ships in sight and then one for a full fleet, highlighted by firing two cannon. Stopford had been careful to ensure that the French ships could see and read his signals, which were in a code that the French were known to have broken, and Villaret knew well that the only French fleet in those waters was the one he led. He therefore assumed that ''Phaeton'' could see the Channel Fleet beyond the northern horizon, a force significantly more powerful than his own.<ref name=\"WLC259\"/> Stopford compounded the ruse at 15:00 by making a string of nonsensical signals to the non-existent fleet before notifying Cornwallis at 16:30, again in plain sight, that the fleet was composed of allied ships of the line. He completed the operation by raising the [[Dutch flag]]  and signalling for the non-existent fleet to join with Cornwallis. It is not clear to what extent Villaret was taken in by this charade, the French fleet continuing their attack without pause, until at 18:00 when a number of sails appeared on the northwest horizon. At this point ''Phaeton'' wore round to return to Cornwallis, and Villaret, now convinced that the strangers, which were in reality a small convoy of merchant vessels, were the vanguard of the Channel Fleet, abandoned the chase.<ref name=\"RW60\">Woodman, p. 60</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"such a retreat . . . reflects as much honour on the abilities of the man who conducted it, as would the achievement of the most splendid victory.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''[[The Naval Chronicle]]'', Vol. VII, pp.&nbsp;20\u201325<ref name=\"NT123\">Tracy, p. 123</ref>\n|}\nWith the French fleet out of sight, Cornwallis ordered his squadron north against the northeast wind, returning through the English Channel to [[Plymouth]] for repairs. ''Phaeton'' was sent ahead with despatches intended to warn Lord Bridport that the French fleet was at sea and inform him of Cornwallis's safety.<ref name=\"WJ243\"/> However, Bridport had already sailed on 12 June with 15 ships of the line as a cover for a secondary force detailed to [[Invasion of France (1795)|land a British and French Royalist army]] at [[Quiberon Bay]], and the main British fleet was already off Brest when the action between Cornwallis and Villaret de Joyeuse was fought.<ref name=\"WJ244\">James, p. 244</ref> The ships of Cornwallis's squadron had all suffered damage, especially ''Triumph'' and ''Mars'': ''Triumph'' had to have extensive repairs to its stern, which had been heavily cut away during the action. Historian [[Edward Pelham Brenton]] credits this action with influencing [[Robert Seppings]] in his future designs of ships of the line, providing rounded sterns that offered a wider field of fire at pursuing warships.<ref name=\"EPB230\"/> Casualties were light however, with just 12 men wounded on ''Mars'' and no other losses on the remainder of the squadron.<ref name=\"WJ241\"/>\n\nThe French fleet was only lightly damaged and had only taken light casualties of 29 men killed and wounded. Villaret continued the fleet's passage eastwards, rounding Penmarck Point and entering [[Audierne]] Bay on the passage north towards Brest when the region was hit by a fierce 27-hour [[gale]], driving the French fleet southwards and dispersing them across the coastline. Over the ensuing days Villaret was able to reconstitute his fleet in the anchorage off Belle \u00cele where Vence had laid up on 8 June.<ref name=\"WLC260\">Clowes, p. 260</ref>  When the fleet was all assembled, Villaret again ordered it to sail north in an effort to regain Brest. His fleet had originally sailed from Brest in such a rush due to the perceived danger to Vence's squadron that it was only carrying 15 days worth of provisions on board and had now been at sea for ten days, making a return to Brest a priority.<ref name=\"WJ238\"/> At 03:30 on 22 June, as the French fleet passed north along the coast, the British Channel Fleet appeared to the northwest, Bridport having discovered the French fleet absent from Brest and cast southwards to protect the Quiberon invasion convoy.<ref name=\"WLC260\"/>\n\nVillaret considered the newly arrived British fleet to be significantly superior to his own and retreated before it, sailing towards the French coast with the intention of sheltering in the protected coastal waters around the island of [[Groix]] and returning to Brest from this position.<ref name=\"WJ245\">James, p. 245</ref> Bridport instructed his fleet to pursue the French force, and a chase developed lasting the day of 22 June and into the early morning of 23 June, when Bridport's leading ships caught the stragglers at the rear of Villaret's fleet off the island. In a sharp engagement known as the [[Battle of Groix]], three ships were overrun and attacked, suffering heavy damage and casualties before surrendering.<ref name=\"WLC263\">Clowes, p. 263</ref> Others were damaged, but at 08:37, with most of his fleet still unengaged and the French scattered along the coast, Bridport suddenly called off the action and instructed his ships to gather their prizes and retire, a decision that was greatly criticised by contemporary officers and later historians.<ref name=\"RW61\">Woodman, p. 61</ref>\n\nIn France, Villaret's failure to press his attack against Cornwallis's squadron was blamed on a number of factors, including accusations that the captains of the French ships leading the attack had deliberately disobeyed orders to engage the British and that they were unable to effectively manoeuvre their vessels.<ref name=\"WLC259\">Clowes, p. 259</ref> It was also insisted by several of the French officers present that the sails on the northwest horizon really had been Bridport's fleet and that this was the only factor that had induced them to disengage.<ref name=\"WJ242\">James, p. 242</ref> Villaret placed much of the blame on Captain [[Jean-Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Aved-Magnac|Jean Magnac]] of ''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'', whom he accused of withdrawing from the action prematurely and disobeying orders. Magnac was later [[court-martial]]ed and dismissed from the French Navy.<ref name=\"CR208\">Rouvier, p. 208</ref> In Britain, the battle was celebrated as one of the most notable actions of the early years of the conflict, an attitude encouraged by the modesty of Cornwallis's dispatch to the [[Admiralty]], which when describing how he had faced down an entire French fleet at the climax of the action wrote only that the French had \"made a Shew of a more ferious attack upon the Mars . . . and obliged me to bear up for her Support {{sic}}.\" He did however subsequently note of his men that\n\n{{quote|\"Indeed I shall ever feel the Impression which the good Conduct of the Captains, Officers, Seamen, Marines and Soldiers in the Squadron has made on my Mind; and it was the greatest Pleasure I ever received to see the Spirit manifested by the Men, who, instead of being cast down at seeing Thirty sail of the Enemy's Ships attacking our little Squadron, were in the highest Spirits imaginable . . .

Attachment of the bacteria to host cells can result in loss of [[cilia]], a reduction in [[metabolism]], [[biosynthesis]], and import of [[macromolecules]], and, eventually, infected cells may be shed from the [[epithelial]] lining.<ref name=Waites/> M. pneumoniae produces a unique virulence factor known as Community Acquired Respiratory Distress Syndrome (CARDS) toxin.<ref>{{cite web|title=CDC Mycoplasma Pneumoniae|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pneumonia/atypical/mycoplasma/hcp/disease-specifics.html|website=CDC|publisher=CDC|accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref> The CARDS toxin most likely aids in the colonization and pathogenic pathways of M. pneumoniae, leading to inflammation and airway dysfunction. In addition, the formation of [[hydrogen peroxide]] is a key [[virulence factor]] in ''M. pneumoniae'' infections.<ref name=Waites/> Attachment of ''M. pneumoniae'' to [[erythrocytes]] permits [[diffusion]] of hydrogen peroxide from the bacteria to the host cell without [[detoxification]] by [[catalase]] or [[peroxidase]], which can injure the host cell by reducing [[glutathione]], damaging [[lipid]] membranes and causing [[protein denaturation]].<ref name=Waites/><ref name=\"Sobeslavsky\"/> Local damage may also be a result of [[lactoferrin]] acquisition and subsequent [[hydroxyl radical]], [[superoxide anion]] and [[peroxide]] formation.<ref name=Waites/> The cytotoxic effects of ''M. pneumoniae'' infections translate into common symptoms like [[coughing]] and lung [[irritation]] that may persist for months after infection has subsided. Local [[inflammation]] and hyperresponsiveness by infection induced [[cytokine]] production has been associated with chronic conditions such as [[bronchial asthma]] and has also been linked to progression of symptoms in individuals with [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[COPD]].<ref name=Waites/>\n\n{{see also|Asthma-related microbes}}\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe incidence of disease does not appear be related to season or geography; however, infection tends to occur more frequently during the summer and fall months when other respiratory [[pathogens]] are less prevalent. Reinfection and [[epidemic]] cycling is thought to be a result of P1 adhesin subtype variation.<ref name=Waites/> Approximately 40% of community-acquired [[pneumonia]] is due to ''M. pneumoniae'' infections, with children and elderly individuals being most [[Susceptible individual|susceptible]], however no personal risk factors for acquiring ''M. pneumoniae'' induced pneumonia have been determined.<ref name=Waites/><ref name=Daxboeck>{{cite journal | last1 = Daxboeck | first1 = F. | last2 = Krause | first2 = R. | last3 = Wenisch | first3 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Laboratory diagnosis of ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' infection | url = | journal = Clin.

[[Outbreak]]s of ''M. pneumoniae'' infections tend to occur within groups of people in close and prolonged proximity, including schools, institutions, military bases, and [[households]].<ref name=Waites/>\n\n==Symptoms of infection==\n''M. pneumoniae'' is known to cause a host of symptoms such as [[primary atypical pneumonia]], [[Bronchitis|tracheobronchitis]], and [[Upper respiratory tract infection|upper respiratory tract disease]]. Primary atypical pneumonia is one of the most severe types of manifestation, with tracheobronchitis being the most common symptom and another 15% of cases, usually adults, remain asymptomatic.<ref name=Waites/><ref name=\"Daxboeck\"/> Symptomatic infections tend to develop over a period of several days and manifestation of pneumonia can be confused with a number of other bacterial pathogens and conditions that cause pneumonia. Tracheobronchitis is most common in children due to a reduced immune system capacity, and up to 18% of infected children require [[hospitalization]].<ref name=Waites/> Common mild symptoms include [[sore throat]], [[wheezing]] and [[coughing]], [[fever]], [[headache]], [[rhinitis]], [[myalgia]] and [[Malaise|feelings of unease]], in which symptom intensity and duration can be limited by early treatment with [[antibiotics]]. Rarely, ''M. pneumoniae'' pneumonia results in death due to [[lesions]] and [[ulceration]] of the epithelial lining, [[pulmonary edema]], and [[bronchiolitis obliterans]]. Extrapulmonary symptoms such as autoimmune responses, [[central nervous system]] complications, and [[dermatological]] disorders have been associated with ''M. pneumoniae'' infections in up to 25% of cases.<ref name=Waites/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[Diagnosis]] of ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' infections is complicated by the delayed onset of [[symptoms]] and the similarity of symptoms to other pulmonary conditions. Often, ''M. pneumoniae'' infections are diagnosed as other conditions and, occasionally, non-[[pathogenic]] mycoplasmas present in the respiratory tract are mistaken for ''M. pneumoniae''.<ref name=Waites/> Historically, diagnosis of ''M. pneumoniae'' infections was made based on the presence of cold [[agglutinins]] and the ability of the infected material to reduce [[tetrazolium]]. Causative diagnosis is dependent upon [[laboratory]] testing, however these methods are more practical in [[epidemiological]] studies than in patient diagnosis.<ref name=Waites/> [[Cell culture|Culture]] tests are rarely used as diagnostic tools; rather [[immunoblotting]], [[Immunofluorescence|immunofluorescent]] staining, hemadsorption tests, tetrazolium reduction, [[metabolic]] inhibition tests, [[serological]] assays, and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) are used for diagnosis and characterization of [[Bacterial pneumonia|bacterial pneumonic infections]].<ref name=Waites/> PCR is the most rapid and effective way to determine the presence of ''M. pneumoniae'', however the procedure does not indicate the activity or [[Viability selection|viability]] of the cells present.<ref name=\"Daxboeck\"/> [[Enzyme immunoassay]] (EIA) serological assays are the most common method of ''M. pneumoniae'' detection used in patient diagnosis due to the low cost and relatively short testing time. One drawback of serology is that viable organisms are required, which may overstate the severity of infection.<ref name=Waites/> Neither of these methods, along with others, has been available to medical professionals in a rapid, efficient and inexpensive enough form to be used in routine diagnosis, leading to decreased ability of physicians to diagnose ''M. pneumoniae'' infections.\n\n==Treatment and prevention==\nThe majority of antibiotics used to treat ''M. pneumoniae'' infections are targeted at bacterial [[rRNA]] in [[Ribosome|ribosomal]] complexes, including [[macrolides]], [[tetracycline]], [[ketolides]], and [[fluoroquinolone]], many of which can be administered orally.<ref name=Waites/><ref name=Matsuoka >{{cite journal | last1 = Matsuoka | first1 = M. | last2 = Narita | first2 = M. | last3 = Okazaki | first3 = N. | last4 = Ohya | first4 = H. | last5 = Yamazaki | first5 = T. | last6 = Ouchi | first6 = K. | last7 = Suzuki | first7 = I. | last8 = Andoh | first8 = T. | last9 = Kenri | first9 = T. | last10 = Sasaki | first10 = Y. | last11 = Horino | first11 = A. | last12 = Shintani | first12 = M. | last13 = Arakawa | first13 = Y. | last14 = Sasaki | first14 = T. | year = 2004 | title = Characterization and Molecular Analysis of Macrolide-Resistant ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' Clinical Isolates Obtained in Japan | journal = Antimicrob.

One drawback of serology is that viable organisms are required, which may overstate the severity of infection.<ref name=Waites/> Neither of these methods, along with others, has been available to medical professionals in a rapid, efficient and inexpensive enough form to be used in routine diagnosis, leading to decreased ability of physicians to diagnose ''M. pneumoniae'' infections.\n\n==Treatment and prevention==\nThe majority of antibiotics used to treat ''M. pneumoniae'' infections are targeted at bacterial [[rRNA]] in [[Ribosome|ribosomal]] complexes, including [[macrolides]], [[tetracycline]], [[ketolides]], and [[fluoroquinolone]], many of which can be administered orally.<ref name=Waites/><ref name=Matsuoka >{{cite journal | last1 = Matsuoka | first1 = M. | last2 = Narita | first2 = M. | last3 = Okazaki | first3 = N. | last4 = Ohya | first4 = H. | last5 = Yamazaki | first5 = T. | last6 = Ouchi | first6 = K. | last7 = Suzuki | first7 = I. | last8 = Andoh | first8 = T. | last9 = Kenri | first9 = T. | last10 = Sasaki | first10 = Y. | last11 = Horino | first11 = A. | last12 = Shintani | first12 = M. | last13 = Arakawa | first13 = Y. | last14 = Sasaki | first14 = T. | year = 2004 | title = Characterization and Molecular Analysis of Macrolide-Resistant ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' Clinical Isolates Obtained in Japan | journal = Antimicrob.

Additionally, some high-dose steroid therapies have shown to reverse [[neurological]] effects in children with complicated infections.<ref name=Waites/> \n\nThe difficulty in eradicating ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' infections is due to the ability of the bacterium to persist within an individual, as well as the lack of cell wall in ''M. pneumoniae'', which renders multiple antibiotics directed at the bacterial cell wall ineffective in treating infections.<ref name=Waites/> ''M. pneumoniae'' therefore displays resistance to antimicrobials such as [[Beta-lactam|\u03b2-lactams]], [[glycopeptides]], [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]], [[trimethoprim]], [[polymixins]], [[nalidixic acid]], and [[rifampin]].<ref name=Waites/><ref name=\"Daxboeck\"/> Antimicrobial drug resistance rates for ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' were determined in clinical specimens and isolates obtained during 2011\u20132012 in Ontario, Canada. Of 91 ''M. pneumoniae'' drug-resistant specimens, 11 (12.1%) carried nucleotide mutations associated with [[macrolide]] resistance in the [[23S ribosomal RNA|23S rRNA]] gene.
