Its mandate is to promote free, independent and pluralistic journalism and to defend media workers. Its advocacy is founded on the belief that everyone requires access to the news and information, inspired by Article 19 of the [https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ UN Declaration of Human Rights]that recognises the right to receive and share information regardless of frontiers, along with other international rights charters.<ref>RSF Annual Report 2018, p5 </ref> RSF has consultative status at the [https://www.un.org/en/ United Nations], [https://en.unesco.org/ UNESCO],  the [https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal Council of Europe], and the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/presentation|title=Presentation, Reporters Without Borders (RSF), for freedom of information|last=|first=|date=2016-01-22|website=RSF|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Activities ===\nRSF works on the ground in defence of individual journalists at risk and also at the highest levels of government and international forums to defend the right to freedom of expression and information. It provides daily briefings and press releases on threats to media freedom in French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Farsi and Chinese and publishes an annual press freedom survey, the World Press Freedom Index, that measures the state of media freedom in 180 countries. The organisation provides assistance to journalists at risk and training in digital and physical security, as well as campaigning to raise public awareness of abuse against journalists and to secure their safety and liberty. RSF lobbies governments and international bodies to adopt standards and legislation in support of media freedom and takes legal action in defence of journalists under threat.<ref>RSF Annual Report 2018, pp14-16</ref>\n\n===History===\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge de RSF.jpeg|thumb|Head office in [[Paris]]]]\nRSF was founded in [[Montpellier]], [[France]] in 1985 by [[Robert M\u00e9nard]], R\u00e9my Loury, Jacques Mol\u00e9nat and [https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/occitanie/herault/montpellier-metropole/montpellier/emilien-jubineau-notre-confrere-journaliste-france-3-quitte-antenne-1076913.html \u00c9milien Jubineau].

JTI defines indicators for trustworthy journalism and rewards compliance, bringing tangible benefits for all media outlets and supporting them in creating a healthy space for information. JTI distinguishes itself from similar initiatives by focusing on the process of journalism rather than content alone. Media outlets will be expected to comply with standards that include transparency of ownership, sources of revenue and proof of a range of professional safeguards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-and-partners-launch-public-consultation-journalism-trust-initiative|title=RSF and partners launch a public consultation on the Journalism Trust Initiative|last=|first=|date=2 March 2020|website=RSF|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Actions ===\nRSF's defence of journalistic freedom includes international missions, the publication of country reports, training of journalists and public protests.

It was founded as a rail terminal for the area, and still serves as such. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of the city was 5,105.<ref name=\"FactFinder\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe city was founded in 1880 when the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] came through. It was named after Judge William S. Benson, a friend of [[Charles Crocker]], president of the Southern Pacific.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Benson's History|url = http://www.bensonvisitorcenter.com/history.htm|website = www.bensonvisitorcenter.com|accessdate = 2017-06-24|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160411143947/http://www.bensonvisitorcenter.com/history.htm|archive-date = 2016-04-11|url-status = dead}}</ref> The railroad, coming overland from California, chose the Benson site to cross the [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro River]].  Benson then served as a rail junction point to obtain ore and refined metal by wagon, in turn shipping rail freight back to the mines at [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Fairbank, Arizona|Fairbank]], [[Contention City, Arizona|Contention City]] and [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]]. For example, the railhead in Benson was about {{convert|25|mi}} from Tombstone, and was the closest rail connection to it until 1882, when a feeder line was laid from Benson to Contention City.\n\nThe railhead in Benson was founded about a mile from a traditional crossing of the upper San Pedro River (known also as the Middle Crossing), used by the [[Southern Emigrant Trail]] and [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]].  It was the site of the San Pedro Station of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] and a wagon depot, the San Pedro River Station, run since 1871 by William Ohnesorgen.  In 1878 he had erected a toll bridge over which mining supplies were transported to the new mining camps such as Fairbank and Tombstone. Two years later this bridge marked the location of the railroad bridge that became the terminal site of Benson.\n\n[[Apache Nitrogen Products]] (originally Apache Powder Company) was formed in the 1920s. It was located just outside Benson and was a major employer. Apache Park and nine nearby houses on West 6th Street in Benson, built to house company management, were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1994 as the [[Apache Powder Historic Residential District]].<ref name=\"ndoc\">{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=94000078}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Apache Powder Historic Residential District |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author= |date= |accessdate=February 21, 2020}} With {{NRHP url|id=94000078|photos=y|title=accompanying pictures}}</ref>\n\nThe city today is perhaps best known as the gateway to [[Kartchner Caverns State Park]].

city in [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]], [[Arizona]], [[United States]], {{convert|45|mi}} east-southeast of [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. It was founded as a rail terminal for the area, and still serves as such. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of the city was 5,105.<ref name=\"FactFinder\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe city was founded in 1880 when the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] came through. It was named after Judge William S. Benson, a friend of [[Charles Crocker]], president of the Southern Pacific.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Benson's History|url = http://www.bensonvisitorcenter.com/history.htm|website = www.bensonvisitorcenter.com|accessdate = 2017-06-24|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160411143947/http://www.bensonvisitorcenter.com/history.htm|archive-date = 2016-04-11|url-status = dead}}</ref> The railroad, coming overland from California, chose the Benson site to cross the [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro River]].  Benson then served as a rail junction point to obtain ore and refined metal by wagon, in turn shipping rail freight back to the mines at [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Fairbank, Arizona|Fairbank]], [[Contention City, Arizona|Contention City]] and [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]]. For example, the railhead in Benson was about {{convert|25|mi}} from Tombstone, and was the closest rail connection to it until 1882, when a feeder line was laid from Benson to Contention City.\n\nThe railhead in Benson was founded about a mile from a traditional crossing of the upper San Pedro River (known also as the Middle Crossing), used by the [[Southern Emigrant Trail]] and [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]].  It was the site of the San Pedro Station of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] and a wagon depot, the San Pedro River Station, run since 1871 by William Ohnesorgen.  In 1878 he had erected a toll bridge over which mining supplies were transported to the new mining camps such as Fairbank and Tombstone. Two years later this bridge marked the location of the railroad bridge that became the terminal site of Benson.\n\n[[Apache Nitrogen Products]] (originally Apache Powder Company) was formed in the 1920s. It was located just outside Benson and was a major employer. Apache Park and nine nearby houses on West 6th Street in Benson, built to house company management, were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1994 as the [[Apache Powder Historic Residential District]].<ref name=\"ndoc\">{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=94000078}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Apache Powder Historic Residential District |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author= |date= |accessdate=February 21, 2020}} With {{NRHP url|id=94000078|photos=y|title=accompanying pictures}}</ref>\n\nThe city today is perhaps best known as the gateway to [[Kartchner Caverns State Park]].

Common shapes are flat, rounded edge, and tubular in horizontal railings, whereas tetraform spear-headed or ball-[[finial]]led are most common in vertical railings around homes.  Park and garden railings commonly in [[metalworking]] feature swirls, leaves, plate metal areas and/or [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s particularly on and beside [[gate]]s.\n\nHigh security railings (particularly if in flat metal then a type of [[palisade]]) may instead feature jagged points and most metals are well-suited to [[anti-climb paint]].\n\nA [[handrail]] is less restrictive on its own than a guard rail and provides support.\n\nGuardrails also apply in a technology context.\n\n== Public safety ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Sign in Niagara Falls, Ontario, warning people not to climb over guard rail.jpg|thumb|right|Sign in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], warning people not to climb over guard rail overlooking the [[Niagara River]].]]\n[[File:Cadnant Clapper Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|A handrail leading along a rocky creek crossing]]\n[[File:Partial stadium collapse at Big12 college football championship - 2005.JPG|right|thumb|A crowd barrier (''guard rail'' &mdash; North America) collapses at a [[college football]] game, spilling [[fan (aficionado)|fans]] onto the [[sidelines]].]]\n[[Image:Ironwork.jpg|thumb|A cast iron grille of decorative railings interspersed by weighty columns in St Petersburg]]\n\nMany [[public space]]s are fitted with guard rails as a means of protection against accidental falls. Any abrupt change in elevation where the higher portion is accessible makes a fall possible. Due to this responsibility and liability, rails are placed to protect people using the premises. Guardrails in the US are generally required by code where there is a drop of {{convert|30|in|m}} or more.\n\nExamples of this are both [[architecture|architectural]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]]. Environmental guard rails are placed along [[hiking trail]]s where adjacent terrain is steep. Railings may also be located at scenic overlooks.\n\nGuard rails in [[building]]s can be numerous, and are required by building codes in many circumstances. Handrails along [[stairway]]s are common known as a [[balustrade]] where filled out below, and [[Footbridge#Catwalk|catwalks]] (a type of footbridge) and [[balcony|balconies]] are also lined with them. An example of a common residential guard rail (US) handrail (Brit.) is a wood railing around a deck or patio. In the US this is typically built on-site from pressure treated lumber thus featuring a simplistic design of vertical baluster spaced every 3.5\" demonstrating compliance with Building Codes (Standards). \n\n[[Cable railings]] typically use stainless steel cables strung horizontally. Glass [[balusters]] and glass panels open the view while still providing safety, as at the [[Grand Canyon Skywalk]]. With the increasing popularity of [[composite lumber]] for decking, manufacturers, like TimberTech are providing composite railing components. [[Wrought iron]] is another choice that is traditional and sturdy. Decorative examples are considered [[ironwork]].\n\nBuilding codes also require that no opening in a guard be of a size such that a 4\" sphere may pass. There are three exceptions according to the 2003 [[International Building Code]] Section 1012.3 which allow openings to not exceed 8\" or 21\" depending on occupancy groups or special areas.\n\nA major architect imaginitively used handrails representing social stability, [[Alvar Aalto]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Details of Modern Architecture / vol. 2:1928 to 1988.|date=2003|publisher=The MIT Press|others=Ford, Edward R.|isbn=9780262562027|edition=Di 1 ban|location=Cambridge|pages=133|oclc=966185775}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Bare architecture : a schizoanalysis|last=L.)|first=Smith, Chris (Chris|isbn=9781350015814|location=London|oclc=1002209835|date = 2017-10-19}}</ref> The guard rails of an [[observation tower]] such as the [[Space Needle]] or [[Eiffel Tower]] become exaggerated to the point of becoming a [[fence]] or [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]]. This is also done on [[bridge]]s and [[overpass]]es to prevent [[accident]]s and [[suicide]]s.\n\n== Facility safety ==\n[[File:Idealshield guardrail.jpg|thumb|right|Guardrail protecting expensive machinery]]\nThe majority of safety guardrails used in industrial workplaces are made from fabricated steel. Steel guardrail was originally developed by Armco (The American Rolling Mill Company) in 1933 as highway guardrail but is often used in the factories and warehouses of the industrial sector, despite not being intended for this application.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/armcosteel/timeline|title=Timeline - Armco Steel|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> Simultaneously, another version of steel guardrail was developed by Kee Clamp Steel for restraining cattle in the agriculture industry, this was released in 1934 and, like Armco guardrail, is still often used in industrial environments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roofingcontractor.com/gdpr-policy?url=https://www.roofingcontractor.com/articles/kee-safety-inc-named-to-inc-magazine-s-top-5-000|title=Kee Safety Inc. Named to Inc. Magazine's Top 5,000|website=www.roofingcontractor.com|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\u00a0Box beam steel and I-beam steel are other examples of fabricated steel commonly used to make safety guardrails.\n\nAs governments around the world courted the voting power of working people and trade unions in the 1980s, the health and safety rights of workers became of greater importance. This set the governmental procedures in motion that would see a flurry of regulations and legislation around workplace safety being introduced in industrialized countries in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/timeline/index.htm#a2000|title=HSE: Timeline|website=www.hse.gov.uk|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\u00a0In the US and UK, these introductions, combined with the demonstrable success of the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1970 (US), and Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (UK), led to workplace safety being taken more seriously at industrial facilities. Businesses worldwide began to see the value of effective workplace safety, in both the direct commercial sense of protecting assets, but also in the improved productivity levels of a protected workforce. Part of this increase in desire for industrial workplace protection, was a growth in demand for safety guardrails. \n\nIn the US, under [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] Standard 1910.28(b)(15), employees who work on surfaces that are 4 feet (1.2 m) or higher off of the ground must have personal fall protection systems in place, such as handrails or guardrails.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omegaindl.com/blog/guardrails-vs-handrails|title=Guardrails vs. Handrails for Industrial Workplace Safety|date=2017-07-10|website=Omega Industrial Products|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> Although the OSHA standard calls for a guardrail or guardrail system to protect workers on elevated work areas, current industry terminology would refer to that type of safety system as a handrail system or safety rail system.\n\nThe term \"guardrail\" as used in industry and distribution facilities refers to floor mounted systems consisting of horizontal rails attached to upright posts that resemble outdoor highway guardrail. The facility safety guardrails control in-plant vehicular traffic and protect areas where errant vehicle contact may cause harm to property or personnel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boplan.com/en/4-reasons-you-need-safety-barriers-warehouse|title=4 Reasons You Need Safety Barriers in the Warehouse|date=2018-01-31|website=Boplan|language=en-us|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> Common uses for guardrail systems may be along an aisle or building wall. Often times guardrails are placed around equipment installations to prevent inadvertent contact from lift trucks. The guardrail provides a safety barrier preventing lift trucks or other in-plant vehicles from traveling into equipment, building walls, or personnel.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThere are different types of \u201cindustrial\u201d or \u201cfacility safety\u201d guardrail systems, each with its own advantages.\n\n=== Types of guardrail ===\n\n==== Steel Ribbed Rail ====\n[[File:Facility GuardRail.jpg|thumb|Steel facility guardrail in warehouse]]\nThe most common industrial or facility safety guardrail systems are constructed of steel, where the upright posts are made of heavy wall steel tubing-either round or square, with heavy gauge ribbed steel rails mechanically attached to the uprights by bolts or other fasteners.\u00a0The uprights may be welded to baseplates and anchored to the floor, or set and concreted into the floor. In industrial and distribution facilities the steel guardrail systems provide solid protection for property and personnel by restricting and controlling where in-plant vehicular traffic may operate.\u00a0These guardrail systems also serve as a warning for people to be aware of hazardous in facility vehicular traffic. Some facility safety steel guardrail systems utilize one horizontal rail, where others employ two or three rails. While a single rail safety guardrail located some 15 inches (38 cm) above floor level may be sufficient to control vehicle traffic, it could present a trip hazard to pedestrians since it is not as noticeable as a double or triple guardrail system where the top rail is some 40 inches (1.0 m) above the floor level.\n\nManufacturers produce several grades of steel safety guardrail.\u00a0Each grade is suited to a different application which may be determined by size and type of vehicles used in the facility, the volume of traffic to be controlled, or the value/risk associated with the areas being guarded.\n==== Polymer Guardrail ====\n[[File:A-SAFE flexible polymer guardrail with handrail for pedestrians.jpg|thumb|Flexible polymer guardrail with handrail for pedestrians and high strength lower rail to absorb vehicle impacts]]\nIn 1992 a yellow polymer cover sleeve for steel guardrails was introduced by a Detroit based company<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idealshield.com/|title=Ideal Shield {{!}} Facility Maintenance and Protection Products|website=Ideal Shield|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> which enhanced the visibility of steel safety guardrails in industrial environments and removed the need for continual repainting.<ref>This statement needs a reference</ref> This polymer cover was the beginning of polymer guardrail in the industrial environment. At the turn of the 21st century, several companies developed safety products constructed with polymer designed specifically for industrial environments and in 2001 a dedicated industrial alternative to steel guardrail was invented by a British based company, and thus the first fixed flexible polymer safety guardrail was introduced to the market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asafe.com/en-gb/about-a-safe/our-story/|title=The history & story of flexible polymer safety barriers {{!}} A-SAFE|website=www.asafe.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/the-manufacturer-mx-awards-2017-winners-announced/|title=The Manufacturer MX Awards 2017 winners announced|website=The Manufacturer|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> In the early 2000s, an Italian company added a version of a polymer bumper<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=424067291|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\u00a0providing small bumpers for walls and equipment in the food industry.

Polymer grains may be blended as part of the production process in order to enhance the natural properties of polymer in different ways. The most common types of polymer used are: polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Using these types of polymer, there are three basic design philosophies for polymer guardrails:\n\n* Impact Dispersal, which applies multi-component engineering to enable guardrails to bend on impact, absorbing and dispersing energy, before returning to their original shape.\n* Hybrid, which features a steel core encased in polymer.\n* Central Fix, which utilizes a solid polymer post fixed into the ground with cement and steel subterranean fixings. \n\nThe Polymer Impact Dispersal Safety Guardrail design offers an advantage over steel guardrails. Steel guardrails, if impacted with sufficient energy, will permanently deform and require repair or replacement to the impacting vehicle, the guardrail itself, and even the floor substrate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://warehousenews.co.uk/2016/08/steel-barriers-vs-polymer-barriers-comparing-the-environmental-credentials/|title=Steel Barriers Vs Polymer Barriers Comparing the Environmental Credentials|date=2016-08-12|website=Warehouse & Logistics News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\u00a0 Where the Impact Dispersal Safety Guardrail design allows the guardrail to bend on impact, disperse the energy, and return to its original shape.\u00a0 Resulting in no damage to the guardrail or the impacting vehicle.\n\n=== Test Standards for Industrial or Facility Safety Guardrail ===\nUntil 2017 there were no accepted standards for how safety guardrail tests were conducted, or how the results were communicated. In 2017, the BSI (British Standards Institution) published the publicly available specification, PAS 13:2017 Code of Practice for safety barriers used in traffic management within workplace environments with test methods for safety barrier impact resilience (commonly referred to as PAS13). This outlines test method guidelines for comparing like-for-like guardrail products, as well as being the current best practice traffic management procedures for a workplace and providing a standard for the safety guardrails within them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030310875|title=PAS 13:2017 Code of practice for safety barriers used in traffic management within workplace environments with test methods for safety barrier impact resilience|website=shop.bsigroup.com|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, there is no ANSI (American National Standards Institute) Standard<ref>[https://www.ansi.org/ (American National Standards Institute)]</ref> for testing guardrails.

Roadside obstacles are typically referred to as fixed objects. A secondary objective is keeping the vehicle upright while deflected along the guardrail. Variables such as motorist speed and vehicle orientation when striking the guardrail are crucial factors in the effectiveness of guardrail performance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/guardrailsafety/guardrail101.pdf|title=Guardrail 101|website=U.S. Department of Transportation|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105063152/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/guardrailsafety/guardrail101.pdf|archive-date=2015-01-05|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>   \n\nThe most common type of guardrail in use today is the Blocked-Out W-beam (Strong Post).<ref name=\"Roadside Design Guide 2011\">Roadside Design Guide, 4th Edition 2011, AASHTO</ref> Strong-post W-beam guardrail consists of wood posts and wood blockouts or steel posts with wood or plastic blockouts. The wood or plastic blockouts reduce or minimize a vehicle snagging on the posts upon impact. In addition, a blockout may be used to increase the offset of guardrail with an obstacle such as a curb.The posts' primary purpose is to maintain the height of the guardrail during the initial stages of post deflection.<ref name=\"Roadside Design Guide 2011\" /> Maintaining guardrail height also reduces the potential for a vehicle to vault over the guardrail upon initial impact. \n\nThe posts also play a role in the amount of resistance and deflection a guardrail may experience during impact. Resistance in a strong post system results from a combination of tensile and flexural stiffness of the rail and the bending and shearing resistance of the posts.<ref name=\"Roadside Design Guide 2011\" /> \n\nOne of the main concerns with strong-post W-beam guardrail has been the ability of the system to contain and redirect modern vehicles that have a higher center of gravity along with the increased weight of those vehicles. The problem with this is that a guardrail of the optimum height for a car might not keep a truck from toppling over it, while a motorbike might slip under a higher rail. To address these concerns, significant research and development of a system that could contain and redirect vehicles of varying weights and heights was developed and crash tested (both controlled and simulated). As a result, the Midwest Guardrail System (MGS) was developed and successfully crash tested per NCHRP Report 350 TL-3 criteria.<ref name=\"Roadside Design Guide 2011\" /> MGS has a higher mounting height, uses larger posts and blockouts as compared to the strong-post W-beam guardrail. One other significant difference is that MGS rail splices occur at mid-span compared to at the posts like the strong-post w-beam guardrail.\n\nIn most cases, guardrail would not be able to withstand the impact of a vehicle just by the strength of the individual posts in the area hit by the vehicle. Guardrail functions as a system with the guardrail, posts, connection of the rail to the posts and to each other, and the end anchors (or terminals) all playing an integral role in how the guardrail will function upon impact. Soil conditions, height of rail, presence of curb or dike, weight of impacting vehicle, distance from back of post to hinge point and depth of post within soil can all determine how well the system will function upon impact.   \n\nGuardrail is effectively one strong band that transfers the force of the vehicle to the rail elements, posts, and end terminals or anchors   A run of guardrail must be anchored at each terminating end either by transitioning the rail into a fixed anchor such as a bridge rail or with an end terminal or end anchor placed in the ground or within an embankment.  Newer concrete barriers, while usually strong enough to withstand direct hits by cars, still work on a similar principle in deflecting heavier vehicles such as trucks.\n\nThough they have usually prevented far more serious accidents, guardrail is considered a roadside obstacle as well and transportation engineers must weigh whether placing guardrail will reduce the severity of an impact as compared to what may be impacted if the guardrail were not placed. In general, the minimum length of guardrail with an end anchor at the trailing end and an end terminal on the approach end will be 62.5 to 75 feet in length. An example would be where an overhead roadside sign structure is placed within what is considered the clear recovery zone \u2014 An engineer would need to determine that the structure has a potential to be impacted and the impact of a vehicle with that structure would be much more severe than impacting the guardrail. \n\nGuardrail has frequently ranked amongst the highest sources of injury and fatality collisions with a fixed-object [[car accident|crash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/research/fatality_facts/roadsidehazards.html#sec3|title=Highway safety topics|work=iihs.org}}</ref> Among the primary reasons for this is the type of treatment used at the end<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsihighway.com/guardrails.html#endtreat |title=Types of end treatments used in the United States. Cited by a distributor of guardrail and end treatments, GSI Highway Products, gsihighway.com. |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref> of the guardrail facing oncoming traffic. Most end terminal designs will either gate and allow a vehicle to pass through the system within the first 12.5 feet or redirect a vehicle if impacted beyond the first 12.5 feet. Some end terminals also have energy absorbing properties when impacted in the head on position, and will actually slow a vehicle upon impact by absorbing the vehicles kinetic energy and dispersing it through the rail. This is typically accomplished by forcing rail elements through an extrusion impact head that has smaller dimensions that the rail being forced through it. The force rate and flattening of the rail through the head absorbs kinetic energy dissipating it through the extrusion head and slowing the vehicle. These types of systems have demonstrated that an errant vehicle, impacting a system in the head on position, can be effectively stopped in a distance of 50 feet or less. As compared to non-energy absorbing end terminals which can allow a vehicle to pass through the system and travel in excess of 250 feet behind and beyond the system.\n\nGuardrail is intended to deflect. The amount of deflection is dependent on a number of factors some of which include type and weight of impacting vehicle, height the guardrail is placed, type of soil the posts may be embedded within, length of embedment of the posts, and distance of the hinge point to the face of guardrail are just a few. A guardrail that deflects significantly can causes pocketing which has the potential to snag a vehicle which may cause it to flip or rollroll, or cause the rail to fail allowing a vehicle to  penetrate the guardrail.\n\nModern installations of guardrail are designed to allow the guiderail to deform under the load of the crash, and safely redirecting a vehicle back onto the roadway at a somewhat shallow angle.  It is important that the approach grades to a guardrail system be very flat (typically 10:1 or flatter) and that grades and fixed objects behind guardrail be placed at a distance so that it will not affect the performance of the guardrail upon impact and deflection.\n\nAbsorption is when the force of impact is directly transferred between the vehicle and guardrail, which may cause the end to puncture the vehicle. This is most common where a \"whale tail\" or blunt end treatment exists. To mitigate this a number of guiderail end treatments exist such as \"Extruder end treatments\", \"eccentric loaders\" and \"Driveway wrap treatments\" which result in blunt ends rarely being left exposed in modern installations.\n\nLastly, a vehicle can become airborne upon striking a guardrail with a buried end treatment if the slope to which the end anchor is buried is relatively flat (3:1 or flatter), which may negate the purpose of the guardrail, if the vehicle continues beyond the guardrail and strikes the object the guardrail was protecting. Additionally, an airborne vehicle is likely to collide in a manner that the vehicle was not designed for, increasing the risk of failure in the vehicle's collision safety systems. Guardrail will have some give and deflection upon impact. The amount of deflection depends on many factors of which speed and weight of vehicle, type of guardrail installed, height of rail, length of posts, soil conditions and a number of other factors can all play a role. Guardrail must be installed so that it is not so rigid that the rail will fail upon impact or the posts will snap off at the point where they are embedded within the ground.\n\n[[Transport engineering|Transportation engineers]] limit the amount of guardrail placed as much as possible, as guardrails should only be placed when the roadside conditions pose a greater threat than the guardrail itself. In fact, in the hierarchy of five roadside safety treatments, shielding with guardrails ranks fourth. Therefore, while guardrails are often added as a retrofit to existing roads, newer roads are designed to minimize roadside obstacles, whether that may include aligning a road on a smoother curve or filling in a ravine which would eliminate the need for guardrail altogether. In addition to new research into end treatments, public awareness among both drivers and engineers has been gradually reducing injuries and fatalities due to guardrails.\n\nThere are four general types of guardrail, ranging from weakest ''and'' inexpensive to strongest ''and'' expensive; cable and wood posts, steel and wood/metal posts, steel box-beam, and concrete barriers. While cheaper guardrail is the weakest, often being destroyed from the impact of a light vehicle, it is inexpensive and quick to repair, so this is frequently used in low-traffic rural areas. On the other hand, concrete barriers can usually withstand direct hits from a larger variety of vehicle types, making them well suited for use on high volume routes such as freeways. While rarely damaged, they would be considerably more expensive and time-consuming to repair. [[Jersey barrier|Concrete barriers]] are frequently installed in the median, being expected to withstand frequent impacts from both sides, while the shoulders of the road often have cheaper guardrail. Although the use of concrete barriers on the right side of highway is becoming a much for frequent occurrence in areas where guardrail may be sustaining frequent impacts and the ability for maintenance repairs may be restricted by the general area or work windows due to high traffic volumes for most of the day.\n\n== Traffic dangers ==\nIn cities occasionally pedestrian railings (and barriers) are installed at the immediate side of a roads however [[cyclist]]s have died when crushed against them by motor vehicles.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23674161-woman-cyclist-crushed-to-death-by-lorry-as-she-turns-corner.do\n |title       = Woman cyclist crushed to death by lorry as she turns corner\n |author      = Rashid Razaq\n |date        = 2009-04-09\n |work        = [[Evening Standard]]\n |accessdate  = 2009-12-08\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100418204852/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23674161-woman-cyclist-crushed-to-death-by-lorry-as-she-turns-corner.do\n |archivedate = 2010-04-18\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/03/cycling-ways-to-stay-safe\n|title= Cycling: the key ways to stay safe\n|author= Helen Pidd\n|publisher= Guardian Media Group\n|date= 2009-12-03\n|work= [[The Guardian]]\n|accessdate= 2009-12-08 }}</ref> Close \"safety barriers\" to roads have been found to increase the chances of injury to pedestrians for a number of reasons including increasing inattention of drivers and pedestrians.<ref name=\"remove-safety-barriers\">{{cite news\n|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article703116.ece\n|title= And the best solution for protecting pedestrians?

Security barriers have been introduced on a number of the world's major bridges and around key areas of congregation.\n\n== Railways ==\n{{Main|Guard rails (railroad)}}\nRailway trackage has guard rails (aka check rails) to guide wheels through possible catch points on turnouts or diamonds.  Similarly, guard rails may be installed inside the innermost running rails on very sharp curves.  The other most common usage is to prevent damage to other structures, especially bridges, in a derailment.\n\n== Technology ==\nIn a technology context, a guardrail is an [[Enterprise architecture artifacts|artifact]] that defines the boundaries in which technology change can be executed in a manner that is aligned with organisational strategy, risk, architecture, operational and cyber security requirements.  \n \nExamples of Technology Guardrails are:\n* [[Principle|Principles]]\n* [[Policy|Policies]]\n* [[Strategy|Strategies]]\n* [[Technical Standard|Technical Standards]]\n* [[Software design pattern|Patterns]]\n* [[Guideline|Guidelines]]\n* [[Reference Architecture|Reference Architectures]] (conceptual, logical, physical)\n \nEach of these Guardrails constrain what technology teams can do within approved boundaries (the scope of the guardrail).  For example, a technology standard may define a certain database as the standard to use within an organisation. The approved standard would have a commercial agreement, operational and delivery capability established, functional and non-functional fit for purpose assessments undertaken, and a cyber security assessment completed.  Technology delivery teams are constrained by the Guardrail to use that particular database technology, but can do so confidently for the scenarios in which usage has been defined and approved.  If a technology delivery team chose a different database technology that is not defined within the technology standards, they could be introducing commercial, organisational or operational risk as the pre-requisite due diligence has not been undertaken.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|small=yes|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cable railings]]\n* [[Baluster]]\n* [[Bollard]]\n* [[Cable barrier]]\n* [[Concrete step barrier]]\n* [[Handrail]]\n* [[Parapet]]\n* [[Jersey barrier]]\n* [[Traffic barrier]]\n* [[Traffic cone]]\n* [[Ironwork]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|guardrails}}\n* [http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/roadway_dept/policy_guide/road_hardware/ Roadside Hardware Policy and Guidance] \u2013 United States [[Federal Highway Administration]]\n* [https://www.eglassrailing.com/glass-railing-building-code.html Glass Railing Building Codes] \n*[http://www.mhi.org/progma Protective Guarding Manufacturers Association (ProGMA)]\n\n{{Road junction types}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport]]\n[[Category:Pedestrian infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Protective barriers]]\n[[Category:Street furniture]]\n[[Category:Bridge components]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|guardrail (disambiguation)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2017}}\n'''Guard rail''', '''guardrails''', or '''protective guarding''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mhi.org/fundamentals/protective-guarding?|title=Protective Guarding|website=www.mhi.org|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> in general, are a boundary feature and may be a means to prevent or deter access to dangerous or off-limits areas while allowing light and visibility in a greater way than a [[fence]].

Any abrupt change in elevation where the higher portion is accessible makes a fall possible. Due to this responsibility and liability, rails are placed to protect people using the premises. Guardrails in the US are generally required by code where there is a drop of {{convert|30|in|m}} or more.\n\nExamples of this are both [[architecture|architectural]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]]. Environmental guard rails are placed along [[hiking trail]]s where adjacent terrain is steep. Railings may also be located at scenic overlooks.\n\nGuard rails in [[building]]s can be numerous, and are required by building codes in many circumstances. Handrails along [[stairway]]s are common known as a [[balustrade]] where filled out below, and [[Footbridge#Catwalk|catwalks]] (a type of footbridge) and [[balcony|balconies]] are also lined with them. An example of a common residential guard rail (US) handrail (Brit.) is a wood railing around a deck or patio. In the US this is typically built on-site from pressure treated lumber thus featuring a simplistic design of vertical baluster spaced every 3.5\" demonstrating compliance with Building Codes (Standards). \n\n[[Cable railings]] typically use stainless steel cables strung horizontally. Glass [[balusters]] and glass panels open the view while still providing safety, as at the [[Grand Canyon Skywalk]]. With the increasing popularity of [[composite lumber]] for decking, manufacturers, like TimberTech are providing composite railing components. [[Wrought iron]] is another choice that is traditional and sturdy. Decorative examples are considered [[ironwork]].\n\nBuilding codes also require that no opening in a guard be of a size such that a 4\" sphere may pass. There are three exceptions according to the 2003 [[International Building Code]] Section 1012.3 which allow openings to not exceed 8\" or 21\" depending on occupancy groups or special areas.\n\nA major architect imaginitively used handrails representing social stability, [[Alvar Aalto]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Details of Modern Architecture / vol. 2:1928 to 1988.|date=2003|publisher=The MIT Press|others=Ford, Edward R.|isbn=9780262562027|edition=Di 1 ban|location=Cambridge|pages=133|oclc=966185775}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Bare architecture : a schizoanalysis|last=L.)|first=Smith, Chris (Chris|isbn=9781350015814|location=London|oclc=1002209835|date = 2017-10-19}}</ref> The guard rails of an [[observation tower]] such as the [[Space Needle]] or [[Eiffel Tower]] become exaggerated to the point of becoming a [[fence]] or [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]].

This set the governmental procedures in motion that would see a flurry of regulations and legislation around workplace safety being introduced in industrialized countries in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/timeline/index.htm#a2000|title=HSE: Timeline|website=www.hse.gov.uk|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\u00a0In the US and UK, these introductions, combined with the demonstrable success of the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1970 (US), and Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (UK), led to workplace safety being taken more seriously at industrial facilities. Businesses worldwide began to see the value of effective workplace safety, in both the direct commercial sense of protecting assets, but also in the improved productivity levels of a protected workforce. Part of this increase in desire for industrial workplace protection, was a growth in demand for safety guardrails. \n\nIn the US, under [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] Standard 1910.28(b)(15), employees who work on surfaces that are 4 feet (1.2 m) or higher off of the ground must have personal fall protection systems in place, such as handrails or guardrails.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omegaindl.com/blog/guardrails-vs-handrails|title=Guardrails vs. Handrails for Industrial Workplace Safety|date=2017-07-10|website=Omega Industrial Products|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> Although the OSHA standard calls for a guardrail or guardrail system to protect workers on elevated work areas, current industry terminology would refer to that type of safety system as a handrail system or safety rail system.\n\nThe term \"guardrail\" as used in industry and distribution facilities refers to floor mounted systems consisting of horizontal rails attached to upright posts that resemble outdoor highway guardrail. The facility safety guardrails control in-plant vehicular traffic and protect areas where errant vehicle contact may cause harm to property or personnel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boplan.com/en/4-reasons-you-need-safety-barriers-warehouse|title=4 Reasons You Need Safety Barriers in the Warehouse|date=2018-01-31|website=Boplan|language=en-us|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> Common uses for guardrail systems may be along an aisle or building wall. Often times guardrails are placed around equipment installations to prevent inadvertent contact from lift trucks. The guardrail provides a safety barrier preventing lift trucks or other in-plant vehicles from traveling into equipment, building walls, or personnel.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThere are different types of \u201cindustrial\u201d or \u201cfacility safety\u201d guardrail systems, each with its own advantages.\n\n=== Types of guardrail ===\n\n==== Steel Ribbed Rail ====\n[[File:Facility GuardRail.jpg|thumb|Steel facility guardrail in warehouse]]\nThe most common industrial or facility safety guardrail systems are constructed of steel, where the upright posts are made of heavy wall steel tubing-either round or square, with heavy gauge ribbed steel rails mechanically attached to the uprights by bolts or other fasteners.\u00a0The uprights may be welded to baseplates and anchored to the floor, or set and concreted into the floor. In industrial and distribution facilities the steel guardrail systems provide solid protection for property and personnel by restricting and controlling where in-plant vehicular traffic may operate.\u00a0These guardrail systems also serve as a warning for people to be aware of hazardous in facility vehicular traffic. Some facility safety steel guardrail systems utilize one horizontal rail, where others employ two or three rails. While a single rail safety guardrail located some 15 inches (38 cm) above floor level may be sufficient to control vehicle traffic, it could present a trip hazard to pedestrians since it is not as noticeable as a double or triple guardrail system where the top rail is some 40 inches (1.0 m) above the floor level.\n\nManufacturers produce several grades of steel safety guardrail.\u00a0Each grade is suited to a different application which may be determined by size and type of vehicles used in the facility, the volume of traffic to be controlled, or the value/risk associated with the areas being guarded.\n==== Polymer Guardrail ====\n[[File:A-SAFE flexible polymer guardrail with handrail for pedestrians.jpg|thumb|Flexible polymer guardrail with handrail for pedestrians and high strength lower rail to absorb vehicle impacts]]\nIn 1992 a yellow polymer cover sleeve for steel guardrails was introduced by a Detroit based company<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idealshield.com/|title=Ideal Shield {{!}} Facility Maintenance and Protection Products|website=Ideal Shield|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> which enhanced the visibility of steel safety guardrails in industrial environments and removed the need for continual repainting.<ref>This statement needs a reference</ref> This polymer cover was the beginning of polymer guardrail in the industrial environment. At the turn of the 21st century, several companies developed safety products constructed with polymer designed specifically for industrial environments and in 2001 a dedicated industrial alternative to steel guardrail was invented by a British based company, and thus the first fixed flexible polymer safety guardrail was introduced to the market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asafe.com/en-gb/about-a-safe/our-story/|title=The history & story of flexible polymer safety barriers {{!}} A-SAFE|website=www.asafe.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/the-manufacturer-mx-awards-2017-winners-announced/|title=The Manufacturer MX Awards 2017 winners announced|website=The Manufacturer|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> In the early 2000\u2019s, an Italian company added a version of a polymer bumper<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=424067291|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\u00a0providing small bumpers for walls and equipment in the food industry.

Polymer grains may be blended as part of the production process in order to enhance the natural properties of polymer in different ways. The most common types of polymer used are: polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Using these types of polymer, there are three basic design philosophies for polymer guardrails:\n\n* Impact Dispersal, which applies multi-component engineering to enable guardrails to bend on impact, absorbing and dispersing energy, before returning to their original shape.\n* Hybrid, which features a steel core encased in polymer.\n* Central Fix, which utilizes a solid polymer post fixed into the ground with cement and steel subterranean fixings. \n\nThe Polymer Impact Dispersal Safety Guardrail design offers an advantage over steel guardrails. Steel guardrails, if impacted with sufficient energy, will permanently deform and require repair or replacement to the impacting vehicle, the guardrail itself, and even the floor substrate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://warehousenews.co.uk/2016/08/steel-barriers-vs-polymer-barriers-comparing-the-environmental-credentials/|title=Steel Barriers Vs Polymer Barriers Comparing the Environmental Credentials|date=2016-08-12|website=Warehouse & Logistics News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\u00a0 Where the Impact Dispersal Safety Guardrail design allows the guardrail to bend on impact, disperse the energy, and return to its original shape.\u00a0 Resulting in no damage to the guardrail or the impacting vehicle.\n\n=== Test Standards for Industrial or Facility Safety Guardrail ===\nUntil 2017 there were no accepted standards for how safety guardrail tests were conducted, or how the results were communicated. In 2017, the BSI (British Standards Institution) published the publicly available specification, PAS 13:2017 Code of Practice for safety barriers used in traffic management within workplace environments with test methods for safety barrier impact resilience (commonly referred to as PAS13). This outlines test method guidelines for comparing like-for-like guardrail products, as well as being the current best practice traffic management procedures for a workplace and providing a standard for the safety guardrails within them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030310875|title=PAS 13:2017 Code of practice for safety barriers used in traffic management within workplace environments with test methods for safety barrier impact resilience|website=shop.bsigroup.com|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, there is no ANSI (American National Standards Institute) Standard<ref>[https://www.ansi.org/ (American National Standards Institute)]</ref> for testing guardrails.

Roadside obstacles are typically referred to as fixed objects. A secondary objective is keeping the vehicle upright while deflected along the guardrail. Variables such as motorist speed and vehicle orientation when striking the guardrail are crucial factors in the effectiveness of guardrail performance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/guardrailsafety/guardrail101.pdf|title=Guardrail 101|website=U.S. Department of Transportation|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105063152/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/guardrailsafety/guardrail101.pdf|archive-date=2015-01-05|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>   \n\nThe most common type of guardrail in use today is the Blocked-Out W-beam (Strong Post).<ref name=\"Roadside Design Guide 2011\">Roadside Design Guide, 4th Edition 2011, AASHTO</ref> Strong-post W-beam guardrail consists of wood posts and wood blockouts or steel posts with wood or plastic blockouts. The wood or plastic blockouts reduce or minimize a vehicle snagging on the posts upon impact. In addition, a blockout may be used to increase the offset of guardrail with an obstacle such as a curb.The posts' primary purpose is to maintain the height of the guardrail during the initial stages of post deflection.<ref name=\"Roadside Design Guide 2011\" /> Maintaining guardrail height also reduces the potential for a vehicle to vault over the guardrail upon initial impact. \n\nThe posts also play a role in the amount of resistance and deflection a guardrail may experience during impact. Resistance in a strong post system results from a combination of tensile and flexural stiffness of the rail and the bending and shearing resistance of the posts.<ref name=\"Roadside Design Guide 2011\" /> \n\nOne of the main concerns with strong-post W-beam guardrail has been the ability of the system to contain and redirect modern vehicles that have a higher center of gravity along with the increased weight of those vehicles. The problem with this is that a guardrail of the optimum height for a car might not keep a truck from toppling over it, while a motorbike might slip under a higher rail. To address these concerns, significant research and development of a system that could contain and redirect vehicles of varying weights and heights was developed and crash tested (both controlled and simulated). As a result, the Midwest Guardrail System (MGS) was developed and successfully crash tested per NCHRP Report 350 TL-3 criteria.<ref name=\"Roadside Design Guide 2011\" /> MGS has a higher mounting height, uses larger posts and blockouts as compared to the strong-post W-beam guardrail. One other significant difference is that MGS rail splices occur at mid-span compared to at the posts like the strong-post w-beam guardrail.\n\nIn most cases, guardrail would not be able to withstand the impact of a vehicle just by the strength of the individual posts in the area hit by the vehicle. Guardrail functions as a system with the guardrail, posts, connection of the rail to the posts and to each other, and the end anchors (or terminals) all playing an integral role in how the guardrail will function upon impact. Soil conditions, height of rail, presence of curb or dike, weight of impacting vehicle, distance from back of post to hinge point and depth of post within soil can all determine how well the system will function upon impact.   \n\nGuardrail is effectively one strong band that transfers the force of the vehicle to the rail elements, posts, and end terminals or anchors   A run of guardrail must be anchored at each terminating end either by transitioning the rail into a fixed anchor such as a bridge rail or with an end terminal or end anchor placed in the ground or within an embankment.  Newer concrete barriers, while usually strong enough to withstand direct hits by cars, still work on a similar principle in deflecting heavier vehicles such as trucks.\n\nThough they have usually prevented far more serious accidents, guardrail is considered a roadside obstacle as well and transportation engineers must weigh whether placing guardrail will reduce the severity of an impact as compared to what may be impacted if the guardrail were not placed. In general, the minimum length of guardrail with an end anchor at the trailing end and an end terminal on the approach end will be 62.5 to 75 feet in length. An example would be where an overhead roadside sign structure is placed within what is considered the clear recovery zone \u2014 An engineer would need to determine that the structure has a potential to be impacted and the impact of a vehicle with that structure would be much more severe than impacting the guardrail. \n\nGuardrail has frequently ranked amongst the highest sources of injury and fatality collisions with a fixed-object [[car accident|crash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/research/fatality_facts/roadsidehazards.html#sec3|title=Highway safety topics|work=iihs.org}}</ref> Among the primary reasons for this is the type of treatment used at the end<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsihighway.com/guardrails.html#endtreat |title=Types of end treatments used in the United States. Cited by a distributor of guardrail and end treatments, GSI Highway Products, gsihighway.com. |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref> of the guardrail facing oncoming traffic. Most end terminal designs will either gate and allow a vehicle to pass through the system within the first 12.5 feet or redirect a vehicle if impacted beyond the first 12.5 feet. Some end terminals also have energy absorbing properties when impacted in the head on position, and will actually slow a vehicle upon impact by absorbing the vehicles kinetic energy and dispersing it through the rail. This is typically accomplished by forcing rail elements through an extrusion impact head that has smaller dimensions that the rail being forced through it. The force rate and flattening of the rail through the head absorbs kinetic energy dissipating it through the extrusion head and slowing the vehicle. These types of systems have demonstrated that an errant vehicle, impacting a system in the head on position, can be effectively stopped in a distance of 50 feet or less. As compared to non-energy absorbing end terminals which can allow a vehicle to pass through the system and travel in excess of 250 feet behind and beyond the system.\n\nGuardrail is intended to deflect. The amount of deflection is dependent on a number of factors some of which include type and weight of impacting vehicle, height the guardrail is placed, type of soil the posts may be embedded within, length of embedment of the posts, and distance of the hinge point to the face of guardrail are just a few. A guardrail that deflects significantly can causes pocketing which has the potential to snag a vehicle which may cause it to flip or rollroll, or cause the rail to fail allowing a vehicle to  penetrate the guardrail.\n\nModern installations of guardrail are designed to allow the guiderail to deform under the load of the crash, and safely redirecting a vehicle back onto the roadway at a somewhat shallow angle.  It is important that the approach grades to a guardrail system be very flat (typically 10:1 or flatter) and that grades and fixed objects behind guardrail be placed at a distance so that it will not affect the performance of the guardrail upon impact and deflection.\n\nAbsorption is when the force of impact is directly transferred between the vehicle and guardrail, which may cause the end to puncture the vehicle. This is most common where a \"whale tail\" or blunt end treatment exists. To mitigate this a number of guiderail end treatments exist such as \"Extruder end treatments\", \"eccentric loaders\" and \"Driveway wrap treatments\" which result in blunt ends rarely being left exposed in modern installations.\n\nLastly, a vehicle can become airborne upon striking a guardrail with a buried end treatment if the slope to which the end anchor is buried is relatively flat (3:1 or flatter), which may negate the purpose of the guardrail, if the vehicle continues beyond the guardrail and strikes the object the guardrail was protecting. Additionally, an airborne vehicle is likely to collide in a manner that the vehicle was not designed for, increasing the risk of failure in the vehicle's collision safety systems. Guardrail will have some give and deflection upon impact. The amount of deflection depends on many factors of which speed and weight of vehicle, type of guardrail installed, height of rail, length of posts, soil conditions and a number of other factors can all play a role. Guardrail must be installed so that it is not so rigid that the rail will fail upon impact or the posts will snap off at the point where they are embedded within the ground.\n\n[[Transport engineering|Transportation engineers]] limit the amount of guardrail placed as much as possible, as guardrails should only be placed when the roadside conditions pose a greater threat than the guardrail itself. In fact, in the hierarchy of five roadside safety treatments, shielding with guardrails ranks fourth. Therefore, while guardrails are often added as a retrofit to existing roads, newer roads are designed to minimize roadside obstacles, whether that may include aligning a road on a smoother curve or filling in a ravine which would eliminate the need for guardrail altogether. In addition to new research into end treatments, public awareness among both drivers and engineers has been gradually reducing injuries and fatalities due to guardrails.\n\nThere are four general types of guardrail, ranging from weakest ''and'' inexpensive to strongest ''and'' expensive; cable and wood posts, steel and wood/metal posts, steel box-beam, and concrete barriers. While cheaper guardrail is the weakest, often being destroyed from the impact of a light vehicle, it is inexpensive and quick to repair, so this is frequently used in low-traffic rural areas. On the other hand, concrete barriers can usually withstand direct hits from a larger variety of vehicle types, making them well suited for use on high volume routes such as freeways. While rarely damaged, they would be considerably more expensive and time-consuming to repair. [[Jersey barrier|Concrete barriers]] are frequently installed in the median, being expected to withstand frequent impacts from both sides, while the shoulders of the road often have cheaper guardrail. Although the use of concrete barriers on the right side of highway is becoming a much for frequent occurrence in areas where guardrail may be sustaining frequent impacts and the ability for maintenance repairs may be restricted by the general area or work windows due to high traffic volumes for most of the day.\n\n== Traffic dangers ==\nIn cities occasionally pedestrian railings (and barriers) are installed at the immediate side of a roads however [[cyclist]]s have died when crushed against them by motor vehicles.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23674161-woman-cyclist-crushed-to-death-by-lorry-as-she-turns-corner.do\n |title       = Woman cyclist crushed to death by lorry as she turns corner\n |author      = Rashid Razaq\n |date        = 2009-04-09\n |work        = [[Evening Standard]]\n |accessdate  = 2009-12-08\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100418204852/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23674161-woman-cyclist-crushed-to-death-by-lorry-as-she-turns-corner.do\n |archivedate = 2010-04-18\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/03/cycling-ways-to-stay-safe\n|title= Cycling: the key ways to stay safe\n|author= Helen Pidd\n|publisher= Guardian Media Group\n|date= 2009-12-03\n|work= [[The Guardian]]\n|accessdate= 2009-12-08 }}</ref> Close \"safety barriers\" to roads have been found to increase the chances of injury to pedestrians for a number of reasons including increasing inattention of drivers and pedestrians.<ref name=\"remove-safety-barriers\">{{cite news\n|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article703116.ece\n|title= And the best solution for protecting pedestrians?

Security barriers have been introduced on a number of the world's major bridges and around key areas of congregation.\n\n== Railways ==\n{{Main|Guard rails (railroad)}}\nRailway trackage has guard rails (aka check rails) to guide wheels through possible catch points on turnouts or diamonds.  Similarly, guard rails may be installed inside the innermost running rails on very sharp curves.  The other most common usage is to prevent damage to other structures, especially bridges, in a derailment.\n\n== Technology ==\nIn a technology context, a guardrail is an [[Enterprise architecture artifacts|artifact]] that defines the boundaries in which technology change can be executed in a manner that is aligned with organisational strategy, risk, architecture, operational and cyber security requirements.  \n \nExamples of Technology Guardrails are:\n* [[Principle|Principles]]\n* [[Policy|Policies]]\n* [[Strategy|Strategies]]\n* [[Technical Standard|Technical Standards]]\n* [[Software design pattern|Patterns]]\n* [[Guideline|Guidelines]]\n* [[Reference Architecture|Reference Architectures]] (conceptual, logical, physical)\n \nEach of these Guardrails constrain what technology teams can do within approved boundaries (the scope of the guardrail).  For example, a technology standard may define a certain database as the standard to use within an organisation. The approved standard would have a commercial agreement, operational and delivery capability established, functional and non-functional fit for purpose assessments undertaken, and a cyber security assessment completed.  Technology delivery teams are constrained by the Guardrail to use that particular database technology, but can do so confidently for the scenarios in which usage has been defined and approved.  If a technology delivery team chose a different database technology that is not defined within the technology standards, they could be introducing commercial, organisational or operational risk as the pre-requisite due diligence has not been undertaken.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|small=yes|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cable railings]]\n* [[Baluster]]\n* [[Bollard]]\n* [[Cable barrier]]\n* [[Concrete step barrier]]\n* [[Handrail]]\n* [[Parapet]]\n* [[Jersey barrier]]\n* [[Traffic barrier]]\n* [[Traffic cone]]\n* [[Ironwork]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|guardrails}}\n* [http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/roadway_dept/policy_guide/road_hardware/ Roadside Hardware Policy and Guidance] \u2013 United States [[Federal Highway Administration]]\n* [https://www.eglassrailing.com/glass-railing-building-code.html Glass Railing Building Codes] \n*[http://www.mhi.org/progma Protective Guarding Manufacturers Association (ProGMA)]\n\n{{Road junction types}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport]]\n[[Category:Pedestrian infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Protective barriers]]\n[[Category:Street furniture]]\n[[Category:Bridge components]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_rail"}
