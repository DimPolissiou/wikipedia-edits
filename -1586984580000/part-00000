The value of each [[musical notation|note]] is not determined by the form of the written note (as is the case with more recent European musical notation), but rather by its position within a group of notes written as a single figure called a [[Ligature (music)|\"ligature\"]], and by the position of the ligature relative to other ligatures. '''Modal notation''' was developed by the composers of the [[Notre Dame school]] from 1170 to 1250, replacing the even and unmeasured rhythm of early [[polyphony]] and [[plainchant]] with patterns based on the metric feet of classical poetry, and was the first step towards the development of modern [[mensural notation]] {{harv|Hoppin|1978|loc=221}}. The rhythmic modes of Notre Dame Polyphony were the first coherent system of rhythmic notation developed in Western music since antiquity.\n\n==History==\nThough the use of the rhythmic modes is the most characteristic feature of the music of the late [[Notre Dame school]], especially the compositions of [[P\u00e9rotin]], they are also predominant in much of the rest of the music of the ''[[ars antiqua]]'' until about the middle of the 13th century. Composition types which were permeated by the modal rhythm include Notre Dame [[organum]] (most famously, the organum triplum and organum quadruplum of P\u00e9rotin), [[conductus]], and [[Clausula (music)|discant clausulae]]. Later in the century, the motets by [[Petrus de Cruce]] and the many anonymous composers, which were descended from discant clausulae, also used modal rhythm, often with much greater complexity than was found earlier in the century: for example each voice sometimes sang in a different mode, as well as a different language.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nIn most sources there were six rhythmic modes, as first explained in the anonymous treatise of about 1260, ''De mensurabili musica'' (formerly attributed to [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]], who is now believed merely to have edited it in the late 13th century for [[Jerome of Moravia]], who incorporated it into his own compilation) {{harv|Baltzer|2001}}. Each mode consisted of a short pattern of long and short note values (\"[[Longa (music)|longa]]\" and \"[[Double whole note|brevis]]\") corresponding to a [[metrical foot]], as follows {{harv|Reese|1940|loc=207\u2013209}}:\n\n# Long-short ([[trochee]])\n# Short-long ([[Iamb (foot)|iamb]])\n# Long-short-short ([[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]])\n# Short-short-long ([[anapaest]])\n# Long-long ([[spondee]])\n# Short-short-short ([[Tribrach (poetry)|tribrach]])\n\nAlthough this system of six modes was recognized by medieval theorists, in practice only the first three and fifth patterns were commonly used, with the first mode being by far the most frequent {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=223}}. The fourth mode is rarely encountered, an exception being the second clausula of ''Lux magna'' in MS Wolfenb\u00fcttel 677, fol. 44 {{harv|Hughes|1954a|loc=320}}. The fifth mode normally occurs in groups of three and is used only in the lowest voice (or tenor), whereas the sixth mode is most often found in an upper part {{harv|Hughes|1954a|loc=320}}.\n\nModern transcriptions of the six modes usually are as follows:\n\n# Quarter ([[crotchet]]), eighth ([[quaver]]) (generally [[meter (music)|barred]], therefore, in {{music|time|3|8}} or, because the patterns usually repeat an even number of times, in {{music|time|6|8}} (Apel 1961, 221))<br>[[File:Rhythmic mode 1.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 1.mid|Play \u00d74}}\n# Eighth, quarter (barred in {{music|time|3|8}} or {{music|time|6|8}})<br>[[File:Rhythmic mode 2.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 2.mid|Play \u00d74}}\n# Dotted quarter, eighth, quarter (barred in {{music|time|6|8}})<br>[[File:Rhythmic mode 3.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 3.mid|Play \u00d72}}\n# Eighth, quarter, dotted quarter (barred in {{music|time|6|8}})<br>[[File:Rhythmic mode 4.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 4.mid|Play \u00d72}}\n# Dotted quarters (barred in either {{music|time|3|8}} or {{music|time|6|8}})<br>[[File:Rhythmic mode 5.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 5.mid|Play \u00d72}}\n# Eighths (barred in {{music|time|3|8}} or {{music|time|6|8}})<br>[[File:Rhythmic mode 6.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 6.mid|Play \u00d74}}\n*Cooper (1973, 30) gives the above but doubled in length, thus 1) is {{music|half}} {{music|quarter}} barred in {{music|time|3|4}}, for example.\n*Riemann (1962, 135) is another modern exception, who also gives the values twice as long, in {{music|time|3|4}} time, but in addition holds that the third and fourth modes were really intended to represent the modern {{music|common-time}}, with duple rhythms ({{music|half}} {{music|quarter}} {{music|quarter}} and {{music|quarter}} {{music|quarter}} {{music|half}}, respectively).\n\n==Notation==\n[[File:P\u00e9rotin - Viderunt omnes.jpg|thumb|P\u00e9rotin, ''Viderunt omnes'' (Gradual for Christmas Day), in the first rhythmic mode. MS Florence, Biblioteca Medicea-Laurenziana, Pluteo 29.1, fol. 1 recto.]]\nDevised in the last half of the 12th century {{harv|Seay|1975|loc=97}}, the notation of rhythmic modes used stereotyped combinations of ligatures (joined noteheads) to indicate the patterns of long notes (longs) and short notes (breves), enabling a performer to recognize which of the six rhythmic modes was intended for a given passage.\n\nLinked notes in groups of:\n:3, 2, 2, 2, etc. indicate the first mode,\n:2, 2, 2, 2, \u2026 3 the second mode, \n:1, 3, 3, 3, 3, etc. the third mode,\n:3, 3, 3, \u2026 1 the fourth mode,\n:3, 3, 3, 3, etc. the fifth mode, \n:and 4, 3, 3, 3, etc. the sixth mode\n{{harv|Hughes|1954a|loc=323\u201324}}.\nThe reading and performance of the music notated using the rhythmic modes was thus based on context. After recognizing which of the six modes applied to a passage of [[neume]]s, a singer would generally continue on in that same mode until the end of a phrase, or a [[cadence (music)|cadence]]. In modern editions of medieval music, ligatures are represented by horizontal brackets over the notes contained within it.\n\nAll the modes adhere to a ternary principle of metre, meaning that each mode would have a number of beat subdivisions divisible by the number 3. Some medieval writers explained this as veneration for the perfection of the Holy Trinity, but it appears that this was an explanation made after the event, rather than a cause ({{harvnb|Reese|1940|loc=274}}; {{harvnb|Hughes|1954a|loc=319\u201320}}). Less speculatively, the flexibility of rhythm possible within the system allows for variety and avoids monotony. Notes could be broken down into shorter units (called ''fractio modi'' by [[Anonymous IV]]) or two rhythmic units of the same mode could be combined into one (''extensio modi'') {{harv|Seay|1975|loc=98\u201399}}. An alternative term used by Garlandia for both types of alteration was \"reduction\" {{harv|Roesner|2001}}. These alterations may be accomplished in several ways: ''extensio modi'' by the insertion of single (unligated) long notes or a smaller-than-usual ligature; ''fractio modi'' by the insertion of a larger-than-usual ligature, or by special signs. These were of two types, the ''plica'' and the ''climacus'' {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}.\n\nThe ''plica'' was adopted from the liquescent neumes (''cephalicus'') of chant notation, and receives its name (Latin for \"fold\") from its form which, when written as a separate note, had the shape of a U or an inverted U. In modal notation, however, the plica usually occurs as a vertical stroke added to the end of a ligature, making it a ''ligatura plicata''. The plica usually indicates an added breve on a weak beat {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}. The pitch indicated by the plica depends on the pitches of the note it is attached to and the note following it. If both notes are the same, then the plica tone is the upper or lower neighbor, depending on the direction of the stem. If the interval between the main notes is a third, then the plica tone fills it in as a passing tone. If the two main notes are a second apart, or at an interval of a fourth or larger, musical context must decide the pitch of the plica tone {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=227}}.\n\n[[File:Climacus.gif|thumb|The ''climacus''.]] [[File:Clivis cumpunctis carr\u00e9e.jpg|thumb|''climacus'' with ligature]]\nThe ''climacus'' is a rapid descending scale figure, written as a single note or a ligature followed by a series of two or more descending lozenges. Anonymous IV called these ''currentes'' (Latin \"running\"), probably in reference to the similar figures found in pre-modal Aquitanian and Parisian polyphony. [[Franco of Cologne]] called them ''coniunctura'' (Latin for \"joined [note]\"). When consisting of just three notes (''coniunctura ternaria'') it is rhythmically identical with the ordinary three-note ligature, but when containing more notes this figure may be rhythmically ambiguous and therefore difficult to interpret {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}. The difficulty was compounded in the later half of the 13th century, when the lozenge shape came also to be used for the [[semibreve]]. A general rule is that the last note is a longa, the second-last note is a breve, and all the preceding notes taken together occupy the space of a longa. However, the exact internal rhythm of these first notes of the group requires some interpretation according to context {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=240}}.\n\nIt was also possible to change from one mode to another without a break, which was called \"admixture\" by Anonymous IV, writing around 1280 {{harv|Roesner|2001}}.\n\n[[File:Alteratio.png|thumbnail|Tenor from Motet \"Homo, luge!\"/\"Homo miserabilis\"/\"Brumans e mors\" (13th century). Third rhythmic mode, syllabic notation.]]\nBecause a ligature cannot be used for more than one syllable of text, the notational patterns can only occur in [[melisma]]tic passages. Where syllables change frequently or where pitches are to be repeated, ligatures must be broken up into smaller ligatures or even single notes in so-called \"syllabic notation\", often creating difficulty for the singers, as was reported by Anonymous IV ({{harvnb|Apel|1961|loc=225}}; {{harvnb|Roesner|2001}}).\n\nAn '''ordo''' (plural ''ordines'') is a [[phrase (music)|phrase]] constructed from one or more statements of one modal pattern and ending in a rest. Ordines were described according to the number of repetitions and the position of the concluding rest. \"Perfect\" ordines ended with the first note of the pattern followed by a rest substituting for the second half of the pattern, and \"imperfect\" ordines ended in the last note of the pattern followed by a rest equal to the first part. Imperfect ordines are mostly theoretical and rare in practice, where perfect ordines predominate {{harv|Hoppin|1978|loc=223}}.\n\nOther writers who covered the topic of rhythmic modes include Anonymous IV, who mentions the names of the composers L\u00e9onin and P\u00e9rotin as well as some of their major works, and [[Franco of Cologne]], writing around 1260, who recognized the limitations of the system and whose name became attached to the idea of representing the duration of a note by particular notational shapes, though in fact the idea had been known and used for some time before Franco {{harv|Hughes|1954b|loc=379\u201380}}. Lambertus described nine modes, and Anonymus IV said that, in England, a whole series of irregular modes was in use {{harv|Reece|1940|loc=288}}.\n\n== References and further reading ==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Apel|1961}}|reference=Apel, Willi. 1961.

Where syllables change frequently or where pitches are to be repeated, ligatures must be broken up into smaller ligatures or even single notes in so-called \"syllabic notation\", often creating difficulty for the singers, as was reported by Anonymous IV ({{harvnb|Apel|1961|loc=225}}; {{harvnb|Roesner|2001}}).\n\nAn '''ordo''' (plural ''ordines'') is a [[phrase (music)|phrase]] constructed from one or more statements of one modal pattern and ending in a rest. Ordines were described according to the number of repetitions and the position of the concluding rest. \"Perfect\" ordines ended with the first note of the pattern followed by a rest substituting for the second half of the pattern, and \"imperfect\" ordines ended in the last note of the pattern followed by a rest equal to the first part. Imperfect ordines are mostly theoretical and rare in practice, where perfect ordines predominate {{harv|Hoppin|1978|loc=223}}.\n\nOther writers who covered the topic of rhythmic modes include Anonymous IV, who mentions the names of the composers L\u00e9onin and P\u00e9rotin as well as some of their major works, and [[Franco of Cologne]], writing around 1260, who recognized the limitations of the system and whose name became attached to the idea of representing the duration of a note by particular notational shapes, though in fact the idea had been known and used for some time before Franco {{harv|Hughes|1954b|loc=379\u201380}}. Lambertus described nine modes, and Anonymus IV said that, in England, a whole series of irregular modes was in use {{harv|Reece|1940|loc=288}}.\n\n== References and further reading ==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Apel|1961}}|reference=Apel, Willi. 1961.

Ufm1 has similar [[tertiary structure]] to Ub but lacks any obvious [[homology (biology)|sequence similarity]]. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor form (pro-Ufm1) which has 2 additional amino acids beyond the conserved glycine. The mechanism of Ufm1 [[bioconjugation|conjugation]] is similar to that of ubiquitin. Mature Ufm1 has an exposed [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] [[glycine]] which is essential for subsequent activation by its cognate E1 protein (Uba5). This activation step results in the formation of a high-energy thiolester bond in the presence of ATP. The Ufm1 is subsequently transferred to its cognate E2-like enzyme (Ufc1) via a similar [[thioester]] linkage with a [[cysteine]] at the E2 active site. Ufm1 is conjugated to a variety of target proteins and forms complexes with as yet unidentified proteins. Thus, presumably there exist E3 ligases (none have been identified to date) to perform the final step in Ufm1 conjugation to relevant targets. The modification of proteins with Ufm1 is also reversible. Two novel [[cysteine protease]]s have been identified to date ([[UFSP1]] and [[UFSP2]]) which cleave Ufm1-peptide C-terminal fusions and also removes Ufm1 from native intracellular conjugates. These proteases have no obvious homology to ubiquitin deconjugating enzymes.

He has held concerts in Japan's largest stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Yokohama Stadium]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[NHK Hall]], and [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]].\n\nOe has also written and produced music for many artists, including [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Misato Watanabe]], [[Hiromi Go]], [[Hikaru Genji (band)|Hikaru Genji]] and [[Sayuri Ishikawa]].\n\nHe has composed music for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Believe\" which was featured in [[Sanrio Puroland]].\n\n== Early life ==\nSenri Oe was born on September 6, 1960, in Fujiidera city [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. Oe began playing piano at the age of three, and was classically trained by his junior high school teacher Yumi Nara, who would go on to become an acclaimed opera singer. After each of their lessons, Nara would encourage Oe to improvise, and eventually Oe began to compose.\n\nUpon being introduced to music by The Carpenters, Captain & Tenille and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Oe decided to become a singer-songwriter. Soon after, Oe's music repertoire expanded to include jazz musicians such as Chris Conor, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Winton Kelly, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.\n\nIn 1975, Oe participated in the final [[Yamaha Popular Song Contest]] POPCON (akin to American Idol).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagomusicguide.com/featured-artist-senri-oe/|title=FEATURED ARTIST - Senri Oe|date=2018-06-24|website=Chicago Music Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Oe entered [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] and majored in economics while simultaneously beginning to pursue a professional music career. He formed his first bands during his time at university, was scouted by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music]] and signed to [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] Japan in 1981.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 1983-1984: Early pop career and debut album ===\nOn February 27, 1983, Oe performed on [[Sapporo Television Broadcasting|STV Radio]]'s Sunday Jumbo Special in Sapporo, Hokkaido, granting him his initial exposure as a professional musician. Within this segment, Oe began a ten-minute performance in which he improvised a song on live radio.\n\nOe soon released his first single \"Wallabee Shoes  (\u30ef\u30e9\u30d3\u30fc\u306c\u304e\u3059\u3066\u3066),\" followed by his debut album, WAKUWAKU. Quickly garnering popularity, \"Wallabee Shoes\" charted at No. 10 in Sapporo radio.\n\nOe appeared on [[All Night Fuji]] (Akin to Saturday Night Live in Japan) on Channel 8 alongside [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] label-mates [[Wham!|Wham]] from Britain.\n\n=== 1985-2007: Greater pop music career success ===\nDirectly after graduating from [[Kwansei Gakuin University]], Oe rose to fame in November 1984 with the success of his sixth single, \"10 People, 10 Colors (\u5341\u4eba\u5341\u8272).\" His third album, Miseinen (\u672a\u6210\u5e74) Juvenile charted at No. 5 on [[Oricon]] (Japanese equivalent to the Billboard weekly chart).\n\nWith his now growing popularity across Japan, Oe toured performing in Japan's largest venues and stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]] (with [[seating capacity]] of 14,471, akin to Madison Square Garden) to promote his fifth album, AVEC Tour Final, in 1987.\n\nOe's seventh album 1234 was awarded Album of the Year in the third [[Japan Gold Disc Award|Gold Disc Awards]] (Japan's equivalent of the Grammy Awards) in the Pop Male Solo Artist Category.\n\nContinuing to tour large venues throughout Japan, Oe released the album, ''Sloppy Joe'', on March 25, 1989, which charted at No. 2 on the [[Oricon]] (Japan's equivalent of Billboard weekly chart).\n\nMeanwhile, Oe appeared as an actor on television for the first time, in the dramatic show entitled Kimi Ga Uso Wo Tuita.\n\nOe's ninth album, APOLLO, was the first of his albums to be recorded in New York City. The album was released to critical acclaim, charting at No.1 in the [[Oricon]] weekly chart on September, 21st 1990. Following APOLLO's success, Oe again toured in stadiums ([[Yokohama Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]]).\n\nOe's single \"Never See You Again (\u683c\u597d\u60aa\u3044\u3075\u3089\u308c\u304b\u305f) Kakko Warui Furare Kata\" was released in September 1990 and was his highest-charting single to date, charting at No.2 in the Oricon weekly chart.\n\nWhile continuing to record and perform, in 2000 Oe established his own record label, Station Kids Records, an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.\n\nOe also began to branch out to musical composition beyond pop music. Among these projects, he scored the soundtrack for the film Noto No Hanayome,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1217486/|title=Senri Oe|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> [[Sanrio Puroland]] Park's Musical titled Believe, music for the performances of illusionist [[Princess Tenko]] Play, for Destiny. Also, notably, Oe scored music for the Japanese animated film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Kono Hoshino Dokokade\" by Yasuda Sisters.\n\n=== 2008-2012: Career shift to jazz ===\nOn December 22, 2007, Oe announced that he would study jazz music in [[School of Jazz (The New School)|The New School for Jazz]] and moved to Manhattan on January 10, 2008, with his then puppy, a [[dachshund]] named Peace.\n\nSince Oe was fifteen years old, he was intent on learning jazz music theory at school. Due to his pop singer-songwriter career unexpectedly taking off, he chose to pause his jazz aspirations later in life.\n\n=== 2012-Present: Beginning of jazz pianist career ===\nAfter graduating from The New School for Jazz, Oe launched his jazz record label in 2012. It was called \"Peace Never Die\" Records, abbreviated to PND Records. His dog, Peace, also appeared in PND's logo. Peace has received a certificate which allows her to officially qualify as an emotional support dog for Oe.\n\nOe's jazz debut album was ''Boys Mature Slow''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzmusicarchives.com/video/senri-oe/5600|title=SENRI OE Boys mature slow /Senri Oe (video)|website=JazzMusicArchives.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nFollowing conversations with former Tokyo Jazz Festival producer, Atsuko Yashima, Oe concluded that his second album's style could expand to include for a jazz 'big band' ensemble.\n\nOe composed eleven pieces for his next album, ''Spooky Hotel'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/B214393|title=Senri Oe|website=www.kennedy-center.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> which was released in 2013.\n\nFollowing ''Spooky Hotel'', Oe's big band performed in the Tokyo Jazz Festival at Tokyo Forum A Hall.\n\nOe  worked towards composing for a drum-less trio was entitled Collective Scribble;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bluenote.co.jp/jp/reports/2015/05/05/senri-oe-ny-trio-collective-scribble-tour-2015.html|title=Senri Oe Trio Bluenote collective Scribble|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Oe remarked that here, saxophone and piano combined with upright bass, \"like a drawing scribble.\"\n\nAt the same time, Oe was creating his fourth jazz vocal album, ''Answer July'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzspeaks.org/senri-oe-record-release-answer-july/|title=Senri Oe Record Release: Answer July|website=Jazz Speaks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicalmemoirs.wordpress.com/2016/07/15/new-cd-releases-reflect-sounds-of-summer-and-celebrate-men-of-jazz/|title=NEW CD RELEASES REFLECT SOUNDS OF SUMMER and CELEBRATE MEN OF JAZZ|date=2016-07-15|website=Musicalmemoirs's Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> with [[Sheila Jordan]], [[Jon Hendricks]], [[Theo Bleckmann]] and [https://laurenkinhan.com/about/ Lauren Kinhan].\n\n''Answer July'' was a Grammy-nominated consideration album in the Best Jazz Album in 2017.\n\nIn addition, Oe challenged himself to adopt the concept of combining pop with jazz in his fifth studio jazz album ''Boys & Girls'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-j-pop-star-turned-jazz-man-senri-oe-talks-solo-piano-for-det-132772|title=Interview: J-Pop star-turned-jazz man Senri Oe talks solo piano for Detroit Jazz Fest|work=AXS|access-date=2019-10-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/04/11/detroit-jazz-festival-chick-corea-bassist-esparanza-spaulding-drummer-terri-lyne-carrington/33738717/|title=2018 Detroit Jazz Fest lineup boasts diversity|website=Detroit News|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khon2.com/living-808/japanese-superstar-senri-oe-plays-the-blue-note/|title=Japanese Superstar Senri Oe plays the Blue Note|date=2019-05-21|website=KHON2|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox2detroit.com/mornings/jazz-pianist-senri-oe-performs|title=Jazz pianist Senri Oe performs|date=2018-09-03|website=FOX 2 Detroit|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/a-whole-new-world-senri-oe-gets-his-kicks-as-a-jazz-pianist/|title=A Whole New World: Senri Oe Gets His Kicks As a Jazz Pianist|last=Magazine|first=JAZZIZ|date=2018-12-15|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> released in 2018.

He has held concerts in Japan's largest stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Yokohama Stadium]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[NHK Hall]], and [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]].\n\nOe has also written and produced music for many artists, including [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Misato Watanabe]], [[Hiromi Go]], [[Hikaru Genji (band)|Hikaru Genji]] and [[Sayuri Ishikawa]].\n\nHe has composed music for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Believe\" which was featured in [[Sanrio Puroland]].\n\n== Early life ==\nSenri Oe was born on September 6, 1960, in Fujiidera city [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. Oe began playing piano at the age of three, and was classically trained by his junior high school teacher Yumi Nara, who would go on to become an acclaimed opera singer. After each of their lessons, Nara would encourage Oe to improvise, and eventually Oe began to compose.\n\nUpon being introduced to music by The Carpenters, Captain & Tenille and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Oe decided to become a singer-songwriter. Soon after, Oe's music repertoire expanded to include jazz musicians such as Chris Conor, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Winton Kelly, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.\n\nIn 1975, Oe participated in the final [[Yamaha Popular Song Contest]] POPCON (akin to American Idol).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagomusicguide.com/featured-artist-senri-oe/|title=FEATURED ARTIST - Senri Oe|date=2018-06-24|website=Chicago Music Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Oe entered [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] and majored in economics while simultaneously beginning to pursue a professional music career. He formed his first bands during his time at university, was scouted by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music]] and signed to [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] Japan in 1981.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 1983-1984: Early pop career and debut album ===\nOn February 27, 1983, Oe performed on [[Sapporo Television Broadcasting|STV Radio]]'s Sunday Jumbo Special in Sapporo, Hokkaido, granting him his initial exposure as a professional musician. Within this segment, Oe began a ten-minute performance in which he improvised a song on live radio.\n\nOe soon released his first single \"Wallabee Shoes  (\u30ef\u30e9\u30d3\u30fc\u306c\u304e\u3059\u3066\u3066),\" followed by his debut album, WAKUWAKU. Quickly garnering popularity, \"Wallabee Shoes\" charted at No. 10 in Sapporo radio.\n\nOe appeared on [[All Night Fuji]] (Akin to Saturday Night Live in Japan) on Channel 8 alongside [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] label-mates [[Wham!|Wham]] from Britain.\n\n=== 1985-2007: Greater pop music career success ===\nDirectly after graduating from [[Kwansei Gakuin University]], Oe rose to fame in November 1984 with the success of his sixth single, \"10 People, 10 Colors (\u5341\u4eba\u5341\u8272).\" His third album, Miseinen (\u672a\u6210\u5e74) Juvenile charted at No. 5 on [[Oricon]] (Japanese equivalent to the Billboard weekly chart).\n\nWith his now growing popularity across Japan, Oe toured performing in Japan's largest venues and stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]] (with [[seating capacity]] of 14,471, akin to Madison Square Garden) to promote his fifth album, AVEC Tour Final, in 1987.\n\nOe's seventh album 1234 was awarded Album of the Year in the third [[Japan Gold Disc Award|Gold Disc Awards]] (Japan's equivalent of the Grammy Awards) in the Pop Male Solo Artist Category.\n\nContinuing to tour large venues throughout Japan, Oe released the album, ''Sloppy Joe'', on March 25, 1989, which charted at No. 2 on the [[Oricon]] (Japan's equivalent of Billboard weekly chart).\n\nMeanwhile, Oe appeared as an actor on television for the first time, in the dramatic show entitled Kimi Ga Uso Wo Tuita.\n\nOe's ninth album, APOLLO, was the first of his albums to be recorded in New York City. The album was released to critical acclaim, charting at No.1 in the [[Oricon]] weekly chart on September, 21st 1990. Following APOLLO's success, Oe again toured in stadiums ([[Yokohama Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]]).\n\nOe's single \"Never See You Again (\u683c\u597d\u60aa\u3044\u3075\u3089\u308c\u304b\u305f) Kakko Warui Furare Kata\" was released in September 1990 and was his highest-charting single to date, charting at No.2 in the Oricon weekly chart.\n\nWhile continuing to record and perform, in 2000 Oe established his own record label, Station Kids Records, an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.\n\nOe also began to branch out to musical composition beyond pop music. Among these projects, he scored the soundtrack for the film Noto No Hanayome,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1217486/|title=Senri Oe|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> [[Sanrio Puroland]] Park's Musical titled Believe, music for the performances of illusionist [[Princess Tenko]] Play, for Destiny. Also, notably, Oe scored music for the Japanese animated film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Kono Hoshino Dokokade\" by Yasuda Sisters.\n\n=== 2008-2012: Career shift to jazz ===\nOn December 22, 2007, Oe announced that he would study jazz music in [[School of Jazz (The New School)|The New School for Jazz]] and moved to Manhattan on January 10, 2008, with his then puppy, a [[dachshund]] named Peace.\n\nSince Oe was fifteen years old, he was intent on learning jazz music theory at school. Due to his pop singer-songwriter career unexpectedly taking off, he chose to pause his jazz aspirations later in life.\n\n=== 2012-Present: Beginning of jazz pianist career ===\nAfter graduating from The New School for Jazz, Oe launched his jazz record label in 2012. It was called \"Peace Never Die\" Records, abbreviated to PND Records. His dog, Peace, also appeared in PND's logo. Peace has received a certificate which allows her to officially qualify as an emotional support dog for Oe.\n\nOe's jazz debut album was ''Boys Mature Slow''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzmusicarchives.com/video/senri-oe/5600|title=SENRI OE Boys mature slow /Senri Oe (video)|website=JazzMusicArchives.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nFollowing conversations with former Tokyo Jazz Festival producer, Atsuko Yashima, Oe concluded that his second album's style could expand to include for a jazz 'big band' ensemble.\n\nOe composed eleven pieces for his next album, ''Spooky Hotel'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/B214393|title=Senri Oe|website=www.kennedy-center.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> which was released in 2013.\n\nFollowing ''Spooky Hotel'', Oe's big band performed in the Tokyo Jazz Festival at Tokyo Forum A Hall.\n\nOe  worked towards composing for a drum-less trio was entitled Collective Scribble;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bluenote.co.jp/jp/reports/2015/05/05/senri-oe-ny-trio-collective-scribble-tour-2015.html|title=Senri Oe Trio Bluenote collective Scribble|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Oe remarked that here, saxophone and piano combined with upright bass, \"like a drawing scribble.\"\n\nAt the same time, Oe was creating his fourth jazz vocal album, ''Answer July'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzspeaks.org/senri-oe-record-release-answer-july/|title=Senri Oe Record Release: Answer July|website=Jazz Speaks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicalmemoirs.wordpress.com/2016/07/15/new-cd-releases-reflect-sounds-of-summer-and-celebrate-men-of-jazz/|title=NEW CD RELEASES REFLECT SOUNDS OF SUMMER and CELEBRATE MEN OF JAZZ|date=2016-07-15|website=Musicalmemoirs's Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> with [[Sheila Jordan]], [[Jon Hendricks]], [[Theo Bleckmann]] and [https://laurenkinhan.com/about/ Lauren Kinhan].\n\n''Answer July'' was a Grammy-nominated consideration album in the Best Jazz Album in 2017.\n\nIn addition, Oe challenged himself to adopt the concept of combining pop with jazz in his fifth studio jazz album ''Boys & Girls'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-j-pop-star-turned-jazz-man-senri-oe-talks-solo-piano-for-det-132772|title=Interview: J-Pop star-turned-jazz man Senri Oe talks solo piano for Detroit Jazz Fest|work=AXS|access-date=2019-10-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/04/11/detroit-jazz-festival-chick-corea-bassist-esparanza-spaulding-drummer-terri-lyne-carrington/33738717/|title=2018 Detroit Jazz Fest lineup boasts diversity|website=Detroit News|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khon2.com/living-808/japanese-superstar-senri-oe-plays-the-blue-note/|title=Japanese Superstar Senri Oe plays the Blue Note|date=2019-05-21|website=KHON2|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox2detroit.com/mornings/jazz-pianist-senri-oe-performs|title=Jazz pianist Senri Oe performs|date=2018-09-03|website=FOX 2 Detroit|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/a-whole-new-world-senri-oe-gets-his-kicks-as-a-jazz-pianist/|title=A Whole New World: Senri Oe Gets His Kicks As a Jazz Pianist|last=Magazine|first=JAZZIZ|date=2018-12-15|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> released in 2018.
