It was responsible under [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] for protecting industry along the [[Humber Estuary]] and airfields in [[Lincolnshire]] during [[The Blitz]]. Later it defended the coast of [[East Anglia]] against ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' 'hit-and-run' attacks. It was later converted to a field force formation, covered the embarkation ports for [[Operation Overlord]] and defended London against [[V-1 flying bomb]]s. It served in the [[Western Front (World War II)#1944.E2.80.9345: The Second Front|campaign in North West Europe]], defending [[Antwerp]] against V-1s and supervising the clean-up of the notorious [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]].\n\n==Origin==\nWith the expansion of Britain's Anti-Aircraft (AA) defences in the late 1930s, new formations were created to command the growing number of [[Royal Artillery]] (RA) and [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) AA gun and searchlight units. 39th AA Brigade was raised on 29 September 1938 at [[Retford]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], the HQ later moving to [[RAF Digby]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. Initially, it formed part of [[2nd Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|2nd AA Division]], and its units were all transferred from other brigades within the division. Its role was to defend airfields and other vulnerable points (VPs) in Lincolnshire and [[Humberside]].

In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. The same month, 39 AA Bde came under the command of the newly formed [[7th Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|7 AA Division]], which was created to control the AA defences of North East England, [[Yorkshire]] and Humberside. Its exact responsibilities were still being worked out when war broke out, and in fact 39 AA Bde remained under the operational control of 2 AA Division into 1940.

However, the most intense period of raiding (the [[Hull Blitz]]) occurred from 3 to 9 May. Many of the plotted raids flew straight on to bomb [[Liverpool]], but several dropped their bombs on Hull as a secondary target. Fires started on 7/8 May drew enemy aircraft to the target, and many of the bombs were large parachute mines that caused widespread damage and many casualties across the city. Three further waves of bombers attacked the still-burning city the following night. The Northern Rovers detachment at Alexandra Dock was directly under some of the heaviest bombing and suffered casualties. Three or four aircraft were shot down on each night by AA guns or fighters cooperating with S/Ls. One detachment of 358 S/L Bty aboard the river barge ''Clem'' shot down a low-flying [[Heinkel He 111]] with LMG fire.<ref name = WD39/><ref name = CollierXXX/>\n\nThe Blitz is generally considered to have ended on 12 May,<ref name = Pile>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/38149/page/5973 Pile's despatch.]</ref> but there was another significant raid on Hull on 28/29 May, mainly minelaying that caused the Humber to be closed to shipping for some time.

The attached units having left for other duties, the brigade kept 110th and 176th HAA Rgts and 161 AAOR under its command, and was joined by [[73rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|73rd LAA Rgt]] (218, 220 and 296 LAA Btys with 1573 Pln, RASC), a mobile unit that had landed on D Day. However, there was dispute as to whether units at Le Havre were under [[US Navy]] or 21st Army Group control, and the brigade had to improvise its own support services, with the brigadier acing as military commandant of the town. The gunsites had to be cleared of mines and boobytraps before the guns could be emplaced (16 of the 48 HAA guns and the radar sets had still to arrive from the UK).

The HAA units also supplied working parties to help unload shipping at Dieppe docks. In late October 176th HAA Rgt moved up from Dieppe to relieve 103rd HAA Rgt at Boulogne, 161 LAA Bty, 54th ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]) LAA Rgt replaced 395/120th LAA Bty, and D Trp of 368 S/L Bty, 42nd (Robin Hoods) S/L Rgt, relieved 3 LAA/SL Bty.<ref name = WD44/>\n\nApart from a few aircraft trying to drop supplies by night to cut-off German troops, there was little ''Luftwaffe'' activity, and by mid-November the LAA strength could be reduced, with 161/54th and 230/139th LAA Btys moving into Belgium, and 1 LAA/SL Bty relieving 320/93rd LAA Bty. At the beginning of December the brigade HQ was ordered to move forward again, to [[Calais]], with 176th HAA Rgt, 161 AAOR and 6 LAA/SL Bty, while 110th HAA Rgt, 139th LAA Rgt and D/368/42nd S/L Trp moved to [[Ostend]] under [[75th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|75 AA Bde]].

Brigadier Searight was absent for a month in temporary command of 76 AA Bde.

In February 1939 the TA's AA defences came under the control of a new [[Anti-Aircraft Command]]. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. The same month, 39 AA Bde came under the command of the newly formed [[7th Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|7 AA Division]], which was created to control the AA defences of North East England, [[Yorkshire]] and Humberside. Its exact responsibilities were still being worked out when war broke out, and in fact 39 AA Bde remained under the operational control of 2 AA Division into 1940.

However, the most intense period of raiding (the [[Hull Blitz]]) occurred from 3 to 9 May. Many of the plotted raids flew straight on to bomb [[Liverpool]], but several dropped their bombs on Hull as a secondary target. Fires started on 7/8 May drew enemy aircraft to the target, and many of the bombs were large parachute mines that caused widespread damage and many casualties across the city. Three further waves of bombers attacked the still-burning city the following night. The Northern Rovers detachment at Alexandra Dock was directly under some of the heaviest bombing and suffered casualties. Three or four aircraft were shot down on each night by AA guns or fighters cooperating with S/Ls. One detachment of 358 S/L Bty aboard the river barge ''Clem'' shot down a low-flying [[Heinkel He 111]] with LMG fire.<ref name = WD39/><ref name = CollierXXX/>\n\nThe Blitz is generally considered to have ended on 12 May,<ref name = Pile>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/38149/page/5973 Pile's despatch.]</ref> but there was another significant raid on Hull on 28/29 May, mainly minelaying that caused the Humber to be closed to shipping for some time.

Brigade HQ moved to [[New Romney]], with guns deployed to [[Littlehampton]] to guard '[[Phoenix breakwaters|Phoenixes]]' waiting to be used in constructing the [[Mulberry Harbour]].<ref name = WD44/>\n\n===Order of Battle April\u2013September 1944===\nThe brigade was now under the command of GHQ AA Troops for [[21st Army Group]], and from the end of April it had the following composition:<ref name = WD44/><ref name = Rout319>Routledge, Table XLIX, p. 319.</ref>\n* 110th HAA Rgt\n* 176th HAA Rgt\n* [[20th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|20th LAA Rgt]] \u2013 ''less two Btys with  [[76th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|76]] and [[80th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|80 AA Bdes]] for [[D Day]] landings''<ref>Routledge, p. 311.</ref>\n* 1 LAA/SL Bty (with 1689 Section, RASC, and [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (REME) Workshops) \u2013 ''at [[RAF Hunsdon]], later [[RAF Colerne]]''\n* 2 LAA/SL Bty (with 1690 Section, RASC, and REME Wkshps) \u2013 ''at [[RAF Newchurch]]''\n* 4 LAA/SL Bty (with 1692 Section, RASC, and REME Wkshps)\u2013 ''at Hunsdon from August''\n* 5 LAA/SL Bty (with 1693 Section, RASC, and REME Wkshps)\u2013 ''from August''\n* [[557th Moonlight Battery, Royal Artillery|557 Independent S/L Bty]] \u2013 ''from June; embarked July''\n* 1 Mobile S/L Troop, [[Canadian Army]]\n* 161 AAOR (with Signal Section, RCS)\n* 202 Fixed Defences\n* 13 Fire Command Post\n* 30 Coast Observer Detachment\n* 103 AA Bde Signal Section, RCS\n* 103 AA Bde Maintenance Detachment, REME\n* 16 Radio Maintenance Detachment, REME\n\n===Operation Diver===\nOnce Operation Overlord began on D Day (6 June), 103 AA Bde anticipated that it would begin to land in Normandy on D+37.<ref name = Rout319/><ref>Routledge, p. 317.</ref> However, the first V-1 'Divers' crossed the brigade's GDA during the night of 12/13 June, and two days later the guns at Littlehampton and Newchurch were heavily engaged. AA Command then put Operation Diver into effect, and mobile HAA batteries were redeployed to London from protecting the Overlord embarkation ports. 103 AA Brigade HQ went to [[Southend-on-Sea]], 110th HAA Rgt to the 'Thames North' defences under [[37th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|37 AA Bde]] and 176th HA Rgt to 'Thames South' under [[28th (Thames and Medway) Anti-Aircraft Brigade|28 (Thames and Medway) AA Bde]]. This deployment lasted until 13 September, when the brigade began to move to marshalling areas for embarkation.<ref name = WD44/><ref>Routledge, p. 410.</ref>\n\n==North West Europe==\n===Channel Ports===\nBrigade HQ landed in Normandy on 14 September and by 23 September was established with its signal section and REME detachment at [[Le Havre]], which had been captured in [[Operation Astonia]]. The attached units having left for other duties, the brigade kept 110th and 176th HAA Rgts and 161 AAOR under its command, and was joined by [[73rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|73rd LAA Rgt]] (218, 220 and 296 LAA Btys with 1573 Pln, RASC), a mobile unit that had landed on D Day. However, there was dispute as to whether units at Le Havre were under [[US Navy]] or 21st Army Group control, and the brigade had to improvise its own support services, with the brigadier acing as military commandant of the town. The gunsites had to be cleared of mines and boobytraps before the guns could be emplaced (16 of the 48 HAA guns and the radar sets had still to arrive from the UK). Luckily, there was no ''Luftwaffe'' activity over the port, which began unloading ships on 2 October.<ref name = WD44/><ref>Routledge, pp. 321\u20133; Table LI, p. 329</ref><ref>Ellis, Appendix IV.</ref>\n\nAs 21st Army Group continued to advance, reductions in the defences required for rear bases and lines of communication enabled 103 AA Bde to hand over to US AA Artillery (AAA) units and move up in mid-October to relieve 76 and 80 AA Bdes at [[Dieppe]] and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]:<ref name = WD44/><ref>Routledge, p. 334.</ref>\n\n'''Dieppe'''\n* 103 AA Bde HQ (with Signals and REME)\n* 110th HAA Rgt\n* 176th HAA Rgt\n* 139th LAA Rgt \u2013 ''already deployed at Dieppe''\n* 3 LAA/SL Bty\n* 161 AAOR (main body)\n'''Boulogne'''\n* [[103rd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|103rd HAA Rgt]]\n* 320 LAA Bty, [[93rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|93rd LAA Rgt]] \u2013 ''equipped with triple [[20 mm Polsten]] guns''\n* 395 LAA Bty, [[120th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|120th LAA Rgt]] \u2013 ''already deployed at Boulogne''\n* 161 AAOR (sub-operations room)\n\nThe brigade soon learned to avoid selecting gun positions in the muddy battlefields, and if possible to re-use German gun positions with their elaborate dug-outs. The HAA units also supplied working parties to help unload shipping at Dieppe docks. In late October 176th HAA Rgt moved up from Dieppe to relieve 103rd HAA Rgt at Boulogne, 161 LAA Bty, 54th ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]) LAA Rgt replaced 395/120th LAA Bty, and D Trp of 368 S/L Bty, 42nd (Robin Hoods) S/L Rgt, relieved 3 LAA/SL Bty.<ref name = WD44/>\n\nApart from a few aircraft trying to drop supplies by night to cut-off German troops, there was little ''Luftwaffe'' activity, and by mid-November the LAA strength could be reduced, with 161/54th and 230/139th LAA Btys moving into Belgium, and 1 LAA/SL Bty relieving 320/93rd LAA Bty. At the beginning of December the brigade HQ was ordered to move forward again, to [[Calais]], with 176th HAA Rgt, 161 AAOR and 6 LAA/SL Bty, while 110th HAA Rgt, 139th LAA Rgt and D/368/42nd S/L Trp moved to [[Ostend]] under [[75th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|75 AA Bde]]. The brigade was also responsible for 1 LAA/SL Bty, which moved back to [[Caen]]; in affect, 103 AA Bde now commanded all the remaining British AA troops in France.<ref name = WD44/>\n\nIn February 1945 the AA defences of Calais were closed down, and all the units moved up to join other HQs. Brigadier Searight was absent for a month in temporary command of 76 AA Bde. With no other duties and in view of the planned conversion of AA troops to infantry units for occupation roles in Germany, 103 AA Bde HQ moved to Hombeek, near [[Mechelen]] in Belgium, where it opened an infantry training centre.<ref name = WD45>103 AA Bde War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4900.</ref><ref name = Rout360>Routledge, pp. 360\u20131.</ref>\n\n===Order of Battle March\u2013April 1945===\nOn 5 March 1945, 103 AA Bde HQ relieved 5 [[Royal Marines]] AA Bde in the defences of [[Antwerp]], with the following units under command:<ref name = WD45/><ref name = Rout333>Routledge, pp. 333\u201341.</ref>\n* 110th HAA Rgt\n* [[155th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|155th (M) HAA Rgt]]\n* [[183rd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|183rd (M) HAA Rgt]]\n* 93rd LAA Rgt  \u2013 ''rejoined from 7 April''\n* [[114th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|114th LAA Rgt]]\n* 139th LAA Rgt\n* 161 AAOR\n* 21 AA Wksp Co, REME\n* 806, 845, 846 Smoke Companies, [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Pioneer Corps]]\n\nIt also had operational control of:\n* 465 Bty, [[146th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|146th HAA Rgt]] \u2013 ''from mid-March''\n* 10 and part 7 LAA Btys, [[4th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|4th LAA Rgt]]\n* 218/73 LAA Bty\n* 7 S/L Bty, [[1st Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|1st S/L Rgt]]\n* 411/54 S/L Bty\n* No 4 Detachment, No 1 Local Warning (Radar) Trp, RA \u2013 ''until mid-March''\n* 159 Balloon Wing, RAF\n* [[601st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Gun Battalion|601st AAA Gun Bn]], US Army \u2013 ''until mid-March''\n* Two Btys [[787th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion|787th AAA Automatic Weapons Bn]], US Army \u2013 ''16 March to 6 April; equipped with [[M45 Quadmount#Mountings|M51 quad 0.5-inch]]''\n* Two Btys [[789th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Batallion|789th AAA Automatic Weapons Bn]], US Army \u2013 ''until 15 March''\n* [[24th Chemical Battalion|24th Chemical Smoke Generator Bn]], US Army \u2013 ''until April''\n\n===Antwerp 'X'===\nOnce again, the brigade was engaged against 'Divers', the vital port of Antwerp having been under attack from V-1s since the previous autumn and an elaborate defence set-up (Antwerp 'X') was in place. The HAA units began to be issued with No 10 Predictors (the all-electric [[Gun data computer|Bell Labs AAA Computer]]) and GL Radar No 3 Mark V (the [[SCR-584 radar]] set), and the success rate against V-1s began to rise. A few high-flying jet aircraft dropped bombs, but the threat from aircraft was low, and the smoke screen was closed down on 14 March and LAA units redeployed elsewhere. The flying bomb onslaught against Antwerp lasted until the end of March.<ref name = WD45/><ref name = Rout333/>\n\nBrigadier Searight was appointed to command a Line of Communication Sub-Area on 4 April and was temporarily replaced by Brig J.G.S.

Harris arrived on 13 April.<ref name = WD45/>\n\n===Occupation duties===\nOn 17 April, [[50th Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|50 AA Bde]] arrived at Antwerp to relieve 103 AA Bde, which became available for new duties. From 25 April it became '''103rd Infantry Brigade''', consisting of 110th, [[111th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|111th]] and 176th HAA Rgts and [[1st Durham Rifle Volunteers|113th (Durham Light Infantry) LAA Rgt]], all of which handed in their AA equipment and became garrison battalions, while 114th and 139th LAA Rgts disbanded. The brigade moved to [[Bad Fallingbostel|Fallingbostel]] in Germany and took over occupation duties under [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]], including responsibility for ameliorating the horrors of the newly-liberated [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Belsen]] concentration camp.<ref name = WD45/><ref name = Rout360/><ref>Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[German surrender at L\u00fcneburg Heath]] was signed on 5 May the occupation troops were fully engaged in collecting, controlling and repatriating [[Displaced persons]], released [[Prisoner of war|Prisoners of war]], and surrendered German troops. The brigade was joined by 633rd Infantry Regt, RA (formerly [[20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich)|34th (Queen's Own Royal West Kent) Searchlight Rgt]]) on 6 May, and came under the command of [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]]. On 3 June the brigade (less 633rd Rgt) moved to [[Kreuztal]] under [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]] and took over responsibility from US troops in the area. Later it moved to [[Allenbach]].<ref name = WD45/>\n\n176th HAA Regiment disbanded on 31 October, and 110th and 111th HAA Rgts on 4 February 1946. 103 Infantry Brigade HQ itself disbanded on 15 February.<ref name = WD45/><ref name = WD46>103 AA Bde War Diary 1946, TNA file WO 171/8882.</ref>\n\n==Commanders==\nThe following officers commanded 39/103 AA Bde during World War II:<ref name = MAL/><ref name = WD39/><ref name = WD42/><ref name = WD43/><ref name = WD45/>\n* Brigadier O.T.

Her childhood sweetheart is Dev ([[Abhay Deol]]), the son of a rich businessman. Paro cares for him immensely, and fully expects a future with him.\nDev constantly takes Paro's love and affection for granted. He grows up to be arrogant and lazy, which causes his father to send him to [[London]] to complete his education. While separated by distance, Paro and Dev's youthful love only blossoms more, despite Dev becoming increasingly more egotistical and entitled. After finishing his studies, Dev returns to Chandigarh and meets Paro, and they rekindle their romance. After some time, Dev overhears scandalous rumours about Paro concerning her reputation and sexual history, which he immediately believes. Paro is shocked to see Dev's chauvinist attitude towards her, even after she claims innocence. Dev hypocritically passes judgement on Paro and does not approve of the things that he has heard. Paro turns her back on him when she hears him insult her and rashly agrees to marry a man of her parents' choice. On her wedding day, Dev learns that the rumors were false but his ego doesn't let him accept his mistake, and he lets Paro marry someone else.\n\n===Chanda===\nLeni ([[Kalki Koechlin]]) is a Delhi student of half-European descent. A date with her much older boyfriend turns sexual and lands Leni in an [[DPS MMS Scandal|MMS sex scandal]]. The incident becomes public knowledge after the video is widely circulated. Her father, having watched the video, commits suicide out of shame and disgust, and Leni's family decides to send her to live in a small rural town. Refusing to live a life of shame and ridicule, she returns to Delhi where she works as a [[prostitute]] at night, while continuing with her studies during the day. She adopts the name 'Chanda' for her profession. Her 'foreign' looks mean her services are reserved for the highest-paying customers and she finds some dignity and independence in the new way of living. One night, an inebriated, half-conscious customer is brought to her room - it turns out to be Dev.\n\n===Dev===\nDev, tormented by Paro's wedding, has been seeking refuge in alcohol and drugs. He finds some solace with Chanda but is unable to forget Paro. While in a drug fueled haze, he calls Paro's husband in the middle of the night, Paro visits him at the cheap lodge where he is staying. She shows her love by taking care of him but spurns his attempts at physical intimacy. The meeting ends on a bitter note, and Paro returns to her married life. Dev resolves to go back to Chanda, but confronted by the reality of her profession, he abandons her, too. He resumes his destructive lifestyle of alcohol, drugs, and reckless behaviour. Months later, after his life has completely fallen apart and hit an all-time low, Dev attempts to pick up the pieces. He seeks Chanda once again and, with her help, sets out to start life afresh.\n\n==Cultural references==\n* Kalki's character is a modern adaptation of Chandramukhi, who was most recently played by [[Madhuri Dixit]] in [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]]'s ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]''. In the film, the young Leni is shown to be a fan of Madhuri's, listening to the songs of Chandramukhi. When she takes up prostitution as profession, she adopts the name Chandramukhi or Chanda, in honor of the character.\n* Chanda's back story in which she gets embroiled in an [[DPS MMS Scandal|MMS scandal while in school is a reference to a similar scandal that took place at Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram in 2004]].<ref name=\"tart\">{{cite news|title=Tart with a heart |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/tart-with-a-heart/articleshow/5451985.cms |first=Nikhat |last=Kazmi |date=16 January 2010|publisher=[[Times of India]] Crest Edition |accessdate=Sep 2, 2015|quote=The turning point in Leni's life was the MMS scandal and Kashyap confesses he used the reference to the DPS MMS scandal to show what happens to a person whose privacy is affected by cheap, hidden cameras.}}</ref> \n* Later in the film, when Dev is depressed after losing both Paro and Chanda, he is driving his new BMW while heavily drunk.

Her childhood sweetheart is Dev ([[Abhay Deol]]), the son of a rich businessman. Paro cares for him immensely, and fully expects a future with him.\nDev constantly takes Paro's love and affection for granted. He grows up to be arrogant and lazy, which causes his father to send him to [[London]] to complete his education. While separated by distance, Paro and Dev's youthful love only blossoms more, despite Dev becoming increasingly more egotistical and entitled. After finishing his studies, Dev returns to Chandigarh and meets Paro, and they rekindle their romance. After some time, Dev overhears scandalous rumours about Paro concerning her reputation and sexual history, which he immediately believes. Paro is shocked to see Dev's chauvinist attitude towards her, even after she claims innocence. Dev hypocritically passes judgement on Paro and does not approve of the things that he has heard. Paro turns her back on him when she hears him insult her and rashly agrees to marry a man of her parents' choice. On her wedding day, Dev learns that the rumors were false but his ego doesn't let him accept his mistake, and he lets Paro marry someone else.\n\n===Chanda===\nLeni ([[Kalki Koechlin]]) is a Delhi student of half-European descent. A date with her much older boyfriend turns sexual and lands Leni in an [[DPS MMS Scandal|MMS sex scandal]]. The incident becomes public knowledge after the video is widely circulated. Her father, having watched the video, commits suicide out of shame and disgust, and Leni's family decides to send her to live in a small rural town. Refusing to live a life of shame and ridicule, she returns to Delhi where she works as a [[prostitute]] at night, while continuing with her studies during the day. She adopts the name 'Chanda' for her profession. Her 'foreign' looks mean her services are reserved for the highest-paying customers and she finds some dignity and independence in the new way of living. One night, an inebriated, half-conscious customer is brought to her room - it turns out to be Dev.\n\n===Dev===\nDev, tormented by Paro's wedding, has been seeking refuge in alcohol and drugs. He finds some solace with Chanda but is unable to forget Paro. While in a drug fueled haze, he calls Paro's husband in the middle of the night, Paro visits him at the cheap lodge where he is staying. She shows her love by taking care of him but spurns his attempts at physical intimacy. The meeting ends on a bitter note, and Paro returns to her married life. Dev resolves to go back to Chanda, but confronted by the reality of her profession, he abandons her, too. He resumes his destructive lifestyle of alcohol, drugs, and reckless behaviour. Months later, after his life has completely fallen apart and hit an all-time low, Dev attempts to pick up the pieces. He seeks Chanda once again and, with her help, sets out to start life afresh.\n\n==Cultural references==\n* Kalki's character is a modern adaptation of Chandramukhi, who was most recently played by [[Madhuri Dixit]] in [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]]'s ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]''. In the film, the young Leni is shown to be a fan of Madhuri's, listening to the songs of Chandramukhi. When she takes up prostitution as profession, she adopts the name Chandramukhi or Chanda, in honor of the character.\n* Chanda's back story in which she gets embroiled in an [[DPS MMS Scandal|MMS scandal while in school is a reference to a similar scandal that took place at Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram in 2004]].<ref name=\"tart\">{{cite news|title=Tart with a heart |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/tart-with-a-heart/articleshow/5451985.cms |first=Nikhat |last=Kazmi |date=16 January 2010|publisher=[[Times of India]] Crest Edition |accessdate=Sep 2, 2015|quote=The turning point in Leni's life was the MMS scandal and Kashyap confesses he used the reference to the DPS MMS scandal to show what happens to a person whose privacy is affected by cheap, hidden cameras.}}</ref> \n* Later in the film, when Dev is depressed after losing both Paro and Chanda, he is driving his new BMW while heavily drunk.

Her close friend ([[Chethan Jayalal]]) comes to know about her interest in taking photos. They decide to go to a studio nearby for taking their photos. The decision changes their destiny.\n\n=== Isha ===\nTwo strangers, Isha ([[Isha Sharvani]]) and Jinu, a thief, ([[Nivin Pauly]]), meet for a similar cause on New Year's Eve. They have a conversation and then a series of twists and turns happen.\n\n=== Gauri ===\nThe short film tells the love story of a married couple living in a hill station. After materializing their love affair through register marriage, Gauri ([[Kavya Madhavan]]) and Jonathan Antony ([[Biju Menon]]) choose the place to begin their married life. Jo is crazy about trekking while Gauri is a dancer and teaches the art to her students. On the eve of their wedding anniversary, a tragedy occurs which changes their life.\n\n=== Kullante Bharya ===\nA newlywed couple comes to stay in an apartment. The husband played by Jinu Ben who is only 5 feet 1 inches is shorter than his extremely tall wife played by the 6 feet tall young newcomer [[Reenu Mathews]]. This gives a chance to their neighbours to gossip about them. As the couple lives happily, they expect their baby to add to the joy. But destiny has something else in store for them. The whole film is pictured from the point of view of a person who is bed-ridden after an accident (played by [[Dulquer Salmaan]]). It is reminiscent of the photographer in wheelchair observing his neighbors in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timescity.com/mumbai-movie/anchu-sundarikal/3793 |title=Anchu Sundarikal Review |publisher=Timescity.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Aami ===\nA businessman, Ajmal ([[Fahadh Faasil]]), faces a row of events during his journey from Malappuram to Kochi.

Her close friend ([[Chethan Jayalal]]) comes to know about her interest in taking photos. They decide to go to a studio nearby for taking their photos. The decision changes their destiny.\n\n=== Isha ===\nTwo strangers, Isha ([[Isha Sharvani]]) and Jinu, a thief, ([[Nivin Pauly]]), meet for a similar cause on New Year's Eve. They have a conversation and then a series of twists and turns happen.\n\n=== Gauri ===\nThe short film tells the love story of a married couple living in a hill station. After materializing their love affair through register marriage, Gauri ([[Kavya Madhavan]]) and Jonathan Antony ([[Biju Menon]]) choose the place to begin their married life. Jo is crazy about trekking while Gauri is a dancer and teaches the art to her students. On the eve of their wedding anniversary, a tragedy occurs which changes their life.\n\n=== Kullante Bharya ===\nA newlywed couple comes to stay in an apartment. The husband played by Jinu Ben who is only 5 feet 1 inches is shorter than his extremely tall wife played by the 6 feet tall young newcomer [[Reenu Mathews]]. This gives a chance to their neighbours to gossip about them. As the couple lives happily, they expect their baby to add to the joy. But destiny has something else in store for them. The whole film is pictured from the point of view of a person who is bed-ridden after an accident (played by [[Dulquer Salmaan]]). It is reminiscent of the photographer in wheelchair observing his neighbors in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timescity.com/mumbai-movie/anchu-sundarikal/3793 |title=Anchu Sundarikal Review |publisher=Timescity.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Aami ===\nA businessman, Ajmal ([[Fahadh Faasil]]), faces a row of events during his journey from Malappuram to Kochi.

Her family is desperately poor, but her life is full of simple pleasures, like raising her black-and-white speckled goat, and having her mother brush her hair by the light of an oil lamp. But now the harsh Himalayan monsoons wash away all that remains of the family's crops, Lakshmi's stepfather says she must leave home and take a job to support her family.\n\nHe introduces her to a charming stranger who tells her she will find her a job as a maid working for a wealthy woman in the city. Glad to be able to help, Lakshmi undertakes the long journey to India and arrives at \u201cHappiness House\u201d full of hope. But she soon learns the horrible truth: she has been sold into prostitution.\n\nAn old woman named Mumtaz rules the brothel with cruelty and cunning. She tells Lakshmi that she is trapped there until she can pay off her family's debt \u2013 then cheats Lakshmi of her meager earnings so that she can never leave.\n\nLakshmi's life becomes a nightmare from which she cannot escape. Still, she lives by her mother's words \u2013 \u201cSimply to endure is to triumph\u201d \u2013 and gradually, she forms friendships with the other girls that enable her to survive in this terrifying new life.  She also teaches herself to read and speak in English through listening to the conversations of people around her and books she manages to take.\n\nEventually, Lakshmi meets an American man, who arrives and disguises himself as a client to gather the evidence he needs to prosecute Mumtaz and her associates. Mumtaz is ultimately arrested, thus freeing Lakshmi and the other girls.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Lakshmi''', a thirteen-year-old farm girl in danger, the narrator and protagonist of the novel.

She oversees all the girls and \u201cmanages\u201d their debts.

Once she ran away but the goonda (men who work for Mumtaz) caught her, beat her, and returned her to the Happiness House. They are the reason her face is lopsided.

He is obsessed with David Beckham and soccer. He goes to school everyday and comes home to the Happiness House.

[[Ambika Chakrabarty]] and [[Niranjan Sengupta]], had earlier been elected from Tollygunge several number of times within the 1950-70s. Both were veteran fighters of the Bengal Independence movement, having been members of the Chittagong Jugantar Party and the Dhaka Anushilan Samity, respectively.
