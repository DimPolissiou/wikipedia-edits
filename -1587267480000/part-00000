Klein's cross from the right wing made contact with Fire midfielder [[Jesse Marsch]] who failed to clear the ball, allowing [[Miklos Molnar]] to make light contact and roll the ball past keeper [[Zach Thornton]] for the only goal of the match. The Fire responded by using its attacking forces to find an equalizer, but failed to break the Wizards defense and goalkeeper [[Tony Meola]], who made ten saves in the final. Meola earned his 5th shutout of the playoffs in addition to 16 clean sheets to his name from the regular season.\n\n===Details===\n{{football box\n|date=October 15, 2000\n|time=15:30 [[Eastern Daylight Time|EST]]\n|team1=[[Kansas City Wizards]]\n|score=1\u20130\n|report=[https://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mls-cup/2000 Report]\n|team2=[[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]\n|goals1=[[Miklos Molnar|Molnar]] {{goal|11}}\n|goals2=\n|stadium=[[Robert F.

He also served as a United States Senator from that state from 1880 to 1891.\n\nA former [[United States Whig Party|Whig]], and a firm believer in slavery and Southern states' rights, Brown was a leading secessionist in 1861, and led his state into the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Yet he also defied the Confederate government's wartime policies: he resisted the military draft, believing that local troops should be used only for the defense of Georgia; and denounced Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] as an incipient tyrant, challenging Confederate impressment of animals and goods to supply the troops, and slaves to work in military encampments and on the lines. Several other governors followed his lead.\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], Brown joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] for a time, and was appointed as chief justice of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] from 1865 to 1870. Later he rejoined the Democrats, became president of the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]] and began to amass great wealth; he was estimated to be a millionaire by 1880. He benefited from using [[convict leasing|convicts leased]] from state, county and local governments in his [[Coal mine|coal mining operations]] in [[Dade County, Georgia|Dade County]]. His Dade Coal Company bought other coal and iron companies, and by 1889 was known as the Georgia Mining, Manufacturing and Investment Company. Finally, he was elected by the state legislature as a two-term [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], serving from 1880 to 1891.\n\nHe saved [[The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] financially in the 1870s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPVv-GxjmZE&t=3101|title=Albert Mohler - Ask Anything Live (Episode 8)|last=Southern Seminary|date=September 14, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> There is now an endowed chair, the Joseph Emerson Brown Chair of Christian Theology, at the institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpnews.net/20683/southern-trustees-elect-mohler-to-storied-chair-of-theology|title=Southern trustees elect Mohler to storied chair of theology|website=Baptist Press}}</ref> Brown and his wife, Elizabeth Grisham Brown, were honored in 1928 by a statue installed on the state capitol grounds.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nJoseph Emerson Brown was born on April 15, 1821, in [[Pickens County, South Carolina|Pickens County]], [[South Carolina]], to Mackey Brown and Sally (Rice) Brown.

The Western and Atlantic Railroad was mismanaged, and unable to produce the income Brown required to fund his public education proposal. In 1858, Governor Brown appointed [[John Wood Lewis Sr.|John W. Lewis]], his landlord and benefactor from Brown's early days in Canton, to the position of Superintendent of the state-owned railroad. Lewis was a successful businessman, and immediately undertook reforms to turn around the failing enterprise. The railroad, said to be in \"dire financial straits\", required the same strict economic controls Lewis had practiced in his private businesses. In the three years that Lewis ran the railroad, he was able to turn the business into a money making enterprise, paying $400,000 per year into the state treasury.<ref name=\"Knight1917\">{{cite book|author=Lucian Lamar Knight|title=The period of expansion or Georgia in the process of growth, 1802-1857 (continued) ; The period of division or Georgia in the assertion of state rights, 1857-1872 ; The period of rehabilitation or Georgia's rise from the ashes of war, 1872-1916 ; Georgia miscellanies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVlKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA717|year=1917|publisher=Lewis Publishing Company|page=717}}</ref>\n\n===Second term===\nBrown easily won re-election in 1859 when he defeated a young [[Warren Akin Sr.]] (who was just beginning his political career) by a margin of 60%-40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=74253|title=Akin, Warren|publisher=OurCampaigns.com|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBrown was a minor slave owner; in 1850, he owned five slaves.<ref>{{cite census | url = https://archive.org/stream/7thcensus0089unit#page/n197/mode/2up| title = 1850 United States Census, Slave Schedules| year = 1850| location = | roll = | page = | line = | enumdist = | filmnum = | nafilm = | accessdate = March 6, 2016}}</ref> By 1860 when he was governor, he owned a total of 19 slaves and several farms in [[Cherokee County, Georgia]].<ref>{{cite census | url = https://archive.org/stream/acpl_slavecensus_03_reel03rs#page/n9/mode/2up| title = 1860 United States Census, Slave Schedules| year = 1860| location = | roll = | page = 4, 8, | line = | enumdist = | filmnum = | nafilm = | accessdate = March 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBrown became a strong supporter of [[secession]] from the United States after [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s election and South Carolina's secession in 1860.

As U.S. troops closed in on the city, and with the fall of the capital imminent, Governor Brown ordered [[Quartermaster General]] [[Ira Roe Foster]] to remove the state records. The task proved to be difficult, as it was undertaken in the midst of chaos.\n\n{{quote box|quote = Gov. Brown, thinking first of the valuable and perishable State property, ordered Gen. Ira Foster, Georgia's quartermaster general (who was always prompt and efficient), to secure its removal. Some of the books and other similar property were stored in the Lunatic Asylum, three miles out of town. A train of cars was held at the depot to carry off other State property, and Gen. Foster made herculean efforts to carry out the Governor's orders, but, such was the general terror and the rush to leave town, it was next to impossible to procure labor.\n\nWhen the Governor saw the condition of affairs, he went to the penitentiary, had the convicts drawn up in a line, and made them a short speech; he appealed to their patriotic pride and offered pardon to each one who would help remove the State property and then enlist for the defense of Georgia. They responded promptly, were put under the command of Gen. Foster, and did valuable service in loading the train. When that was done each one was given a suit of gray, and a gun, and they were formed into a military company of which one of their number was captain. They were ordered to report for duty to Gen.

He also served as a United States Senator from that state from 1880 to 1891.\n\nA former [[United States Whig Party|Whig]], and a firm believer in slavery and Southern states' rights, Brown was a leading secessionist in 1861, and led his state into the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Yet he also defied the Confederate government's wartime policies: he resisted the military draft, believing that local troops should be used only for the defense of Georgia; and denounced Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] as an incipient tyrant, challenging Confederate impressment of animals and goods to supply the troops, and slaves to work in military encampments and on the lines. Several other governors followed his lead.\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], Brown joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] for a time, and was appointed as chief justice of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] from 1865 to 1870. Later he rejoined the Democrats, became president of the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]] and began to amass great wealth; he was estimated to be a millionaire by 1880. He benefited from using [[convict leasing|convicts leased]] from state, county and local governments in his [[Coal mine|coal mining operations]] in [[Dade County, Georgia|Dade County]]. His Dade Coal Company bought other coal and iron companies, and by 1889 was known as the Georgia Mining, Manufacturing and Investment Company. Finally, he was elected by the state legislature as a two-term [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], serving from 1880 to 1891.\n\nHe saved [[The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] financially in the 1870s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPVv-GxjmZE&t=3101|title=Albert Mohler - Ask Anything Live (Episode 8)|last=Southern Seminary|date=September 14, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> There is now an endowed chair, the Joseph Emerson Brown Chair of Christian Theology, at the institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpnews.net/20683/southern-trustees-elect-mohler-to-storied-chair-of-theology|title=Southern trustees elect Mohler to storied chair of theology|website=Baptist Press}}</ref> Brown and his wife, Elizabeth Grisham Brown, were honored in 1928 by a statue installed on the state capitol grounds.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nJoseph Emerson Brown was born on April 15, 1821, in [[Pickens County, South Carolina|Pickens County]], [[South Carolina]], to Mackey Brown and Sally (Rice) Brown.

With the help of his younger brother James and his father's plow horse, Brown drove a yoke of oxen on a 125-mile trek to an academy near [[Anderson, South Carolina]]. There Brown traded the oxen for eight months' board and lodging.<ref name=\"wright\"/>\n\nIn 1844, Brown moved to [[Canton, Georgia]], where he served as headmaster of the academy at Canton.<ref name=\"wright\">{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=G.

He was elected as state circuit court judge in 1855.\n\n==Governor of Georgia==\n===First term===\nIn 1857, at the young age of 36, Brown was elected governor of the state. He supported free public education for poor white children, believing that it was key to development of the state. He asked the state legislature to divert a portion of profits from the state-owned railroad, the [[Western & Atlantic]], to help fund the schools.<ref name= \"scott\">[http://www.aboutnorthgeorgia.com/ang/Joseph_E._Brown Carole E. Scott, \"Joseph E.

The Western and Atlantic Railroad was mismanaged, and unable to produce the income Brown required to fund his public education proposal. In 1858, Governor Brown appointed [[John Wood Lewis Sr.|John W. Lewis]], his landlord and benefactor from Brown's early days in Canton, to the position of Superintendent of the state-owned railroad. Lewis was a successful businessman, and immediately undertook reforms to turn around the failing enterprise. The railroad, said to be in \"dire financial straits\", required the same strict economic controls Lewis had practiced in his private businesses. In the three years that Lewis ran the railroad, he was able to turn the business into a money making enterprise, paying $400,000 per year into the state treasury.<ref name=\"Knight1917\">{{cite book|author=Lucian Lamar Knight|title=The period of expansion or Georgia in the process of growth, 1802-1857 (continued) ; The period of division or Georgia in the assertion of state rights, 1857-1872 ; The period of rehabilitation or Georgia's rise from the ashes of war, 1872-1916 ; Georgia miscellanies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVlKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA717|year=1917|publisher=Lewis Publishing Company|page=717}}</ref>\n\n===Second term===\nBrown easily won re-election in 1859 when he defeated a young [[Warren Akin Sr.]] (who was just beginning his political career) by a margin of 60%-40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=74253|title=Akin, Warren|publisher=OurCampaigns.com|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBrown was a minor slave owner; in 1850, he owned five slaves.<ref>{{cite census | url = https://archive.org/stream/7thcensus0089unit#page/n197/mode/2up| title = 1850 United States Census, Slave Schedules| year = 1850| location = | roll = | page = | line = | enumdist = | filmnum = | nafilm = | accessdate = March 6, 2016}}</ref> By 1860 when he was governor, he owned a total of 19 slaves and several farms in [[Cherokee County, Georgia]].<ref>{{cite census | url = https://archive.org/stream/acpl_slavecensus_03_reel03rs#page/n9/mode/2up| title = 1860 United States Census, Slave Schedules| year = 1860| location = | roll = | page = 4, 8, | line = | enumdist = | filmnum = | nafilm = | accessdate = March 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBrown became a strong supporter of [[secession]] from the United States after [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s election and South Carolina's secession in 1860.

It was at this time, during the re-election campaign, that [[Western & Atlantic Railroad]] Superintendent [[John Wood Lewis]], and old friend of the governor, decided to resign from the railroad. The timing could not have been worse. Fearing that Lewis' resignation would be interpreted negatively, the governor requested that Lewis keep the resignation a secret. But the resignation letter was leaked to the press, causing a rift between the two old friends. Brown wrote to Lewis, saying: \"I did not deserve this at your hands, and I confess I felt it keenly...I do not attribute improper motives, but only say the coincidence was an unfortunate one for me\".<ref name=\"Parks1999\">{{cite book|author=Joseph Howard Parks|title=Joseph E.

On April 7, 1862, months after Lewis left the railroad, Governor Brown appointed Lewis to a vacant seat in the [[Confederate Senate]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the [[1st Confederate States Congress]], 1862-1863.

On the route from Atlanta to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] the left wing of Sherman's army entered the city of [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]], then Georgia's state capital. As U.S. troops closed in on the city, and with the fall of the capital imminent, Governor Brown ordered [[Quartermaster General]] [[Ira Roe Foster]] to remove the state records. The task proved to be difficult, as it was undertaken in the midst of chaos.\n\n{{quote box|quote = Gov. Brown, thinking first of the valuable and perishable State property, ordered Gen. Ira Foster, Georgia's quartermaster general (who was always prompt and efficient), to secure its removal. Some of the books and other similar property were stored in the Lunatic Asylum, three miles out of town. A train of cars was held at the depot to carry off other State property, and Gen. Foster made herculean efforts to carry out the Governor's orders, but, such was the general terror and the rush to leave town, it was next to impossible to procure labor.\n\nWhen the Governor saw the condition of affairs, he went to the penitentiary, had the convicts drawn up in a line, and made them a short speech; he appealed to their patriotic pride and offered pardon to each one who would help remove the State property and then enlist for the defense of Georgia. They responded promptly, were put under the command of Gen. Foster, and did valuable service in loading the train. When that was done each one was given a suit of gray, and a gun, and they were formed into a military company of which one of their number was captain. They were ordered to report for duty to Gen. Wayne, who was commanding a small battalion of militia at Milledgeville and also the Georgia cadets from the Military Institute at Marietta.\n|source=\u2014FRANCES LETCHER MITCHELL.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/georgialandpeopl00mitc/georgialandpeopl00mitc_djvu.txt ''Georgia Land and People''.(1919) p.158] at archive.org</ref>|publisher=The Franklin Printing and Publishing Co.Atlanta, Georgia.|title= WAR BETWEEN THE STATES - 1864|accessdate=October 27, 2013|width = 100%|align= left|bgcolor= #c6dbf7}}\n\nAfter the loss of Atlanta, Brown withdrew the [[State militia|state's militia]] from the Confederate forces to harvest crops for the state and the army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutnorthgeorgia.com/ang/Reconstruction|title=Reconstruction|website=www.aboutnorthgeorgia.com}}</ref> When Union troops under [[William T.

He was elected to the [[U.S. Senate]] in 1880 by the state legislature, as was custom by the US constitution and state laws of the time. Soon after his election to the Senate, Brown became the first Democratic Party official in Georgia to support [[public education]] for all children. The Republican Reconstruction-era legislature was the first to establish public education in the state but the succeeding post-Reconstruction, white-dominated legislature abandoned it. Brown recommended that railroad fees be used to support it financially. Prior to this, only the elite who could afford tutors or private academies had their children formally educated.<ref name= Smith />\n\n==Later political service and business career==\nBrown was first elected to the [[United States Senate]] by the [[Georgia General Assembly|state legislature]] in 1880, taking office on May 26, 1880.

Garrett, ''Atlanta and Environs,'' I:952</ref> most of his enterprises stemmed from his political connections. He amassed a fortune, in part through the use of [[convict leasing|convicts leased from state, county and local government]] in his [[Coal mine|coal mining operations]] in [[Dade County, Georgia|Dade County]].<ref name=\"stampp\">Kenneth M. Stampp, ''The Era of Reconstruction, 1865-1877,'' 1965, p. 161</ref> His use of leased convict labor began in 1874 and continued until his death in 1894, a period that coincided with \"the high tide of the convict lease system in Georgia\".<ref name=\"stampp\"/>\n\nThe convict lease system never existed during the years Brown was governor. It was first authorized during the [[Reconstruction era|period of Reconstruction]], under [[martial law|military governor]] and Union general [[Thomas H. Ruger]], who issued the first convict lease in April 1868.<ref name=\"mancini\"/> It was expanded during the post-Reconstruction era, when the Democratic-dominated state legislature passed new laws criminalizing a range of behavior. State prisoners who were unable to pay fines, levied as part of their conviction, faced the possibility of  being leased out by the state, as convict labor.\n\nIn 1880 Brown, whose fortune was estimated conservatively at one million dollars, netted $98,000 from the Dade Coal Company. By 1886, Dade Coal was a parent company, owning Walker Iron and Coal, Rising Fawn Iron, Chattanooga Iron, and Rogers Railroad and Ore Banks, and leasing Castle Rock Coal Company. An 1889 reorganization resulted in the formation of the Georgia Mining, Manufacturing and Investment Company. This rested largely on a foundation of convict labor.<ref name=\"mancini\">Matthew J.

Brown had tried to keep Georgia troops in the state for local defense.  Mitchell wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Yes, Governor Brown's darlings are likely to smell powder at last, and I imagine most of them will be much surprised. Certainly they never expected to see action. The Governor as good as promised them they wouldn't. Well, that's a good joke on them. They thought they had bomb proofs because the Governor stood up to even Jeff Davis and refused to send them to Virginia. Said they were needed for the defense of their state. Who'd have ever thought the war would come to their own back yard and they'd really have to defend their state?<ref name=\"Mitchell2014\">{{cite book|author=Margaret Mitchell|title=Gone with the Wind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAVZAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT191|date=13 April 2014|publisher=Hayrapetyan Brothers|pages=191|id=GGKEY:SA26KUXWEFG}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|American Civil War|Georgia (U.S. state)}}\n*[[American Civil War]]\n*[[Ira Roe Foster]]- Confederate Quartermaster General of Georgia\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n*Blackmon, Douglas A.
