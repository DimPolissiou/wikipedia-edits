As a child, he received instruction from his father and from his grandfather, Ephraim ha-Kohen, then rabbi at [[\u00d3buda|Alt-Ofen]], and later went to [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]], where for some time he attended the school of Elihu Cobo. In Salonica he also witnessed the impact of the [[Sabbatai Zevi]] movement on the community, and this experience became a determining factor in his whole career. During his stay at Salonica, Ashkenazi devoted himself mainly to an investigation of the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] methods of study. Upon his return journey to Alt-Ofen he seems to have stayed some time (probably till 1679) at [[Constantinople]], where his learning and astuteness made such an impression that, though a Polish scholar, he was termed \"Chacham\" (a Sephardic title reserved for rabbis). He retained this title throughout his career.

He fled, becoming separated from his parents (who were taken captive by the Prussians), and proceeded to [[Sarajevo]], where he received an appointment as rabbi. He remained in that city until 1689, in which year he resigned (probably on account of some contention with certain members of his congregation), and left for Germany. In Berlin he married Sarah (died at Lemberg January 23, 1719), the daughter of [[Meshullam Zalman Mirels Neumark]], chief rabbi of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Wandsbeck]].<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nOn the advice of his father-in-law he went in 1690 to Altona, where the leading members of the congregation founded a study-house (Klaus) and installed Ashkenazi as rabbi. His [[yeshiva]] became celebrated, and pupils assembled from all parts to hear him; but his income as rabbi of the Klaus was only 60 thalers annually, so that he was compelled to defray his living expenses by engaging in various business pursuits (e.g. dealing in jewelry). After the death of his father-in-law, whom Ashkenazi had latterly aided in his official duties, one party in the Jewish community wished to have Ashkenazi installed as rabbi of the three congregations (the unity known as AH\"U), while another party favored the election of Moses ben Alexander Rothenburg. Finally it was decided that both candidates should serve, but alternately, each for a period of six months. Friction and strife over religious questions ensued, and finally became so intense that, in 1709, Ashkenazi deemed it advisable to resign and resume his duties as rabbi of the ''Klaus''.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n==Amsterdam==\n\n===Appointment and welcome===\nLess than a year later, on 10 January 1710, he received a letter of appointment to the [[chief rabbi]]nate of the Ashkenazi congregation of [[Amsterdam]]. In addition to free residence, the office carried with it a yearly salary of 2,500 Dutch guilders (a large sum, in view of the fact that fifty years later 375 guilders was the usual salary of the chief rabbi of Berlin). Unselfish and independent by nature, Ashkenazi renounced the perquisites of his office, such as fees in civil suits, in order to maintain his independence, and accepted the high position only upon the condition that under no circumstances was he to be required to subordinate himself to the congregation, or to be obliged to receive gifts, and that he should be permitted to preserve absolute freedom of action on all occasions.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nFrom the very beginning he encountered in Amsterdam a hostile party, whose principal leader was Aaron Polak Gokkes. Indeed, the difficulties with the directors became so serious that, on 26 May 1712, it was decided to dismiss the chief rabbi at the end of the term (three years) mentioned in his letter of appointment. Ashkenazi announced that he would not under any circumstances accept this dismissal, which he regarded as unjust. Serious difficulties arose. The rabbi's salary does not seem to have been paid, for in the register of the records of the congregation it is stated that on Saturday 4 Nisan 5472 (12 April 1712), the parnasim sent a secretary and two attendants of the congregation to Ashkenazi to inform the latter that upon the return of the letter of appointment he would be paid the money to which he was still entitled. Ashkenazi, however, naturally declined to return this piece of evidence, a copy of which has been preserved among the official documents of the congregation.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n===The Chayun incident===\nOn June 30, 1713, [[Nehemiah Chiya Chayun]] arrived at Amsterdam and requested permission of the Portuguese congregation to circulate his writings, which had been published at Berlin. Ashkenazi thought Chayun was an old enemy of his from Sarajevo and Salonica, and at once requested [[Solomon Ayllon]], Chacham of the Portuguese congregation, not to accord patronage to the stranger, who was unfavorably known to him. Ashkenazi believed himself justified in making this demand, as the Portuguese congregation and its rabbi had, from the beginning, treated him most courteously, and had already, during his term at Altona, repeatedly sent to him from the Sephardim of Hamburg, Amsterdam, and London religio-legal questions for his decision. Chayun thereupon called on Ashkenazi personally and made an explanation; whereupon the rabbi retracted his accusation, stating that it was a case of mistaken identity. Meanwhile, several members of the Portuguese congregation had submitted Chayun's writings to the judgment of [[Moses Hagiz]], a messenger from Jerusalem then sojourning at Amsterdam, who immediately discovered their Sabbatian principles and tendencies and gave the alarm. He also called the attention of Ashkenazi to the dangerous doctrines published in Chayun's book, whereupon the rabbi again warned the directorate of the Sephardim congregation not to support the author. Ashkenazi rejected a proposition to designate the objectionable passages, and declined to act as member of a committee of investigation, because he did not regard Ayllon, the rabbi of the Sephardim, as a competent authority on such questions. Thereupon a fierce contention ensued, during the progress of which Hagiz fought valiantly beside Ashkenazi.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nA great number of pamphlets were issued by both sides, in which the contestants indulged in the most vehement abuse of each other. On 23 July 1713, Ashkenazi placed Chayun under the [[Herem (censure)|ban]], because the investigating committee appointed by the Sephardic directorate had not yet made its report. In consequence of this measure, both Ashkenazi and Chagiz were subjected to street attacks, more particularly at the hands of the Portuguese, who threatened to kill them. In the midst of the constantly increasing bitterness and animosity, the report of the committee, which had been prepared by Ayllon alone, was publicly announced. It was to the effect that the writings of Chayun contained nothing which could be construed as offensive to Judaism. It was publicly announced in the synagogue that Chayun was to be exonerated from every suspicion of heresy, and on the following day a public reception was tendered him at the synagogue, on which occasion unparalleled honor was shown him. Naturally, the Sephardic opponents of Ashkenazi had found excellent support among the rabbi's adversaries in his own German congregation. The controversy was now waged so fiercely that even the family-life of the community became affected, and all peace vanished from the otherwise model congregation of Amsterdam. Ashkenazi was deserted, except for a few friends that remained faithful to him. When, finally, he was summoned by the directors of the Portuguese congregation to appear before their tribunal\u2014which, of course, had no jurisdiction\u2014he refused to do so, as he anticipated that he would be asked to retract and to praise and recommend Chayun.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n===Placed under ban===\nThrough a Christian advocate the directorate again summoned Ashkenazi to appear, 9 November 1713, and when he again refused, he and [[Moses Hagiz]] were formally placed under the ban by the Portuguese community. Ashkenazi was temporarily placed under arrest in his own home (probably to protect his life) by the municipal authorities, who had been influenced against him by [[Ayllon]] and the Portuguese leaders; and the whole matter was brought before the magistracy in order to secure Ashkenazi's deposition and banishment from Amsterdam.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThe magistrates thereupon sought the opinions of certain professors at [[Leiden]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and [[Harderwijk]], including [[Willem Surenhuis]] and [[Adriaan Reland]], on the dispute; but their decision, if given, has not been made known.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n==London==\nAshkenazi forestalled the magisterial action by resigning his office and fleeing, in the beginning of 1714, from Amsterdam, perhaps secretly, with the aid of his friend Solomon Levi Norden de Lima. After leaving his wife and children at Emden, he proceeded to London at the invitation of the Sephardic congregation of that city. In 1705 he was invited to pronounce a judicial decision concerning the orthodoxy of the rabbi [[David Nieto]], who, in a certain sermon, had given utterance to allegedly [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinozistic]] views. In London Ashkenazi found many friends, and received many tributes of regard. Even before this he had been invited to take the rabbinate of the Sephardic congregation, but refused. It seems that his portrait in oil was painted here, after he had refused, on account of religious scruples, to have his bust stamped on a coin. In the following spring he returned to Emden, and proceeded thence to Poland by way of [[Hanover]], [[Halberstadt]], Berlin, and [[Breslau]], stopping at each place for some time. After spending two years in [[Stasz\u00f3w]],<ref>[http://yizkor.nypl.org/index.php?id=2499 Sefer Stasz\u00f3w, Tel-Aviv, 1962, pp. 36-38, images 40-42]</ref> Poland, he was called to Hamburg to serve as member of a judicial body convened to settle a complicated legal question.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nUpon the death of Simhah Cohen Rapoport, in 1717, Ashkenazi was called as rabbi to [[Lemberg]], where he stood in high repute, both in his congregation and in the community at large. Four months after entering upon this office, he died.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n==Praised by contemporaries==\nOf a firm and unselfish but abrupt and passionate disposition, Ashkenazi everywhere aroused the discontent and hatred of the rich and the scholarly. Extensive learning, keen intelligence, and exceptional linguistic attainments, all combined to make him one of the most distinguished men of his day. All his contemporaries, even those who knew him only as the head of the Klaus at Altona, unite in praising his profound learning, his astuteness, his clearness of exposition, which never degenerated into the subtleties of the pilpul, and his absolute disregard for the influence of money. He would suffer serious deprivation rather than accept pecuniary assistance; and this characteristic, interpreted by the wealthy of that day as obstinacy and arrogance, became to him a source of much suffering and enmity.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nOf his works, only a part of his responsa have been printed, under the title \"Responsa Chacham Tzvi\" (Amsterdam, 1712, and since frequently republished). They are distinguished by lucidity of treatment and an undeviating adherence to the subject.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n==Descendants==\nHis son [[Jacob Emden|Jacob]] served as rabbi in [[Emden]] and followed in his father's footsteps in combating inroads of the [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbattean movement]]. His daughter Miriam was the wife of [[Aryeh Leib ben Saul]], the rabbi of Amsterdam; the mother of Chief Rabbi [[Hart Lyon]]; and the grandmother of the first chief rabbi of the [[British empire]], [[Solomon Heschel]]. Ashkenazi's son David was the [[Av Beit Din]] of Novyy Yarychev, Ukraine, and an ancestor of the mother of Rabbi [[Chaim Halberstam]] (the Divrei Chaim), Miriam. (See Dr. [[Neil Rosenstein]]'s ''The Unbroken Chain''<ref name=\"TheUnbrokenChain\">{{cite book | author =[[Neil Rosenstein]] | title =The Unbroken Chain | year =1990 |edition=II  | publisher =CIS | location=[[Lakewood, New Jersey]] | isbn=0-9610578-4-X| oclc=60265214 | nopp =true | page =vol II, 862}}</ref> for details about conflicting opinions as to how Miriam was a descendant of David.)

The rabbi's salary does not seem to have been paid, for in the register of the records of the congregation it is stated that on Saturday 4 Nisan 5472 (12 April 1712), the parnasim sent a secretary and two attendants of the congregation to Ashkenazi to inform the latter that upon the return of the letter of appointment he would be paid the money to which he was still entitled. Ashkenazi, however, naturally declined to return this piece of evidence, a copy of which has been preserved among the official documents of the congregation.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n===The Chayun incident===\nOn June 30, 1713, [[Nehemiah Chiya Chayun]] arrived at Amsterdam and requested permission of the Portuguese congregation to circulate his writings, which had been published at Berlin. Ashkenazi thought Chayun was an old enemy of his from Sarajevo and Salonica, and at once requested [[Solomon Ayllon]], Chacham of the Portuguese congregation, not to accord patronage to the stranger, who was unfavorably known to him. Ashkenazi believed himself justified in making this demand, as the Portuguese congregation and its rabbi had, from the beginning, treated him most courteously, and had already, during his term at Altona, repeatedly sent to him from the Sephardim of Hamburg, Amsterdam, and London religio-legal questions for his decision. Chayun thereupon called on Ashkenazi personally and made an explanation; whereupon the rabbi retracted his accusation, stating that it was a case of mistaken identity. Meanwhile, several members of the Portuguese congregation had submitted Chayun's writings to the judgment of [[Moses Hagiz]], a messenger from Jerusalem then sojourning at Amsterdam, who immediately discovered their Sabbatian principles and tendencies and gave the alarm. He also called the attention of Ashkenazi to the dangerous doctrines published in Chayun's book, whereupon the rabbi again warned the directorate of the Sephardim congregation not to support the author. Ashkenazi rejected a proposition to designate the objectionable passages, and declined to act as member of a committee of investigation, because he did not regard Ayllon, the rabbi of the Sephardim, as a competent authority on such questions. Thereupon a fierce contention ensued, during the progress of which Hagiz fought valiantly beside Ashkenazi.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nA great number of pamphlets were issued by both sides, in which the contestants indulged in the most vehement abuse of each other. On 23 July 1713, Ashkenazi placed Chayun under the [[Herem (censure)|ban]], because the investigating committee appointed by the Sephardic directorate had not yet made its report. In consequence of this measure, both Ashkenazi and Chagiz were subjected to street attacks, more particularly at the hands of the Portuguese, who threatened to kill them. In the midst of the constantly increasing bitterness and animosity, the report of the committee, which had been prepared by Ayllon alone, was publicly announced. It was to the effect that the writings of Chayun contained nothing which could be construed as offensive to Judaism. It was publicly announced in the synagogue that Chayun was to be exonerated from every suspicion of heresy, and on the following day a public reception was tendered him at the synagogue, on which occasion unparalleled honor was shown him. Naturally, the Sephardic opponents of Ashkenazi had found excellent support among the rabbi's adversaries in his own German congregation. The controversy was now waged so fiercely that even the family-life of the community became affected, and all peace vanished from the otherwise model congregation of Amsterdam. Ashkenazi was deserted, except for a few friends that remained faithful to him. When, finally, he was summoned by the directors of the Portuguese congregation to appear before their tribunal\u2014which, of course, had no jurisdiction\u2014he refused to do so, as he anticipated that he would be asked to retract and to praise and recommend Chayun.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n===Placed under ban===\nThrough a Christian advocate the directorate again summoned Ashkenazi to appear, 9 November 1713, and when he again refused, he and [[Moses Hagiz]] were formally placed under the ban by the Portuguese community. Ashkenazi was temporarily placed under arrest in his own home (probably to protect his life) by the municipal authorities, who had been influenced against him by [[Ayllon]] and the Portuguese leaders; and the whole matter was brought before the magistracy in order to secure Ashkenazi's deposition and banishment from Amsterdam.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThe magistrates thereupon sought the opinions of certain professors at [[Leiden]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and [[Harderwijk]], including [[Willem Surenhuis]] and [[Adriaan Reland]], on the dispute; but their decision, if given, has not been made known.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n==London==\nAshkenazi forestalled the magisterial action by resigning his office and fleeing, in the beginning of 1714, from Amsterdam, perhaps secretly, with the aid of his friend Solomon Levi Norden de Lima. After leaving his wife and children at Emden, he proceeded to London at the invitation of the Sephardic congregation of that city. In 1705 he was invited to pronounce a judicial decision concerning the orthodoxy of the rabbi [[David Nieto]], who, in a certain sermon, had given utterance to allegedly [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinozistic]] views. In London Ashkenazi found many friends, and received many tributes of regard. Even before this he had been invited to take the rabbinate of the Sephardic congregation, but refused. It seems that his portrait in oil was painted here, after he had refused, on account of religious scruples, to have his bust stamped on a coin. In the following spring he returned to Emden, and proceeded thence to Poland by way of [[Hanover]], [[Halberstadt]], Berlin, and [[Breslau]], stopping at each place for some time. After spending two years in [[Stasz\u00f3w]],<ref>[http://yizkor.nypl.org/index.php?id=2499 Sefer Stasz\u00f3w, Tel-Aviv, 1962, pp. 36-38, images 40-42]</ref> Poland, he was called to Hamburg to serve as member of a judicial body convened to settle a complicated legal question.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nUpon the death of Simhah Cohen Rapoport, in 1717, Ashkenazi was called as rabbi to [[Lemberg]], where he stood in high repute, both in his congregation and in the community at large. Four months after entering upon this office, he died.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n==Praised by contemporaries==\nOf a firm and unselfish but abrupt and passionate disposition, Ashkenazi everywhere aroused the discontent and hatred of the rich and the scholarly. Extensive learning, keen intelligence, and exceptional linguistic attainments, all combined to make him one of the most distinguished men of his day. All his contemporaries, even those who knew him only as the head of the Klaus at Altona, unite in praising his profound learning, his astuteness, his clearness of exposition, which never degenerated into the subtleties of the pilpul, and his absolute disregard for the influence of money. He would suffer serious deprivation rather than accept pecuniary assistance; and this characteristic, interpreted by the wealthy of that day as obstinacy and arrogance, became to him a source of much suffering and enmity.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nOf his works, only a part of his responsa have been printed, under the title \"Responsa Chacham Tzvi\" (Amsterdam, 1712, and since frequently republished). They are distinguished by lucidity of treatment and an undeviating adherence to the subject.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n==Descendants==\nHis son [[Jacob Emden|Jacob]] served as rabbi in [[Emden]] and followed in his father's footsteps in combating inroads of the [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbattean movement]]. His daughter Miriam was the wife of [[Aryeh Leib ben Saul]], the rabbi of Amsterdam; the mother of Chief Rabbi [[Hart Lyon]]; and the grandmother of the first chief rabbi of the [[British empire]], [[Solomon Heschel]]. Ashkenazi's son David was the [[Av Beit Din]] of Novyy Yarychev, Ukraine, and an ancestor of the mother of Rabbi [[Chaim Halberstam]] (the Divrei Chaim), Miriam.

It began when the Rashidun army, under the command of [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaidah]], besieged [[Jerusalem]] beginning in November 636. After six months, the Patriarch [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] agreed to surrender, on condition that he submit only to the [[Caliph]]. In 637 or 638, Caliph [[Umar]] traveled to Jerusalem in person to receive the submission of the city. The Patriarch thus surrendered to him.\n\nThe Muslim conquest of the city solidified Arab control over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], which would not again be threatened until the [[First Crusade]] in 1099.\n\n==Background==\nJerusalem was an important city of the Byzantine province of [[Palaestina Prima]]. Just 23 years prior to the Muslim conquest, in 614, it fell to an invading [[Sassanid army]] under [[Shahrbaraz]] during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628|last of the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian Wars]]. The Persians looted the city, and are said to have massacred its 90,000 Christian inhabitants.<ref>{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=198}}.</ref> As part of the looting, the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] was destroyed and the [[True Cross]] captured and taken to [[Ctesiphon]] as a battle-captured holy [[relic]]. The Cross was later returned to Jerusalem by Emperor [[Heraclius]] after his final victory against the Persians in 628. The Jews, who were persecuted in their Christian-controlled homeland, have initially aided the Persian conquerors.<ref>{{harvnb|Haldon|1997|p=46}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of [[Muhammad]] in 632, Muslim leadership passed to Caliph [[Abu Bakr]] following a series of campaigns known as the [[Ridda wars]]. Once Abu Bakr's sovereignty over [[Arabia]] had been secured, he initiated a war of conquest in the east by [[First Muslim invasion of Mesopotamia|invading Iraq]], then a province of the Sassanid Persian Empire; while on the western front, his armies invaded the Byzantine Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|1994|pp=12\u201314}}.</ref>\n\nIn 634, Abu Bakr died and was succeeded by Umar, who continued his own war of conquest.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=65}}.</ref> In May 636, Emperor Heraclius launched a major expedition to regain the lost territory, but his army was defeated decisively at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in August 636. Thereafter, Abu Ubaidah, the Muslim commander-in-chief of the Rashidun army in [[Syria]], held a council of war in early October 636 to discuss future plans. Opinions of objectives varied between the coastal city of [[Caesarea]] and Jerusalem. Abu Ubaidah could see the importance of both these cities, which had resisted all Muslim attempts at capture. Unable to decide on the matter, he wrote to Caliph Umar for instructions. In his reply, the caliph ordered them to capture the latter. Accordingly, Abu Ubaidah marched towards Jerusalem from [[Jabiyah]], with [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] and his [[mobile guard]] leading the advance. The Muslims arrived at Jerusalem around early November, and the Byzantine garrison withdrew into the fortified city.<ref name=\"Akram431\"/>\n\n==Siege==\nJerusalem had been well-fortified after Heraclius recaptured it from the Persians.<ref name=\"Gil51\">{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=51}}.</ref> After the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk, [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]], the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], repaired its defenses.<ref name=\"Runciman17\">{{harvnb|Runciman|1987|p=17}}.</ref> The Muslims had so far not attempted any siege of the city. However, since 634, Saracen forces had the potential to threaten all routes to the city. Although it was not encircled, it had been in a state of siege since the Muslims captured the towns of [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]] and [[Bosra]] east of the [[Jordan River]]. After the Battle of Yarmouk, the city was severed from the rest of Syria, and was presumably being prepared for a siege that seemed inevitable.<ref name=\"Gil51\"/> When the Muslim army reached [[Jericho]], Sophronius collected all the holy relics including the True Cross, and secretly sent them to the coast, to be taken to [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"Runciman17\"/> The Muslim troops besieged the city some time in November 636. Instead of relentless assaults on the city,{{cref|a}} they decided to press on with the siege until the Byzantines ran short of supplies and a bloodless surrender could be negotiated.<ref name=\"Gibbon321\">{{harvnb|Gibbon|1862|loc=Volume 6, p. 321}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough details of the siege were not recorded,{{cref|b}} it appeared to be bloodless.<ref>{{harvnb|Akram|2004|p=432}}.</ref> The Byzantine garrison could not expect any help from the humbled Heraclius. After a siege of four months, Sophronius offered to surrender the city and pay a [[jizya]] (''tribute''), on condition that the caliph came to Jerusalem to sign the pact and accept the surrender.<ref>{{harvnb|Benvenisti|1998|p=14}}.</ref> It is said that when Sophronius's terms became known to the Muslims, [[Shurahbil ibn Hasana]], one of the Muslim commanders, suggested that instead of waiting for the caliph to come all the way from [[Madinah]], Khalid ibn Walid should be sent forward as the caliph, as he was very similar in appearance to Umar.<ref>al-Waqidi. ''Futuh al-Sham'', Volume 1, p. 162; Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani. ''al-Fath al-Qussi fi-l-Fath al-Qudsi'', Volume 15, pp. 12\u201356.</ref> The subterfuge did not work. Possibly, Khalid was too famous in Syria, or there may have been Christian Arabs in the city who had visited Madinah and had seen both Umar and Khalid, remembering the differences. Consequently, the Patriarch of Jerusalem refused to negotiate. When Khalid reported the failure of this mission, Abu Ubaidah wrote to caliph Umar about the situation, and invited him to come to Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Akram|2004|p=433}}.</ref>\n\n===Surrender===\n[[File:Holy sepulchre exterior.jpg|thumb|alt=The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Sophronius invited Caliph Umar to offer ''salat''.|200px|Present-day building of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], where Sophronius invited Caliph Umar to offer ''[[salat]]'' (prayers)]]\n\nThe date of the surrender of Jerusalem is debatable. Primary sources, such as chronicles from centuries closer or further removed from the time of the events, offer the year 638, for instance [[Theophilus of Edessa]] (695\u2013785); or 636, 636/37, and 637.

Depending on the sources, in either 637 or in 638, Jerusalem was officially surrendered to the caliph.<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=54}}.</ref> For the first time, after almost 500 years of oppressive Roman rule, Jews were once again allowed to live inside Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Gil70\u201371\">{{harvnb|Gil|1997|pp=70\u201371}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bu.edu/mzank/Jerusalem/p/period3-2.htm |last= Zank |first =Michael |publisher= Boston University |title= Byzantian Jerusalem |accessdate= 1 February 2007}}</ref>.\n\nIt has been recorded in the annals of Muslim chronicles, that at the time of the [[Zuhr prayer]]s, Sophronius invited Umar to pray in the rebuilt Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Umar declined, fearing that accepting the invitation might endanger the church's status as a place of Christian worship, and that Muslims might break the treaty and turn the church into a [[mosque]].<ref name=\"Gibbon321\"/> After staying for ten days in Jerusalem, the caliph returned to Medina.<ref>al-Waqidi.

Amr and Shurahbil marched to complete the occupation of Palestine, a task that was completed by the end of the year. Caesarea, however, could not be taken until 640, when at last, the garrison surrendered to [[Muawiyah I]], then a governor of Syria. With an army of 17,000 men, Abu Ubaidah and Khalid set off from Jerusalem to [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquer all of northern Syria]]. This ended with the [[Battle of the Iron Bridge|conquest of Antioch]] in late 637.<ref>{{harvnb|Akram|2004|p=438}}.</ref> In 639, the Muslims [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|invaded and conquered Egypt]].\n\nDuring his stay in Jerusalem, Umar was led by Sophronius to various holy sites, including the [[Temple Mount]]. Seeing the poor state of where the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] once stood, Umar ordered the area cleared of refuse and debris before having a wooden mosque built on the site.<ref name=\"Hoppe15\">{{harvnb|Hoppe|2000|p=15}}.</ref> The earliest account of such a structure is given by the [[Gaul|Gallic]] bishop [[Arculf]], who visited Jerusalem between 679 and 682, and describes a very primitive house of prayer able to accommodate up to 3,000 worshippers, constructed of wooden beams and boards over preexisting ruins.<ref>{{harvnb|Elad|1999|p=33}}.</ref>\n\nMore than half a century after the capture of Jerusalem, in 691, the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] commissioned the construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]] over a large outcropping of bedrock on the Temple Mount. The 10th-century historian [[al-Maqdisi]] wrote that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to compete in grandeur with the city's Christian churches. Whatever the intention, the impressive splendor and scale of the shrine is seen as having helped significantly in solidifying the attachment of Jerusalem to the early Muslim faith.<ref name=\"Hoppe15\"/>\n\nOver the next 400 years, the city's prominence diminished as Saracen powers in the region jockeyed for control. Jerusalem remained under Muslim rule until it was [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|captured by Crusaders in 1099]] during the [[First Crusade]].\n\n==Hadith==\nIt is believed in [[Sunni Islam]] that [[Muhammad]] foretold the conquest of Jerusalem in numerous authentic [[hadith]]s in various Islamic sources,<ref>Sunan Ibn Majah 4042</ref><ref>Sahih al-Bukhari 3176</ref> including a narration mentioned in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] in ''Kitab Al Jizyah Wa'l Mawaada'ah'' (The Book of [[Jizya]] and Storage):\n\nNarrated `Auf bin Mali:\nI went to the Prophet during the [[Expedition to Tabuk]] while he was sitting in a leather tent. He said, \"Count six signs that indicate the approach of the End Times: my death, the conquest of [[Jerusalem]], a plague that will afflict you (and kill you in great numbers) as the plague that afflicts sheep...\"<ref>Sahih al-Bukhari Vol. 4, Book 53, Hadith 401</ref>\n\nThe siege of Jerusalem was carried by [[Abu Ubaidah]] under [[Umar]] in the earliest period of Islam along with [[Plague of Emmaus]].

It began when the Rashidun army, under the command of [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaidah]], besieged [[Jerusalem]] beginning in November 636. After six months, the Patriarch [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] agreed to surrender, on condition that he submit only to the [[Caliph]]. In 637 or 638, Caliph [[Umar]] traveled to Jerusalem in person to receive the submission of the city. The Patriarch thus surrendered to him.\n\nThe Muslim conquest of the city solidified Arab control over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], which would not again be threatened until the [[First Crusade]] in 1099.\n\n==Background==\nJerusalem was an important city of the Byzantine province of [[Palaestina Prima]]. Just 23 years prior to the Muslim conquest, in 614, it fell to an invading [[Sassanid army]] under [[Shahrbaraz]] during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628|last of the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian Wars]]. The Persians looted the city, and are said to have massacred its 90,000 Christian inhabitants.<ref>{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=198}}.</ref> As part of the looting, the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] was destroyed and the [[True Cross]] captured and taken to [[Ctesiphon]] as a battle-captured holy [[relic]]. The Cross was later returned to Jerusalem by Emperor [[Heraclius]] after his final victory against the Persians in 628. The Jews, who were persecuted in their Christian-controlled homeland, have initially aided the Persian conquerors.<ref>{{harvnb|Haldon|1997|p=46}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of [[Muhammad]] in 632, Muslim leadership passed to Caliph [[Abu Bakr]] following a series of campaigns known as the [[Ridda wars]]. Once Abu Bakr's sovereignty over [[Arabia]] had been secured, he initiated a war of conquest in the east by [[First Muslim invasion of Mesopotamia|invading Iraq]], then a province of the Sassanid Persian Empire; while on the western front, his armies invaded the Byzantine Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|1994|pp=12\u201314}}.</ref>\n\nIn 634, Abu Bakr died and was succeeded by Umar, who continued his own war of conquest.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=65}}.</ref> In May 636, Emperor Heraclius launched a major expedition to regain the lost territory, but his army was defeated decisively at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in August 636. Thereafter, Abu Ubaidah, the Muslim commander-in-chief of the Rashidun army in [[Syria]], held a council of war in early October 636 to discuss future plans. Opinions of objectives varied between the coastal city of [[Caesarea]] and Jerusalem. Abu Ubaidah could see the importance of both these cities, which had resisted all Muslim attempts at capture. Unable to decide on the matter, he wrote to Caliph Umar for instructions. In his reply, the caliph ordered them to capture the latter. Accordingly, Abu Ubaidah marched towards Jerusalem from [[Jabiyah]], with [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] and his [[mobile guard]] leading the advance. The Muslims arrived at Jerusalem around early November, and the Byzantine garrison withdrew into the fortified city.<ref name=\"Akram431\"/>\n\n==Siege==\nJerusalem had been well-fortified after Heraclius recaptured it from the Persians.<ref name=\"Gil51\">{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=51}}.</ref> After the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk, [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]], the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], repaired its defenses.<ref name=\"Runciman17\">{{harvnb|Runciman|1987|p=17}}.</ref> The Muslims had so far not attempted any siege of the city. However, since 634, Saracen forces had the potential to threaten all routes to the city. Although it was not encircled, it had been in a state of siege since the Muslims captured the towns of [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]] and [[Bosra]] east of the [[Jordan River]]. After the Battle of Yarmouk, the city was severed from the rest of Syria, and was presumably being prepared for a siege that seemed inevitable.<ref name=\"Gil51\"/> When the Muslim army reached [[Jericho]], Sophronius collected all the holy relics including the True Cross, and secretly sent them to the coast, to be taken to [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"Runciman17\"/> The Muslim troops besieged the city some time in November 636. Instead of relentless assaults on the city,{{cref|a}} they decided to press on with the siege until the Byzantines ran short of supplies and a bloodless surrender could be negotiated.<ref name=\"Gibbon321\">{{harvnb|Gibbon|1862|loc=Volume 6, p. 321}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough details of the siege were not recorded,{{cref|b}} it appeared to be bloodless.<ref>{{harvnb|Akram|2004|p=432}}.</ref> The Byzantine garrison could not expect any help from the humbled Heraclius. After a siege of four months, Sophronius offered to surrender the city and pay a [[jizya]] (''tribute''), on condition that the caliph came to Jerusalem to sign the pact and accept the surrender.<ref>{{harvnb|Benvenisti|1998|p=14}}.</ref> It is said that when Sophronius's terms became known to the Muslims, [[Shurahbil ibn Hasana]], one of the Muslim commanders, suggested that instead of waiting for the caliph to come all the way from [[Madinah]], Khalid ibn Walid should be sent forward as the caliph, as he was very similar in appearance to Umar.<ref>al-Waqidi. ''Futuh al-Sham'', Volume 1, p. 162; Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani. ''al-Fath al-Qussi fi-l-Fath al-Qudsi'', Volume 15, pp. 12\u201356.</ref> The subterfuge did not work. Possibly, Khalid was too famous in Syria, or there may have been Christian Arabs in the city who had visited Madinah and had seen both Umar and Khalid, remembering the differences. Consequently, the Patriarch of Jerusalem refused to negotiate. When Khalid reported the failure of this mission, Abu Ubaidah wrote to caliph Umar about the situation, and invited him to come to Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Akram|2004|p=433}}.</ref>\n\n===Surrender===\n[[File:Holy sepulchre exterior.jpg|thumb|alt=The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Sophronius invited Caliph Umar to offer ''salat''.|200px|Present-day building of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], where Sophronius invited Caliph Umar to offer ''[[salat]]'' (prayers)]]\n\nThe date of the surrender of Jerusalem is debatable. Primary sources, such as chronicles from centuries closer or further removed from the time of the events, offer the year 638, for instance [[Theophilus of Edessa]] (695\u2013785); or 636, 636/37, and 637.

It was signed by caliph Umar on behalf of the Muslims, and witnessed by Khalid, Amr, [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf]], and [[Muawiya]]. Depending on the sources, in either 637 or in 638, Jerusalem was officially surrendered to the caliph.<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=54}}.</ref> For the first time, after almost 500 years of oppressive Roman rule, Jews were once again allowed to live inside Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Gil70\u201371\">{{harvnb|Gil|1997|pp=70\u201371}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bu.edu/mzank/Jerusalem/p/period3-2.htm |last= Zank |first =Michael |publisher= Boston University |title= Byzantian Jerusalem |accessdate= 1 February 2007}}</ref>.\n\nIt has been recorded in the annals of Muslim chronicles, that at the time of the [[Zuhr prayer]]s, Sophronius invited Umar to pray in the rebuilt Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Umar declined, fearing that accepting the invitation might endanger the church's status as a place of Christian worship, and that Muslims might break the treaty and turn the church into a [[mosque]].<ref name=\"Gibbon321\"/> After staying for ten days in Jerusalem, the caliph returned to Medina.<ref>al-Waqidi. ''Futuh al-Sham'', Volume 1, p. 169.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Dome of the Rock viewed through Bab al-Qattanin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|200px|alt=Image of Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem|The [[Dome of the Rock]], constructed by Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik in 691]]\n\nFollowing the Caliph's instructions, Yazid proceeded to [[Caesarea]], and once again laid siege to the port city. Amr and Shurahbil marched to complete the occupation of Palestine, a task that was completed by the end of the year. Caesarea, however, could not be taken until 640, when at last, the garrison surrendered to [[Muawiyah I]], then a governor of Syria. With an army of 17,000 men, Abu Ubaidah and Khalid set off from Jerusalem to [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquer all of northern Syria]]. This ended with the [[Battle of the Iron Bridge|conquest of Antioch]] in late 637.<ref>{{harvnb|Akram|2004|p=438}}.</ref> In 639, the Muslims [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|invaded and conquered Egypt]].\n\nDuring his stay in Jerusalem, Umar was led by Sophronius to various holy sites, including the [[Temple Mount]]. Seeing the poor state of where the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] once stood, Umar ordered the area cleared of refuse and debris before having a wooden mosque built on the site.<ref name=\"Hoppe15\">{{harvnb|Hoppe|2000|p=15}}.</ref> The earliest account of such a structure is given by the [[Gaul|Gallic]] bishop [[Arculf]], who visited Jerusalem between 679 and 682, and describes a very primitive house of prayer able to accommodate up to 3,000 worshippers, constructed of wooden beams and boards over preexisting ruins.<ref>{{harvnb|Elad|1999|p=33}}.</ref>\n\nMore than half a century after the capture of Jerusalem, in 691, the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] commissioned the construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]] over a large outcropping of bedrock on the Temple Mount. The 10th-century historian [[al-Maqdisi]] wrote that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to compete in grandeur with the city's Christian churches. Whatever the intention, the impressive splendor and scale of the shrine is seen as having helped significantly in solidifying the attachment of Jerusalem to the early Muslim faith.<ref name=\"Hoppe15\"/>\n\nOver the next 400 years, the city's prominence diminished as Saracen powers in the region jockeyed for control. Jerusalem remained under Muslim rule until it was [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|captured by Crusaders in 1099]] during the [[First Crusade]].\n\n==Hadith==\nIt is believed in [[Sunni Islam]] that [[Muhammad]] foretold the conquest of Jerusalem in numerous authentic [[hadith]]s in various Islamic sources,<ref>Sunan Ibn Majah 4042</ref><ref>Sahih al-Bukhari 3176</ref> including a narration mentioned in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] in ''Kitab Al Jizyah Wa'l Mawaada'ah'' (The Book of [[Jizya]] and Storage):\n\nNarrated `Auf bin Mali:\nI went to the Prophet during the [[Expedition to Tabuk]] while he was sitting in a leather tent.

Pursuing this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p9-18>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=9\u201318}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|p=63}}</ref> Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=183}}</ref> A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer-range [[Airbus A310]].<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p18-9 /> Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the [[Airbus A320 family]], the first commercial aircraft with digital [[fly-by-wire]] controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p18-9>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Airbus began development of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan]] engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> Offering the same range and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency,<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3 /> the B9 was seen as a viable replacement for the DC-10 and the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] trijets.<ref>''Flight International'' 1981, p. 1155.</ref> It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\" />\n\nAt the same time, a 200-seat four-engine version, the B11 (which would eventually become the A340) was also under development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\">{{harnvb|Eden|2008|p=30}}</ref> The B11 was originally planned to take the place of narrow-body [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s then in commercial use, but would later evolve to target the long-range, wide-body [[trijet]] replacement market.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> To differentiate from the SA series, the B9 and B11 were re-designated as the TA9 and TA11, with TA standing for \"twin aisle\".<ref name=\"Eden p.30\" /> Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same [[fuselage]] and wing, with projected savings of US$500&nbsp;million. Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, those of prospective customers; twinjets were favoured in North America, quad-jets desired in Asia, and operators had mixed views in Europe.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3 /> Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine.<ref name=kingsley>Kingsley-Jones 1997, p. 29.</ref> As a result, development plans prioritised the four-engined TA11 ahead of the TA9.<ref name=kingsley />\n\n=== Design effort ===\n[[File:HL7552 Airbus A330-223 Korean Air, CS-TQM Airbus A340-313X Strategic Airlines (HiFly) and VH-ZPL 'Samba Blue' Embraer 190-100IGW Virgin Blue (Virgin Australia) (6600549415).jpg|thumb|Compared to the A330 twinjet (on ground), the heavier A340 (inflight) has four engines and a centre-line wheel [[Bogie#Bogie (aircraft)|bogie]]]]<!-- alternates pics: \"File:Swiss Airbus A340 and A330.jpg\" or \"File:Swiss Airbus A340-313X; HB-JMJ@ZRH;04.03.2011 592en (5501768255).jpg\" -->\n\nThe first specifications for the TA9 and TA11, aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one-class layout, emerged in 1982.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24.}}</ref> They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen [[Unit load device|LD3]] cargo containers in the forward, and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold\u2014double the capacity of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar or DC-10, and {{Convert|8.46|m|ft|sigfig=3}} longer than the Airbus A300.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p24-5>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=24\u201325.}}</ref> By June 1985, the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements, including the adoption of the A320 [[flight deck]], digital fly-by-wire (FBW) control system, and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name=\"N&W p.27\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27.}}</ref> Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots.

On the A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used, which allows the A340-300 wing to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW. This is as the A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing, while also the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300.

Pursuing this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p9-18>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=9\u201318}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|p=63}}</ref> Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=183}}</ref> A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer-range [[Airbus A310]].<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p18-9 /> Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the [[Airbus A320 family]], the first commercial aircraft with digital [[fly-by-wire]] controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p18-9>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Airbus began development of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan]] engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> Offering the same range and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency,<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3 /> the B9 was seen as a viable replacement for the DC-10 and the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] trijets.<ref>''Flight International'' 1981, p. 1155.</ref> It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\" />\n\nAt the same time, a 200-seat four-engine version, the B11 (which would eventually become the A340) was also under development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\">{{harnvb|Eden|2008|p=30}}</ref> The B11 was originally planned to take the place of narrow-body [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s then in commercial use, but would later evolve to target the long-range, wide-body [[trijet]] replacement market.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> To differentiate from the SA series, the B9 and B11 were re-designated as the TA9 and TA11, with TA standing for \"twin aisle\".<ref name=\"Eden p.30\" /> Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same [[fuselage]] and wing, with projected savings of US$500&nbsp;million. Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, those of prospective customers; twinjets were favoured in North America, quad-jets desired in Asia, and operators had mixed views in Europe.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3 /> Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine.<ref name=kingsley>Kingsley-Jones 1997, p. 29.</ref> As a result, development plans prioritised the four-engined TA11 ahead of the TA9.<ref name=kingsley />\n\n=== Design effort ===\n[[File:HL7552 Airbus A330-223 Korean Air, CS-TQM Airbus A340-313X Strategic Airlines (HiFly) and VH-ZPL 'Samba Blue' Embraer 190-100IGW Virgin Blue (Virgin Australia) (6600549415).jpg|thumb|Compared to the A330 twinjet (on ground), the heavier A340 (inflight) has four engines and a centre-line wheel [[Bogie#Bogie (aircraft)|bogie]]]]<!-- alternates pics: \"File:Swiss Airbus A340 and A330.jpg\" or \"File:Swiss Airbus A340-313X; HB-JMJ@ZRH;04.03.2011 592en (5501768255).jpg\" -->\n\nThe first specifications for the TA9 and TA11, aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one-class layout, emerged in 1982.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24.}}</ref> They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen [[Unit load device|LD3]] cargo containers in the forward, and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold\u2014double the capacity of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar or DC-10, and {{Convert|8.46|m|ft|sigfig=3}} longer than the Airbus A300.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p24-5>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=24\u201325.}}</ref> By June 1985, the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements, including the adoption of the A320 [[flight deck]], digital fly-by-wire (FBW) control system, and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name=\"N&W p.27\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27.}}</ref> Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots.

Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe), now part of [[BAE Systems]], at [[Hatfield Aerodrome|Hatfield]] and [[Filton Aerodrome|Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency,<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=26, 31.}}</ref> but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\" /> A true [[laminar flow]] wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=196.}}</ref>\n\nWith necessary funding available, the Airbus Supervisory Board approved the development of the A330 and A340 with potential customers on 27 January 1986.<ref>{{Cite press release |url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/supervisory-board-approves-strategy-for-future-product-range/ |title=Supervisory Board approves strategy for future product range |date=27 January 1986 |publisher=Airbus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224052010/http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/supervisory-board-approves-strategy-for-future-product-range/ | archivedate=24 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Its chairman [[Franz Josef Strauss]] stated afterwards that \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, now officially designated as the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\". The designations were originally reversed and were switched so the quad-jet airliner would have a \"4\" in its name.

As a result, Cathay Pacific self-suspended its 120-minute ETOPS clearance. Another engine failure occurred on 6 May during [[climb (aeronautics)|climbout]] with a Cathay Pacific A330, due to a bearing failure in a [[Hispano-Suiza]]-built [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]]. Three days later, a Cathay Pacific A330 on climbout during a Bangkok\u2013Hong Kong flight experienced an oil pressure drop and a resultant [[Flameout|engine spool down]], forcing a return to Bangkok.

On the A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used, which allows the A340-300 wing to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW. This is as the A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing, while also the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300.

She is the daughter of Remington Starwin, a wealthy [[Texas]] [[oil]] baron and amateur [[rodeo]] performer.  When she was a child, her father encouraged his daughter's aspirations to perform professionally in rodeos.  He hired scientists to build for her a special six-shooter that shoots star-shaped paralysis pellets for her sharp-shooting act. At some point in her performing career, she met a rodeo performer and former superhuman adventurer, the [[Texas Twister]], and the two formed a dual act. Her father then had scientists design a pair of jet-boots that enabled her to stabilize her flight when swept up in the Twister's cyclonic vortex.\n\n===Rangers===\nShooting Star and Texas Twister were the star attractions at Cody's Rodeo Extravaganza when they intercepted a [[shortwave radio]] message sent by [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] meant for the hero team known as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  Jones was being held captive by the villainous [[Corruptor (comics)|Corruptor]], who had the [[Hulk]] under his influence. Shooting Star and Texas Twister went to answer the distress call and discovered that three other individuals had responded as well \u2014 [[Firebird (Marvel Comics)|Firebird]], the [[Hamilton Slade (Rangers)|Phantom Rider]] (then called Night Rider), and [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]]. Although the five Southwestern adventurers were unable to stop the Hulk's rampage, they did enable him to defeat the Corruptor. At the battle's end, Texas Twister suggested that the five of them get together whenever a threat to the Southwest crops up.

She is the daughter of Remington Starwin, a wealthy [[Texas]] [[oil]] baron and amateur [[rodeo]] performer.  When she was a child, her father encouraged his daughter's aspirations to perform professionally in rodeos.  He hired scientists to build for her a special six-shooter that shoots star-shaped paralysis pellets for her sharp-shooting act. At some point in her performing career, she met a rodeo performer and former superhuman adventurer, the [[Texas Twister]], and the two formed a dual act. Her father then had scientists design a pair of jet-boots that enabled her to stabilize her flight when swept up in the Twister's cyclonic vortex.\n\n===Rangers===\nShooting Star and Texas Twister were the star attractions at Cody's Rodeo Extravaganza when they intercepted a [[shortwave radio]] message sent by [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] meant for the hero team known as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  Jones was being held captive by the villainous [[Corruptor (comics)|Corruptor]], who had the [[Hulk]] under his influence.

Although the five Southwestern adventurers were unable to stop the Hulk's rampage, they did enable him to defeat the Corruptor. At the battle's end, Texas Twister suggested that the five of them get together whenever a threat to the Southwest crops up.

She returned to Milan, under the tutelage of her uncle Ludovico ''Il Moro'', who cared little about her education and allowed her to indulge her own interests, mainly needlework.\n\n===Betrothals===\nThree years later, on 31 July 1485, the engagement between Bianca and [[John Corvinus|Janus Corvinus]], the only (though illegitimate) son of King [[Matthias Corvinus|Matthias of Hungary]] was formally announced. With this marriage, the Hungarian ruler wanted to secure his son's future inheritance of Hungary and Bohemia and to make him Duke of Austria. The marriage by proxy was signed on 25 November 1487, and according to the terms of the contract, Bianca received several Hungarian counties. However, due to the opposition and intrigues of [[Beatrice of Naples|Queen Beatrix]], wife of Matthias, the formal marriage never took place. In March 1492 a marriage between Bianca and King [[James IV of Scotland]] was considered, but the idea was soon abandoned.<ref name=Treccani/>\n[[File:Bernhard Strigel 009.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Bianca Maria Sforza, by [[Bernhard Strigel]], ca. 1505/1510.]]\n\n===Queen and Empress===\nOn 16 March 1494<ref>{{Citation\n| last1 = Hunt\n| first1 = Lynn\n| last2 = Martin\n| first2 = Thomas R.\n| last3 = Rosenwein\n| first3 = Barbara H.\n| last4 = Hsia\n| first4 = R.

Bianca's second marriage was arranged by her uncle, who wanted recognition and the title of Duke confirmed by the Emperor; in exchange, the Emperor received a large dowry along with Bianca. Her magnificent retinue on her way to her wedding aroused much attention.\n\nAt her wedding, Bianca wore a bodice \"with eighty pieces of the jeweler's art pinned thereon, with each piece consisting of one ruby and four pearls\".<ref name=Marek>[[George R.

This angered [[Anne of France]], regent of France for her brother King Charles VIII, and brought about French intervention in Italy, thus inaugurating the lengthy [[Italian Wars]].\n\n[[File:Ambrogio de Predis 002.jpg|thumbnail|Bianca Maria Sforza by [[Ambrogio de Predis]] ca. 1493/1495 ]]\n\nThe union was unhappy: shortly after the consummation of the marriage, Maximilian complained that Bianca may have been more beautiful than his first wife but was not as wise. It was impossible for the young bride to win the affection of her husband, who considered her too uneducated, talkative, naive, wasteful with money, and careless. He did wish to have children with her, but all their attempts failed: despite Bianca's several pregnancies, none produced a living child. She very much liked his two surviving legitimate children ([[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]], who married [[Joanna of Castile]], and [[Archduchess Margaret of Austria]], who first married [[John, Prince of Asturias]], and later [[Philibert II, Duke of Savoy]]), but was criticized for forgetting her dignity when she sat on the floor with them to play.<ref name=Treccani/>\n\nAfter 1500, Maximilian lost all interest in Bianca. She lived with her own court of Milanese people in various castles in Tyrol. On several occasions he left her behind as security when he could not pay for his rooms on trips.\n\nMaximilian took the title of Holy Roman Emperor Elect in 1508. Bianca was, by marriage, Empress of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nBianca Maria Sforza died at [[Innsbruck]] on 31 December 1510. She was buried at [[Stams]].

With this marriage, the Hungarian ruler wanted to secure his son's future inheritance of Hungary and Bohemia and to make him Duke of Austria. The marriage by proxy was signed on 25 November 1487, and according to the terms of the contract, Bianca received several Hungarian counties. However, due to the opposition and intrigues of [[Beatrice of Naples|Queen Beatrix]], wife of Matthias, the formal marriage never took place.

Bianca's second marriage was arranged by her uncle, who wanted recognition and the title of Duke confirmed by the Emperor; in exchange, the Emperor received a large dowry along with Bianca.

It was impossible for the young bride to win the affection of her husband, who considered her too uneducated, talkative, naive, wasteful with money, and careless. He did wish to have children with her, but all their attempts failed: despite Bianca's several pregnancies, none produced a living child. She very much liked his two surviving legitimate children ([[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]], who married [[Joanna of Castile]], and [[Archduchess Margaret of Austria]], who first married [[John, Prince of Asturias]], and later [[Philibert II, Duke of Savoy]]), but was criticized for forgetting her dignity when she sat on the floor with them to play.<ref name=Treccani/>\n\nAfter 1500, Maximilian lost all interest in Bianca. She lived with her own court of Milanese people in various castles in Tyrol. On several occasions he left her behind as security when he could not pay for his rooms on trips.\n\nMaximilian took the title of Holy Roman Emperor Elect in 1508. Bianca was, by marriage, Empress of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nBianca Maria Sforza died at [[Innsbruck]] on 31 December 1510. She was buried at [[Stams]].

The red population has mean 100 and variance 100 (SD=10) while the blue population has mean 100 and variance 2500 (SD=50).]]\nIn [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], '''variance''' is the [[expected value|expectation]] of the squared [[Deviation (statistics)|deviation]] of a [[random variable]] from its [[Expected value|mean]].  Informally, it measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value. Variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include [[descriptive statistics]], [[statistical inference]], [[hypothesis testing]], [[goodness of fit]], and [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo sampling]]. Variance is an important tool in the sciences, where statistical analysis of data is common. The variance is the square root of the [[standard deviation]], the second [[central moment]] of a distribution, and the [[covariance]] of the random variable with itself, and it is often represented by <math>\\sigma^2</math>, <math>s^2</math>, or <math>\\operatorname{Var}(X)</math>.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nThe variance of a random variable <math>X</math> is the [[expected value]] of the squared deviation from the [[Expected value|mean]] of <math>X</math>, <math>\\mu = \\operatorname{E}[X]</math>:\n: <math> \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{E}\\left[(X - \\mu)^2 \\right]. </math>\nThis definition encompasses random variables that are generated by processes that are [[discrete random variable|discrete]], [[continuous random variable|continuous]], [[Cantor distribution|neither]], or mixed. The variance can also be thought of as the covariance of a random variable with itself:\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{Cov}(X, X).</math> \nThe variance is also equivalent to the second [[cumulant]] of a probability distribution that generates <math>X</math>. The variance is typically designated as <math>\\operatorname{Var}(X)</math>, <math>\\sigma^2_X</math>, or simply <math>\\sigma^2</math> (pronounced \"[[sigma]] squared\"). The expression for the variance can be expanded:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{Var}(X) &= \\operatorname{E}\\left[(X - \\operatorname{E}[X])^2\\right] \\\\[4pt]\n&= \\operatorname{E}\\left[X^2 - 2X\\operatorname{E}[X] + \\operatorname{E}[X]^2\\right] \\\\[4pt]\n&= \\operatorname{E}\\left[X^2\\right] - 2\\operatorname{E}[X]\\operatorname{E}[X] + \\operatorname{E}[X]^2 \\\\[4pt]\n&= \\operatorname{E}\\left[X^2 \\right] - \\operatorname{E}[X]^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn other words, the variance of {{mvar|X}} is equal to the mean of the square of {{mvar|X}} minus the square of the mean of {{mvar|X}}.  This equation should not be used for computations using [[floating point arithmetic]] because it suffers from [[catastrophic cancellation]] if the two components of the equation are similar in magnitude. There exist [[Algorithms for calculating variance|numerically stable alternatives]].\n\n===Discrete random variable===\n\nIf the generator of random variable <math>X</math> is [[Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] with [[probability mass function]] <math>x_1 \\mapsto p_1, x_2 \\mapsto p_2, \\ldots, x_n \\mapsto p_n</math> then\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i\\cdot(x_i - \\mu)^2,</math>\n\nor equivalently\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i ^2\\right) - \\mu^2,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the expected value, i.e.\n\n:<math>\\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i .</math>\n\n(When such a discrete [[weighted variance]] is specified by weights whose sum is not&nbsp;1, then one divides by the sum of the weights.)\n\nThe variance of a set of <math>n</math> equally likely values can be written as\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu)^2, </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the average value, i.e.,\n\n:<math>\\mu = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i .</math>\n\nThe variance of a set of <math>n</math> equally likely values can be equivalently expressed, without directly referring to the mean, in terms of squared deviations of all points from each other:<ref>{{cite conference|authors=Yuli Zhang, Huaiyu Wu, Lei Cheng|date=June 2012|title=Some new deformation formulas about variance and covariance|conference=Proceedings of 4th International Conference on Modelling, Identification and Control(ICMIC2012)|pages=987\u2013992}}</ref>\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{1}{2}(x_i - x_j)^2 = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_i \\sum_{j>i} (x_i-x_j)^2. </math>\n\n===Absolutely continuous random variable===\n\nIf the random variable <math>X</math> has a [[probability density function]] <math>f(x)</math>, and <math>F(x)</math> is the corresponding [[cumulative distribution function]], then\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2 &= \\int_{\\R} (x-\\mu)^2 f(x) \\, dx \\\\[4pt]\n     &= \\int_{\\R} x^2f(x)\\,dx -2\\mu\\int_{\\R} xf(x)\\,dx + \\int_{\\R} \\mu^2 f(x)\\,dx \\\\[4pt]\n     &= \\int_{\\R} x^2 \\,dF(x) - 2 \\mu \\int_{\\R} x \\,dF(x) + \\mu^2 \\int_{\\R} \\,dF(x) \\\\[4pt]\n     &= \\int_{\\R} x^2 \\,dF(x) - 2 \\mu \\cdot \\mu + \\mu^2 \\cdot 1 \\\\[4pt]\n     &= \\int_{\\R} x^2 \\,dF(x) - \\mu^2,\n \\end{align}</math>\n\nor equivalently,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\int_{\\R} x^2 f(x) \\,dx - \\mu^2 ,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the expected value of <math>X</math> given by\n\n:<math>\\mu = \\int_{\\R} x f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{\\R} x \\, d F(x). </math>\n\nIn these formulas, the integrals with respect to <math>dx</math> and <math>dF(x)</math>\nare [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue]] and [[Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integration|Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes]] integrals, respectively.\n\nIf the function <math>x^2f(x)</math> is [[Riemann-integrable]] on every finite interval <math>[a,b]\\subset\\R,</math> then\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\int^{+\\infty}_{-\\infty} x^2 f(x) \\, dx - \\mu^2, </math>\n\nwhere the integral is an [[improper Riemann integral]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Exponential distribution===\nThe [[exponential distribution]] with parameter {{mvar|&lambda;}} is a continuous distribution whose [[probability density function]] is given by\n:<math>f(x) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}</math>\non the interval {{math|[0, &infin;)}}.

This formula for the variance of the mean is used in the definition of the [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of the sample mean, which is used in the [[central limit theorem]].\n\nTo prove the initial statement, it suffices to show that\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(X+Y) = \\operatorname{Var}(X)+\\operatorname{Var}(Y).</math>\n\nThe general result then follows by induction.

The formula states that the variance of a sum is equal to the sum of all elements in the covariance matrix of the components. The next expression states equivalently that the variance of the sum is the sum of the diagonal of covariance matrix plus two times the sum of its upper triangular elements (or its lower triangular elements); this emphasizes that the covariance matrix is symmetric. This formula is used in the theory of [[Cronbach's alpha]] in [[classical test theory]].\n\nSo if the variables have equal variance ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup> and the average [[correlation]] of distinct variables is ''\u03c1'', then the variance of their mean is\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{X}) = \\frac {\\sigma^2} {n} + \\frac {n-1} {n} \\rho \\sigma^2.</math>\n\nThis implies that the variance of the mean increases with the average of the correlations. In other words, additional correlated observations are not as effective as additional independent observations at reducing the [[standard error|uncertainty of the mean]]. Moreover, if the variables have unit variance, for example if they are standardized, then this simplifies to\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{X}) = \\frac {1} {n} + \\frac {n-1} {n} \\rho.</math>\n\nThis formula is used in the [[Spearman\u2013Brown prediction formula]] of classical test theory. This converges to ''\u03c1'' if ''n'' goes to infinity, provided that the average correlation remains constant or converges too. So for the variance of the mean of standardized variables with equal correlations or converging average correlation we have\n\n:<math> \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{X}) = \\rho.</math>\n\nTherefore, the variance of the mean of a large number of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation. This makes clear that the sample mean of correlated variables does not generally converge to the population mean, even though the [[law of large numbers]] states that the sample mean will converge for independent variables.\n\n====[[I.i.d.]] with random sample size====\nThere are cases when a sample is taken without knowing, in advance, how many observations will be acceptable according to some criterion.

For example, a variable measured in meters will have a variance measured in meters squared.  For this reason, describing data sets via their [[standard deviation]] or [[root mean square deviation]] is often preferred over using the variance.  In the dice example the standard deviation is {{math|{{sqrt|2.9}} \u2248 1.7}}, slightly larger than the expected absolute deviation of&nbsp;1.5.\n\nThe standard deviation and the expected absolute deviation can both be used as an indicator of the \"spread\" of a distribution.  The standard deviation is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than the expected absolute deviation, and, together with variance and its generalization [[covariance]], is used frequently in theoretical statistics; however the expected absolute deviation tends to be more [[Robust statistics|robust]] as it is less sensitive to [[outlier]]s arising from [[measurement error|measurement anomalies]] or an unduly [[heavy-tailed distribution]].\n\n==Approximating the variance of a function==\nThe [[delta method]] uses second-order [[Taylor expansion]]s to approximate the variance of a function of one or more random variables: see [[Taylor expansions for the moments of functions of random variables]]. For example, the approximate variance of a function of one variable is given by\n\n::<math>\\operatorname{Var}\\left[f(X)\\right]\\approx \\left(f'(\\operatorname{E}\\left[X\\right])\\right)^2\\operatorname{Var}\\left[X\\right]</math>\n\nprovided that ''f'' is twice differentiable and that the mean and variance of ''X'' are finite.\n\n==Population variance and sample variance==\n{{anchor|Estimation}}\n{{see also|Unbiased estimation of standard deviation}}\nReal-world observations such as the measurements of yesterday's rain throughout the day typically cannot be complete sets of all possible observations that could be made. As such, the variance calculated from the finite set will in general not match the variance that would have been calculated from the full population of possible observations.  This means that one [[Estimation theory|estimates]] the mean and variance that would have been calculated from an omniscient set of observations by using an [[estimator]] equation.  The estimator is a function of the [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of ''n'' [[observations]] drawn without observational bias from the whole [[Statistical population|population]] of potential observations. In this example that sample would be the set of actual measurements of yesterday's rainfall from available rain gauges within the geography of interest.\n\nThe simplest estimators for population mean and population variance are simply the mean and variance of the sample, the '''sample mean''' and '''(uncorrected) sample variance''' \u2013 these are [[consistent estimator]]s (they converge to the correct value as the number of samples increases), but can be improved. Estimating the population variance by taking the sample's variance is close to optimal in general, but can be improved in two  ways. Most simply, the sample variance is computed as an average of [[squared deviations]] about the (sample) mean, by dividing by ''n.'' However, using values other than ''n'' improves the estimator in various ways. Four common values for the denominator are ''n,'' ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, and ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5: ''n'' is the simplest (population variance of the sample), ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 eliminates bias, ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 minimizes [[mean squared error]] for the normal distribution, and ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5 mostly eliminates bias in [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]] for the normal distribution.\n\nFirstly, if the omniscient mean is unknown (and is computed as the sample mean), then the sample variance is a [[biased estimator]]: it underestimates the variance by a factor of (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) / ''n''; correcting by this factor (dividing by ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 instead of ''n'') is called [[Bessel's correction]]. The resulting estimator is unbiased, and is called the '''(corrected) sample variance''' or '''unbiased sample variance'''. For example, when ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 the variance of a single observation about the sample mean (itself) is obviously zero regardless of the population variance. If the mean is determined in some other way than from the same samples used to estimate the variance then this bias does not arise and the variance can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the (independently known) mean.\n\nSecondly, the sample variance does not generally minimize [[mean squared error]] between sample variance and population variance. Correcting for bias often makes this worse: one can always choose a scale factor that performs better than the corrected sample variance, though the optimal scale factor depends on the [[excess kurtosis]] of the population (see [[Mean squared error#Variance|mean squared error: variance]]), and introduces bias. This always consists of scaling down the unbiased estimator (dividing by a number larger than ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), and is a simple example of a [[shrinkage estimator]]: one \"shrinks\" the unbiased estimator towards zero. For the normal distribution, dividing by ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 (instead of ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 or ''n'') minimizes mean squared error. The resulting estimator is biased, however, and is known as the '''biased sample variation'''.\n\n===Population variance===\nIn general, the '''''population variance''''' of a ''finite'' [[statistical population|population]] of size ''N'' with values ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> is given by\n\n:<math display=\"block\"> \\begin{align}\n \\sigma^2 &= \\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N  \\left(x_i - \\mu \\right)^2 = \\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N  \\left(x_i^2 - 2\\mu x_i + \\mu^2 \\right) \\\\[5pt]\n &= \\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2\\right) - 2\\mu \\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\\right) + \\mu^2 \\\\[5pt]\n &= \\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2\\right) - \\mu^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the population mean is\n\n: <math> \\mu = \\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i. </math>\n\nThe population variance can also be computed using\n\n:<math> \\sigma^2 = \\frac {1} {N^2}\\sum_{i<j}\\left( x_i-x_j \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2N^2} \\sum_{i, j=1}^N\\left( x_i-x_j \\right)^2.</math>\n\nThis is true because\n\n:<math display=\"block\"> \n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{2N^2} \\sum_{i, j=1}^N\\left( x_i-x_j \\right)^2 & = \n \\frac{1}{2N^2} \\sum_{i, j=1}^N\\left( x_i^2 - 2x_ix_j  + x_j^2 \\right) \\\\[5pt]\n &= \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{j=1}^N\\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2\\right) - \\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\\right)\\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{j=1}^N x_j\\right) \\\\[5pt]\n&\\quad + \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{i=1}^N\\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{j=1}^N x_j^2\\right) \\\\[5pt]\n &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sigma^2 + \\mu^2 \\right) - \\mu^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sigma^2 + \\mu^2 \\right) \\\\[5pt]\n &= \\sigma^2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe population variance matches the variance of the generating probability distribution. In this sense, the concept of population can be extended to continuous random variables with infinite populations.\n\n===Sample variance===\nIn many practical situations, the true variance of a population is not known ''a priori'' and must be computed somehow.  When dealing with extremely large populations, it is not possible to count every object in the population, so the computation must be performed on a [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of the population.<ref>Navidi, William (2006) ''Statistics for Engineers and Scientists'', McGraw-Hill, pg 14.</ref> Sample variance can also be applied to the estimation of the variance of a continuous distribution from a sample of that distribution.\n\nWe take a  [[statistical sample|sample with replacement]] of ''n'' values ''Y''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''Y''<sub>''n''</sub> from the population, where ''n''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''N'', and estimate the variance on the basis of this sample.<ref>Montgomery, D. C. and Runger, G. C. (1994) ''Applied statistics and probability for engineers'', page 201. John Wiley & Sons New York</ref> Directly taking the variance of the sample data gives the average of the [[squared deviations]]:\n\n:<math>\\sigma_Y^2 = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(Y_i - \\overline{Y} \\right)^2 =\\left(\\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i^2\\right) - \\overline{Y}^2 = \\frac {1} {n^2} \\sum_{i,j\\,:\\,i<j}\\left( Y_i-Y_j \\right)^2.</math>\n\nHere, <math>\\overline{Y}</math> denotes the [[sample mean]]: \n:<math>\\overline{Y}=\\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i .</math>\n\nSince the ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> are selected randomly, both <math>\\overline{Y}</math> and <math>\\sigma_Y^2</math> are random variables. Their expected values can be evaluated by averaging over the ensemble of all possible samples {''Y''<sub>''i''</sub>} of size ''n'' from the population. For <math>\\sigma_Y^2</math> this gives:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{E}[\\sigma_Y^2]\n& = \\operatorname{E}\\left[ \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(Y_i - \\frac 1n \\sum_{j=1}^n Y_j \\right)^2 \\right] \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\operatorname{E}\\left[ Y_i^2 - \\frac 2n Y_i \\sum_{j=1}^n Y_j + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{j=1}^n Y_j \\sum_{k=1}^n Y_k \\right] \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\frac{n-2}{n} \\operatorname{E}[Y_i^2] - \\frac 2n \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\operatorname{E}[Y_i Y_j] + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{k \\neq j}^n \\operatorname{E}[Y_j Y_k] +\\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\operatorname{E}[Y_j^2] \\right] \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\frac{n-2}{n} (\\sigma^2+\\mu^2) - \\frac 2n (n-1) \\mu^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2} n (n-1) \\mu^2 + \\frac 1n (\\sigma^2+\\mu^2) \\right] \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac{n-1}{n} \\sigma^2.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nHence <math>\\sigma_Y^2</math> gives an estimate of the population variance that is biased by a factor of <math>\\frac{n-1}{n}</math>. For this reason, <math>\\sigma_Y^2</math> is referred to as the ''biased sample variance''. Correcting for this bias yields the ''unbiased sample variance'':\n\n:<math>s^2 = \\frac{n}{n-1} \\sigma_Y^2 = \\frac{n}{n-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(Y_i - \\overline{Y} \\right)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(Y_i - \\overline{Y} \\right)^2 </math>\n\nEither estimator may be simply referred to as the ''sample variance'' when the version can be determined by context. The same proof is also applicable for samples taken from a continuous probability distribution.\n\nThe use of the term ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 is called [[Bessel's correction]], and it is also used in [[sample covariance]] and the [[sample standard deviation]] (the square root of variance). The square root is a [[concave function]] and thus introduces negative bias (by [[Jensen's inequality]]), which depends on the distribution, and thus the corrected sample standard deviation (using Bessel's correction) is biased. The [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]] is a technically involved problem, though for the normal distribution using the term ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5 yields an almost unbiased estimator.\n\nThe unbiased sample variance is a [[U-statistic]] for the function ''\u0192''(''y''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>) =&nbsp;(''y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/2, meaning that it is obtained by averaging a 2-sample statistic over 2-element subsets of the population.\n\n===Distribution of the sample variance===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right <!-- left/right/center/none --> \n| direction = vertical <!-- horizontal/vertical -->\n| width     = 250 <!-- Digits only; no \"px\" suffix, please -->\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1   = Scaled chi squared.svg <!-- Filename only; no \"File:\" or \"Image:\" prefix, please -->\n| width1   =\n| alt1     =\n| caption1 =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2   = Scaled chi squared cdf.svg <!-- Filename only; no \"File:\" or \"Image:\" prefix, please -->\n| width2   =\n| alt2     =\n| caption2 = Distribution and cumulative distribution of ''S''<sup>2</sup>/&sigma;<sup>2</sup>, for various values of ''&nu;'' = ''n'' \u2212 1, when the ''y<sub>i</sub>'' are independent normally distributed.\n}}\nBeing a function of [[random variable]]s, the sample variance is itself a random variable, and it is natural to study its distribution.

Informally, it measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value. Variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include [[descriptive statistics]], [[statistical inference]], [[hypothesis testing]], [[goodness of fit]], and [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo sampling]]. Variance is an important tool in the sciences, where statistical analysis of data is common. The variance is the square of the [[standard deviation]], the second [[central moment]] of a distribution, and the [[covariance]] of the random variable with itself, and it is often represented by <math>\\sigma^2</math>, <math>s^2</math>, or <math>\\operatorname{Var}(X)</math>.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nThe variance of a random variable <math>X</math> is the [[expected value]] of the squared deviation from the [[Expected value|mean]] of <math>X</math>, <math>\\mu = \\operatorname{E}[X]</math>:\n: <math> \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{E}\\left[(X - \\mu)^2 \\right]. </math>\nThis definition encompasses random variables that are generated by processes that are [[discrete random variable|discrete]], [[continuous random variable|continuous]], [[Cantor distribution|neither]], or mixed. The variance can also be thought of as the covariance of a random variable with itself:\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{Cov}(X, X).</math> \nThe variance is also equivalent to the second [[cumulant]] of a probability distribution that generates <math>X</math>. The variance is typically designated as <math>\\operatorname{Var}(X)</math>, <math>\\sigma^2_X</math>, or simply <math>\\sigma^2</math> (pronounced \"[[sigma]] squared\").

This formula for the variance of the mean is used in the definition of the [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of the sample mean, which is used in the [[central limit theorem]].\n\nTo prove the initial statement, it suffices to show that\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(X+Y) = \\operatorname{Var}(X)+\\operatorname{Var}(Y).</math>\n\nThe general result then follows by induction.

The formula states that the variance of a sum is equal to the sum of all elements in the covariance matrix of the components. The next expression states equivalently that the variance of the sum is the sum of the diagonal of covariance matrix plus two times the sum of its upper triangular elements (or its lower triangular elements); this emphasizes that the covariance matrix is symmetric. This formula is used in the theory of [[Cronbach's alpha]] in [[classical test theory]].\n\nSo if the variables have equal variance ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup> and the average [[correlation]] of distinct variables is ''\u03c1'', then the variance of their mean is\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{X}) = \\frac {\\sigma^2} {n} + \\frac {n-1} {n} \\rho \\sigma^2.</math>\n\nThis implies that the variance of the mean increases with the average of the correlations. In other words, additional correlated observations are not as effective as additional independent observations at reducing the [[standard error|uncertainty of the mean]]. Moreover, if the variables have unit variance, for example if they are standardized, then this simplifies to\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{X}) = \\frac {1} {n} + \\frac {n-1} {n} \\rho.</math>\n\nThis formula is used in the [[Spearman\u2013Brown prediction formula]] of classical test theory. This converges to ''\u03c1'' if ''n'' goes to infinity, provided that the average correlation remains constant or converges too. So for the variance of the mean of standardized variables with equal correlations or converging average correlation we have\n\n:<math> \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{X}) = \\rho.</math>\n\nTherefore, the variance of the mean of a large number of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation. This makes clear that the sample mean of correlated variables does not generally converge to the population mean, even though the [[law of large numbers]] states that the sample mean will converge for independent variables.\n\n====[[I.i.d.]] with random sample size====\nThere are cases when a sample is taken without knowing, in advance, how many observations will be acceptable according to some criterion.

For example, a variable measured in meters will have a variance measured in meters squared.  For this reason, describing data sets via their [[standard deviation]] or [[root mean square deviation]] is often preferred over using the variance.  In the dice example the standard deviation is {{math|{{sqrt|2.9}} \u2248 1.7}}, slightly larger than the expected absolute deviation of&nbsp;1.5.\n\nThe standard deviation and the expected absolute deviation can both be used as an indicator of the \"spread\" of a distribution.  The standard deviation is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than the expected absolute deviation, and, together with variance and its generalization [[covariance]], is used frequently in theoretical statistics; however the expected absolute deviation tends to be more [[Robust statistics|robust]] as it is less sensitive to [[outlier]]s arising from [[measurement error|measurement anomalies]] or an unduly [[heavy-tailed distribution]].\n\n==Approximating the variance of a function==\nThe [[delta method]] uses second-order [[Taylor expansion]]s to approximate the variance of a function of one or more random variables: see [[Taylor expansions for the moments of functions of random variables]]. For example, the approximate variance of a function of one variable is given by\n\n::<math>\\operatorname{Var}\\left[f(X)\\right]\\approx \\left(f'(\\operatorname{E}\\left[X\\right])\\right)^2\\operatorname{Var}\\left[X\\right]</math>\n\nprovided that ''f'' is twice differentiable and that the mean and variance of ''X'' are finite.\n\n==Population variance and sample variance==\n{{anchor|Estimation}}\n{{see also|Unbiased estimation of standard deviation}}\nReal-world observations such as the measurements of yesterday's rain throughout the day typically cannot be complete sets of all possible observations that could be made. As such, the variance calculated from the finite set will in general not match the variance that would have been calculated from the full population of possible observations.  This means that one [[Estimation theory|estimates]] the mean and variance that would have been calculated from an omniscient set of observations by using an [[estimator]] equation.  The estimator is a function of the [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of ''n'' [[observations]] drawn without observational bias from the whole [[Statistical population|population]] of potential observations. In this example that sample would be the set of actual measurements of yesterday's rainfall from available rain gauges within the geography of interest.\n\nThe simplest estimators for population mean and population variance are simply the mean and variance of the sample, the '''sample mean''' and '''(uncorrected) sample variance''' \u2013 these are [[consistent estimator]]s (they converge to the correct value as the number of samples increases), but can be improved. Estimating the population variance by taking the sample's variance is close to optimal in general, but can be improved in two  ways. Most simply, the sample variance is computed as an average of [[squared deviations]] about the (sample) mean, by dividing by ''n.'' However, using values other than ''n'' improves the estimator in various ways. Four common values for the denominator are ''n,'' ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, and ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5: ''n'' is the simplest (population variance of the sample), ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 eliminates bias, ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 minimizes [[mean squared error]] for the normal distribution, and ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5 mostly eliminates bias in [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]] for the normal distribution.\n\nFirstly, if the omniscient mean is unknown (and is computed as the sample mean), then the sample variance is a [[biased estimator]]: it underestimates the variance by a factor of (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) / ''n''; correcting by this factor (dividing by ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 instead of ''n'') is called [[Bessel's correction]]. The resulting estimator is unbiased, and is called the '''(corrected) sample variance''' or '''unbiased sample variance'''. For example, when ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 the variance of a single observation about the sample mean (itself) is obviously zero regardless of the population variance. If the mean is determined in some other way than from the same samples used to estimate the variance then this bias does not arise and the variance can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the (independently known) mean.\n\nSecondly, the sample variance does not generally minimize [[mean squared error]] between sample variance and population variance. Correcting for bias often makes this worse: one can always choose a scale factor that performs better than the corrected sample variance, though the optimal scale factor depends on the [[excess kurtosis]] of the population (see [[Mean squared error#Variance|mean squared error: variance]]), and introduces bias. This always consists of scaling down the unbiased estimator (dividing by a number larger than ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), and is a simple example of a [[shrinkage estimator]]: one \"shrinks\" the unbiased estimator towards zero. For the normal distribution, dividing by ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 (instead of ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 or ''n'') minimizes mean squared error. The resulting estimator is biased, however, and is known as the '''biased sample variation'''.\n\n===Population variance===\nIn general, the '''''population variance''''' of a ''finite'' [[statistical population|population]] of size ''N'' with values ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> is given by\n\n:<math display=\"block\"> \\begin{align}\n \\sigma^2 &= \\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N  \\left(x_i - \\mu \\right)^2 = \\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N  \\left(x_i^2 - 2\\mu x_i + \\mu^2 \\right) \\\\[5pt]\n &= \\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2\\right) - 2\\mu \\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\\right) + \\mu^2 \\\\[5pt]\n &= \\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2\\right) - \\mu^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the population mean is\n\n: <math> \\mu = \\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i. </math>\n\nThe population variance can also be computed using\n\n:<math> \\sigma^2 = \\frac {1} {N^2}\\sum_{i<j}\\left( x_i-x_j \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2N^2} \\sum_{i, j=1}^N\\left( x_i-x_j \\right)^2.</math>\n\nThis is true because\n\n:<math display=\"block\"> \n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{2N^2} \\sum_{i, j=1}^N\\left( x_i-x_j \\right)^2 & = \n \\frac{1}{2N^2} \\sum_{i, j=1}^N\\left( x_i^2 - 2x_ix_j  + x_j^2 \\right) \\\\[5pt]\n &= \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{j=1}^N\\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2\\right) - \\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\\right)\\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{j=1}^N x_j\\right) \\\\[5pt]\n&\\quad + \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{i=1}^N\\left(\\frac 1N \\sum_{j=1}^N x_j^2\\right) \\\\[5pt]\n &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sigma^2 + \\mu^2 \\right) - \\mu^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sigma^2 + \\mu^2 \\right) \\\\[5pt]\n &= \\sigma^2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe population variance matches the variance of the generating probability distribution. In this sense, the concept of population can be extended to continuous random variables with infinite populations.\n\n===Sample variance===\nIn many practical situations, the true variance of a population is not known ''a priori'' and must be computed somehow.  When dealing with extremely large populations, it is not possible to count every object in the population, so the computation must be performed on a [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of the population.<ref>Navidi, William (2006) ''Statistics for Engineers and Scientists'', McGraw-Hill, pg 14.</ref> Sample variance can also be applied to the estimation of the variance of a continuous distribution from a sample of that distribution.\n\nWe take a  [[statistical sample|sample with replacement]] of ''n'' values ''Y''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''Y''<sub>''n''</sub> from the population, where ''n''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''N'', and estimate the variance on the basis of this sample.<ref>Montgomery, D. C. and Runger, G. C. (1994) ''Applied statistics and probability for engineers'', page 201. John Wiley & Sons New York</ref> Directly taking the variance of the sample data gives the average of the [[squared deviations]]:\n\n:<math>\\sigma_Y^2 = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(Y_i - \\overline{Y} \\right)^2 =\\left(\\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i^2\\right) - \\overline{Y}^2 = \\frac {1} {n^2} \\sum_{i,j\\,:\\,i<j}\\left( Y_i-Y_j \\right)^2.</math>\n\nHere, <math>\\overline{Y}</math> denotes the [[sample mean]]: \n:<math>\\overline{Y}=\\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i .</math>\n\nSince the ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> are selected randomly, both <math>\\overline{Y}</math> and <math>\\sigma_Y^2</math> are random variables. Their expected values can be evaluated by averaging over the ensemble of all possible samples {''Y''<sub>''i''</sub>} of size ''n'' from the population. For <math>\\sigma_Y^2</math> this gives:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{E}[\\sigma_Y^2]\n& = \\operatorname{E}\\left[ \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(Y_i - \\frac 1n \\sum_{j=1}^n Y_j \\right)^2 \\right] \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\operatorname{E}\\left[ Y_i^2 - \\frac 2n Y_i \\sum_{j=1}^n Y_j + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{j=1}^n Y_j \\sum_{k=1}^n Y_k \\right] \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\frac{n-2}{n} \\operatorname{E}[Y_i^2] - \\frac 2n \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\operatorname{E}[Y_i Y_j] + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{k \\neq j}^n \\operatorname{E}[Y_j Y_k] +\\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\operatorname{E}[Y_j^2] \\right] \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\frac{n-2}{n} (\\sigma^2+\\mu^2) - \\frac 2n (n-1) \\mu^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2} n (n-1) \\mu^2 + \\frac 1n (\\sigma^2+\\mu^2) \\right] \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac{n-1}{n} \\sigma^2.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nHence <math>\\sigma_Y^2</math> gives an estimate of the population variance that is biased by a factor of <math>\\frac{n-1}{n}</math>. For this reason, <math>\\sigma_Y^2</math> is referred to as the ''biased sample variance''. Correcting for this bias yields the ''unbiased sample variance'':\n\n:<math>s^2 = \\frac{n}{n-1} \\sigma_Y^2 = \\frac{n}{n-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(Y_i - \\overline{Y} \\right)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(Y_i - \\overline{Y} \\right)^2 </math>\n\nEither estimator may be simply referred to as the ''sample variance'' when the version can be determined by context. The same proof is also applicable for samples taken from a continuous probability distribution.\n\nThe use of the term ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 is called [[Bessel's correction]], and it is also used in [[sample covariance]] and the [[sample standard deviation]] (the square root of variance). The square root is a [[concave function]] and thus introduces negative bias (by [[Jensen's inequality]]), which depends on the distribution, and thus the corrected sample standard deviation (using Bessel's correction) is biased. The [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]] is a technically involved problem, though for the normal distribution using the term ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5 yields an almost unbiased estimator.\n\nThe unbiased sample variance is a [[U-statistic]] for the function ''\u0192''(''y''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>) =&nbsp;(''y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/2, meaning that it is obtained by averaging a 2-sample statistic over 2-element subsets of the population.\n\n===Distribution of the sample variance===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right <!-- left/right/center/none --> \n| direction = vertical <!-- horizontal/vertical -->\n| width     = 250 <!-- Digits only; no \"px\" suffix, please -->\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1   = Scaled chi squared.svg <!-- Filename only; no \"File:\" or \"Image:\" prefix, please -->\n| width1   =\n| alt1     =\n| caption1 =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2   = Scaled chi squared cdf.svg <!-- Filename only; no \"File:\" or \"Image:\" prefix, please -->\n| width2   =\n| alt2     =\n| caption2 = Distribution and cumulative distribution of ''S''<sup>2</sup>/&sigma;<sup>2</sup>, for various values of ''&nu;'' = ''n'' \u2212 1, when the ''y<sub>i</sub>'' are independent normally distributed.\n}}\nBeing a function of [[random variable]]s, the sample variance is itself a random variable, and it is natural to study its distribution.

The IPOB rose to prominence after previous Biafran independence organizations got weakened.

Biafrans all over the world have identified with the movement, thereby making IPOB to be a face of Biafra restoration movement.\n\n== Background ==\nBiafra had previously existed as an Independent Republic declared by Lieutenant Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu for three years, 1967 through 1970. The federal government fought hard to preserve the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and did not like the idea of an independent state of [[Biafra]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Biafra |title= Biafra: Secessonist State, Nigeria|author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref>.

In 1970, the Biafran forces surrendered through the armistice brokered by the defunct OAU <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Peaceful Settlement of Disputes: Unsolved Problem for the OAU (A Case Study of the Nigeria-Biafra Conflict)|journal = Africa Today|volume = 24|issue = 4|pages = 39\u201358|jstor = 4185729|last1 = Akuchu|first1 = Gemuh E.|year = 1977}}</ref>. From 1970 onwards, Nigeria remained a united nation. \n\n== Leadership ==\nThe leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra is [[Nnamdi Kanu|Nnamdi kanu]] who is a dual British and Biafran citizen. He created IPOB after he initially gained fame from his broadcasts on [[Radio Biafra]], which was established in 2009. This was a radio station from London that broadcast messages that called for \"freedom of Biafrans\" and criticised corruption in the government of Nigeria. Radio Biafra catalyzed Kanu\u2019s rise to the public scene, as he was previously an unknown figure.<ref name=\":0\" /> Kanu was arrested by Nigerian security forces on 19 October 2015, on charges of \"sedition, ethnic incitement and treasonable felony.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=IBEANU, ORJI, IWUAMADI|first=OKECHUKWU, NKWACHUKWU, CHIJIOKE|date=2016|title=Biafra Separatism: Causes, Consequences and Remedies|url=|journal=Institute for Innovations in Development|volume=|pages=1\u201371|via=Research Gate}}</ref>\n\n== Links with other groups ==\nThere have been many other pro-Biafran groups that have come into existence. The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra ([[Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra|MASSOB]]) began gaining attention in the early 2000s, along with the Biafra Zionist Movement (BZM) which rose to the spotlight in 2012. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) emerged in 2012 as well after these other groups<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bybee|first=Ashley|date=November 9, 2017|title=The Indigenous People of Biafra: Another Stab at Biafran Independence|url=https://www.ida.org/idamedia/Corporate/Files/Publications/AfricaWatch/africawatch-November-9-2017-vol17.pdf|journal=Institute for Defense Analyses|volume=17|pages=1\u20135|via=}}</ref>. \n\nIPOB emerged to continue the movement that had been championed by MASSOB. MASSOB was formed in 1999 by its national leader [[Ralph Uwazuruike]]. However, the organization was severely weakened due to alleged state repression and disagreement within the group about leadership. MASSOB accused \u00a0Uwazuruike of associating himself with \u201cmainstream Nigerian politics\u201d instead of furthering the cause of Biafra<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenationonlineng.net/massob-expels-uwazuruike-picks-new-leadership/|title=MASSOB expels Uwazuruike, picks new leadership|date=2015-11-30|website=The Nation Newspaper|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. These conflicts contributed to the formation of another faction named BZM. BZM leader Benjamin Igwe Onwuka and many members of the group were arrested for treason by the Nigerian government at a rally that took place on 5 November, 2012 in the region of Enugu. BZM\u2019s activities were scaled down because of arrests and trials of many lead members of the organization. Both of these pro-Biafran groups set up the rise of IPOB which would continue championing the same causes<ref name=\":1\" />. \n\n== Protest ==\nThere has been recent peaceful protest in the country regarding IPOB. The organizations leader and a prominent activist named Nnamdi Kanu has been arrested by Nigeria\u2019s Department of State Services on 19 October, 2015. In response to his arrest there has been a group of pro-Biafran protesters who have been leading marches in eastern parts of Nigeria to push for his release. His arrest has pushed IPOB supporters into gaining further traction, as their mobilization grew<ref name=\":0\" />. There have been many protesters and police clashes; on 2 December, 2015, nine protesters and two policemen were killed at a protest in Onitsha, Anambra state<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/investigationspecial-reports/204902-special-report-inside-massive-extrajudicial-killings-nigerias-south-east.html|title=SPECIAL REPORT: Inside the massive extrajudicial killings in Nigeria's South-East|last=Maya|first=Emmanuel|date=2016-06-08|website=Premium Times Nigeria|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>.

The cause in rising protests are attributed to the claimed political disenfranchisement among the Igbo people and much trauma that continues as an effect of the Nigerian civil war.\n\nIPOB supporters have cited historical events such as the 2016 election of [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]], and Britain's vote to exit the [[European Union]] as proof of international support for \u201cself-determination.<ref name=\":0\" />\u201d According to many sources, Donald Trump\u2019s victory provides hope for the IPOB group in their ability to secede from Nigeria. Trump\u2019s political interests are in line with supporting Biafra, because of oil pursuits. U.S oil company outputs in Nigeria have been cut by militants in the [[Niger Delta]] who have been continually attacking pipelines<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0Therefore, IPOB figures contend that it is within the United State\u2019s economic interest to support the Biafran secessionist movement due to agitations in the region<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/nigeria-biafra-separatists-are-celebrating-donald-trumps-election-519550|title=In Nigeria, secessionists are celebrating Donald Trump's election|last=EST|first=Conor Gaffey On 11/10/16 at 1:39 PM|date=2016-11-10|website=Newsweek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. However, as of yet Trump has made no public statement in support of Biafran self-determination.\n\nThe pro-Biafran protesters are calling for the immediate release of Nnamdi Kanu and other Biafran activists that have been jailed. Most importantly they want an independence referendum to have a date set by the government. The editor of pro-Biafran media outlet \u2018Voice of Biafra\u2019 Nnabuike Nnadede stated that the Igbo people suffer from a lack of resources and investment from the Nigerian government. The main reason for their protests are because they want the opportunity to vote for independence<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/what-biafra-and-why-are-some-nigerians-calling-independence-401164|title=What is Biafra and Why are Some Nigerians Calling for Independence?|last=EST|first=Conor Gaffey On 12/7/15 at 7:22 AM|date=2015-12-07|website=Newsweek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>.\n\n== State response and treatment ==\nThe Federal High Court in Abuja has labelled the IPOB as a terrorist organization on 18 September 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punchng.com/court-affirms-ipobs-proscription-designation-as-terrorist-group/|title=Court affirms IPOB's proscription, designation as terrorist group|last=Published|website=Punch Newspapers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>.

However, their attempt has ultimately been unsuccessful, and they continue to be declared as terrorist organization under Nigeria\u2019s Terrorism Act.\n\nAccording to sources, the Nigerian State has utilized violent and excessive police force in order to silence pro-Biafran movements. This police violence has been ongoing from 2014, first targeting MASSOB and IPOB after its formation<ref name=\":1\" />. In 2008, MASSOB claimed that 2,020 of their members had been massacred and extra-judicially killed by the state. Amnesty International released a report detailing that countless IPOB protesters were killed between the 29th through 30th of May 2016 during a governmental operation wanting to prevent IPOB members marching from Nkpor motor park to a rally<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.nl/actueel/nigeria-killing-of-unarmed-pro-biafra-supporters-by-military-must-be-urgently-investigated|title=Nigeria: Killing of unarmed pro-Biafra supporters by military must be urgently investigated|website=Amnesty International|language=nl|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. \u00a0The Nigerian army claims that they were acting in self-defense, and that the death count lies at five instead of fifty.

From 1970 onwards, Nigeria remained a united nation. \n\n== Leadership ==\nThe leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra is [[Nnamdi Kanu|Nnamdi kanu]] who is a dual British and Biafran citizen. He created IPOB after he initially gained fame from his broadcasts on [[Radio Biafra]], which was established in 2009. This was a radio station from London that broadcast messages that called for \"freedom of Biafrans\" and criticised corruption in the government of Nigeria. Radio Biafra catalyzed Kanu\u2019s rise to the public scene, as he was previously an unknown figure.<ref name=\":0\" /> Kanu was arrested by Nigerian security forces on 19 October 2015, on charges of \"sedition, ethnic incitement and treasonable felony.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=IBEANU, ORJI, IWUAMADI|first=OKECHUKWU, NKWACHUKWU, CHIJIOKE|date=2016|title=Biafra Separatism: Causes, Consequences and Remedies|url=|journal=Institute for Innovations in Development|volume=|pages=1\u201371|via=Research Gate}}</ref>\n\n== Links with other groups ==\nThere have been many other pro-Biafran groups that have come into existence. The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra ([[Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra|MASSOB]]) began gaining attention in the early 2000s, along with the Biafra Zionist Movement (BZM) which rose to the spotlight in 2012. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) emerged in 2012 as well after these other groups<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bybee|first=Ashley|date=November 9, 2017|title=The Indigenous People of Biafra: Another Stab at Biafran Independence|url=https://www.ida.org/idamedia/Corporate/Files/Publications/AfricaWatch/africawatch-November-9-2017-vol17.pdf|journal=Institute for Defense Analyses|volume=17|pages=1\u20135|via=}}</ref>. \n\nIPOB emerged to continue the movement that had been championed by MASSOB. MASSOB was formed in 1999 by its national leader [[Ralph Uwazuruike]]. However, the organization was severely weakened due to alleged state repression and disagreement within the group about leadership. MASSOB accused \u00a0Uwazuruike of associating himself with \u201cmainstream Nigerian politics\u201d instead of furthering the cause of Biafra<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenationonlineng.net/massob-expels-uwazuruike-picks-new-leadership/|title=MASSOB expels Uwazuruike, picks new leadership|date=2015-11-30|website=The Nation Newspaper|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. These conflicts contributed to the formation of another faction named BZM. BZM leader Benjamin Igwe Onwuka and many members of the group were arrested for treason by the Nigerian government at a rally that took place on 5 November, 2012 in the region of Enugu. BZM\u2019s activities were scaled down because of arrests and trials of many lead members of the organization. Both of these pro-Biafran groups set up the rise of IPOB which would continue championing the same causes<ref name=\":1\" />. \n\n== Protest ==\nThere has been recent peaceful protest in the country regarding IPOB. The organizations leader and a prominent activist named Nnamdi Kanu has been arrested by Nigeria\u2019s Department of State Services on 19 October, 2015. In response to his arrest there has been a group of pro-Biafran protesters who have been leading marches in eastern parts of Nigeria to push for his release. His arrest has pushed IPOB supporters into gaining further traction, as their mobilization grew<ref name=\":0\" />. There have been many protesters and police clashes; on 2 December, 2015, nine protesters and two policemen were killed at a protest in Onitsha, Anambra state<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/investigationspecial-reports/204902-special-report-inside-massive-extrajudicial-killings-nigerias-south-east.html|title=SPECIAL REPORT: Inside the massive extrajudicial killings in Nigeria's South-East|last=Maya|first=Emmanuel|date=2016-06-08|website=Premium Times Nigeria|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>.

The cause in rising protests are attributed to the claimed political disenfranchisement among the Igbo people and much trauma that continues as an effect of the Nigerian civil war.\n\nIPOB supporters have cited historical events such as the 2016 election of [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]], and Britain's vote to exit the [[European Union]] as proof of international support for \u201cself-determination.<ref name=\":0\" />\u201d According to many sources, Donald Trump\u2019s victory provides hope for the IPOB group in their ability to secede from Nigeria. Trump\u2019s political interests are in line with supporting Biafra, because of oil pursuits. U.S oil company outputs in Nigeria have been cut by militants in the [[Niger Delta]] who have been continually attacking pipelines<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0Therefore, IPOB figures contend that it is within the United State\u2019s economic interest to support the Biafran secessionist movement due to agitations in the region<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/nigeria-biafra-separatists-are-celebrating-donald-trumps-election-519550|title=In Nigeria, secessionists are celebrating Donald Trump's election|last=EST|first=Conor Gaffey On 11/10/16 at 1:39 PM|date=2016-11-10|website=Newsweek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. However, as of yet Trump has made no public statement in support of Biafran self-determination.\n\nThe pro-Biafran protesters are calling for the immediate release of Nnamdi Kanu and other Biafran activists that have been jailed. Most importantly they want an independence referendum to have a date set by the government. The editor of pro-Biafran media outlet \u2018Voice of Biafra\u2019 Nnabuike Nnadede stated that the Igbo people suffer from a lack of resources and investment from the Nigerian government. The main reason for their protests are because they want the opportunity to vote for independence<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/what-biafra-and-why-are-some-nigerians-calling-independence-401164|title=What is Biafra and Why are Some Nigerians Calling for Independence?|last=EST|first=Conor Gaffey On 12/7/15 at 7:22 AM|date=2015-12-07|website=Newsweek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>.\n\n== State response and treatment ==\nThe Federal High Court in Abuja has labelled the IPOB as a terrorist organization on 18 September 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punchng.com/court-affirms-ipobs-proscription-designation-as-terrorist-group/|title=Court affirms IPOB's proscription, designation as terrorist group|last=Published|website=Punch Newspapers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>.

However, their attempt has ultimately been unsuccessful, and they continue to be declared as terrorist organization under Nigeria\u2019s Terrorism Act.\n\nAccording to sources, the Nigerian State has utilized violent and excessive police force in order to silence pro-Biafran movements. This police violence has been ongoing from 2014, first targeting MASSOB and IPOB after its formation<ref name=\":1\" />. In 2008, MASSOB claimed that 2,020 of their members had been massacred and extra-judicially killed by the state. Amnesty International released a report detailing that countless IPOB protesters were killed between the 29th through 30th of May 2016 during a governmental operation wanting to prevent IPOB members marching from Nkpor motor park to a rally<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.nl/actueel/nigeria-killing-of-unarmed-pro-biafra-supporters-by-military-must-be-urgently-investigated|title=Nigeria: Killing of unarmed pro-Biafra supporters by military must be urgently investigated|website=Amnesty International|language=nl|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. \u00a0The Nigerian army claims that they were acting in self-defense, and that the death count lies at five instead of fifty.

While the commission was authorized by an 80% positive vote of county voters in a 1906 referendum, it was controversial and there was a Michigan state supreme court case pressed which found it unconstitutional.  Commissioners Benton and Ford quit, but commissioner Hines persisted and led the commission through reorganization getting around the obstacles.<ref name=mps/>{{rp|33}}  Hines was a commissioner continuously from 1906 to 1938.\n\nHines is credited with the idea of putting a painted line down a roadway's center to divide traffic, and other innovations that were later widely adopted.\n\nThe commission worked systematically, and it became a model to others.  \"As early as 1911, the commission felt confident in asserting that 'Wayne County is coming to be known as a leader in the good roads movement, and the Mecca of those upon whose shoulders devolves the duty of solving traffic problems.'

It had long had its own in-house construction group to build bridges, before the state copied that practice in 1924.<ref name=mps/>{{rp|10}}  It adopted one or more bridge types before the state did.\n\nIts first commissioners were [[Edward N. Hines]], Cassius R. Benton, and automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]].  While the commission was authorized by an 80% positive vote of county voters in a 1906 referendum, it was controversial and there was a Michigan state supreme court case pressed which found it unconstitutional.  Commissioners Benton and Ford quit, but commissioner Hines persisted and led the commission through reorganization getting around the obstacles.<ref name=mps/>{{rp|33}}  Hines was a commissioner continuously from 1906 to 1938.\n\nHines is credited with the idea of putting a painted line down a roadway's center to divide traffic, and other innovations that were later widely adopted.\n\nThe commission worked systematically, and it became a model to others.  \"As early as 1911, the commission felt confident in asserting that 'Wayne County is coming to be known as a leader in the good roads movement, and the Mecca of those upon whose shoulders devolves the duty of solving traffic problems.' Within a few years, the county hosted delegations of engineers from around the United States, as well as from a number of other\ncountries, including Britain, Japan, Australia, and Borneo.[footnote omitted] The commission's international prominence was enhanced by its advocacy of concrete as a road material. It claimed credit for constructing the country's first mile of concrete-paved rural highway, a section of Woodward Avenue\" just outside the Detroit city limits.<ref name=mps/>\n\nThe county road commission led in calling, during the 1930s, for superhighways in the state to relieve congestion;  it worked to build superhighways in conjunction with the state plan that emerged, and which the county road commission endorsed.\n\nThe state relied upon the Wayne County Road Commission to provide expertise to build the Willow Run Expressway, during World War II as many state staff went into military service.<ref name=mps/>{{rp|18}}  The state hired the county road commission to supervise the building of the Lodge Expressway.<ref name=mps/>{{rp|27}}\n\nA number of the county road commissions' works are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Wayne County, Michigan|National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=mps>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=64500271}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Documentation: Historic Highway Bridges of Michigan, 1875-1948 / Wayne County: An Exemplary Road Commission, 1906-1948 |first1= Charlene K. |last1= Roise |first2= Clayton B. |last2=Fraser |date=August 1998 |publisher=National Park Service}}</ref><ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>\n\nThe county road commission was merged into the general county government,<ref name=mps/>{{rp|42}} becoming the Roads Division of the Department of Public Services.<ref>{{cite web |author= Roads Division |url= http://www.co.wayne.mi.us/dps/dps_roads_history.htm |title= History of the Wayne County Road Commission |publisher= Wayne County Department of Public Services |accessdate= October 18, 2012 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121101031522/http://www.co.wayne.mi.us/dps/dps_roads_history.htm |archivedate= November 1, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n*Willow Run Freeway, now part of [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|Interstate&nbsp;94]] (I-94)<ref name=mps/>\n*Lodge Freeway, now [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]]<ref name=mps/>\n*[[East River Road-North Hickory Canal Bridge]], East River Road over North Hickory Canal, [[Grosse Ile, Michigan]] (Wayne County Road Commission), NRHP-listed<ref name=nris/>\n*[[Ferry Street-Thorofare Canal Bridge]], Ferry Street over Thorofare Canal, Grosse Ile, Michigan (Wayne County Road Commission), NRHP-listed<ref name=nris/>\n*[[Fort Street-Pleasant Street and Norfolk & Western Railroad Viaduct]], Fort Street over Pleasant Street and [[Norfolk and Western Railway]], [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] (Wayne County Road Commission), NRHP-listed<ref name=nris/>\n*[[Parke Lane Road-Thorofare Canal Bridge]], Parke Lane Road over Thorofare Channel, Grosse Ile, Michigan (Wayne County Road Commission), NRHP-listed<ref name=nris/>\n*[[South Pointe Drive-Frenchman's Creek Bridge]], South Pointe Drive over Frenchman's Creek, Grosse Ile, Michigan (Wayne County Road Commission), NRHP-listed<ref name=nris/>\n*[[Waltz Road-Huron River Bridge]], Waltz Road over [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]], [[Huron Township, Michigan]] (Wayne County Road Commission), NRHP-listed<ref name=nris/>\n\n===Major highways===\n*{{jct|state=MI|I|75}} through the [[Downriver]] communities, then through the southwest-side neighborhoods of [[Detroit]] and serves as the northern border of [[Downtown Detroit]] as the Fisher Freeway.
