Findings attest that the region was peopled from the Neolithic period. Teutons, Avars, and Slavs appeared here in the first millennium BC.\n\nHungarians settled down in the surrounding country in the decades following the Hungarian Conquest, which began in AD 895. The town itself must have originated from that era. The burial places found on the confines of the town render this pretension probable.\n\nThe first genuine written document about Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny dates back to 1219. In 1334, Lord Chief Justice [[Thomas Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi]] induced King Charles Robert to permit the status of town, so Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny became a market town in the same year.\n\nThe Turkish occupied Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny in 1552 under the name \"Se\u00e7en\" and after that the town became the center of a [[sanjak of Se\u00e7en|sanjak]] for several decades. The first Turkish occupation ended in 1593, whereupon [[Zsigmond Forg\u00e1ch]] became the landed proprietor of the town and the captain of the fortress at the same time. The second Turkish occupation lasted 20 years. Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny became practically deserted by the end of the nearly 150-year Turkish rule.\n\nOne of the most glorious parts of the town history is linked with the war of independence in 1703 that was called into being against Habsburgs by Prince Ferenc R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II. The Prince convened the Diet into our town in September 1705, where he was elected the ruling Prince of Transylvania and commander-in chief of the Hungarian insurgent forces. Although the war of independence failed, the inhabitants of the town still treasure the Prince's memory. Many town institutions bear his name.\n\n1737 is a remarkable date in the life of the town as the Forg\u00e1ch repurchased their property from Koh\u00e1ry family. The town began a slow development in the 18th century, a lot of private houses were built and the first pharmacy of the county was opened in 1741. The baroque style Forg\u00e1ch Castle - which is a museum nowadays - was built in that century as well.\n\nThe development of the town slowed down in the 19th century and fell behind other towns in N\u00f3gr\u00e1d, such as Balassagyarmat, Losonc, Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n. Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny lost its town status in 1886 owing to the decision of Parliament. In spite of the situation, a town hall was built in 1905 and the municipality organized a brilliant commemorative R\u00e1k\u00f3czi festival on the 200th anniversary of the 1705 Diet.\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920, following the [[First World War]], Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny became a frontier town, which has hindered its development until the present day. The [[Second World War]] did not keep out of Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny's way either. During the fighting raging in December 1944, the inhabitants suffered greatly.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the war, the reorganization of life started immediately. [[Nationalization]] and [[collectivization]] brought fundamental changes in everyday life.\n\nUntil the end of the 1970s, Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny was an administrative center, being the chief town of the district. When the public administration system was reformed, the function of the seat of the district became extinct. As a result, several institutions and offices were closed down, e.g. the district court, the title registry, the central police station, and the high school. Two other settlements belong to Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny's current administration, though: [[P\u00f6st\u00e9nypuszta]], located beside the [[River Ipoly]], and [[Bencz\u00farfalva]], {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=off}} away.\n\nThe recession in the 1990s also damaged the local economy, but significant improvements in infrastructure were\ncarried out, including sewer and gas networks and connection to the national telephone network.\n\nThe institutions of the town also have changed. A second high school was founded in 1994, along with an ambulance station and nursing home. The agricultural vocational school and the art school, though, were transferred to the county seat.\n\n==Geography & Geology==\nSz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny lies in the northern part of [[N\u00f3gr\u00e1d county]] on the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] border, at the edge of the [[Ipoly valley]].  The town is situated at a height of {{convert|155|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] in a small basin along the [[River Ipoly]] at the intersection of Northern, Northeast, and Eastern [[Cserh\u00e1t hills]]. The major part of the town was built on a plateau extending along the southern edge of the basin. The north-south flow of the river turns into east-west nearby.\n\nIts geographical position is 48\u00b0 5\" N, 19\u00b0 32\" E.\n\nThe Szentl\u00e9lek (\"Holy Spirit\") is a stream running through the town along the edge of the plateau and flowing into the Ipoly. On the confines of the settlement, there is a pond originating from ballast-digging.\n\n==Climatic features==\nSz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny has a continental climate of wetter type. The average number of\nsunny hours is 1,990 a year. The average annual mean is {{convert|9.1|C|F|1}}, on the\nbasis of the yearly average in the last 70 years. The annual rainfall is {{convert|360|to|610|mm|0|abbr=on}} - taking the yearly average of 50 years as a basis. The prevailing winds are westerly and northwestly.\n\n==Geological features==\nThe plough-lands in the Ipoly valley are of good quality, they are suitable\nfor agricultural production. The soil of hills surrounding the valley is of\npoorer quality but the plateau is under crop.\nThe major part of the soil is medium or high acidic. The most frequent type\nis brown alluvial forest soil. Quite a large area is covered by 'kov\u00e1rv\u00e1ny'\nbrown forest soil (sandy brown forest soil with thin interstratified layers\nof colloid and sesquioxide accumulation), chernozem-brown forest soil and\nbrown earth. Meadow and meadow alluvial soils are typical along the Ipoly.\nSporadically, loess and sand can be found. The average gold crown value of\nthe cropland (measurement unit of the quality of arable land in Hungary) is\n24.97 per hectare, which is below the national average.\n*'''Infrastructure'''\nAfter the transformation of regime the town assigned a substantial sum for\nextension the public utility services to 100%. Every property of the settlement has\naccessibility to piped water and sewage network as well as to pipeline gas.\nSz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny is the traffic junction of the neighbouring villages. Vars\u00e1ny,\nN\u00f3gr\u00e1dsipek, Rim\u00f3c can be approached just via our town.\nSz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny lies {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} from the county seat Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n and {{convert|105|km|0|abbr=on}} from\nBudapest. Several bus services are available to Budapest every day but there\nis a railway line too.\nBecause of the investments of the past years, the roads maintained by the\nlocal government got damaged. The municipal corporation is planning to carry\nout a road reconstruction and intends to finance it steadily.\n\nOn the basis of treaty between Hungarian and Slovak Government, in Postenypuszta,\nwhich belongs to Szecseny, the building of a bridge on river Ipoly will begin soon.\nThus, the bordercross traffic, which has not worked since the World War II, will be\nreestabilished.\n\n==Culture==\nThe community centre co-ordinates and organises the cultural life of the\ntown. We have several traditional festivals: Town Day at the end of May or\nat the beginning of June, Autumn Art Exhibition of Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny and Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny\nVintage Festival. The cultural centre sponsors the [[Ferenc Erkel]] mixed-voice\nchoir that has been performing for 30 years. There is a projection in the\nbuilding once a week. The kindergarteners and school children regularly\nwatch different educational and entertaining films there.\nThe town library works within the framework of the cultural centre. Readers\ncan choose from 44 thousand volumes. The number of the registered readers is\nnearly 2,000.\n\n==Education, school system==\nThe local government maintains the following educational institutions:\n- Kindergarten: The teachers do high quality pedagogic work in the three\nbuildings of the nursery school.\n- Ferenc R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II Elementary School: It has one building. Owing to the\nhigh-standard didactic and educational work, pupils won several inter-school\ncompetitions.\n- S\u00e1ndor K\u0131r\u00f6si Csoma Secondary Grammar and Vocational School: The municipal\ncorporation founded it in 1994 as an 8-grade secondary grammar school. The\nvocational education of computer technology began in 1998. Teaching foreign\nlanguages and computer science have -outstanding - importance.\nThe following institutions are maintained by the county self-government:\n- The School of Arts: The music section is fairly successful. The members of\nthe dramatic group regularly perform at the town festivities.\n- B\u00e9la Lipthay Agricultural Secondary Vocational School: This technical\nschool trains agricultural skilled workers. The students come not only from\nN\u00f3gr\u00e1d but also from other counties as well. The school also organises\ncourses for adults and courses adjusted to the trade, too.\nSocial welfare, healthcare, unemployment\nThree general practitioners and two paediatricians work in Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny as\nentrepreneurs. There are four dentists. The dentists also attend the\ninhabitants of 12 villages in the region of Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny. Besides basic\nhealthcare a small laboratory, physical therapy and therapeutic gymnastics\nare available as well. There is a gynaecological consultation too but it\nis a private practice.\nMore and more people appeal to holistic medicine practitioners whose work is\nco-ordinated by one of the paediatricians in the framework of a medical\ncentre.\nThe ambulance station has been working since 1993. Its job is confined to\ntransporting patients. The emergency service is operated by an enterprise\nowned by a doctor.\n*'''Social welfare'''\nThe present data of the unemployment show that approximately 1,000\ninhabitants are entitled to a form of social allocations the major part of\nwhich is financed by the local authority.\n*'''Unemployment'''\nOur figures, which were published by the Employment Centre of N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County,\nrelate to Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny and its region. The number of the registered unemployed:\n1,625, including 896 men and 729 women. Manual workers: 1,429 people, not\nmanual, white-collar workers: 196 people.\nProfessional grouping:\n- Skilled worker: 425\n- Semi-skilled labourer: 507\n- Unskilled worker or handyman: 520\nClassification according to educational level:\n- fewer than 8 elementary grades: 245\n- 8-grade elementary school: 688\n- trade school: 392\n- technical school: 24\n- technical academy: 40\n- vocational technical school: 130\n- secondary grammar school: 86\n- college, university: 20\n*'''Agriculture'''\nAs a consequence of the Act of Co-operative farms 1992, one of the best\nco-operative farms of the country was liquidated in Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny and was\nsucceeded by a number of collective and private farms. They work in the\nagricultural sector and deal with cultivation first of all. The\ntraditionally grown plants are: potato, maize, sunflower and grain crop.\n\nThe collective farms are raising cows at present as well as sheep. Growing\nnumber of private farmers keep horses too. The majority of the landowners\nhave a farm of {{convert|1.5|ha|acres|1|abbr=off}}. This area supplies their household mainly.\nThere are few private or collective farmers who run a farm bigger than 50\nhectares.\n*'''Industry'''\nThe biggest employer of the town is Eurocandle Ltd., the owners of which are\nDanish entrepreneurs. They employ 300 people and export their products. The\nother important industrial company, the Tommy Invest Ltd. gives work to 280\nworkers.\nSeveral building entrepreneurs work in the town. There are two important\nfactories: furniture and packing machines ones. A lot of trading companies\nwork in our town. The most significant of them is Pal\u00f3c-Coop Ltd. The local\ngovernment is revising the tax on practice of a trade, the amount of which\nis 2,0%.\n*'''Religion'''\nThe majority of the inhabitants are Roman Catholic, the minority is\nLutheran. The practice of the Catholic religion is helped by Franciscan\nfriars who live in the local Franciscan monastery, founded in 1339. The\nClarissa nuns (Franciscan Order of Poor Clares) undertake the task of\nnursing of great importance.\n*'''Ethnic minorities'''\nThe Gypsy Minority Self-government has been working in the town since 1994.\nTheir aim is to preserve and protect the Gypsy traditions. The mayor's\noffice supports their work and supplies the material conditions for them.\n*'''Tourism'''\n[[File:Leaning Tower Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny Hungary W-SW.jpg|thumb|100px|right|The Firetower, the leaning tower of the town]]\nThe tourism has not made the most of the potentials of the town yet. The\nlocal authority maintains a Tourinform office, which works together with the\nHandicrfts\u2019 Society in the renovted building of Handicraftsman\u2019s House.

Findings attest that the region was peopled from the Neolithic period. Teutons, Avars, and Slavs appeared here in the first millennium BC.\n\nHungarians settled down in the surrounding country in the decades following the Hungarian Conquest, which began in AD 895. The town itself must have originated from that era. The burial places found on the confines of the town render this pretension probable.\n\nThe first genuine written document about Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny dates back to 1219. In 1334, Lord Chief Justice [[Thomas Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi]] induced King Charles Robert to permit the status of town, so Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny became a market town in the same year.\n\nThe Turkish occupied Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny in 1552 under the name \"Se\u00e7en\" and after that the town became the center of a [[sanjak of Se\u00e7en|sanjak]] for several decades. The first Turkish occupation ended in 1593, whereupon [[Zsigmond Forg\u00e1ch]] became the landed proprietor of the town and the captain of the fortress at the same time. The second Turkish occupation lasted 20 years. Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny became practically deserted by the end of the nearly 150-year Turkish rule.\n\nOne of the most glorious parts of the town history is linked with the war of independence in 1703 that was called into being against Habsburgs by Prince Ferenc R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II. The Prince convened the Diet into our town in September 1705, where he was elected the ruling Prince of Transylvania and commander-in chief of the Hungarian insurgent forces. Although the war of independence failed, the inhabitants of the town still treasure the Prince's memory. Many town institutions bear his name.\n\n1737 is a remarkable date in the life of the town as the Forg\u00e1ch repurchased their property from Koh\u00e1ry family. The town began a slow development in the 18th century, a lot of private houses were built and the first pharmacy of the county was opened in 1741. The baroque style Forg\u00e1ch Castle - which is a museum nowadays - was built in that century as well.\n\nThe development of the town slowed down in the 19th century and fell behind other towns in N\u00f3gr\u00e1d, such as Balassagyarmat, Losonc, Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n. Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny lost its town status in 1886 owing to the decision of Parliament. In spite of the situation, a town hall was built in 1905 and the municipality organized a brilliant commemorative R\u00e1k\u00f3czi festival on the 200th anniversary of the 1705 Diet.\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920, following the [[First World War]], Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny became a frontier town, which has hindered its development until the present day. The [[Second World War]] did not keep out of Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny's way either. During the fighting raging in December 1944, the inhabitants suffered greatly.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the war, the reorganization of life started immediately. [[Nationalization]] and [[collectivization]] brought fundamental changes in everyday life.\n\nUntil the end of the 1970s, Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny was an administrative center, being the chief town of the district. When the public administration system was reformed, the function of the seat of the district became extinct. As a result, several institutions and offices were closed down, e.g. the district court, the title registry, the central police station, and the high school. Two other settlements belong to Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny's current administration, though: [[P\u00f6st\u00e9nypuszta]], located beside the [[River Ipoly]], and [[Bencz\u00farfalva]], {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=off}} away.\n\nThe recession in the 1990s also damaged the local economy, but significant improvements in infrastructure were\ncarried out, including sewer and gas networks and connection to the national telephone network.\n\nThe institutions of the town also have changed. A second high school was founded in 1994, along with an ambulance station and nursing home. The agricultural vocational school and the art school, though, were transferred to the county seat.\n\n==Geography & Geology==\nSz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny lies in the northern part of [[N\u00f3gr\u00e1d county]] on the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] border, at the edge of the [[Ipoly valley]].  The town is situated at a height of {{convert|155|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] in a small basin along the [[River Ipoly]] at the intersection of Northern, Northeast, and Eastern [[Cserh\u00e1t hills]]. The major part of the town was built on a plateau extending along the southern edge of the basin. The north-south flow of the river turns into east-west nearby.\n\nIts geographical position is 48\u00b0 5\" N, 19\u00b0 32\" E.\n\nThe Szentl\u00e9lek (\"Holy Spirit\") is a stream running through the town along the edge of the plateau and flowing into the Ipoly. On the confines of the settlement, there is a pond originating from ballast-digging.\n\n==Climatic features==\nSz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny has a continental climate of wetter type. The average number of\nsunny hours is 1,990 a year. The average annual mean is {{convert|9.1|C|F|1}}, on the\nbasis of the yearly average in the last 70 years. The annual rainfall is {{convert|360|to|610|mm|0|abbr=on}} - taking the yearly average of 50 years as a basis. The prevailing winds are westerly and northwestly.\n\n==Geological features==\nThe plough-lands in the Ipoly valley are of good quality, they are suitable\nfor agricultural production. The soil of hills surrounding the valley is of\npoorer quality but the plateau is under crop.\nThe major part of the soil is medium or high acidic. The most frequent type\nis brown alluvial forest soil. Quite a large area is covered by 'kov\u00e1rv\u00e1ny'\nbrown forest soil (sandy brown forest soil with thin interstratified layers\nof colloid and sesquioxide accumulation), chernozem-brown forest soil and\nbrown earth. Meadow and meadow alluvial soils are typical along the Ipoly.\nSporadically, loess and sand can be found. The average gold crown value of\nthe cropland (measurement unit of the quality of arable land in Hungary) is\n24.97 per hectare, which is below the national average.\n*'''Infrastructure'''\nAfter the transformation of regime the town assigned a substantial sum for\nextension the public utility services to 100%. Every property of the settlement has\naccessibility to piped water and sewage network as well as to pipeline gas.\nSz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny is the traffic junction of the neighbouring villages. Vars\u00e1ny,\nN\u00f3gr\u00e1dsipek, Rim\u00f3c can be approached just via our town.\nSz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny lies {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} from the county seat Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n and {{convert|105|km|0|abbr=on}} from\nBudapest. Several bus services are available to Budapest every day but there\nis a railway line too.\nBecause of the investments of the past years, the roads maintained by the\nlocal government got damaged. The municipal corporation is planning to carry\nout a road reconstruction and intends to finance it steadily.\n\nOn the basis of treaty between Hungarian and Slovak Government, in Postenypuszta,\nwhich belongs to Szecseny, the building of a bridge on river Ipoly will begin soon.\nThus, the bordercross traffic, which has not worked since the World War II, will be\nreestabilished.\n\n==Culture==\nThe community centre co-ordinates and organises the cultural life of the\ntown. We have several traditional festivals: Town Day at the end of May or\nat the beginning of June, Autumn Art Exhibition of Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny and Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny\nVintage Festival. The cultural centre sponsors the [[Ferenc Erkel]] mixed-voice\nchoir that has been performing for 30 years. There is a projection in the\nbuilding once a week. The kindergarteners and school children regularly\nwatch different educational and entertaining films there.\nThe town library works within the framework of the cultural centre. Readers\ncan choose from 44 thousand volumes. The number of the registered readers is\nnearly 2,000.\n\n==Education, school system==\nThe local government maintains the following educational institutions:\n- Kindergarten: The teachers do high quality pedagogic work in the three\nbuildings of the nursery school.\n- Ferenc R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II Elementary School: It has one building. Owing to the\nhigh-standard didactic and educational work, pupils won several inter-school\ncompetitions.\n- S\u00e1ndor K\u0131r\u00f6si Csoma Secondary Grammar and Vocational School: The municipal\ncorporation founded it in 1994 as an 8-grade secondary grammar school. The\nvocational education of computer technology began in 1998. Teaching foreign\nlanguages and computer science have -outstanding - importance.\nThe following institutions are maintained by the county self-government:\n- The School of Arts: The music section is fairly successful. The members of\nthe dramatic group regularly perform at the town festivities.\n- B\u00e9la Lipthay Agricultural Secondary Vocational School: This technical\nschool trains agricultural skilled workers. The students come not only from\nN\u00f3gr\u00e1d but also from other counties as well. The school also organises\ncourses for adults and courses adjusted to the trade, too.\nSocial welfare, healthcare, unemployment\nThree general practitioners and two paediatricians work in Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny as\nentrepreneurs. There are four dentists. The dentists also attend the\ninhabitants of 12 villages in the region of Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny. Besides basic\nhealthcare a small laboratory, physical therapy and therapeutic gymnastics\nare available as well. There is a gynaecological consultation too but it\nis a private practice.\nMore and more people appeal to holistic medicine practitioners whose work is\nco-ordinated by one of the paediatricians in the framework of a medical\ncentre.\nThe ambulance station has been working since 1993. Its job is confined to\ntransporting patients. The emergency service is operated by an enterprise\nowned by a doctor.\n*'''Social welfare'''\nThe present data of the unemployment show that approximately 1,000\ninhabitants are entitled to a form of social allocations the major part of\nwhich is financed by the local authority.\n*'''Unemployment'''\nOur figures, which were published by the Employment Centre of N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County,\nrelate to Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny and its region. The number of the registered unemployed:\n1,625, including 896 men and 729 women. Manual workers: 1,429 people, not\nmanual, white-collar workers: 196 people.\nProfessional grouping:\n- Skilled worker: 425\n- Semi-skilled labourer: 507\n- Unskilled worker or handyman: 520\nClassification according to educational level:\n- fewer than 8 elementary grades: 245\n- 8-grade elementary school: 688\n- trade school: 392\n- technical school: 24\n- technical academy: 40\n- vocational technical school: 130\n- secondary grammar school: 86\n- college, university: 20\n*'''Agriculture'''\nAs a consequence of the Act of Co-operative farms 1992, one of the best\nco-operative farms of the country was liquidated in Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny and was\nsucceeded by a number of collective and private farms. They work in the\nagricultural sector and deal with cultivation first of all. The\ntraditionally grown plants are: potato, maize, sunflower and grain crop.\n\nThe collective farms are raising cows at present as well as sheep. Growing\nnumber of private farmers keep horses too. The majority of the landowners\nhave a farm of {{convert|1.5|ha|acres|1|abbr=off}}. This area supplies their household mainly.\nThere are few private or collective farmers who run a farm bigger than 50\nhectares.\n*'''Industry'''\nThe biggest employer of the town is Eurocandle Ltd., the owners of which are\nDanish entrepreneurs. They employ 300 people and export their products. The\nother important industrial company, the Tommy Invest Ltd. gives work to 280\nworkers.\nSeveral building entrepreneurs work in the town. There are two important\nfactories: furniture and packing machines ones. A lot of trading companies\nwork in our town. The most significant of them is Pal\u00f3c-Coop Ltd. The local\ngovernment is revising the tax on practice of a trade, the amount of which\nis 2,0%.\n*'''Religion'''\nThe majority of the inhabitants are Roman Catholic, the minority is\nLutheran. The practice of the Catholic religion is helped by Franciscan\nfriars who live in the local Franciscan monastery, founded in 1339. The\nClarissa nuns (Franciscan Order of Poor Clares) undertake the task of\nnursing of great importance.\n*'''Ethnic minorities'''\nThe Gypsy Minority Self-government has been working in the town since 1994.\nTheir aim is to preserve and protect the Gypsy traditions. The mayor's\noffice supports their work and supplies the material conditions for them.\n*'''Tourism'''\n[[File:Leaning Tower Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny Hungary W-SW.jpg|thumb|100px|right|The Firetower, the leaning tower of the town]]\nThe tourism has not made the most of the potentials of the town yet. The\nlocal authority maintains a Tourinform office, which works together with the\nHandicrfts\u2019 Society in the renovted building of Handicraftsman\u2019s House. All\nvisitors get a free brochure about Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny and its surrounding.\nThe town has developed the buildings of the historic part of the town\nturning the historical values of Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny to account. We used European Union\nresources for fulfilment of this task. The display of the unique historic\nrelics will be advanced when we form closer co-operation with the Franciscan\norder.\n\n*'''Source:'''\nszecseny town's webpage\n{{-}}\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\nSz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Testv\u00e9rtelep\u00fcl\u00e9seink|url=http://szecseny.hu/testvertelepuleseink/|website=szecseny.hu|publisher=Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny|language=hu|accessdate=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|SVK}} [[Fi\u013eakovo]], Slovakia \n*{{flagicon|SVK}} [[Kov\u00e1\u010dovce]], Slovakia \n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Gmina Niepo\u0142omice|Niepo\u0142omice]], Poland\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Gmina Warta|Warta]], Poland\n\n==Picture gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Civertanlegifotoszecseny2.jpg|Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny Center\nFile:Ciertanlegifotoszecseny3.jpg|Forg\u00e1ch-castle\nFile:Civertanlegifotoszecseny1.jpg|Forg\u00e1ch-castle and its Landscape park\nFile:Civertanlegifotoszecseny4.jpg|Fire Tower, early 18th century\nFile:Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny - Palace.jpg|Forg\u00e1ch-castle\nFile:Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny - The Baroque building of the Palace Forg\u00e1ch.jpg|Forg\u00e1ch-castle\nFile:Civertanlegifotoszecseny5.jpg|Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny bastion\nFile:Franciscan Convent Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny.jpg|Franciscan Convent, Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny\nFile:Szecsenycivertanlegi.jpg|Franciscan Convent\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny}}\n* {{Official website|http://szecseny.hu/}} in Hungarian\n* [http://www.terkepcentrum.hu/index.asp?go=map&tid=6628 Street map] {{in lang|hu}}\n* [http://www.civertan.hu/legifoto/legifoto.php?page_level=680 Aerial photographs]\n\n{{Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny District}}\n{{N\u00f3gr\u00e1d}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Szecseny}}\n[[Category:Populated places in N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%C3%A9cs%C3%A9ny"}

Their discoverers, [[Osamu Shimomura]] and colleagues, won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on GFP.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Aequorea3.jpeg|thumb|Ventral view with [[hyperiid]] [[amphipod]]]]\nAlmost entirely transparent and colorless, and sometimes difficult to resolve, ''Aequorea victoria'' possess a highly contractile mouth and manubrium at the center of up to 100 radial canals that extend to the bell margin. The bell margin is surrounded by uneven tentacles, up to 150 of them in fully-grown specimens. The tentacles possess [[nematocyst]]s that aid in prey capture, although they have no effect on humans. Specimens larger than 3&nbsp;cm usually possess gonads for sexual reproduction, which run most of the length of the radial canals and are visible in the photos in this article as whitish thickenings along the radial canals. The bell margin is ringed with the muscular velum, which is typical of hydromedusae, and aids in locomotion through muscular contraction of the bell. Larger specimens are frequently found with symbiotic [[Hyperiidea|hyperiid amphipod]]s attached to the subumbrella, or even occasionally living inside the gut or radial canals.\n\n==Distribution==\n''Aequorea victoria'' are found along the North American west coast of the Pacific Ocean from the Bering Sea to southern California. The medusa part of the life cycle is a pelagic organism, which is budded off a bottom-living polyp in late spring. The medusae can be found floating and swimming both nearshore and offshore in the eastern Pacific Ocean;<ref>Kozloff, Eugene N. Marine Invertebrates of the Pacific Northwest. 2nd. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1996.</ref> this species is particularly common in [[Puget Sound]].\n\nIn September 2009, ''Aequorea victoria'' was spotted in the [[Moray Firth]], an unusual occurrence, as crystal jellies had never been seen or reported in British waters. The specimen was put on display in Macduff Marine Aquarium in [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]].{{cn}}\n\n==Identification==\n''Aequorea'' species can be fairly difficult to tell apart, as the morphological features on which identifications are made are mostly the numbers of tentacles, numbers of radial canals, numbers of marginal statocysts, and size.<!--their size or overall size?--> These features are fairly plastic, and the numbers of tentacles and radial canals increase in all species of ''Aequorea'' with size. One other species is occasionally found in the same geographical range as ''Aequorea victoria''; this other form has been called ''[[Aequorea coerulescens]]''. While ''A. coerulescens'' is apparently generally found offshore in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rare specimens have been collected in central California and in [[Friday Harbor, Washington|Friday Harbor]], North Puget Sound.<ref name=\"faculty.washington.edu\">Mills, C.E. 1999\u2013present. \u201cBioluminescence of Aequorea, a hydromedusa.\u201d Electronic internet document available at http://faculty.washington.edu/cemills/Aequorea.html. Published by C. E. Mills, web page established June 1999, last updated (15 February 2007).</ref> While morphologically similar to ''Aequorea victoria'', the ''Aequorea coerulescens'' form is larger (roughly the size of a dinner plate) with many more radial canals. Animals of sizes intermediate between these two forms are also rather intermediate in appearance, making morphological identifications difficult.\n\nThis species is thought to be synonymous with ''Aequorea aequorea'' of [[Osamu Shimomura]], the discoverer of [[green fluorescent protein|green fluorescent protein (GFP)]]. Shimomura together with Martin Chalfie and Roger Y. Tsien were awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2008/index.html 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry].</ref> for the discovery and development of this protein as an important biological research tool. Originally the ''A. victoria'' name was used to designate the variant found in the Pacific, and the ''A. aequorea'' designation was used for specimens found in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The species name used in GFP purification was later disputed by M.N. Arai and A. Brinckmann-Voss (1980),<ref>Arai, M.N. and A.

The medusa spends its first stage of life growing quickly, and after reaching approximately 3&nbsp;cm will begin producing gametes for reproduction. Each medusa is either a male or a female. The eggs and spermatozoa mature daily in the medusa gonads, given enough food, and are free-spawned into the water column in response to a daily light cue, where they are fertilized and eventually settle out to form a new hydroid colony. The hydroids live on hard or rocky substrates on the bottom, where they asexually bud new tiny jellyfish each springtime in response to some (still unknown) environmental cue(s).

Their discoverers, [[Osamu Shimomura]] and colleagues, won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on GFP.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Aequorea3.jpeg|thumb|Ventral view with [[hyperiid]] [[amphipod]]]]\nAlmost entirely transparent and colorless, and sometimes difficult to resolve, ''Aequorea victoria'' possess a highly contractile mouth and manubrium at the center of up to 100 radial canals that extend to the bell margin. The bell margin is surrounded by uneven tentacles, up to 150 of them in fully-grown specimens. The tentacles possess [[nematocyst]]s that aid in prey capture, although they have no effect on humans. Specimens larger than 3&nbsp;cm usually possess gonads for sexual reproduction, which run most of the length of the radial canals and are visible in the photos in this article as whitish thickenings along the radial canals. The bell margin is ringed with the muscular velum, which is typical of hydromedusae, and aids in locomotion through muscular contraction of the bell. Larger specimens are frequently found with symbiotic [[Hyperiidea|hyperiid amphipod]]s attached to the subumbrella, or even occasionally living inside the gut or radial canals.\n\n==Distribution==\n''Aequorea victoria'' are found along the North American west coast of the Pacific Ocean from the Bering Sea to southern California. The medusa part of the life cycle is a pelagic organism, which is budded off a bottom-living polyp in late spring. The medusae can be found floating and swimming both nearshore and offshore in the eastern Pacific Ocean;<ref>Kozloff, Eugene N. Marine Invertebrates of the Pacific Northwest. 2nd. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1996.</ref> this species is particularly common in [[Puget Sound]].\n\nIn September 2009, ''Aequorea victoria'' was spotted in the [[Moray Firth]], an unusual occurrence, as crystal jellies had never been seen or reported in British waters. The specimen was put on display in Macduff Marine Aquarium in [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]].\n\n==Identification==\n''Aequorea'' species can be fairly difficult to tell apart, as the morphological features on which identifications are made are mostly the numbers of tentacles, numbers of radial canals, numbers of marginal statocysts, and size.<!--their size or overall size?--> These features are fairly plastic, and the numbers of tentacles and radial canals increase in all species of ''Aequorea'' with size. One other species is occasionally found in the same geographical range as ''Aequorea victoria''; this other form has been called ''[[Aequorea coerulescens]]''. While ''A. coerulescens'' is apparently generally found offshore in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rare specimens have been collected in central California and in [[Friday Harbor, Washington|Friday Harbor]], North Puget Sound.<ref name=\"faculty.washington.edu\">Mills, C.E. 1999\u2013present. \u201cBioluminescence of Aequorea, a hydromedusa.\u201d Electronic internet document available at http://faculty.washington.edu/cemills/Aequorea.html. Published by C. E. Mills, web page established June 1999, last updated (15 February 2007).</ref> While morphologically similar to ''Aequorea victoria'', the ''Aequorea coerulescens'' form is larger (roughly the size of a dinner plate) with many more radial canals. Animals of sizes intermediate between these two forms are also rather intermediate in appearance, making morphological identifications difficult.\n\nThis species is thought to be synonymous with ''Aequorea aequorea'' of [[Osamu Shimomura]], the discoverer of [[green fluorescent protein|green fluorescent protein (GFP)]]. Shimomura together with Martin Chalfie and Roger Y. Tsien were awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2008/index.html 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry].</ref> for the discovery and development of this protein as an important biological research tool. Originally the ''A. victoria'' name was used to designate the variant found in the Pacific, and the ''A. aequorea'' designation was used for specimens found in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The species name used in GFP purification was later disputed by M.N. Arai and A. Brinckmann-Voss (1980),<ref>Arai, M.N. and A.

One of the RFC aircraft was the first British aircraft to be shot down by the Germans, on 22 August 1914. The pilot was [[Second Lieutenant|2nd Lt.]] Vincent Waterfall and his navigator [[Lieutenant|Lt]] Charles George Gordon Bayly (both of [[No. 5 Squadron RFC|5 Sqn RFC]])<ref>\"[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/478797 Casualty Details:Vincent Waterfall]\". ''Commonwealth War Graves Commission''. Retrieved 10 January 2010.</ref><ref name=\"Jackson Avro p56\">Jackson 1990, p.56.</ref> The RNAS used four 504s to form a special flight in order to bomb the [[Zeppelin]] works at [[Friedrichshafen]] on the shores of [[Lake Constance]]. Three set out from [[Belfort]] in north-eastern France on 21 November 1914, carrying four 20&nbsp;lb (9&nbsp;kg) bombs each. While one aircraft was shot down, the raid was successful, with several direct hits on the airship sheds and the destruction of the hydrogen generating plant.<ref name=\"Mason Bomber p21\">Mason 1994, p.21.</ref>\n\nSoon obsolete as a frontline aircraft, it came into its own as a trainer, with thousands being built during the war, with the major production types being the 504J and the mass production 504K, designed with modified engine bearers to accommodate a range of engines in order to cope with engine shortages. 8,340 Avro 504s had been produced by the end of 1918.<ref name=\"Bruce ptII p87\">Bruce 16 July 1954, p.87.</ref>\n\n[[File:Foster Mount Avro504.jpg|thumb|right|[[Foster mounting|Foster-mounted]] [[Lewis gun]] on [[night fighter]] Avro 504K]]\n\nIn the winter of 1917\u201318 it was decided to use converted 504Js and 504Ks to equip Home Defence squadrons of the RFC, replacing ageing [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2c]]s, which had poor altitude performance. These aircraft were modified as single-seaters, armed with a Lewis gun above the wing on a [[Foster mounting]], and powered by 100&nbsp;hp (75&nbsp;kW) Gnome or 110&nbsp;hp (80&nbsp;kW) Le Rh\u00f4ne engines. 274 converted Avro 504Js and Ks were issued to eight home defence squadrons in 1918, with 226 still being used as fighters at the end of the First World War.<ref name=\"Mason Fighter\">Mason 1992, p.127.</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of the war, while the type continued in service as the standard trainer of the [[RAF]], large numbers of surplus aircraft were available for sale, both for civil and military use. More than 300 504Ks were placed on the civil register in Britain. Used for training, pleasure flying, banner towing and even [[barnstorming]] exhibitions (as was ongoing in North America following World War I with the similar-role, surplus [[Curtiss JN-4]]s and [[Standard J]]-1s); civil 504s continued flying in large numbers until well into the 1930s.\n\nThe embryonic [[Soviet Air Forces|air service of the Soviet Union]], formed just after the First World War, used both original Avro 504s and their own ''Avrushka'' (\" Little Avro\") copy of it for primary training as the '''U-1''' in the early 1920s, usually powered by Russian-made copies of the [[Gnome Monosoupape]] rotary engine.  This Russian version of the 504 was replaced by what would become the most produced biplane in all of aviation history, the [[Polikarpov Po-2]], first known as the '''U-2''' in Soviet service in the late 1920s.\n\nAlthough Avro 504s sold to China were training versions, they participated in battles among [[Warlord era|warlords]] by acting as bombers with the pilot dropping hand grenades and modified mortar shells {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.\n\nThe improved, redesigned and radial-engined 504N with a new undercarriage was produced by Avro in 1925. After evaluation of two prototypes, one powered by the [[Bristol Lucifer]] and the other by the [[Armstrong-Siddeley Lynx]], the Lynx-powered aircraft was selected by the RAF to replace the 504K. 592 were built between 1925 and 1932, equipping the RAF's five flying training schools, while also being used as communication aircraft. The 504N was also exported to the armed forces of [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], [[Thailand|Siam]] and [[South Africa]], with licensed production taking place in Denmark, Belgium, [[Canada]], Siam and [[Japan]].\n\nThe RAF's 504Ns were finally replaced in 1933 by the [[Avro Tutor]], with small numbers continuing in civilian use until 1940, when seven were impressed into RAF service, where they were used for target- and glider-towing.\n\nThe 504 was the first British aeroplane to strafe troops on the ground<ref name =\"Bruce pt I p43\">Bruce 9 July 1954, p.43.</ref> as well as the first British aircraft to make a bombing raid over Germany.<ref name=\"Holmes\"/> It was also the first Allied aeroplane to be downed by enemy [[anti-aircraft]] fire and was the first aircraft flown by many future aces, including [[Billy Bishop]].\n\nThe 504 is easily recognisable because of the single skid between the wheels, referred to as the \"tooth pick\" in the RAF.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Qantas Replica Mascot Airport.JPG|thumb|right|[[Qantas]] Avro 504K replica with Sunbeam engine displayed at [[Sydney Airport|Qantas Domestic Terminal]]]]\n\n*'''504''': {{convert|80|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Gnome Lambda]] engine.\n:Original model\n*'''504A''':\n:Modified with smaller ailerons and broader struts. 80&nbsp;hp (60&nbsp;kW) Gnome engine.\n*'''504B'''\n:Version for RNAS with larger fin. {{convert|80|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Gnome or Le Rh\u00f4ne engine.\n*'''504C'''\n:Single-seat anti-[[zeppelin]] aircraft for the [[RNAS]].

It was a [[interplane struts#Bays|two-bay]] all-wooden biplane with a square-section [[fuselage]].\n[[File:Avro 504 by ndrwfgg.jpeg|thumb|right|The Shuttleworth Avro 504K]]\n\n== Operational history ==\n\nSmall numbers of early aircraft were purchased by the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) and the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) prior to the start of the First World War, and were taken to France when the war started. One of the RFC aircraft was the first British aircraft to be shot down by the Germans, on 22 August 1914. The pilot was [[Second Lieutenant|2nd Lt.]] Vincent Waterfall and his navigator [[Lieutenant|Lt]] Charles George Gordon Bayly (both of [[No. 5 Squadron RFC|5 Sqn RFC]])<ref>\"[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/478797 Casualty Details:Vincent Waterfall]\". ''Commonwealth War Graves Commission''. Retrieved 10 January 2010.</ref><ref name=\"Jackson Avro p56\">Jackson 1990, p.56.</ref> The RNAS used four 504s to form a special flight in order to bomb the [[Zeppelin]] works at [[Friedrichshafen]] on the shores of [[Lake Constance]]. Three set out from [[Belfort]] in north-eastern France on 21 November 1914, carrying four 20&nbsp;lb (9&nbsp;kg) bombs each. While one aircraft was shot down, the raid was successful, with several direct hits on the airship sheds and the destruction of the hydrogen generating plant.<ref name=\"Mason Bomber p21\">Mason 1994, p.21.</ref>\n\nSoon obsolete as a frontline aircraft, it came into its own as a trainer, with thousands being built during the war, with the major production types being the 504J and the mass production 504K, designed with modified engine bearers to accommodate a range of engines in order to cope with engine shortages. 8,340 Avro 504s had been produced by the end of 1918.<ref name=\"Bruce ptII p87\">Bruce 16 July 1954, p.87.</ref>\n\n[[File:Foster Mount Avro504.jpg|thumb|right|[[Foster mounting|Foster-mounted]] [[Lewis gun]] on [[night fighter]] Avro 504K]]\n\nIn the winter of 1917\u201318 it was decided to use converted 504Js and 504Ks to equip Home Defence squadrons of the RFC, replacing ageing [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2c]]s, which had poor altitude performance. These aircraft were modified as single-seaters, armed with a Lewis gun above the wing on a [[Foster mounting]], and powered by 100&nbsp;hp (75&nbsp;kW) Gnome or 110&nbsp;hp (80&nbsp;kW) Le Rh\u00f4ne engines. 274 converted Avro 504Js and Ks were issued to eight home defence squadrons in 1918, with 226 still being used as fighters at the end of the First World War.<ref name=\"Mason Fighter\">Mason 1992, p.127.</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of the war, while the type continued in service as the standard trainer of the [[RAF]], large numbers of surplus aircraft were available for sale, both for civil and military use. More than 300 504Ks were placed on the civil register in Britain. Used for training, pleasure flying, banner towing and even [[barnstorming]] exhibitions (as was ongoing in North America following World War I with the similar-role, surplus [[Curtiss JN-4]]s and [[Standard J]]-1s); civil 504s continued flying in large numbers until well into the 1930s.\n\nThe embryonic [[Soviet Air Forces|air service of the Soviet Union]], formed just after the First World War, used both original Avro 504s and their own ''Avrushka'' (\" Little Avro\") copy of it for primary training as the '''U-1''' in the early 1920s, usually powered by Russian-made copies of the [[Gnome Monosoupape]] rotary engine.  This Russian version of the 504 was replaced by what would become the most produced biplane in all of aviation history, the [[Polikarpov Po-2]], first known as the '''U-2''' in Soviet service in the late 1920s.\n\nAlthough Avro 504s sold to China were training versions, they participated in battles among [[Warlord era|warlords]] by acting as bombers with the pilot dropping hand grenades and modified mortar shells {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.\n\nThe improved, redesigned and radial-engined 504N with a new undercarriage was produced by Avro in 1925. After evaluation of two prototypes, one powered by the [[Bristol Lucifer]] and the other by the [[Armstrong-Siddeley Lynx]], the Lynx-powered aircraft was selected by the RAF to replace the 504K. 592 were built between 1925 and 1932, equipping the RAF's five flying training schools, while also being used as communication aircraft. The 504N was also exported to the armed forces of [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], [[Thailand|Siam]] and [[South Africa]], with licensed production taking place in Denmark, Belgium, [[Canada]], Siam and [[Japan]].\n\nThe RAF's 504Ns were finally replaced in 1933 by the [[Avro Tutor]], with small numbers continuing in civilian use until 1940, when seven were impressed into RAF service, where they were used for target- and glider-towing.\n\nThe 504 was the first British aeroplane to strafe troops on the ground<ref name =\"Bruce pt I p43\">Bruce 9 July 1954, p.43.</ref> as well as the first British aircraft to make a bombing raid over Germany.<ref name=\"Holmes\"/> It was also the first Allied aeroplane to be downed by enemy [[anti-aircraft]] fire and was the first aircraft flown by many future aces, including [[Billy Bishop]].\n\nThe 504 is easily recognisable because of the single skid between the wheels, referred to as the \"tooth pick\" in the RAF.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Qantas Replica Mascot Airport.JPG|thumb|right|[[Qantas]] Avro 504K replica with Sunbeam engine displayed at [[Sydney Airport|Qantas Domestic Terminal]]]]\n\n*'''504''': {{convert|80|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Gnome Lambda]] engine.\n:Original model\n*'''504A''':\n:Modified with smaller ailerons and broader struts. 80&nbsp;hp (60&nbsp;kW) Gnome engine.\n*'''504B'''\n:Version for RNAS with larger fin. {{convert|80|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Gnome or Le Rh\u00f4ne engine.\n*'''504C'''\n:Single-seat anti-[[zeppelin]] aircraft for the [[RNAS]].
