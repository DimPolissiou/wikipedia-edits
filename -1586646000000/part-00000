In the period from 2003 to 2011 it resumed its upward trajectory, despite declining foreign assistance, averaging over 5% a year. It is noteworthy that growth continued during the financial crisis of 2009, and returned to 5% in 2011 [[Inflation]] was low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has a negative balance of trade; in 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP, and was 39% of GDP in 2011. Remittances from the Kosovo diaspora accounted for an estimated 14 percent of GDP, little changed over the previous decade.<ref name=\"IMF Country Report No 12/100\"> '' IMF Country Report No 12/100 '' http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12100.pdf \"Unemployment, around 40% of the population, is a significant problem that encourages outward migration and black market activity.\"</ref><ref>{{cite web| publisher= IMF| url= http://imf.org| title=IMF Country Report No 12/100| date= 2011| accessdate= 1 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf |title=Page not found |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=8 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201034658/http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nMost economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and construction sectors. The private sector which has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak. The economy, and its sources of growth, are therefore geared far more to demand than production, as shown by the current account, which was in 2011 in deficit by about 20% of GDP. Consequently, Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the diaspora (the majority of these from Germany and Switzerland), [[foreign direct investment]] (of which a high proportion also comes from the diaspora, and other capital inflows).<ref name=\"IMF Country Report No 12/100\"/> Government revenue is also dependent on demand rather than production; only 14% of revenue comes from direct taxes and the rest mainly from customs duties and taxes on consumption.\n\nHowever, Kosovo has very low levels of general government debt (only 5.8% of GDP)<ref name=\"IMF Country Report No 12/100\"/> and government liquid assets resulting from past fiscal surpluses (deposited in the Central Bank and invested abroad). Under applicable Kosovo law, there are also substantial assets from privatisation of socially-owned enterprises, also invested abroad by the Central Bank, which should mostly accrue to the Government when liquidation processes have been completed.<ref name=\"IMF Country Report No 12/100\"/> The net foreign assets of the financial corporations and the Pension Fund amount to well over 50% of GDP.\n\nMoreover, the [[Banking Network System of Kosovo|banking system]] in Kosovo seems very sound. For the banking system as a whole, the Tier One Capital Ratio as of January 2012 was 17.5%, double the ratio required in the EU; the proportion of non-performing loans was 5.9%, well below the regional average; and the credit to deposit ratio was only just above 80%. The assets of the banking system have increased from 5% of GDP in 2000 to 60% of GDP as of January 2012.<ref name=\"IMF Country Report No 12/100\"/> Since the housing stock in Kosovo is generally good by South-East European standards, this suggests that (if the legal system's ability to enforce claims on collateral and resolve property issues is trusted), credit to Kosovars could be safely expanded.\n\nThe [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] introduced an external trade office and customs administration on September 3, 1999, when it established border controls in Kosovo.

Examples include flight diversions because of a Serbian ban on flights to Kosovo over its territory; loss of revenues because of a lack of a regional dialling code (end-user fees on fixed lines accrue to Serbian Telecoms, while Kosovo has to pay Monaco and Slovenia for use of their regional codes for mobile phone connections); no IBAN code for bank transfers; and no regional Kosovo code for the internet. A major deterrent to foreign manufacturing investment in Kosovo was removed in 2011 when the European Council accepted a Convention allowing Kosovo to be accepted as part of its rules for diagonal cumulative origination, allowing the label of Kosovo origination to goods which have been processed there but originated in a country elsewhere in the Convention.\n\nSince 2002 the [[European Commission]] has compiled a yearly progress report on Kosovo, evaluating its political and economic situation. For 2008 the European Commission reported a GDP growth of 5.4% \u2013 essentially due to public investment (194% growth, compared to a 10.2% decline in private investment) \u2013 but the report also noted that the unsatisfactory state of the statistical system does not allow for a comprehensive assessment of the situation.\n\nKosovo became a member of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on 29 June 2009.\n\n==Foreign direct investment==\n{{main|Foreign direct investments in Kosovo}}\n\nLeading Countries in Foreign Direct Investment (2007 to 2011) \nGermany: \u20ac292 million;\tUnited Kingdom: \u20ac251 million; Slovenia: \u20ac195 million; Austria: \u20ac133 million: Switzerland: \u20ac115 million; the Netherlands: \u20ac109 million, Albania: \u20ac70 million, Turkey: \u20ac64 million, the United States: \u20ac31 million, and France: \u20ac5 million.\n\nForeign direct investment in Kosovo is still a relatively small contribution to the Kosovo economy, compared with other transition economies. Much of the reason is, apart from a late start in 2000-2001, because of legal and political uncertainties, and an incomplete, contested, and very slow system of privatisation before the declaration of independence in 2008. Thus Kosovo still retains a state-owned telecommunications company, a state-owned electricity monopoly (with the largest lignite reserves in Europe), and a ski-resort in Brezovica (a Serb-majority area) which was the Winter Olympics reserve site during the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. All of these are now under the process of privatisation. Other infrastructure companies (water, railways) may also be privatised.\n\nWhile there remain significant disincentives to investment in Kosovo (a small domestic market, residual political uncertainty, perceptions of corruption, and a slow and uncertain judiciial system), there are also incentives. These include a much younger workforce than elsewhere in south-eastern Europe, which has been more exposed to Western European culture and has higher linguistic standards (see next paragraph); a low corporate tax-rate; access to the [[European Union]] and [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]] markets; and a government with low debt and low contingent liabilities in terms of pension and other social welfare transfers. [[Information and communications technology in Kosovo]] has also developed very rapidly and broadband internet penetration is comparable to the European Union average.\n\n== Labor law ==\n\n;Maternal and Paternal Leave\n\nA lack of female employment opportunities in Kosovo perpetuates a traditional society in which many women remain in the home.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Kosovo Conflict and International Law: An Analytical Documentation|last=Krieger|first=Heike|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>&nbsp;Provisions for maternity leave were approved by the [[Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo|Assembly of Kosovo]] in 2011, where maximum time allotted for [[maternity leave]] was set at one year.

In 2009 demand was met by lignite generation (4,656 GWh), imports (611 GWh) and hydro (121 GWh).\n\nIn Yugoslav times, Kosovo was a net exporter of electricity. But its current generating capacity has been affected by many factors. The generation units were designed for a life of 30 years but have all operated for longer than 28 years, and in some cases for 50 years. They were part of a much wider integrated energy system in which they could be shut down for maintenance without local economic consequences. Maintenance was reduced in the period from 1989 to 1999; and expert (Albanian) workers were sacked in 1990 and expert (Serb) workers left in 1999.\n\nDistribution has also suffered. The Northern (Serb-majority) municipalities have received electricity without any ability by Kosovo Energy Corporation to receive payment, as has also been the case for much of the 1999-2007 period in southern Serb-majority areas. (Many Albanians also avoided their payments during this period). Transmission of electricity through Kosovo from Serbia to Macedonia has not created any income for Kosovo because of the status dispute.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Natural resources==\n{{main|Natural resources of Kosovo}}\nKosovo is rich in [[natural resources]], and has been an important mining centre for much of its history. In Kosovo there is substantially high reserves of [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[silver]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[iron]] and [[bauxite]].<ref name=\"Natural resources key to the future\">{{cite web|title=Kosovo: Natural resources key to the future, say experts|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Business/?id=1.0.1683003038|work=adnkronos.com|accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref>  There is also believed to be around 14 billion tonnes of [[lignite]].

It contributes 97% of the total electricity generation, with just 3% being based on hydropower. At 14,700 megatons, Kosovo possesses the world's fifth-largest proven reserves of lignite.<ref>http://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/action/switchLanguage.do?activePagePath=/al/mining/minerals.html&language=en {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316020348/http://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/action/switchLanguage.do?activePagePath=%2Fal%2Fmining%2Fminerals.html&language=en |date=2013-03-16 }}</ref> The lignite is distributed across the Kosovo, Dukagjin and Drenica Basins, although mining has so far been restricted to the Kosovo Basin. The first systematic records of lignite exploitation date from 1922, when small-scale, shallow underground room-and-pillar mining commenced in the Kosovo Basin. Large-scale winning of lignite began with the first production from the Mira\u0161 (1958) and Bardh (1969) open-pit mines, using bucketwheel excavators.\nCumulative exploitation from the commencement of mining in 1922 up to the end of 2004 has amounted to 265 megatons. Geologically, Kosovo's lignite mines exploit one of the most favorable lignite deposits in Europe. The average stripping ratio is 1.7m3 of waste to one tonne of coal and the total estimated economically exploitable resource represents one of the richest in Europe, which would allow ambitious power generation and expansion schemes in forthcoming decades.\n\nThe lignite is of high quality for the generation of electricity and compares well with the lignite resources of neighbouring countries on a range of parameters. Kosovo's lignite varies in net calorific value from 6.28-9.21 MJ/kg, averaging 7.8 MJ/kg. The deposits (Pliocene in age) can be up to 100 m thick, but average 40 m, and possess an average strip ratio of 1.7:1. This combination has meant that the cost of lignite-fuelled electricity in Kosovo is the lowest in the region. Kosovo's cost of \u20ac0.62/GJ compares favourably with \u20ac0.88/GJ in Bulgaria and \u20ac1.34/GJ in Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nFurther development of lignite mining in the medium term will continue with the exploitation of the Sibovc mining field in the northern part of the Kosovo Basin, and provides a great opportunity for private investors.\n\n;Lead [[zinc]]-[[silver]]\nIn what today is Kosovo, base-metal mining has been a mainstay of the economy, since pre-Roman times. Illyrians, Romans, Byzantines, Saxons, Turks, French and Britons have all conducted extensive mining in the region. These activities have been based on a series of nine mines, of which five comprise today's Trepca Complex. Modern mining began in the 1930s, when the British company Selection Trust Ltd revamped the Trepca Complex, including the development of a battery factory that utilised the lead. Active mining of the five mines ceased during the NATO bombing campaign. The locations of the Trepca mines define the Trepca Mineral Belt. There are three NNW-SSE trending zones of mineralisation within this belt that hosts the ore deposits.\n\nZone I includes the Novo Brdo mine and follows the boundary between the Vardar Zone and the Kosovo sector of the Serbo-Macedonian Massif, which is characterised by extensive Neogene calc-alkaline volcanics and intrusives. Zone II includes the Belo Brdo, Stan Terg and Hajvalia mines. This zone follows the major fault that marks the eastern margin of the Miocene Pristina basin, and its extension to the NNW and the intrusive and volcanic complexes in northern Kosovo. Zone III includes the Crnac mine, and hosts a number of lead-zinc occurrences along the western border of the Vardar Zone, where it is in contact with the Dinaride Drina-Ivanjica (Drenica) structural block.\n\nCurrent estimates for combined mineable reserves for the five mines have been undertaken, but all of the deposits are open at depth and their strike lengths are uncertain, owing to a lack of systematic exploration and definition drilling. During the lead-zinc-silver exploitation at Farbani Potok (Artana-Novo Brdo), about 3 megatons of high-grade halloysite was discovered. This is only one of five known exploitable deposits of this very high-value (US$140\u2013450/t) clay, the other four being in New Zealand, Turkey, China and Utah, US. Current world production is estimated at 150,000 tons per year.\n\n;[[Nickel]]\nFormer open-pit mining operations based on laterite were undertaken at \u00c7ikatova (Dushkaja and Suke) and Gllavica. Remaining mineable reserves have been calculated as 13.2 megatons averaging 1.42% nickel and 0.05% cobalt. Production stopped in 1999 and has resumed. The buyer of Ferronikeli, IMR/Alferon, paid 33 million euro ($38.76 million) for the plant. The company had to invest at least 20 million euro in the first three years and to employ 1,000 at the end of the first year. Ferronikeli ore mining and metallurgical complex was set up in 1984 to produce ferro-nickel for exports. It produced and exported 6,800 tonnes a year of nickel, in ferro-nickel ingots, before the 1990s but since 1998 it has been idle. Ferronikeli has three open pit mines: the Dushkaja mine with estimated reserves of 6.2 million tonnes; the Suka mine - 0.8 million tonnes and the Gllavica with 6.8 million tonnes. Ferronikeli now is one of the main exporters of Kosovo.\n\n;[[Chromium]]\nA chain of Alpine-type chromite pods in southwestern Kosovo are part of a series of linear deposits that continue into Albania. These pods are small but of high grade and in Albania are known to possess enhanced levels of platinum group metals (PGM).\n\n;Chromit ore\nFrom the end of World War Two until 1956, the ores were worked, primarily from the Gjakova mine by Deva holding company, and direct-shipping ore was sent to Albania for treatment. When the high-grade ore was depleted, Kosovo began importing 30,000- 50,000 t/y of chromite ore from Albania. This ceased when the plant was closed in 1991. No meaningful exploration for chrome has been undertaken for several decades.\n\n;[[Bauxite]]\nKosovo's bauxite deposits are hosted in karst limestone and have been exploited in a series of pits that comprise the Grebnik mine. The host limestone was worked as a construction material and a sizeable stockpile of broken limestone remains on site. Mining began in 1966 and ceased in 1990, owing to the deteriorating political climate in Kosovo. Total production was 2.85 Mt.\nThe traditional markets for bauxite from Grebnik were Romania, Germany and Russia. The mine had a fines mixing and bagging facility to produce wall plaster; production was 5,000 t/y, for the domestic market, and Montenegro and Macedonia.\n\n;[[Magnesite]]\nKosovo possesses two magnesite (MgCO3) mines at Golesh and Strezovc. Both were originally worked as quarries and both moved to underground operations prior to their closure in 1999. Before 1990, the Golesh operation produced 110,000 t of magnesite, 22,000 t of sintered magnesia and 10,000 t of caustic calcined magnesia per annum. Golesh mine is accessed via a shaft, whereas Strezovc is accessed via a horizontal adit in the hillside. Both mines have recently been put up for privatisation.

Currently the wine industry is successful and growing after the war in the 1990s. The main heartland of Kosovo's wine industry is in [[Orahovac]] where millions of litres of wine is produced. The main wines produced in Kosovo include [[pinot noir]], [[merlot]] and [[chardonnay]]. Kosovo has recently been exporting wines to [[Germany]] and the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Kosovo's wines flowing again\">{{cite news|title=Kosovo's wines flowing again|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15401459|accessdate=29 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 October 2011}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Trade==\nKosovo is a small open economy and mainly imports more goods and services than it exports. It is committed to trade liberalization. Participation in regional and wider trade facilitating mechanisms has been one of the main policy objectives of Kosovo institutions. Enhancing trade in Kosovo through liberalized trade requires three aspects to be in place, import rationalization and replacement, trade facilitation and export promotion. This is the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] integrated export strategy which gives equal importance to competitiveness in the domestic market and competitiveness in the foreign market.<ref>[http://mti-ks.org/repository/docs/Trade_Policy_of_Kosovo_2009.pdf Trade Policy of Kosovo, 2009.]</ref>\n\nKosovo's largest export market is [[Italy]] (averaging an amount of \u20ac84 million), followed by Albania (\u20ac34 million), the Republic of Macedonia (\u20ac31 million) and Germany (\u20ac24 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esk.rks-gov.net/tregtia-e-jashtme/tabelat|title=ESK Statistics Table 7|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> Imports are mostly from European Union and Central European Free Trade Agreement countries.

One of the worst problem faced by Kosovo is the negative trade balance, this is made worse by the high level of informal economic activity and an uncontrolled [[black market]], led by illegal groups in northern Kosovo. Exports are dominated mainly by raw materials. Kosovo's liberal trade regime is characterized by simplicity and neutrality, key features considered to be important for stimulating private sector led growth as well as creating the conditions for healthy exports. But as trade liberalization has not been accompanied by an improvement in the competitiveness of the emerging domestic production sectors, Kosovo is facing a huge trade deficit.<ref>[http://www.lmps.gofor.de/riinvest2003aTRADE%20POLICIES%20AND%20EXPORT%20PROMOTION%20IN.pdf Trade Policies and Export Promotion in Kosovo (RIINVEST Research)]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2009, Kosovo joined the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]], and Kosovo began servicing its share of the former Yugoslavia's debt.

In the period from 2003 to 2011 it resumed its upward trajectory, despite declining foreign assistance, averaging over 5% a year. It is noteworthy that growth continued during the financial crisis of 2009, and returned to 5% in 2011 [[Inflation]] was low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has a negative balance of trade; in 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP, and was 39% of GDP in 2011.

The private sector which has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak. The economy, and its sources of growth, are therefore geared far more to demand than production, as shown by the current account, which was in 2011 in deficit by about 20% of GDP. Consequently, Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the diaspora (the majority of these from Germany and Switzerland), [[foreign direct investment]] (of which a high proportion also comes from the diaspora, and other capital inflows).<ref name=\"IMF Country Report No 12/100\"/> Government revenue is also dependent on demand rather than production; only 14% of revenue comes from direct taxes and the rest mainly from customs duties and taxes on consumption.\n\nHowever, Kosovo has very low levels of general government debt (only 5.8% of GDP)<ref name=\"IMF Country Report No 12/100\"/> and government liquid assets resulting from past fiscal surpluses (deposited in the Central Bank and invested abroad). Under applicable Kosovo law, there are also substantial assets from privatisation of socially-owned enterprises, also invested abroad by the Central Bank, which should mostly accrue to the Government when liquidation processes have been completed.<ref name=\"IMF Country Report No 12/100\"/> The net foreign assets of the financial corporations and the Pension Fund amount to well over 50% of GDP.\n\nMoreover, the [[Banking Network System of Kosovo|banking system]] in Kosovo seems very sound. For the banking system as a whole, the Tier One Capital Ratio as of January 2012 was 17.5%, double the ratio required in the EU; the proportion of non-performing loans was 5.9%, well below the regional average; and the credit to deposit ratio was only just above 80%. The assets of the banking system have increased from 5% of GDP in 2000 to 60% of GDP as of January 2012.<ref name=\"IMF Country Report No 12/100\"/> Since the housing stock in Kosovo is generally good by South-East European standards, this suggests that (if the legal system's ability to enforce claims on collateral and resolve property issues is trusted), credit to Kosovars could be safely expanded.\n\nThe [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] introduced an external trade office and customs administration on September 3, 1999, when it established border controls in Kosovo.

Examples include flight diversions because of a Serbian ban on flights to Kosovo over its territory; loss of revenues because of a lack of a regional dialling code (end-user fees on fixed lines accrue to Serbian Telecoms, while Kosovo has to pay Monaco and Slovenia for use of their regional codes for mobile phone connections); no IBAN code for bank transfers; and no regional Kosovo code for the internet. A major deterrent to foreign manufacturing investment in Kosovo was removed in 2011 when the European Council accepted a Convention allowing Kosovo to be accepted as part of its rules for diagonal cumulative origination, allowing the label of Kosovo origination to goods which have been processed there but originated in a country elsewhere in the Convention.\n\nSince 2002 the [[European Commission]] has compiled a yearly progress report on Kosovo, evaluating its political and economic situation. For 2008 the European Commission reported a GDP growth of 5.4% \u2013 essentially due to public investment (194% growth, compared to a 10.2% decline in private investment) \u2013 but the report also noted that the unsatisfactory state of the statistical system does not allow for a comprehensive assessment of the situation.\n\nKosovo became a member of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on 29 June 2009.\n\n==Foreign direct investment==\n{{main|Foreign direct investments in Kosovo}}\n\nLeading Countries in Foreign Direct Investment (2007 to 2011) \nGermany: \u20ac292 million;\tUnited Kingdom: \u20ac251 million; Slovenia: \u20ac195 million; Austria: \u20ac133 million: Switzerland: \u20ac115 million; the Netherlands: \u20ac109 million, Albania: \u20ac70 million, Turkey: \u20ac64 million, the United States: \u20ac31 million, and France: \u20ac5 million.\n\nForeign direct investment in Kosovo is still a relatively small contribution to the Kosovo economy, compared with other transition economies. Much of the reason is, apart from a late start in 2000-2001, because of legal and political uncertainties, and an incomplete, contested, and very slow system of privatisation before the declaration of independence in 2008. Thus Kosovo still retains a state-owned telecommunications company, a state-owned electricity monopoly (with the largest lignite reserves in Europe), and a ski-resort in Brezovica (a Serb-majority area) which was the Winter Olympics reserve site during the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. All of these are now under the process of privatisation. Other infrastructure companies (water, railways) may also be privatised.\n\nWhile there remain significant disincentives to investment in Kosovo (a small domestic market, residual political uncertainty, perceptions of corruption, and a slow and uncertain judicicial system), there are also incentives. These include a much younger workforce than elsewhere in south-eastern Europe, which has been more exposed to Western European culture and has higher linguistic standards (see next paragraph); a low corporate tax-rate; access to the [[European Union]] and [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]] markets; and a government with low debt and low contingent liabilities in terms of pension and other social welfare transfers. [[Information and communications technology in Kosovo]] has also developed very rapidly and broadband internet penetration is comparable to the European Union average.\n\n== Labor law ==\n\n;Maternal and Paternal Leave\n\nA lack of female employment opportunities in Kosovo perpetuates a traditional society in which many women remain in the home.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Kosovo Conflict and International Law: An Analytical Documentation|last=Krieger|first=Heike|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>&nbsp;Provisions for maternity leave were approved by the [[Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo|Assembly of Kosovo]] in 2011, where maximum time allotted for [[maternity leave]] was set at one year.

In 2009 demand was met by lignite generation (4,656 GWh), imports (611 GWh) and hydro (121 GWh).\n\nIn Yugoslav times, Kosovo was a net exporter of electricity. But its current generating capacity has been affected by many factors. The generation units were designed for a life of 30 years but have all operated for longer than 28 years, and in some cases for 50 years. They were part of a much wider integrated energy system in which they could be shut down for maintenance without local economic consequences. Maintenance was reduced in the period from 1989 to 1999; and expert (Albanian) workers were sacked in 1990 and expert (Serb) workers left in 1999.\n\nDistribution has also suffered. The Northern (Serb-majority) municipalities have received electricity without any ability by Kosovo Energy Corporation to receive payment, as has also been the case for much of the 1999-2007 period in southern Serb-majority areas. (Many Albanians also avoided their payments during this period). Transmission of electricity through Kosovo from Serbia to Macedonia has not created any income for Kosovo because of the status dispute.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Natural resources==\n{{main|Natural resources of Kosovo}}\nKosovo is rich in [[natural resources]], and has been an important mining centre for much of its history. In Kosovo there is substantially high reserves of [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[silver]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[iron]] and [[bauxite]].<ref name=\"Natural resources key to the future\">{{cite web|title=Kosovo: Natural resources key to the future, say experts|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Business/?id=1.0.1683003038|work=adnkronos.com|accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref>  There is also believed to be around 14 billion tonnes of [[lignite]].

It contributes 97% of the total electricity generation, with just 3% being based on hydropower. At 14,700 megatons, Kosovo possesses the world's fifth-largest proven reserves of lignite.<ref>http://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/action/switchLanguage.do?activePagePath=/al/mining/minerals.html&language=en {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316020348/http://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/action/switchLanguage.do?activePagePath=%2Fal%2Fmining%2Fminerals.html&language=en |date=2013-03-16 }}</ref> The lignite is distributed across the Kosovo, Dukagjin and Drenica Basins, although mining has so far been restricted to the Kosovo Basin. The first systematic records of lignite exploitation date from 1922, when small-scale, shallow underground room-and-pillar mining commenced in the Kosovo Basin. Large-scale winning of lignite began with the first production from the Mira\u0161 (1958) and Bardh (1969) open-pit mines, using bucketwheel excavators.\nCumulative exploitation from the commencement of mining in 1922 up to the end of 2004 has amounted to 265 megatons. Geologically, Kosovo's lignite mines exploit one of the most favorable lignite deposits in Europe. The average stripping ratio is 1.7m3 of waste to one tonne of coal and the total estimated economically exploitable resource represents one of the richest in Europe, which would allow ambitious power generation and expansion schemes in forthcoming decades.\n\nThe lignite is of high quality for the generation of electricity and compares well with the lignite resources of neighbouring countries on a range of parameters. Kosovo's lignite varies in net calorific value from 6.28-9.21 MJ/kg, averaging 7.8 MJ/kg. The deposits (Pliocene in age) can be up to 100 m thick, but average 40 m, and possess an average strip ratio of 1.7:1. This combination has meant that the cost of lignite-fuelled electricity in Kosovo is the lowest in the region. Kosovo's cost of \u20ac0.62/GJ compares favourably with \u20ac0.88/GJ in Bulgaria and \u20ac1.34/GJ in Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nFurther development of lignite mining in the medium term will continue with the exploitation of the Sibovc mining field in the northern part of the Kosovo Basin, and provides a great opportunity for private investors.\n\n;Lead [[zinc]]-[[silver]]\nIn what today is Kosovo, base-metal mining has been a mainstay of the economy, since pre-Roman times. Illyrians, Romans, Byzantines, Saxons, Turks, French and Britons have all conducted extensive mining in the region. These activities have been based on a series of nine mines, of which five comprise today's Trepca Complex. Modern mining began in the 1930s, when the British company Selection Trust Ltd revamped the Trepca Complex, including the development of a battery factory that utilised the lead. Active mining of the five mines ceased during the NATO bombing campaign. The locations of the Trepca mines define the Trepca Mineral Belt. There are three NNW-SSE trending zones of mineralisation within this belt that hosts the ore deposits.\n\nZone I includes the Novo Brdo mine and follows the boundary between the Vardar Zone and the Kosovo sector of the Serbo-Macedonian Massif, which is characterised by extensive Neogene calc-alkaline volcanics and intrusives. Zone II includes the Belo Brdo, Stan Terg and Hajvalia mines. This zone follows the major fault that marks the eastern margin of the Miocene Pristina basin, and its extension to the NNW and the intrusive and volcanic complexes in northern Kosovo. Zone III includes the Crnac mine, and hosts a number of lead-zinc occurrences along the western border of the Vardar Zone, where it is in contact with the Dinaride Drina-Ivanjica (Drenica) structural block.\n\nCurrent estimates for combined mineable reserves for the five mines have been undertaken, but all of the deposits are open at depth and their strike lengths are uncertain, owing to a lack of systematic exploration and definition drilling. During the lead-zinc-silver exploitation at Farbani Potok (Artana-Novo Brdo), about 3 megatons of high-grade halloysite was discovered. This is only one of five known exploitable deposits of this very high-value (US$140\u2013450/t) clay, the other four being in New Zealand, Turkey, China and Utah, US. Current world production is estimated at 150,000 tons per year.\n\n;[[Nickel]]\nFormer open-pit mining operations based on laterite were undertaken at \u00c7ikatova (Dushkaja and Suke) and Gllavica. Remaining mineable reserves have been calculated as 13.2 megatons averaging 1.42% nickel and 0.05% cobalt. Production stopped in 1999 and has resumed. The buyer of Ferronikeli, IMR/Alferon, paid 33 million euro ($38.76 million) for the plant. The company had to invest at least 20 million euro in the first three years and to employ 1,000 at the end of the first year. Ferronikeli ore mining and metallurgical complex was set up in 1984 to produce ferro-nickel for exports. It produced and exported 6,800 tonnes a year of nickel, in ferro-nickel ingots, before the 1990s but since 1998 it has been idle. Ferronikeli has three open pit mines: the Dushkaja mine with estimated reserves of 6.2 million tonnes; the Suka mine - 0.8 million tonnes and the Gllavica with 6.8 million tonnes. Ferronikeli now is one of the main exporters of Kosovo.\n\n;[[Chromium]]\nA chain of Alpine-type chromite pods in southwestern Kosovo are part of a series of linear deposits that continue into Albania. These pods are small but of high grade and in Albania are known to possess enhanced levels of platinum group metals (PGM).\n\n;Chromit ore\nFrom the end of World War Two until 1956, the ores were worked, primarily from the Gjakova mine by Deva holding company, and direct-shipping ore was sent to Albania for treatment. When the high-grade ore was depleted, Kosovo began importing 30,000- 50,000 t/y of chromite ore from Albania. This ceased when the plant was closed in 1991. No meaningful exploration for chrome has been undertaken for several decades.\n\n;[[Bauxite]]\nKosovo's bauxite deposits are hosted in karst limestone and have been exploited in a series of pits that comprise the Grebnik mine. The host limestone was worked as a construction material and a sizeable stockpile of broken limestone remains on site. Mining began in 1966 and ceased in 1990, owing to the deteriorating political climate in Kosovo. Total production was 2.85 Mt.\nThe traditional markets for bauxite from Grebnik were Romania, Germany and Russia. The mine had a fines mixing and bagging facility to produce wall plaster; production was 5,000 t/y, for the domestic market, and Montenegro and Macedonia.\n\n;[[Magnesite]]\nKosovo possesses two magnesite (MgCO3) mines at Golesh and Strezovc. Both were originally worked as quarries and both moved to underground operations prior to their closure in 1999. Before 1990, the Golesh operation produced 110,000 t of magnesite, 22,000 t of sintered magnesia and 10,000 t of caustic calcined magnesia per annum. Golesh mine is accessed via a shaft, whereas Strezovc is accessed via a horizontal adit in the hillside. Both mines have recently been put up for privatisation.

Currently the wine industry is successful and growing after the war in the 1990s. The main heartland of Kosovo's wine industry is in [[Orahovac]] where millions of litres of wine is produced. The main wines produced in Kosovo include [[pinot noir]], [[merlot]] and [[chardonnay]]. Kosovo has recently been exporting wines to [[Germany]] and the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Kosovo's wines flowing again\">{{cite news|title=Kosovo's wines flowing again|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15401459|accessdate=29 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 October 2011}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Trade==\nKosovo is a small open economy and mainly imports more goods and services than it exports. It is committed to trade liberalization. Participation in regional and wider trade facilitating mechanisms has been one of the main policy objectives of Kosovo institutions. Enhancing trade in Kosovo through liberalized trade requires three aspects to be in place, import rationalization and replacement, trade facilitation and export promotion. This is the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] integrated export strategy which gives equal importance to competitiveness in the domestic market and competitiveness in the foreign market.<ref>[http://mti-ks.org/repository/docs/Trade_Policy_of_Kosovo_2009.pdf Trade Policy of Kosovo, 2009.]</ref>\n\nKosovo's largest export market is [[Italy]] (averaging an amount of \u20ac84 million), followed by Albania (\u20ac34 million), the Republic of Macedonia (\u20ac31 million) and Germany (\u20ac24 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esk.rks-gov.net/tregtia-e-jashtme/tabelat|title=ESK Statistics Table 7|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> Imports are mostly from European Union and Central European Free Trade Agreement countries.

One of the worst problem faced by Kosovo is the negative trade balance, this is made worse by the high level of informal economic activity and an uncontrolled [[black market]], led by illegal groups in northern Kosovo. Exports are dominated mainly by raw materials. Kosovo's liberal trade regime is characterized by simplicity and neutrality, key features considered to be important for stimulating private sector led growth as well as creating the conditions for healthy exports. But as trade liberalization has not been accompanied by an improvement in the competitiveness of the emerging domestic production sectors, Kosovo is facing a huge trade deficit.<ref>[http://www.lmps.gofor.de/riinvest2003aTRADE%20POLICIES%20AND%20EXPORT%20PROMOTION%20IN.pdf Trade Policies and Export Promotion in Kosovo (RIINVEST Research)]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2009, Kosovo joined the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]], and Kosovo began servicing its share of the former Yugoslavia's debt.

This first bridge was wooden, no pedestrian sidewalk, with wooden walls on either side for protection. Caledonia's Grand River Sachem reported the collapse of this bridge in 1861, stating that the \"Spring Freshet\" took out the bridge and damaged the Caledonia Dam.\nTwo temporary bridges were constructed between 1861 and 1874. The last temporary bridge was replaced by a new, state of the art, iron bridge in 1875. The iron being formed at Scott's Foundry located on the eastern corner of Edinburgh Square and Caithness Streets. A toll house was also constructed on the north side of the bridge, to pay off the more than $33,000.00 debt the town had incurred building the bridge. This bridge lasted until 1925 when a truck carrying a load of stone collapsed an entire span. This span was soon replaced and traffic carried on as usual, but a major overhaul was necessary in the long run.\nIn 1926 Construction started on a new bridge. The bridge was to be nine-spans, the first of its type in Canada. built with iron-reinforced concrete the new bridge carried two lanes of traffic and had a pedestrian sidewalk on either side. \nMajor reconstruction work was conducted in 1983, and again in 2008.\n\n==Statistics==\n* Length: {{convert|700|ft}}\n* Width: {{convert|72|ft|7|in}}\n* Number of arches: 9\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1927]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Haldimand County]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Tied arch bridges in Canada]]\n[[Category:Former toll bridges in Canada]]\n", "text_old": ":''For the Caledonia Bridge in North Dakota in the U.S., see [[Caledonia Bridge (Caledonia, North Dakota)]]''\n{{Infobox bridge\n|bridge_name   = Caledonia Bridge\n|image         = Caledonia Bridge Ontario.JPG\n|caption       = The Caledonia Bridge\n|official_name = Caledonia Bridge\n|carries       = \n|crosses       = [[Grand river (Ontario)]]\n|locale        = [[Caledonia, Ontario]]\n|maint         = Ministry Of Transportation, Ontario\n|id            = \n|design        = [[Arch bridge|bow string Arch Bridge]]\n|mainspan      = \n|length        = {{convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n|width         = {{convert|72.7|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n|height        = \n|load          = \n|clearance     = \n|below         = \n|traffic       = \n|begin         = 1926\n|complete      = 1927<ref name=Heritage>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpd.mcl.gov.on.ca/scripts/hpdsearch/english/popupSearch.asp?pid=2926|title=Property Info|publisher=[[Ministry of Culture (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Culture]]|accessdate=2007-12-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192238/http://www.hpd.mcl.gov.on.ca/scripts/hpdsearch/english/popupSearch.asp?pid=2926|archivedate=2011-07-06}}</ref>\n|open          = \n|closed        = \n|toll          = \n|map_cue       = \n|map_image     = \n|map_text      = \n|map_width     = \n|coordinates   = {{coord|43.072250|-79.952456|display=title,inline}}\n|lat           = \n|long          = \n}}\n[[File:CaliBridge150dpi.jpg|right|260px]]\n\nThe '''Caledonia Bridge''', also known as the '''Grand River Bridge''' (built 1927) is a road bridge located in [[Caledonia, Ontario]], Canada on Argyle Street.<ref>[http://www.historicbridges.org/ontario/caledonia/index.htm www.historicbridges.org]</ref>\n\nThe bridge is the only nine span bridge of its kind in [[Canada]] and is considered the first reinforced concrete bridge of its type ever built.<ref>[http://tourism.haldimandcounty.on.ca/filming/ Haldimand County]</ref>\n\nThe bridge, is on the Ontario Heritage Bridge List.<ref name=Heritage /> and is designated by the Haldimand County LACAC (Local Architectural Conservation Advisory Committee).\n\nThe bridge is scheduled to be replaced by a new bridge due to structural damage and age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/pubs/shp2007/rehab3.html|title=2009 to 2011 Highway Rehabilitation Projects|publisher=[[Ministry of Transportation (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Transportation]]|accessdate=2007-12-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070802142704/http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/pubs/shp2007/rehab3.html|archivedate=2007-08-02}}</ref> A number of bridge deficiencies were found requiring action.

The [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman Empire]] allowed Chios almost complete control over its own affairs as Chian trade and the very highly-valued [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic plant]] harvested only on Chios were of great value to it. The cosmopolitan Chians were also very prominent in [[Constantinople]].

{"title_page": "Pavel Krava\u0159", "text_new": "[[File:Pavel Kravar memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque in St Andrews with Hussite emblem.]]\n\n'''Pavel Krava\u0159''' (c. 1391 \u2013 23 July 1433), or '''Paul Crawar''', '''Paul Craw''',  was a [[Hussite]] emissary from [[Bohemia]] who was burned at the stake for heresy at [[St Andrews]] in [[Scotland]] on 23 July 1433. He was the first of a succession of religious reformers who were martyred in the town during the course of the subsequent [[Protestant Reformation]]. (The others being: [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]] in 1528, [[Henry Forrest (martyr)|Henry Forest]] in 1533, [[George Wishart]] in 1546, and [[Walter Myln]] in 1558).\n\nPavel Krava\u0159 was probably a native of [[Krava\u0159e]], [[Opava District]], [[Silesia]] (then [[Moravia]]), now part of the [[Czech Republic]]. After studying medicine at the [[University of Montpellier]], he graduated as Master of Arts from the [[University of Paris]] in 1415. The following year, he entered the Faculty of Arts at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], then a hotbed of Hussite activity. Around 1421, with the University now in decline, Pavel Krava\u0159 left [[Prague]] to become a physician in the service of the Polish King, W\u0142adis\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o ([[Jogaila]]). He probably returned to the Bohemian capital in 1432 prior to undertaking his ill-fated mission to Scotland.\n\nHis journey to St Andrews, at the time the ecclesiastical centre of Scotland and the location of its only [[University of St Andrews|university]], was most likely made in a vain attempt to gain allies, hopefully amongst [[Lollard]] sympathisers, for the Hussite cause at the [[Council of Basel]], at which reconciliation was sought between the Hussites and the [[Catholic Church]]. Pavel Krava\u0159's activities in St Andrews evidently met with the displeasure of the authorities there, particularly [[Henry Wardlaw]], [[Bishop of St Andrews]], who accused him of spreading the heretical ideas of [[Jan Hus]] and [[John Wyclif]]. At his trial he defended himself with skill and courage, but was nevertheless condemned and died, according to [[John Knox]], with a brass ball stuffed in his mouth to prevent him addressing the people.\n\nPavel Krava\u0159's execution is believed to have taken place at the centre of the market square in St Andrews, close to the former location of the [[Mercat Cross]] which is now marked with a cross of red stones set into the cobbled surface of the roadway. A memorial plaque, with an inscription in English and Czech languages, is located on a building nearby.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource|The Acts and Monuments of John Foxe/Volume 3/Thomas Bagley, Priest; Paul Craw, a Bohemian, Martyr|Paul Craw, a Bohemian, Martyr}}\n[[List of Protestant martyrs of the Scottish Reformation]]\n\n==References==\n* Vy\u0161n\u00fd, Paul, \"A Hussite in Scotland: The Mission of Pavel Krava\u0159 to St Andrews in 1433\", ''The Scottish Historical Review'', vol. lxxxii, April 2003, pp.&nbsp;1\u201319.\n\n==Further reading==\n* Moonan, Lawrence, \"Pavel Kravar and some writings once attributed to him\", ''Innes Review'', Vol. 27 (1976), pp.&nbsp;3\u201323\n* Spinka, Matthew, \"Paul Krava\u0159 and the Lollard-Hussite Relations\", in ''Church History'', Vol. 25, No. 1.

(The others being: [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]] in 1528, [[Henry Forrest (martyr)|Henry Forest]] in 1533, [[George Wishart]] in 1546, and [[Walter Myln]] in 1558).\n\nPavel Krava\u0159 was probably a native of [[Krava\u0159e]], [[Opava District]], [[Silesia]] (then [[Moravia]]), now part of the [[Czech Republic]]. After studying medicine at the [[University of Montpellier]], he graduated as Master of Arts from the [[University of Paris]] in 1415. The following year, he entered the Faculty of Arts at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], then a hotbed of Hussite activity. Around 1421, with the University now in decline, Pavel Krava\u0159 left [[Prague]] to become a physician in the service of the Polish King, W\u0142adis\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o ([[Jogaila]]). He probably returned to the Bohemian capital in 1432 prior to undertaking his ill-fated mission to Scotland.\n\nHis journey to St Andrews, at the time the ecclesiastical centre of Scotland and the location of its only [[University of St Andrews|university]], was most likely made in a vain attempt to gain allies, hopefully amongst [[Lollard]] sympathisers, for the Hussite cause at the [[Council of Basel]], at which reconciliation was sought between the Hussites and the [[Catholic Church]]. Pavel Krava\u0159's activities in St Andrews evidently met with the displeasure of the authorities there, particularly [[Henry Wardlaw]], [[Bishop of St Andrews]], who accused him of spreading the heretical ideas of [[Jan Hus]] and [[John Wyclif]]. At his trial he defended himself with skill and courage, but was nevertheless condemned and died, according to [[John Knox]], with a brass ball stuffed in his mouth to prevent him addressing the people.\n\nPavel Krava\u0159's execution is believed to have taken place at the centre of the market square in St Andrews, close to the former location of the [[Mercat Cross]] which is now marked with a cross of red stones set into the cobbled surface of the roadway. A memorial plaque, with an inscription in English and Czech languages, is located on a building nearby.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource|The Acts and Monuments of John Foxe/Volume 3/Thomas Bagley, Priest; Paul Craw, a Bohemian, Martyr|Paul Craw, a Bohemian, Martyr}}\n[[List of Protestant martyrs of the Scottish Reformation]]\n\n==References==\n* Vy\u0161n\u00fd, Paul, \"A Hussite in Scotland: The Mission of Pavel Krava\u0159 to St Andrews in 1433\", ''The Scottish Historical Review'', vol. lxxxii, April 2003, pp.&nbsp;1\u201319.\n\n==Further reading==\n* Moonan, Lawrence, \"Pavel Kravar and some writings once attributed to him\", ''Innes Review'', Vol. 27 (1976), pp.&nbsp;3\u201323\n* Spinka, Matthew, \"Paul Krava\u0159 and the Lollard-Hussite Relations\", in ''Church History'', Vol. 25, No. 1.
