Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]\", Spears is regarded as a [[pop icon]] and is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nSpears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior beginning in 2006, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|last=|first=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Spears' personal struggles led her to be placed on a still ongoing [[conservatorship]]. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), respectively. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58&nbsp;million, having last topped the list in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/britney-spears-highest-paid-woman-music-2012-full-list-935061 |title=Britney Spears Is The Highest-Paid Woman in Music For 2012; Full List |work=International Business Times |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her [[Conservatorship|conservator]], leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.\n\nSpears has scored six number one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.<ref name=\"billboard_472190\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472190/britney-spears-snares-sixth-no-1-on-billboard-200-with-femme-fatale |title=Britney Spears Snares Sixth No. 1 on Billboard 200 with 'Femme Fatale' |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}</ref> Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\", \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\", \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\", and \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\".

Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.\n\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''.

Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineer|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day.

Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]\", Spears is regarded as a [[pop icon]] and is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nSpears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior beginning in 2006, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|last=|first=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Spears' personal struggles led her to be placed on a still ongoing [[conservatorship]]. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), respectively. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58&nbsp;million, having last topped the list in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/britney-spears-highest-paid-woman-music-2012-full-list-935061 |title=Britney Spears Is The Highest-Paid Woman in Music For 2012; Full List |work=International Business Times |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her [[Conservatorship|conservator]], leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.\n\nSpears has scored six number one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.<ref name=\"billboard_472190\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472190/britney-spears-snares-sixth-no-1-on-billboard-200-with-femme-fatale |title=Britney Spears Snares Sixth No. 1 on Billboard 200 with 'Femme Fatale' |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}</ref> Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\", \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\", \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\", and \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\". Other singles, \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]\" and \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\", topped the charts in most countries. With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after [[Mariah Carey]] in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs.

Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.\n\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and was cast in a number of commercials.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}</ref> In December 1992, she was cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' alongside [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ryan Gosling]], and [[Keri Russell]].

Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored.

Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made.

In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells.\n\nCharacteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref>\n\nILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood. They are particularly abundant at mucosal surfaces, playing a key role in mucosal immunity and [[homeostasis]].\n\nBased on the difference in developmental pathways, phenotype, and signalling molecules produced, in 2013, ILCs were divided into three groups: 1, 2 and 3, however, after further investigation, we now appreciate five distinct subsets within these groups: [[natural killer cell|NK cells]], ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, and LTi cells.<ref name=\"SpitsArtis2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Spits|first1=Hergen|last2=Artis|first2=David|last3=Colonna|first3=Marco|last4=Diefenbach|first4=Andreas|last5=Di Santo|first5=James P.|last6=Eberl|first6=Gerard|last7=Koyasu|first7=Shigeo|last8=Locksley|first8=Richard M.|last9=McKenzie|first9=Andrew N.

Once matured, the ILCs release cytokines. The classification of ILCs is therefore based on the differences in the transcription factor and cytokine profiles associated with the development and function of the different ILC subtypes.<ref name=\"KloseKiss2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Klose|first1=Christoph S.

This is in response to polarising signals released in the resident tissue. Therefore, cytokine receptors, their transcription factors, and access of defined chromatin regions to the transcription factors, are required to allow the change.<ref name=\"VivierArtis2018\"/>\n\n===Group 1 ILCs===\n\nILC1 and [[Natural Killer cell|NK cell]] lineages diverge early in their developmental pathways and can be discriminated by their difference in dependence on [[transcription factor]]s, their [[cytotoxicity]], and their resident marker expression. \n\nNK cells are cytotoxic cells, circulating in the bloodstream, killing [[virus]]-infected, and [[tumor]] cells. ILC1s, are non- cytotoxic or weakly cytotoxic, tissue resident cells, functioning in the defence against infections with viruses and certain [[bacteria]]. \n\nDue to ILC1s and NK cells having both common and uncommon features, the classification of ILC1s has been problematic. Both cell types produce [[Interferon gamma|IFN-\u03b3]] as their principle cytokine and require the transcription factor [[TBX21|T-bet]] to do so.<ref name=\"VivierArtis2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Vivier|first1=Eric|last2=Artis|first2=David|last3=Colonna|first3=Marco|last4=Diefenbach|first4=Andreas|last5=Di Santo|first5=James P.|last6=Eberl|first6=G\u00e9rard|last7=Koyasu|first7=Shigeo|last8=Locksley|first8=Richard M.|last9=McKenzie|first9=Andrew N.J.|last10=Mebius|first10=Reina E.|last11=Powrie|first11=Fiona|last12=Spits|first12=Hergen|title=Innate Lymphoid Cells: 10 Years On|journal=Cell|volume=174|issue=5|year=2018|pages=1054\u20131066|issn=00928674|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2018.07.017}}</ref>\nThe cells can also produce IFN-\u03b3 when the cytokines [[Interleukin 15|IL-15]] or [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]] are up-regulated in tissues after infection or injury.

His impressive performances caught the eye of a PAOK scout, and joined PAOK in the summer of 2004. He has been a mainstay in the PAOK first team proving to be a vital team player.\n\nAs of 2008 many European clubs were interested in signing him. He was contracted to [[PAOK FC|PAOK]] until 2008 with minimum fee release clause of \u20ac6 million.\n\nIn the summer of 2006 he was given a trial by English giants [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] but PAOK was reluctant to sell him at the time. This started a dispute that prevented him from playing for more than half of the [[2006\u201307 Superleague Greece|2006\u201307 season]].\nHe was nicknamed \"The Builder\" by the local media, because during his fall-out in relations with [[PAOK F.C.|PAOK]], he stated that he would be better off being a construction worker than playing for PAOK again.\n\n===Panathinaikos===\nOn 20 June 2008, Christodoulopoulos agreed a deal in principle to join [[Panathinaikos FC]] for \u20ac3.8&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.sportaction.gr/document.php?category_id=146&document_id=98437 SPORTACTION \u2013 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Christodoulopoulos signed a four-year contract with the club.<ref>[http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/Superleague/Panathinaikos/202926.html Christodoulopoulos signed for Panathinaikos FC]</ref> On 18 February 2010, Christodoulopoulos scored against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] after coming on in the [[UEFA Europa League]] round of 32.\n\nThe 2011\u201312 season didn't start well for him, as he faced a serious knee injury during pre-season which led him to surgery. The club doctors said that he would be expected to return after five months. After months of therapy and special treatment, he joined the rest of the team at training in December. On 29 December 2011, the club president announced that Christodoulopoulos had agreed to sign a new three-year contract until 2015 since his contract was going to expire during the end of the 2011\u201312 season. In January 2012, it was reported that [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] were interested in signing Christodoulopoulos, the former trialist at the club, for \u00a32,000,000 (\u20ac4,500,000).\n\nChristodoulopoulos began 2012\u201313 by scoring in European and championship matches. He was given the number \"10\". He and [[Ibrahim Sissoko]] were the most important players for the season. In December, in order for Panathinaikos' president, Giannis Alafouzos, to save money for the team, he released players with high-paying contacts; as a result Christodoulopoulos was released alongside [[Nikos Spyropoulos]], [[Loukas Vyntra]], [[Antonis Petropoulos]] and [[Sebastian Leto]].\n\n===Bologna===\nOn 31 January 2013, Lazaros was transferred to [[Bologna F.C.|Bologna]] on a free transfer. On 26 February 2013, Lazaros made his debut against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] coming on as a substitute and scoring a goal in a 2\u20131 win.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe departure of [[Alessandro Diamanti]] in January has opened its doors as a starter for Lazaros Christodoulopoulos. The Greek attacking midfielder has proved ready and able to take advantage of the chances he had, becoming one of the linchpins of the team coached by [[Davide Ballardini]].\n\nIn March 2014, Lazaros Christodoulopoulos netted a late consolation penalty in a 2\u20131 away loss against [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]].<ref>[http://www.sportinglife.com/football/live/match-report/302304/livorno-climb-above-rivals Livorno \u2013 Bologna 2\u20131]</ref> It was his first goal in the season. A week later, Lazaros Christodoulopoulos gave Bologna's survival hopes a massive boost with a crucial 1\u20130 win over [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] at the Dal\u2019Ara. He was outstanding for the club and at the heart of the club's excellent attacking football so it was no surprise when he swept home the winner from the penalty spot. Lazaros curled a free kick over the top for Bologna before being denied by another brilliant save with 15 minutes to go after again jinking past defenders and letting loose. Two minutes afterwards, the man of the match involved in everything was at the centre of controversy when the referee adjudged [[Daniele Dessena]] to have pushed him to the ground inside the box. The spot kick was awarded and Lazaros stepped up to provide the cool conversion and give his side a priceless win.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2014/03/bologna-1-0-cagliari-outstanding-lazaros-fires-felsinei-to-massive-win/|publisher=forzaitalianfootball.com|title=Bologna 1\u20130 Cagliari: Outstanding Lazaros fires Felsinei to massive win}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 May 2014, there was tension in the training campus at [[Bologna]], a few days after the last challenge at the Olimpico against [[S.S.

His impressive performances caught the eye of a PAOK scout, and joined PAOK in the summer of 2004. He has been a mainstay in the PAOK first team proving to be a vital team player.\n\nAs of 2008 many European clubs were interested in signing him. He was contracted to [[PAOK FC|PAOK]] until 2008 with minimum fee release clause of \u20ac6 million.\n\nIn the summer of 2006 he was given a trial by English giants [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] but PAOK was reluctant to sell him at the time. This started a dispute that prevented him from playing for more than half of the [[2006\u201307 Superleague Greece|2006\u201307 season]].\nHe was nicknamed \"The Builder\" by the local media, because during his fall-out in relations with [[PAOK F.C.|PAOK]], he stated that he would be better off being a construction worker than playing for PAOK again.\n\n===Panathinaikos===\nOn 20 June 2008, Christodoulopoulos agreed a deal in principle to join [[Panathinaikos FC]] for \u20ac3.8&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.sportaction.gr/document.php?category_id=146&document_id=98437 SPORTACTION \u2013 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Christodoulopoulos signed a four-year contract with the club.<ref>[http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/Superleague/Panathinaikos/202926.html Christodoulopoulos signed for Panathinaikos FC]</ref> On 18 February 2010, Christodoulopoulos scored against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] after coming on in the [[UEFA Europa League]] round of 32.\n\nThe 2011\u201312 season didn't start well for him, as he faced a serious knee injury during pre-season which led him to surgery. The club doctors said that he would be expected to return after five months. After months of therapy and special treatment, he joined the rest of the team at training in December. On 29 December 2011, the club president announced that Christodoulopoulos had agreed to sign a new three-year contract until 2015 since his contract was going to expire during the end of the 2011\u201312 season. In January 2012, it was reported that [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] were interested in signing Christodoulopoulos, the former trialist at the club, for \u00a32,000,000 (\u20ac4,500,000).\n\nChristodoulopoulos began 2012\u201313 by scoring in European and championship matches. He was given the number \"10\". He and [[Ibrahim Sissoko]] were the most important players for the season. In December, in order for Panathinaikos' president, Giannis Alafouzos, to save money for the team, he released players with high-paying contacts; as a result Christodoulopoulos was released alongside [[Nikos Spyropoulos]], [[Loukas Vyntra]], [[Antonis Petropoulos]] and [[Sebastian Leto]].\n\n===Bologna===\nOn 31 January 2013, Lazaros was transferred to [[Bologna F.C.|Bologna]] on a free transfer. On 26 February 2013, Lazaros made his debut against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] coming on as a substitute and scoring a goal in a 2\u20131 win.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe departure of [[Alessandro Diamanti]] in January has opened its doors as a starter for Lazaros Christodoulopoulos. The Greek attacking midfielder has proved ready and able to take advantage of the chances he had, becoming one of the linchpins of the team coached by [[Davide Ballardini]].\n\nIn March 2014, Lazaros Christodoulopoulos netted a late consolation penalty in a 2\u20131 away loss against [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]].<ref>[http://www.sportinglife.com/football/live/match-report/302304/livorno-climb-above-rivals Livorno \u2013 Bologna 2\u20131]</ref> It was his first goal in the season. A week later, Lazaros Christodoulopoulos gave Bologna's survival hopes a massive boost with a crucial 1\u20130 win over [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] at the Dal\u2019Ara. He was outstanding for the club and at the heart of the club's excellent attacking football so it was no surprise when he swept home the winner from the penalty spot. Lazaros curled a free kick over the top for Bologna before being denied by another brilliant save with 15 minutes to go after again jinking past defenders and letting loose. Two minutes afterwards, the man of the match involved in everything was at the centre of controversy when the referee adjudged [[Daniele Dessena]] to have pushed him to the ground inside the box. The spot kick was awarded and Lazaros stepped up to provide the cool conversion and give his side a priceless win.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2014/03/bologna-1-0-cagliari-outstanding-lazaros-fires-felsinei-to-massive-win/|publisher=forzaitalianfootball.com|title=Bologna 1\u20130 Cagliari: Outstanding Lazaros fires Felsinei to massive win}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 May 2014, there was tension in the training campus at [[Bologna]], a few days after the last challenge at the Olimpico against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] ending a disappointing season that led to relegation to [[Serie B]]. An entry of [[Cesare Natali]]'s hard training on Lazaros Christodoulopoulos, sparked the reaction of the Greek midfielder. Lazaros is afraid to get hurt and jeopardize his participation at the [[2014 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/calcio/serie_a/bologna/2014/05/16-361414/Tensione+Bologna%3A+lite+fra+Natali+e+Lazaros|publisher=corrieredellosport.it|title=Tensione Bologna: lite fra Natali e Lazaros|access-date=9 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714195717/http://www.corrieredellosport.it/calcio/serie_a/bologna/2014/05/16-361414/Tensione+Bologna%3A+lite+fra+Natali+e+Lazaros|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBologna, after relegation, will proceed with the disposal of its most popular players.

It is the second oldest botanic garden in Britain after [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Oxford's]]. The plant collection used as the basis of the garden was the private collection of [[Patrick Murray, 1st Lord Elibank#Patrick Murray, 2nd Lord Elibank|Sir Patrick Murray, 2nd Lord Elibank]], moved from his home at Livingston Peel in 1672 following his death in September 1671.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SV4CAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=patrick+murray,+baron+livingstone&source=bl&ots=pfAoi0vzNw&sig=YIfs4JgvpXZqmrBky9cvms2QKu4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VTtLUcvvO8ek4APhm4CADg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=patrick%20murray%2C%20baron%20livingstone&f=false|title=Notes & Queries|author=William White|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1889}}</ref> The original site was \"obtained of John Brown, gardener of the North Yardes in the Holyrood Abby, ane inclosure of some 40 foot of measure every way.

The three main cross-cutting themes of scientific work at the RBGE are: Scottish [[Biodiversity]], Plants & [[Climate Change]], and [[Conservation biology|Conservation]].\n\nIn addition to the RBGE's scientific activities the garden remains a popular destination for both tourists and locals. Locally known as \"The Botanics\", the garden is a popular place to go for a walk, particularly with young families. Entrance to the botanic garden is free, although a small entry charge exists for the glasshouses. During the year the garden hosts many events including live performances, guided tours and exhibitions. The RBGE is also an important centre for education, offering taught courses across all levels.\n\nIn 2009, the John Hope Gateway was opened. [[John Hope (botanist)|John Hope]] was the first Regius Keeper of RBGE.\n\n===Living collection===\n[[File:Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh (9458336048).jpg|thumb|''[[Nymphaea]]'' in the Royal Botanic Garden]]\n[[File:Waterfall, Edinburgh Botanical Garden.jpg|thumb|upright|Waterfall in the rock garden]]\nNearly 273,000<ref name=\"Cat\" /> individual plants are grown at the Botanics in Edinburgh or its three smaller satellite gardens (known as Regional Gardens) located in other parts of Scotland. These represent around 13,300<ref name=\"Cat\" /> species from all over the world, or about 4%<ref name=\"Cat\" /> of all known plant species.\n\nThe RBGE Living Collection catalogue is available [http://elmer.rbge.org.uk/bgbase/livcol/bgbaselivcol.php here] and is updated nightly.\n\nSome notable collections at the botanic garden Edinburgh include:\n*[[Alpine plant|Alpine Plants]]\n*Chinese Hillside\n*[[Cryptogamic]] Garden\n*The Glasshouses\n**Palmhouse\n***Temperate Palms\n***Tropical Palms\n**Orchids and Cycads\n**Ferns and Fossils\n**Plants and people (including [[Victoria amazonica|Giant Water Lily]] pond)\n**Temperate lands\n**Rainforest Riches\n**Arid Lands\n**Montane tropical house (including [[Carnivorous plant]]s)\n**Wet Tropical House\n*Peat Walls\n*The [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mother's]] memorial garden.\n*Rock Garden\n*Scottish Heath Garden\n*Woodland Garden\n\n===Herbarium===\n\nThe RBGE [[Herbarium]] (situated in a purpose built facility at the Edinburgh site) is considered a world-leading botanical collection, housing in excess of 3 million specimens. Prior to the formation of the Herbarium, plant collections tended to be the private property of the Regius Keeper. The Herbarium in its present form came with the fusion of the collections of the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the [[Botanical Society of Edinburgh]] in 1839-40. RBGE's Herbarium moved into its present, purpose-built home in 1964.\n\nOver the years, a large number of collections have been added, belonging to individuals such as R.K. Greville and [[John Hutton Balfour]], and institutions including the Universities of [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and [[University of Hull|Hull]]. The most important historical collection is that of [[George Arnott Walker-Arnott|George Walker Arnott]], which came with the University of Glasgow's foreign herbarium deposited on permanent loan in 1965. This collection contains specimens from all the major mid-19th century collectors, especially from India, North and South America, and South Africa, including type material of species described by \u2018Hooker & Arnott'. From the early 20th century, collections have been made by members of staff.\n\nThe approx 20% of the Herbarium that has been databased is searchable [http://elmer.rbge.org.uk/bgbase/vherb/bgbasevherb.php here.]\n\n===Library===\n\nRBGE's Library is Scotland's national reference collection for specialist botanical and horticultural resources. Housing around 70,000 books and 150,000 periodicals the research library is one of the country's largest . It has been built up to support the specific subject fields researched and taught at RBGE - Garden staff and students are its main users, along with visiting researchers. However, as a national reference collection, the Library is also open to members of the public, either in person or by telephone or e-mail.\n\n===Inverleith House===\n\n[[Inverleith House]] is an 18th-century building, located centrally in the modern botanic gardens. From 1960 to 1984 it was the original base of the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], with exhibits in the house and in the gardens, before it moved to larger premises in Belford Road. Since then, Inverleith House has functioned as a contemporary art gallery, showing a programme of temporary exhibitions by invited artists. Its spring programmes feature works and specimens from the historical collections of the Botanics, together with exhibitions by modern and contemporary artists. The gallery is curated by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.<ref name=\"Edinburgh 2015\">{{cite web | last=Edinburgh | first=Royal Botanic Garden | title=Inverleith House | website=rbge.org.uk | date=13 Jan 2015  | url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/the-gardens/edinburgh/inverleith-house | accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Regional specialist gardens==\n\n===Benmore===\n{{main article|Benmore Botanic Garden}}\n[[File:2015 October Holidays (22148695396).jpg|thumb|View of [[Benmore Botanic Garden]]]]\n[[File:Tree ferns, Logan Botanic Gardens, Mull of Galloway - geograph.org.uk - 878266.jpg|thumb|Tree ferns at [[Logan Botanic Garden]]]]\nSituated on the West Coast of Scotland, Benmore Botanic Garden experiences a wetter and milder oceanic climate than the main site in Edinburgh. Benmore grows trees and shrubs from high rainfall areas, especially conifers and rhododendrons. Highlights of the collection include an avenue of [[Sequoiadendron]] and a recently refurbished Fernery, exhibiting rare ferns from both Britain and abroad.\n\n===Dawyck===\n{{main article|Dawyck Botanic Garden}}\n\nSituated to the south of the Scottish Border town of [[Peebles]], Dawyck Botanic Garden is particularly suitable for hardy plants from the world's cooler, drier areas. Dawyck is also renowned for its high diversity of [[fungi]] and [[cryptogam]]ics.\n\n===Logan===\n{{main article|Logan Botanic Garden}}\n\nLogan, Scotland's most exotic garden, has an almost sub-tropical climate, and provides ideal growing conditions for southern hemisphere plants.\n\n==Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh Medal==\nThe Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh Medal, instituted in 2010, is awarded from time to time to recognise an outstanding individual contribution in any field related to the work of the RBGE (either by a member of staff or by any other person).

The Edinburgh site is the main garden and the headquarters of the public body, which is led by Regius Keeper, [[Simon Milne]].\n\n==History==\nThe Edinburgh [[botanical garden|botanic garden]] was founded in 1670 at St. Anne's Yard, near [[Holyrood Palace]], by [[Robert Sibbald|Dr. Robert Sibbald]] and Dr. [[Andrew Balfour (botanist)|Andrew Balfour]]. It is the second oldest botanic garden in Britain after [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Oxford's]]. The plant collection used as the basis of the garden was the private collection of [[Patrick Murray, 1st Lord Elibank#Patrick Murray, 2nd Lord Elibank|Sir Patrick Murray, 2nd Lord Elibank]], moved from his home at Livingston Peel in 1672 following his death in September 1671.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SV4CAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=patrick+murray,+baron+livingstone&source=bl&ots=pfAoi0vzNw&sig=YIfs4JgvpXZqmrBky9cvms2QKu4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VTtLUcvvO8ek4APhm4CADg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=patrick%20murray%2C%20baron%20livingstone&f=false|title=Notes & Queries|author=William White|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1889}}</ref> The original site was \"obtained of John Brown, gardener of the North Yardes in the Holyrood Abby, ane inclosure of some 40 foot of measure every way.

The three main cross-cutting themes of scientific work at the RBGE are: Scottish [[Biodiversity]], Plants & [[Climate Change]], and [[Conservation biology|Conservation]].\n\nIn addition to the RBGE's scientific activities the garden remains a popular destination for both tourists and locals. Locally known as \"The Botanics\", the garden is a popular place to go for a walk, particularly with young families. Entrance to the botanic garden is free, although a small entry charge exists for the glasshouses. During the year the garden hosts many events including live performances, guided tours and exhibitions. The RBGE is also an important centre for education, offering taught courses across all levels.\n\nIn 2009, the John Hope Gateway was opened. [[John Hope (botanist)|John Hope]] was the first Regius Keeper of RBGE.\n\n===Living collection===\n[[File:Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh (9458336048).jpg|thumb|''[[Nymphaea]]'' in the Royal Botanic Garden]]\n[[File:Waterfall, Edinburgh Botanical Garden.jpg|thumb|upright|Waterfall in the rock garden]]\nNearly 273,000<ref name=\"Cat\" /> individual plants are grown at the Botanics in Edinburgh or its three smaller satellite gardens (known as Regional Gardens) located in other parts of Scotland. These represent around 13,300<ref name=\"Cat\" /> species from all over the world, or about 4%<ref name=\"Cat\" /> of all known plant species.\n\nThe RBGE Living Collection catalogue is available [http://elmer.rbge.org.uk/bgbase/livcol/bgbaselivcol.php here] and is updated nightly.\n\nSome notable collections at the botanic garden Edinburgh include:\n*[[Alpine plant|Alpine Plants]]\n*Chinese Hillside\n*[[Cryptogamic]] Garden\n*The Glasshouses\n**Palmhouse\n***Temperate Palms\n***Tropical Palms\n**Orchids and Cycads\n**Ferns and Fossils\n**Plants and people (including [[Victoria amazonica|Giant Water Lily]] pond)\n**Temperate lands\n**Rainforest Riches\n**Arid Lands\n**Montane tropical house (including [[Carnivorous plant]]s)\n**Wet Tropical House\n*Peat Walls\n*The [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mother's]] memorial garden.\n*Rock Garden\n*Scottish Heath Garden\n*Woodland Garden\n\n===Herbarium===\n\nThe RBGE [[Herbarium]] (situated in a purpose built facility at the Edinburgh site) is considered a world-leading botanical collection, housing in excess of 3 million specimens. Prior to the formation of the Herbarium, plant collections tended to be the private property of the Regius Keeper. The Herbarium in its present form came with the fusion of the collections of the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the [[Botanical Society of Edinburgh]] in 1839-40. RBGE's Herbarium moved into its present, purpose-built home in 1964.\n\nOver the years, a large number of collections have been added, belonging to individuals such as R.K. Greville and [[John Hutton Balfour]], and institutions including the Universities of [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and [[University of Hull|Hull]]. The most important historical collection is that of [[George Arnott Walker-Arnott|George Walker Arnott]], which came with the University of Glasgow's foreign herbarium deposited on permanent loan in 1965. This collection contains specimens from all the major mid-19th century collectors, especially from India, North and South America, and South Africa, including type material of species described by \u2018Hooker & Arnott'. From the early 20th century, collections have been made by members of staff.\n\nThe approx 20% of the Herbarium that has been databased is searchable [http://elmer.rbge.org.uk/bgbase/vherb/bgbasevherb.php here.]\n\n===Library===\n\nRBGE's Library is Scotland's national reference collection for specialist botanical and horticultural resources. Housing around 70,000 books and 150,000 periodicals the research library is one of the country's largest . It has been built up to support the specific subject fields researched and taught at RBGE - Garden staff and students are its main users, along with visiting researchers. However, as a national reference collection, the Library is also open to members of the public, either in person or by telephone or e-mail.\n\n===Inverleith House===\n\n[[Inverleith House]] is an 18th-century building, located centrally in the modern botanic gardens. From 1960 to 1984 it was the original base of the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], with exhibits in the house and in the gardens, before it moved to larger premises in Belford Road. Since then, Inverleith House has functioned as a contemporary art gallery, showing a programme of temporary exhibitions by invited artists. Its spring programmes feature works and specimens from the historical collections of the Botanics, together with exhibitions by modern and contemporary artists. The gallery is curated by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.<ref name=\"Edinburgh 2015\">{{cite web | last=Edinburgh | first=Royal Botanic Garden | title=Inverleith House | website=rbge.org.uk | date=13 Jan 2015  | url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/the-gardens/edinburgh/inverleith-house | accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Regional specialist gardens==\n\n===Benmore===\n{{main article|Benmore Botanic Garden}}\n[[File:2015 October Holidays (22148695396).jpg|thumb|View of [[Benmore Botanic Garden]]]]\n[[File:Tree ferns, Logan Botanic Gardens, Mull of Galloway - geograph.org.uk - 878266.jpg|thumb|Tree ferns at [[Logan Botanic Garden]]]]\nSituated on the West Coast of Scotland, Benmore Botanic Garden experiences a wetter and milder oceanic climate than the main site in Edinburgh. Benmore grows trees and shrubs from high rainfall areas, especially conifers and rhododendrons. Highlights of the collection include an avenue of [[Sequoiadendron]] and a recently refurbished Fernery, exhibiting rare ferns from both Britain and abroad.\n\n===Dawyck===\n{{main article|Dawyck Botanic Garden}}\n\nSituated to the south of the Scottish Border town of [[Peebles]], Dawyck Botanic Garden is particularly suitable for hardy plants from the world's cooler, drier areas. Dawyck is also renowned for its high diversity of [[fungi]] and [[cryptogam]]ics.\n\n===Logan===\n{{main article|Logan Botanic Garden}}\n\nLogan, Scotland's most exotic garden, has an almost sub-tropical climate, and provides ideal growing conditions for southern hemisphere plants.\n\n==Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh Medal==\nThe Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh Medal, instituted in 2010, is awarded from time to time to recognise an outstanding individual contribution in any field related to the work of the RBGE (either by a member of staff or by any other person).

Trip or journey planning, in contrast, would make use of at least one [[public transport]] mode which operates according to [[Public transport timetable|published schedules]]; given that public transport services only depart at specific times (unlike private transport which may leave at any time), an algorithm must therefore not only find a path to a destination, but seek to optimise it so as to minimise the  waiting time incurred for each leg. In European Standards such as [[Transmodel]], trip planning is used specifically to describe the planning of a route for a passenger, to avoid confusion with the completely separate process of planning the operational journeys to be made by public transport vehicles on which such trips are made.\n\nTrip planners have been widely used in the [[travel industry]] since the 1970s, by booking agents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveltecnik.com/2007/12/history-of-global-distribution-systems.html |title=TravelTecnik Consultants - Travel & Hospitality Technology: History of Global Distribution Systems (GDS) |website=Traveltecnik.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> The growth of the [[Internet]], the proliferation of [[Geographic data and information|geospatial data]], and the development of [[Information technology|information technologies]] generally has led to the rapid development of many self-service app or [[Web browser|browser-based]], on-line [[Intermodal journey planner|intermodal]] trip planners such as [[Citymapper]], [[Door2Door]], [[FromAtoB.com]], [[Google Maps]], [https://www.omio.com Omio], and [[Rome2rio]].\n\nA trip planner may be used in conjunction with ticketing and reservation systems.\n\n== Basic features ==\nJourney planners, also known as trip planners,  comprise a front end user interface to gather travel requirements from the user and  present the proposed travel itineraries back to them, and a back end journey planning engine which performs the actual computation of the  possible trip plans, prioritising these according to the user's optimisation criteria (''fastest, fewest changes, cheapest'', etc.) and returning a subset that best satisfy them.  The user interface may run on a terminal, PC, tablet,  mobile device or even be speech based and may integrate maps and location data to give a visualisation of the trip or to simplify the interaction with the user.  The journey planning engine may be either local or remote and may have either a monolithic (all the data in a single search space)  or a distributed architecture (the data for different regions split among different engines, each with their own search space).\n\nSimple engines cover only public transport data for a single mode, others are multimodal, covering public transport data for several modes; advanced intermodal engines may also   include road and footpath routing to cover the access legs to reach the public transport stops and also simultaneously compute routes for travel by private car so that the user may make a comparison between public and private modes.  Advanced trip planners may also make use of real-time data to improve their results; this use may be decorative, annotating the results with information about known incidents that might affect the trip, or computational, dynamically using the predicted departure and arrival times from a real-time feed such as the CEN [[Service Interface for Real Time Information]] to give more accurate trip plans for trips taking place in the near future.   The capabilities of the back-end engine limit what may be offered in the user interface. The available data limits the capabilities of the back-end engine.\n\n=== Inputs ===\nThe minimum inputs to a trip planner are an origin and destination place and a  date and time of travel (which can be defaulted to the current moment).  The interface may provide various methods to discover and specify an origin or destination, including specifying  the name of a  [[Geocoding|geocoded place]], a stop or station code, a [[Address (geography)|street address]],  a point of interest (that is, a tourist attraction or other  named common destination) or  a [[Spatial reference system|spatial coordinate]]  (usually specified by using an interactive  [[Web Map Service|web map]] - current locations can also be obtained from a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location service or from an IP address lookup).   A location finding function of the trip planner will typically first resolve the origin and destination into the nearest known nodes on the transport network in order to compute a trip plan over its data set of known public transport journeys.\n\nDepending on the journey planning engine and the data sets which are available to it, many other additional inputs may be supported, for example:\n* Which [[Mode of transport|transport modes]] to include or exclude.\n* Whether to constrain the time of travel by arrival time, departure time - or to allow a  flexible window within which travel may be undertaken.\n* Any preferred routing for the trip via intermediate stop points.\n* Trip optimisation preferences:  for example ''the shortest trip''  versus ''the fewest changes''.\n* Trip cost optimisation preferences: for example, ''the cheapest''  versus ''the most convenient''.\n* Accessibility preferences: ''step free, wheelchair accessible'', etc., and whether to allow extra time for connections.\n* Access preferences: how long the user is prepared to walk to a stop, etc.\n* Class of travel and desired on-board facilities.\n* Congestion preferences : ''least crowded '' versus ''shortest trip '', etc.\n* Information relevant for selecting fares and the cheapest option: the type of user (''adult, child, senior, student,'' etc.),  ownership of travel cards, etc.\n* etc.\n\n=== Outputs ===\nAfter the trip planner has computed and prioritised a trip or set of possible trips, these are presented to the user as a list for the user to choose from, they may also or instead be displayed on a map. Again, depending on the capabilities of the planner and the available data, the results may include;\n* The times and departure points of trips from stops or stations, possibly with the exact platform to use and even the boarding point on the platform.\n* Trip maps showing the path of the trip legs on a map.\n* Route maps showing the network topology.\n* Stop area maps and other directions to identify the location of the stops at the boarding and alighting points.\n* Information about the heading signs shown on the vehicle in order to identify the correct transport vehicle to take.\n* Information on the transfer times needed to make the access and connection legs.\n* Step by step directions in order to follow an access leg to a stop, enter a station or large interchange such as an airport, or make a transfer on a connection leg, including the accessibility characteristics of each step.\n* Information on the accessibility characteristics of the vehicles on specific legs (''wheelchair hoist, wheelchair spaces'', etc.).\n* Information on the at-stop and on-board facilities (''parking, buffet car, wifi,'' etc.).\n* Information on disruption or delays expected on specific trip legs or modes.\n* Information on available fares for the trip.\n\n=== Additional features ===\nSome trip planners integrate information services other than point-to-point [https://www.productsreviewzone.com/vacation-planning/ trip planning] into their user interface, for example to provide timetables for routes,  real-time arrivals and departures at stops, or real-time disruption notices.   Additional visualisations may be offered;  Google, for example, has a [[Gantt chart]] like 'Schedule explorer' that can be used to visualise the relative timings of different trip plans.  Another powerful visualisation is the [[Isochrone map]] which shows relative travel times as relative distances.\n\nA trip  planner may also have more than one [[user interfaces|user interface]], with each optimised for different purposes. For example, online self-service done with a [[Web browser]], an interface for [[call centre]] agents, one for use on mobile devices, or special interfaces for visually impaired users.\n\nSome commercial trip planners include aspects of [[discovery shopping]] for accommodation and activities and [[price comparison]] for some aspects of a trip.\n\n== History ==\n=== Antecedents ===\nPaper based timetables designed for manual trip  planning on public transport were developed in the 19th century, most notably by [[George Bradshaw]]  who published the [[Bradshaw's Guide]], the world's first compilation of railway timetables] in  1839. This became the definitive guide to UK railway routes and timetables, aggregating the data from the different railway companies into a common format. This served to establish both a standardised data set of stops and services,  a workflow for regularly gathering data from many different providers and updating the data set, and a market for travel information products.  Equivalent publications were developed for other countries.\n\nA theoretical basis for computer-based trip planning was provided in 1956 by Edsger W. [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] for finding the [[shortest path problem|shortest paths]] between [[vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] in a [[Graph (abstract data type)|graph]]. [[Graph theory]] itself originates from [[Euler]]'s consideration of a  route planning problem - the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]].\n\n=== Precursor systems ===\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, national railway operators such as [[British Rail]], [[Deutsche Bahn]]  and major metropolitan transit authorities  [[Transport for London|London Transport]] developed internal systems to manage data for printed timetables and to support operations. National rail operators also developed reservation systems which typically have the ability for ticket offices and retailers to find the trip available between an origin and a destination in order to book a ticket.\n\nA separate development of electronic trip planning capabilities occurred in aviation, starting somewhat earlier as part of the evolution of airline [[Computer reservation system|reservation systems]] concerned with managing airline seating inventory in real-time. The earliest of these systems [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]] was launched in 1960 by [[American Airlines]], others included Apollo ([[United Airlines]] (1972) and the rival [[Galileo CRS]]  and [[Amadeus IT Group|Amadeus]]  systems created by different European airline consortia in 1987. All were mainframe-based with remote [[OLTP]] terminals and became widely used by travel agents to find air, rail and boat journeys.\n\n=== First generation systems ===\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, some national railway operators and major metropolitan transit authorities developed  their own specialised trip planners to support their customer enquiry services. These typically ran on [[mainframes]]  and were accessed internally with terminals by their own staff in customer information centres, call centres, and at ticket counters in order to answer customer queries.  The data came from the timetable databases used  to publish printed timetables and to manage operations and  some included simple route  planning capabilities. The HAFAs timetable information system developed in 1989 by the German company  <ref name=\"hacon.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hacon.de/company/geschichte |title=History \u2014 HaCon, Fahrplanauskunft HAFAS, Fahrplankonstruktion TPS |publisher=Hacon.de |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref>  Hacon, (now part of Siemens AG) is an example of such a system and was adopted by [[Swiss Federal Railways]] (SBB) and [[Deutsche Bahn]] in 1989. The \"\"Routes\"\" system of [[London Regional Transport|London Transport, now TfL]], in use before the development of the on-line planner and covering all public transport services in London,  was another example of a mainframe OLTP journey planner and included a large database of tourist attractions and popular destinations in London.\n\n=== Second generation systems ===\nIn the 1990s with the advent of [personal computers] with sufficient memory and processor power to undertake trip planning (which is relatively expensive computationally in terms of memory and processor requirements), systems were developed that could be installed and run on minicomputers and personal computers. The first digital public transport trip planner systems for a microcomputer was developed by Eduard Tulp, an informatica student at the Amsterdam University on an [[Atari]] PC.<ref>[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/article/detail/2645851/1998/06/05/Succes-voor-het-eerste-06-nummer-zonder-hijgende-dames.dhtml Trouw, 05/06/1998]</ref>  He was hired by the [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen|Dutch Railways]] to built a digital trip  planner for the train services. In 1990 the first digital trip planner for the Dutch Railways (on diskette) was sold to be installed on PC's and computers for off-line consultation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://9292.nl/extra/175-jaar-reisinformatie# |title=175 years of travel information, chapter:Wel of geen vervoer? |language=nl |publisher=9292.nl |date=1992-09-02 |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> The principles of his software program was published in a Dutch university paper in 1991<ref>http://kinkrsoftware.nl/contrib/Artikel16b.2a/tulp.pdf, Tulp, Eduard, ''Searching time-table networks'', proefschrift [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]], 1991</ref> This was soon expanded to include all public transport in the Netherlands.\n\nAnother pioneer was Hans-Jakob Tobler in Switzerland. His product ''Finajour'', which ran for [[PC DOS]] and [[MS-DOS]] was the first electronic timetable for Switzerland.

A test web interface for HaFAs, was launched as [[Deutsche Bahn]]'s official rail trip planner in 1995 and evolved over time into the main Deutsche Bahn website. In 2001 [[Transport for London]] launched  the  world's first large-scale multimodal trip planner  for a world city  covering all of London's transport modes as well as rail routes to London; this used a trip planning engine supplied by  [https://www.mentz.net] Mentz Gmbh]  of Munich after earlier attempts in the late 1990s  to add a web interface to TfL's  own mainframe internal trip planner failed to scale.  Internet trip planners for major transport networks such as national railways and major cities must sustain very high query rates and so require software architectures optimised to sustain such traffic.  The world's first mobile trip  planner for a large metropolitan area, a WAP based interface to the London using the Mentz engine,  was launched in  2001  by London startup company [[Kizoom Ltd]] , who also launched the UK's first    rail trip planner for the mobile internet in 2000, also as a WAP service, followed by an SMS service.   Starting in 2000 the Traveline<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveline.info |title=Traveline |publisher=Traveline.info |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> service provided all parts of the UK with regional multi-modal trip planning on bus, coach, and rail.  A web-based trip planner for UK rail was  launched by UK [[National Rail Enquiries]] in 2003.\n\nEarly public transport trip planners typically required a stop or station to be specified for the endpoints. Some also supported inputting the name of a tourist attraction or other popular destination places by keeping a table of the nearest stop to the destination. This was later extended with  ability to add addresses or  coordinates to offer true point to point planning.\n\nCritical to the development of large-scale multi-modal trip planning in the late 1990s and early 2000s was the development in parallel of standards for encoding stop and schedule data from many different operators and the setting up of workflows to aggregate and distribute data on a regular basis. This is more challenging for modes such as bus and coach, where there tend to a large number of small operators than for rail, which typically involves only a few large operators who have exchange formats and processes already in place in order to operate their networks. In Europe, which has a dense and sophisticated public transport network, the  CEN [[Transmodel] Transmodel reference model for Public Transport] was developed to support the process of creating and harmonising standard formats at both a national and international level.\n\n=== Distributed journey planners ===\nIn the 2000s, Several major projects developed distributed trip planning architectures to allow the federation of separate trip planners each covering a specific area to create a composite engine covering a very large area.\n* The UK [[Transport Direct Portal]] launched in 2004 by the UK Department of Transport,  used the [[JourneyWeb]] protocol to link eight separate regional engines covering data from 140 local transport authorities in  England, Scotland and Wales as a unified engine. The portal integrated both road and public transport planners allowing a comparison between modes of travel times, C02 footprint etc..\n* The German Delfi    <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delfi.de/ |title=Was ist DELFI? &#124; DELFI |language=de |publisher=Delfi.de |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref>  project developed a distributed trip planning architecture used to federate the German regional planners, launched as a prototype in 2004. The Interface was further developed by the German TRIAS project and   led to the development  of a CEN Standard  [[<ref>[http://www.normes-donnees-tc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TC 278 WI 00278420 E-RS-170118-final3.pdf]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}</ref>|Open API for distributed journey planning']] (CEN/TS 17118:2017) published in 2017 to provide a standard interface to trip planners, incorporating features from JourneyWeb and EU-Spirit and making use of the  [[Service Interface for Real Time Information|SIRI Protocol Framework]]  and the  [[Transmodel|Transmodel reference model]].\n* The European<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eu-spirit.eu/ |title=EU-Spirit &#124; European travel information network |publisher=Eu-spirit.eu |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> EU Spirit  project developed a long-distance trip planner between a number of different European regions\n\n=== Second generation Internet systems ===\nPublic Transport trip planners proved to be immensely popular (for example by 2005 [[Deutsche Bahn]] was already sustaining <ref name=\"hacon.de\"/> 2.8 million requests per day and journey planning sites constitute some of the highest trafficked information sites in every country that has them.  The ability to purchase tickets for travel for the journeys found has further increased the utility and popularity of the sites; early implementations such as the UK's Trainline offered delivery of tickets by mail; this has been complemented in most European countries by self-service print and mobile fulfillment methods. Internet trip planners now constitute a primary sales channel for most rail and air transport operators.\n\n[[Google]] started to add trip planning capabilities to its product set with a version of Google Transit in 2005,  covering trips in the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] region, as described by the [[TriMet]]  agency manager <ref>{{cite web|author=Bibiana McHugh |url=http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-2/pioneering-open-data-standards-the-gtfs-story/ |title=Pioneering Open Data Standards: The GTFS Story |publisher=Beyondtransparency.org |date=2005-12-07 |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> Bibiana McHugh. This led to the development of the [[General Transit Feed Specification]] (GTFS), a format for collecting transit data for use in trip planners that has been highly influential in developing an ecosystem of PT data feeds covering many different countries.  The successful uptake of GTFS as an available output format by large operators in many countries has allowed Google to extend its trip planner coverage to many more regions around the world. The Google Transit trip planning capabilities were integrated into the Google Map product in 2012.\n\nFurther evolution of trip planning engines has seen the integration of real time data so that trip plans for the immediate future take into account real time delays and disruptions.  The UK  [[National Rail|National Rail Enquiries]] added real time to its rail trip planner in 2007. Also significant has been the integration of other types of data into the trip planning results such as disruption notices, crowding levels, Co2 costs, etc. The trip planners of some major metropolitan cities such as the [[Transport for London]] trip planner have the ability to dynamically suspend individual stations and whole lines so that modified trip plans are produced during major disruptions that omit the unavailable parts of the network.    Another development has been the addition of accessibility data and the ability for algorithms to optimise plans to take into account the requirements of specific disabilities such as wheelchair access.\n\nFor the London 2012 Olympics, an enhanced London trip planner was created that allowed the proposed trip results to be biased to manage available capacity across different routes, spreading traffic to less congested routes. Another innovation was the detailed modelling of all the access paths into and out of every Olympic venue, (from PT stop to individual arena entrance)  with predicted and actual queueing times to allow for security checks and other delays being factored into the recommended travel times.\n\nAn initiative to develop an open source trip planner, the   <ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/History/ |title=OpenTripPlanner |publisher=Docs.opentripplanner.org |date=2016-09-09 |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> [[Open Trip Planner]]  was seeded by Portland, Oregon's transit agency [[TriMet]] in 2009 and developed with the participation of agencies and operators in the US and Europe; a full version 1.0 released in September 2016, is making it possible for smaller transit agencies and operators to provide trip planning without paying proprietary licence fees.\n\n=== Mobile applications ===\nThe usability of mobile internet trip planners was transformed by the launch of the [[Apple iPhone]]  in 2007. The iPhone and similar smartphone such as Android allowed more intelligence to be placed in the client as well offering a larger format and maps and so much more usable interfaces could be created. The incorporation of the current spatial location from the mobile device's GPS also simplified some interactions. The first iPhone App for UK rail trip planning was launched by UK Startup [[Kizoom Ltd]]  in 2008 and a large market for trip planning and travel information applications has subsequently developed around the world, with applications being provided both by transport operators and third parties. In the UK this was greatly facilitated by the open data policy of [[Transport for London]] which made its trip planning engine and other data feeds available to third party developers.\n\nAdvanced mobile applications such as [[Citymapper]] now integrate multiple types of data feed including trip planning for cities in every continent and give the user a uniform interface regardless of the country or city they are in.\n\n==Mode-specific considerations==\n=== Public transport routing ===\nA public transport route planner is an [[intermodal journey planner|intermodal]] journey planner, typically accessed via the [[web application|web]] that provides information about available [[public transport]] services. The application prompts a user to input an origin and a destination, and then uses algorithms to find a good route between the two on public transit services. Time of travel may be constrained to either time of departure or arrival and other routing  preferences may be specified as well.\n\nAn intermodal journey planner supports [[Intermodal passenger transport|intermodal journeys]] i.e. using more than one [[modes of transport]], such as cycling, [[rapid transit]], [[bus]], [[ferry]], etc. Many route planners support door-to-door planning while others only work between stops on the [[transport network]], such as stations, [[airport]]s or [[bus stop]]s.\n\nFor public transport routing the trip planner is constrained by times of arrival or departure. It may also support different optimisation criteria \u2013 for example, ''fastest route, fewest changes, most accessible''.   Optimisation by price (''cheapest, \"most flexible fare'', etc.) is usually done by a separate algorithm or engine,  though trip planners that can return fare prices for the trips they find may also offer sorting or filtering of results by price and product type.  For long-distance rail and air trip planning, where price is a significant consideration in price optimising trip planners may suggest the cheapest dates to travel for customers are flexible as to travel time.\n\n=== Car routing ===\nThe planning of road legs is sometimes done by a separate subsystem within a journey planner, but may consider both single mode trip calculations as well as intermodal scenarios (e.g. [[Park and Ride]], [[kiss and ride]], etc.). Typical optimisations for [[car routing]] are ''shortest route'', ''fastest route'', ''cheapest route'' and with constraints for specific ''waypoints.'' Some advanced journey planners can take into account average journey times on road sections, or even real-time predicted average journey times on road sections.\n\n=== Pedestrian routing ===\nA journey planner will ideally provide detailed routing for pedestrian access to stops, stations, points of interest etc. This will include options to take into account accessibility requirements for different types of users, for example; 'no steps', 'wheelchair access', 'no lifts', etc.\n\n=== Bicycle routing ===\nSome journey planning systems can calculate bicycle routes,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Yoon|first=Ji Won|last2=Pinelli|first2=Fabio|last3=Calabrese|first3=Francesco|date=2012|title=Cityride: A Predictive Bike Sharing Journey Advisor|journal=Mobile Data Management (MDM), 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference|volume=|pages=306\u2013311|doi=10.1109/MDM.2012.16|isbn=978-1-4673-1796-2}}</ref> integrating all paths accessible by bicycle and often including additional information like topography, traffic, on-street cycling infrastructure, etc. These systems assume, or allow the user to specify, preferences for quiet or safe roads, minimal elevation change, [[Cycling infrastructure|bicycle lanes]], etc.\n\n== Data requirements ==\nTrip planners depend on a number of different types of data and the quality and extent of this data limits their capability.  Some trip planners integrate many different kinds of data from numerous sources. Others may work with one mode only, such as flight itineraries between airports, or using only addresses and the street network for driving directions.\n\n=== Contextual data ===\n==== Point of interest data ====\nPassengers don't travel because they want to go to a particular station or stop, but because they want to go some destination of interest, such as a sports arena, tourist attraction, shopping centre, park, law court, etc., etc.  Many trip planners allow users to look for such \"Points of interest\", either by name or by category (''museum, stadium, prison,'' etc.). Data sets of systematically named, geocoded and categorized popular destinations can be obtained commercially, for example, The UK  PointX  <ref>{{cite web|author=Martin Webb |url=http://www.pointx.co.uk/ |title=Welcome |publisher=PointX |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> data set, or derived from opensource data sets such as [[Open Street Map]]. Major operators such as [[Transport for London]] or [[National Rail]] have historically had well developed sets of such data for use in their Customer Call centres, along with information on the links to the nearest stops.  For points of interest that cover a large area, such as parks, country houses or stadia, a precise geocoding of the entrances is important.\n\n==== Gazetteer data ====\nTrip planning user interfaces can be made more usable by integration of [[Gazetteer]] data. This can be associated with stops to assist with stop finding in particular, for example for disambiguation; there are 33 places named Newport in the US and 14 in the UK - a Gazetteer can be used to distinguish which is which and also in some cases to indicate the relationship of transport interchanges with towns and urban centres that passengers are trying to reach - for example only one of London's five or so Airports is actually in London. Data for this purpose typically comes from additional layers in a map data set such as that provided by [[Esri]], [[Ordnance Survey]], [[Navtech]],  or specific data sets such as the UK [[National Public Transport Gazetteer]].\n\n=== Road data ===\n==== Road network data ====\nRoad trip planners, sometimes referred to as route planners, use street and footpath network data to compute a route using simply the network connectivity (i.e. trips may run at any time and not constrained by a timetable). Such data can come from one or more public, commercial or crowdsourced datasets such as [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]], [[Esri]] or [[OpenStreetMap]].  The data is fundamental both for computing access legs to reach public transport stops, and to compute road trips in their own right. The fundamental representation is a graph of nodes and edges (i.e. points and links).  The data may be further annotated to assist trip planning for different modes;\n* Road data may be characterised by road type (highway, major road, minor road, track, etc.),  turn restrictions,  speed restrictions etc., as well as average travel times at different times of day on different day types (''Weekday, Weekend, Public Holiday,'' etc.), so that accurate travel time predictions can be offered\n* Cycle road and path data may be annotated with characteristics such as cycle route number,  traffic levels, surface, lighting, etc. that affect its usability by cyclists.\n* Footpath data may be annotated with accessibility characteristics such as steps, lifts, wheelchair access, ramps, etc., etc., and also safety indicators (e.g., lighting, [[CCTV]], help points, ) so that accessibility constrained trip plans can be computed.\n\n==== Real-time data for roads ====\nAdvanced road trip planners take into account the real-time state of the network.  They use two main types of feed to do this, obtained from road data services using interfaces such as  [[Datex II]] or  [[Urban Traffic Management and Control|UTMC]].\n* Situation data, which described the incidents, events and planned roadworks in a structured form that can be related to the network; this is used to decorate trip plans and road maps to show current bottlenecks and incident locations.\n*Link traffic flow data, which gives a quantitative measurement of the current flow on each link of the network that is monitored; this can be used to take actual current conditions into account when computing predicted journey times.\n\n=== Public transport data ===\nFor transit route planners to work, transit schedule data must always be kept up to date. To facilitate data exchange and interoperability between different trip planners, several standard data formats have emerged.\n\nThe [[General Transit Feed Specification]], developed in 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-2/pioneering-open-data-standards-the-gtfs-story/|title=Pioneering Open Data Standards: The GTFS Story|website=beyondtransparency.org|access-date=2017-05-10}}</ref> is now used by hundreds of transit agencies around the world.\n\nIn the European Union all public passenger travel operators have the obligation to provide the information under the EU railway timetable data exchange format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netex-cen.eu/ |title=NeTEx |publisher=Netex-cen.eu |date=2014-03-18 |accessdate=2018-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=SOA architecture for complying with EU railway timetable data exchange format (link in chapter Pr\u00e4sentationen) |volume=2 |pages=630\u2013631 |publisher=Ieeexplore.ieee.org |date= October 2011|doi=10.1109/TELSKS.2011.6143191 |chapter=SOA architecture for complying with EU railway timetable data exchange format |last1=Branovic |first1=Irina |last2=Veskovic |first2=Slavko |last3=Mladenovic |first3=Snezana |last4=Milinkovic |first4=Sanjin |last5=Jankovic |first5=Sladjana |isbn=978-1-4577-2019-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gip.gv.at/downloads-219.html?...Transnational%20exchang |title=Transnational exchange of timetable and GIS data as a basis for cross-border ITS services |publisher=Gip.gv.at |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}</ref> In other parts of the world there similar exchange standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.nl/search?q=timetable+data+exchange&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b&gfe_rd=cr&ei=6FRpWN3BIeiD3gPJpZJQ |title=Transit Schedule Data Exchange Architecture |publisher=Google.nl |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Stop data ====\nThe location and identity of Public transport access points such as bus, tram and coach stops, stations, airports, ferry landing and ports are fundamental to trip planning and a stop data set is an essential layer of the transport data infrastructure. In order to integrate stops with spatial searches and road routing engines they are [[Geocoding|geocoded]]. In order to integrate them with the timetables and routes they are given a unique identifier within the transport network.  In order to be recognizable to passengers they are given official names and may also have a public short code (for example the three letter [[IATA]] codes for airports)  to use in interfaces.   Historically, different operators quite often used a different identifier for the same stop and stop numbers were not unique within a country or even a region.  Systems for  managing stop data, such as the  [[International Union of Railways|International Union of Railways (UIC)]] station location code set or the  UK's  [[NaPTAN|NaPTAN (National Public Transport Access Point)]] system  for stop numbers provide a means of ensuring numbers are unique and the stops are fully described,   greatly facilitate the integration of data.   Timetable exchange formats, such as [[GTFS]], [[TransXChange]] or [[NeTEx]] include  stop data in their  formats  and spatial data sets such as   [[OpenStreetMap]] allow stop identifiers to be geocoded.\n\n==== Public transport network topology data ====\nFor public transport networks with a very high frequency of service, such as urban metro cities and inner city bus services, the topology of the network can also be used for route planning,  with an average interval being assumed rather than specific departure times.  Data on the routes of trains and buses is also useful for providing visualisation of results, for example, to plot the route of a train on a map.  National mapping bodies, such as the UK's [[Ordnance Survey]] typically include a Transport layer in their data sets and the European [[Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community|INSPIRE]] framework includes public transport infrastructure links in its set of strategic digital data.  The CEN [[NeTEx]] format  allows both the physical layer (e.g. road and railway track infrastructure links)  and the logical layer (e.g. links between scheduled stopping points on a given line)  of the transport infrastructure to be exchanged\n\n=== Public transport timetables ===\nData on public transport schedules is used by trip planners to determine the available journeys at specific times. Historically rail data has been widely available in national formats, and many countries also have bus and other mode data in national formats such as [[Association of German Transport Companies|VDV 452]] (Germany),  [[TransXChange]] (UK) and Neptune (France). Schedule data is also increasingly becoming available in international formats such as  [[General Transit Feed Specification|GTFS]] and [[NeTEx]]. To allow a route to be projected onto a map,  GTFS allows the specification of a simple shape plot; whilst [[Transmodel]] based standards such as CEN [[NeTEx]], [[TransXChange]] additionally allow  a more detailed representation which can recognize the constituent links and distinguish several different semantic layers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Real-time prediction information for Public Transport ===\nTrip planners may be able to incorporate real-time information into their database and consider them in the selection of optimal routes for travel in the immediate future. [[Automatic Vehicle Location|Automatic vehicle location]] (AVL) systems <ref name=\":2\" /> monitor the position of vehicles using [[Global Positioning System|GPS systems]] and can pass on real-time and forecast information to the journey planning system.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Jing-Quan|last2=Zhou|first2=Kun|last3=Zhang|first3=Liping|last4=Zhang|first4=Wei-Bin|date=2012-04-01|title=A Multimodal Trip Planning System With Real-Time Traffic and Transit Information|journal=Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems|volume=16|issue=2|pages=60\u201369|doi=10.1080/15472450.2012.671708|issn=1547-2450}}</ref> A trip planner may use a real time interface such as the CEN [[Service Interface for Real Time Information]] to obtain this data.\n\n=== Situation information ===\nA situation is a software representation of an incident{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} or event that is affecting or is likely to affect the transport network. A trip planner can integrate situation information and use it both to revise its trip planning computations and to annotate its responses so as to inform users through both text and map representations. A trip planner will typically use a standard interface such as [[Service Interface for Real Time Information|SIRI]], [[TPEG]] or [[Datex II]] to obtain situation information.\n\nIncidents are captured through an [[Incident Capturing System|incident capturing system]] (ICS) by different operators and stakeholders, for example in transport operator control rooms, by broadcasters or by the emergency services. Text and image information can be combined with the trip result. Recent incidents can be considered within the routing as well as visualized in an interactive map.\n\n== Technology ==\n\nTypically journey planners use an efficient in-memory representation of the network and timetable to allow the rapid searching of a large number of paths. Database queries may also be used where the number of nodes needed to compute a journey is small, and to access ancillary information relating to the journey. A single engine may contain the entire transport network, and its schedules, or may allow the [[Distributed computing|distributed computation]] of journeys using a distributed journey planning protocol such as [[JourneyWeb]] or [[Delfi Protocol]]. A journey planning engine may be accessed by different front ends, using a software protocol or [[Application Program Interface|application program interface]] specialised for journey queries, to provide a [[User Interface|user interface]] on different types of device.\n\nThe development of journey planning engines has gone hand in hand with the development of data standards for representing the stops, routes and timetables of the network, such as [[TransXChange]], [[NaPTAN]], [[Transmodel]] or [[General Transit Feed Specification|GTFS]] that ensure that these fit together. Journey planning algorithms are a classic example of problems in the field of [[Computational complexity theory]]. Real-world implementations involve a tradeoff of computational resources between accuracy, completeness of the answer, and the time required for calculation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe sub-problem of route planning is an easier problem to solve<ref>{{Cite book|title=Algorithmics of Large and Complex Networks|last=Delling|first=Daniel|last2=Sanders|first2=Peter|last3=Schultes|first3=Dominik|last4=Wagner|first4=Dorothea|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642020933|editor-last=Lerner|editor-first=J\u00fcrgen|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|location=|pages=117\u2013139|language=en|chapter=Engineering Route Planning Algorithms|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-02094-0_7|editor-last2=Wagner|editor-first2=Dorothea|editor-last3=Zweig|editor-first3=Katharina A.|citeseerx = 10.1.1.164.8916}}</ref> as it generally involves less data and fewer constraints. However, with the development of \"road timetables\", associating different journey times for road links at different times of day, time of travel is increasingly relevant for route planners as well.\n\n=== Algorithms ===\nJourney planners use a [[Routing|routing algorithm]] to search a [[Graph (data structure)|graph]] representing the transport network. In the simplest case where routing is independent of time, the graph uses (directed) [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] to represent street/path segments and [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] to represent [[Intersection (road)|intersections]]. Routing on such a graph can be accomplished effectively using any of a number of routing algorithms such as [[Dijkstra's algorithm|Dijkstra's]], [[A* search algorithm|A*]], [[Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm|Floyd-Warshall]], or [[Johnson's algorithm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.pgrouting.org/2.0/en/src/index.html#routing-functions|title=Routing Functions \u2014 pgRouting Manual (2.0.0)|website=docs.pgrouting.org|access-date=2017-05-13}}</ref> Different weightings such as distance, cost or accessibility may be associated with each edge, and sometimes with nodes.\n\nWhen time-dependent features such as public transit are included, there are several proposed ways of representing the transport network as a graph and different algorithms may be used such as RAPTOR<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Delling|first=Daniel|last2=Pajor|first2=Thomas|last3=Werneck|first3=Renato F.|date=2014-10-30|title=Round-Based Public Transit Routing|journal=Transportation Science|volume=49|issue=3|pages=591\u2013604|doi=10.1287/trsc.2014.0534|issn=0041-1655|citeseerx=10.1.1.652.775}}</ref>\n\n=== Automated trip planner ===\nAutomated trip planners generate your [[Travel itinerary|itinerary]] automatically, based on the information you provide.

Trip or journey planning, in contrast, would make use of at least one [[public transport]] mode which operates according to [[Public transport timetable|published schedules]]; given that public transport services only depart at specific times (unlike private transport which may leave at any time), an algorithm must therefore not only find a path to a destination, but seek to optimise it so as to minimise the  waiting time incurred for each leg. In European Standards such as [[Transmodel]], trip planning is used specifically to describe the planning of a route for a passenger, to avoid confusion with the completely separate process of planning the operational journeys to be made by public transport vehicles on which such trips are made.\n\nTrip planners have been widely used in the [[travel industry]] since the 1970s, by booking agents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveltecnik.com/2007/12/history-of-global-distribution-systems.html |title=TravelTecnik Consultants - Travel & Hospitality Technology: History of Global Distribution Systems (GDS) |website=Traveltecnik.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> The growth of the [[Internet]], the proliferation of [[Geographic data and information|geospatial data]], and the development of [[Information technology|information technologies]] generally has led to the rapid development of many self-service app or [[Web browser|browser-based]], on-line [[Intermodal journey planner|intermodal]] trip planners such as [[Citymapper]], [[Door2Door]], [[FromAtoB.com]], [[Google Maps]], [https://www.omio.com Omio], and [[Rome2rio]].\n\nA trip planner may be used in conjunction with ticketing and reservation systems.\n\n== Basic features ==\nJourney planners, also known as trip planners,  comprise a front end user interface to gather travel requirements from the user and  present the proposed travel itineraries back to them, and a back end journey planning engine which performs the actual computation of the  possible trip plans, prioritising these according to the user's optimisation criteria (''fastest, fewest changes, cheapest'', etc.) and returning a subset that best satisfy them.  The user interface may run on a terminal, PC, tablet,  mobile device or even be speech based and may integrate maps and location data to give a visualisation of the trip or to simplify the interaction with the user.  The journey planning engine may be either local or remote and may have either a monolithic (all the data in a single search space)  or a distributed architecture (the data for different regions split among different engines, each with their own search space).\n\nSimple engines cover only public transport data for a single mode, others are multimodal, covering public transport data for several modes; advanced intermodal engines may also   include road and footpath routing to cover the access legs to reach the public transport stops and also simultaneously compute routes for travel by private car so that the user may make a comparison between public and private modes.  Advanced trip planners may also make use of real-time data to improve their results; this use may be decorative, annotating the results with information about known incidents that might affect the trip, or computational, dynamically using the predicted departure and arrival times from a real-time feed such as the CEN [[Service Interface for Real Time Information]] to give more accurate trip plans for trips taking place in the near future.   The capabilities of the back-end engine limit what may be offered in the user interface. The available data limits the capabilities of the back-end engine.\n\n=== Inputs ===\nThe minimum inputs to a trip planner are an origin and destination place and a  date and time of travel (which can be defaulted to the current moment).  The interface may provide various methods to discover and specify an origin or destination, including specifying  the name of a  [[Geocoding|geocoded place]], a stop or station code, a [[Address (geography)|street address]],  a point of interest (that is, a tourist attraction or other  named common destination) or  a [[Spatial reference system|spatial coordinate]]  (usually specified by using an interactive  [[Web Map Service|web map]] - current locations can also be obtained from a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location service or from an IP address lookup).   A location finding function of the trip planner will typically first resolve the origin and destination into the nearest known nodes on the transport network in order to compute a trip plan over its data set of known public transport journeys.\n\nDepending on the journey planning engine and the data sets which are available to it, many other additional inputs may be supported, for example:\n* Which [[Mode of transport|transport modes]] to include or exclude.\n* Whether to constrain the time of travel by arrival time, departure time - or to allow a  flexible window within which travel may be undertaken.\n* Any preferred routing for the trip via intermediate stop points.\n* Trip optimisation preferences:  for example ''the shortest trip''  versus ''the fewest changes''.\n* Trip cost optimisation preferences: for example, ''the cheapest''  versus ''the most convenient''.\n* Accessibility preferences: ''step free, wheelchair accessible'', etc., and whether to allow extra time for connections.\n* Access preferences: how long the user is prepared to walk to a stop, etc.\n* Class of travel and desired on-board facilities.\n* Congestion preferences : ''least crowded '' versus ''shortest trip '', etc.\n* Information relevant for selecting fares and the cheapest option: the type of user (''adult, child, senior, student,'' etc.),  ownership of travel cards, etc.\n* etc.\n\n=== Outputs ===\nAfter the trip planner has computed and prioritised a trip or set of possible trips, these are presented to the user as a list for the user to choose from, they may also or instead be displayed on a map. Again, depending on the capabilities of the planner and the available data, the results may include;\n* The times and departure points of trips from stops or stations, possibly with the exact platform to use and even the boarding point on the platform.\n* Trip maps showing the path of the trip legs on a map.\n* Route maps showing the network topology.\n* Stop area maps and other directions to identify the location of the stops at the boarding and alighting points.\n* Information about the heading signs shown on the vehicle in order to identify the correct transport vehicle to take.\n* Information on the transfer times needed to make the access and connection legs.\n* Step by step directions in order to follow an access leg to a stop, enter a station or large interchange such as an airport, or make a transfer on a connection leg, including the accessibility characteristics of each step.\n* Information on the accessibility characteristics of the vehicles on specific legs (''wheelchair hoist, wheelchair spaces'', etc.).\n* Information on the at-stop and on-board facilities (''parking, buffet car, wifi,'' etc.).\n* Information on disruption or delays expected on specific trip legs or modes.\n* Information on available fares for the trip.\n\n=== Additional features ===\nSome trip planners integrate information services other than point-to-point [https://www.productsreviewzone.com/vacation-planning/ trip planning] into their user interface, for example to provide timetables for routes,  real-time arrivals and departures at stops, or real-time disruption notices.   Additional visualisations may be offered;  Google, for example, has a [[Gantt chart]] like 'Schedule explorer' that can be used to visualise the relative timings of different trip plans.  Another powerful visualisation is the [[Isochrone map]] which shows relative travel times as relative distances.\n\nA trip  planner may also have more than one [[user interfaces|user interface]], with each optimised for different purposes. For example, online self-service done with a [[Web browser]], an interface for [[call centre]] agents, one for use on mobile devices, or special interfaces for visually impaired users.\n\nSome commercial trip planners include aspects of [[discovery shopping]] for accommodation and activities and [[price comparison]] for some aspects of a trip.\n\n== History ==\n=== Antecedents ===\nPaper based timetables designed for manual trip  planning on public transport were developed in the 19th century, most notably by [[George Bradshaw]]  who published the [[Bradshaw's Guide]], the world's first compilation of railway timetables] in  1839. This became the definitive guide to UK railway routes and timetables, aggregating the data from the different railway companies into a common format. This served to establish both a standardised data set of stops and services,  a workflow for regularly gathering data from many different providers and updating the data set, and a market for travel information products.  Equivalent publications were developed for other countries.\n\nA theoretical basis for computer-based trip planning was provided in 1956 by Edsger W. [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] for finding the [[shortest path problem|shortest paths]] between [[vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] in a [[Graph (abstract data type)|graph]]. [[Graph theory]] itself originates from [[Euler]]'s consideration of a  route planning problem - the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]].\n\n=== Precursor systems ===\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, national railway operators such as [[British Rail]], [[Deutsche Bahn]]  and major metropolitan transit authorities  [[Transport for London|London Transport]] developed internal systems to manage data for printed timetables and to support operations. National rail operators also developed reservation systems which typically have the ability for ticket offices and retailers to find the trip available between an origin and a destination in order to book a ticket.\n\nA separate development of electronic trip planning capabilities occurred in aviation, starting somewhat earlier as part of the evolution of airline [[Computer reservation system|reservation systems]] concerned with managing airline seating inventory in real-time. The earliest of these systems [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]] was launched in 1960 by [[American Airlines]], others included Apollo ([[United Airlines]] (1972) and the rival [[Galileo CRS]]  and [[Amadeus IT Group|Amadeus]]  systems created by different European airline consortia in 1987. All were mainframe-based with remote [[OLTP]] terminals and became widely used by travel agents to find air, rail and boat journeys.\n\n=== First generation systems ===\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, some national railway operators and major metropolitan transit authorities developed  their own specialised trip planners to support their customer enquiry services. These typically ran on [[mainframes]]  and were accessed internally with terminals by their own staff in customer information centres, call centres, and at ticket counters in order to answer customer queries.  The data came from the timetable databases used  to publish printed timetables and to manage operations and  some included simple route  planning capabilities. The HAFAs timetable information system developed in 1989 by the German company  <ref name=\"hacon.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hacon.de/company/geschichte |title=History \u2014 HaCon, Fahrplanauskunft HAFAS, Fahrplankonstruktion TPS |publisher=Hacon.de |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref>  Hacon, (now part of Siemens AG) is an example of such a system and was adopted by [[Swiss Federal Railways]] (SBB) and [[Deutsche Bahn]] in 1989. The \"\"Routes\"\" system of [[London Regional Transport|London Transport, now TfL]], in use before the development of the on-line planner and covering all public transport services in London,  was another example of a mainframe OLTP journey planner and included a large database of tourist attractions and popular destinations in London.\n\n=== Second generation systems ===\nIn the 1990s with the advent of [personal computers] with sufficient memory and processor power to undertake trip planning (which is relatively expensive computationally in terms of memory and processor requirements), systems were developed that could be installed and run on minicomputers and personal computers. The first digital public transport trip planner systems for a microcomputer was developed by Eduard Tulp, an informatica student at the Amsterdam University on an [[Atari]] PC.<ref>[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/article/detail/2645851/1998/06/05/Succes-voor-het-eerste-06-nummer-zonder-hijgende-dames.dhtml Trouw, 05/06/1998]</ref>  He was hired by the [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen|Dutch Railways]] to built a digital trip  planner for the train services. In 1990 the first digital trip planner for the Dutch Railways (on diskette) was sold to be installed on PC\u00b4s and computers for off-line consultation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://9292.nl/extra/175-jaar-reisinformatie# |title=175 years of travel information, chapter:Wel of geen vervoer? |language=nl |publisher=9292.nl |date=1992-09-02 |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> The principles of his software program was published in a Dutch university paper in 1991<ref>http://kinkrsoftware.nl/contrib/Artikel16b.2a/tulp.pdf, Tulp, Eduard, ''Searching time-table networks'', proefschrift [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]], 1991</ref> This was soon expanded to include all public transport in the Netherlands.\n\nAnother pioneer was Hans-Jakob Tobler in Switzerland. His product ''Finajour'', which ran for [[PC DOS]] and [[MS-DOS]] was the first electronic timetable for Switzerland. The first published version was sold for the timetable period 1989/1990.<ref name=\"TA\">Tages-Anzeiger, 14 February 2009, p. 14, ''Hans-Jakob Tobler gestorben''.

Inzwischen wurden gut tausend Exemplare zu einem St\u00fcckpreis von hundert Franken verkauft.''\u00bb)</ref> Other European countries soon followed with their own journey planners.\n\nA further development of this trend was  to deploy trip planners onto even smaller platforms such as mobile devices,  a [[Windows CE]] version of Hafas was launched in  1998   compressing the application and  the entire railway timetable of Deutsche Bahn into six megabytes and running as a stand-alone application.\n\n=== Early Internet-based systems ===\nThe development of the internet allowed HTML based user interfaces to be added to allow direct querying of trip planning systems by the general public. A test web interface for HaFAs, was launched as [[Deutsche Bahn]]'s official rail trip planner in 1995 and evolved over time into the main Deutsche Bahn website. In 2001 [[Transport for London]] launched  the  world's first large-scale multimodal trip planner  for a world city  covering all of London's transport modes as well as rail routes to London; this used a trip planning engine supplied by  [https://www.mentz.net] Mentz Gmbh]  of Munich after earlier attempts in the late 1990s  to add a web interface to TfL's  own mainframe internal trip planner failed to scale.  Internet trip planners for major transport networks such as national railways and major cities must sustain very high query rates and so require software architectures optimised to sustain such traffic.  The world's first mobile trip  planner for a large metropolitan area, a WAP based interface to the London using the Mentz engine,  was launched in  2001  by London startup company [[Kizoom Ltd]] , who also launched the UK's first    rail trip planner for the mobile internet in 2000, also as a WAP service, followed by an SMS service.   Starting in 2000 the Traveline<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveline.info |title=Traveline |publisher=Traveline.info |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> service provided all parts of the UK with regional multi-modal trip planning on bus, coach, and rail.  A web-based trip planner for UK rail was  launched by UK [[National Rail Enquiries]] in 2003.\n\nEarly public transport trip planners typically required a stop or station to be specified for the endpoints. Some also supported inputting the name of a tourist attraction or other popular destination places by keeping a table of the nearest stop to the destination. This was later extended with  ability to add addresses or  coordinates to offer true point to point planning.\n\nCritical to the development of large-scale multi-modal trip planning in the late 1990s and early 2000s was the development in parallel of standards for encoding stop and schedule data from many different operators and the setting up of workflows to aggregate and distribute data on a regular basis. This is more challenging for modes such as bus and coach, where there tend to a large number of small operators than for rail, which typically involves only a few large operators who have exchange formats and processes already in place in order to operate their networks. In Europe, which has a dense and sophisticated public transport network, the  CEN [[Transmodel] Transmodel reference model for Public Transport] was developed to support the process of creating and harmonising standard formats at both a national and international level.\n\n=== Distributed journey planners ===\nIn the 2000s, Several major projects developed distributed trip planning architectures to allow the federation of separate trip planners each covering a specific area to create a composite engine covering a very large area.\n* The UK [[Transport Direct Portal]] launched in 2004 by the UK Department of Transport,  used the [[JourneyWeb]] protocol to link eight separate regional engines covering data from 140 local transport authorities in  England, Scotland and Wales as a unified engine. The portal integrated both road and public transport planners allowing a comparison between modes of travel times, C02 footprint etc..\n* The German Delfi    <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delfi.de/ |title=Was ist DELFI? &#124; DELFI |language=de |publisher=Delfi.de |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref>  project developed a distributed trip planning architecture used to federate the German regional planners, launched as a prototype in 2004. The Interface was further developed by the German TRIAS project and   led to the development  of a CEN Standard  [[<ref>[http://www.normes-donnees-tc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TC 278 WI 00278420 E-RS-170118-final3.pdf]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}</ref>|Open API for distributed journey planning']] (CEN/TS 17118:2017) published in 2017 to provide a standard interface to trip planners, incorporating features from JourneyWeb and EU-Spirit and making use of the  [[Service Interface for Real Time Information|SIRI Protocol Framework]]  and the  [[Transmodel|Transmodel reference model]].\n* The European<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eu-spirit.eu/ |title=EU-Spirit &#124; European travel information network |publisher=Eu-spirit.eu |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> EU Spirit  project developed a long distance trip planner between a number of different European regions\n\n=== Second generation Internet systems ===\nPublic Transport trip planners proved to be immensely popular (for example by 2005 [[Deutsche Bahn]] was already sustaining <ref name=\"hacon.de\"/> 2.8 million requests per day and journey planning sites constitute some of the highest trafficked information sites in every country that has them.  The ability to purchase tickets for travel for the journeys found has further increased the utility and popularity of the sites; early implementations such as the UK's Trainline offered delivery of tickets by mail; this has been complemented in most European countries by self-service print and mobile fulfillment methods. Internet trip planners now constitute a primary sales channel for most rail and air transport operators.\n\n[[Google]] started to add trip planning capabilities to its product set with a version of Google Transit in 2005,  covering trips in the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] region, as described by the [[TriMet]]  agency manager <ref>{{cite web|author=Bibiana McHugh |url=http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-2/pioneering-open-data-standards-the-gtfs-story/ |title=Pioneering Open Data Standards: The GTFS Story |publisher=Beyondtransparency.org |date=2005-12-07 |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> Bibiana McHugh. This led to the development of the [[General Transit Feed Specification]] (GTFS), a format for collecting transit data for use in trip planners that has been highly influential in developing an ecosystem of PT data feeds covering many different countries.  The successful uptake of GTFS as an available output format by large operators in many countries has allowed Google to extend its trip planner coverage to many more regions around the world. The Google Transit trip planning capabilities were integrated into the Google Map product in 2012.\n\nFurther evolution of trip planning engines has seen the integration of real time data so that trip plans for the immediate future take into account real time delays and disruptions.  The UK  [[National Rail|National Rail Enquiries]] added real time to its rail trip planner in 2007. Also significant has been the integration of other types of data into the trip planning results such as disruption notices, crowding levels, Co2 costs, etc. The trip planners of some major metropolitan cities such as the [[Transport for London]] trip planner have the ability to dynamically suspend individual stations and whole lines so that modified trip plans are produced during major disruptions that omit the unavailable parts of the network.    Another development has been the addition of accessibility data and the ability for algorithms to optimise plans to take into account the requirements of specific disabilities such as wheelchair access.\n\nFor the London 2012 Olympics, an enhanced London trip planner was created that allowed the proposed trip results to be biased to manage available capacity across different routes, spreading traffic to less congested routes. Another innovation was the detailed modelling of all the access paths into and out of every Olympic venue, (from PT stop to individual arena entrance)  with predicted and actual queueing times to allow for security checks and other delays being factored into the recommended travel times.\n\nAn initiative to develop an open source trip planner, the   <ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/History/ |title=OpenTripPlanner |publisher=Docs.opentripplanner.org |date=2016-09-09 |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> [[Open Trip Planner]]  was seeded by Portland, Oregon's transit agency [[TriMet]] in 2009 and developed with the participation of agencies and operators in the USA and Europe; a full version 1.0 released in September 2016, is making it possible for smaller transit agencies and operators to provide trip planning without paying proprietary licence fees.\n\n=== Mobile applications ===\nThe usability of mobile internet trip planners was transformed by the launch of the [[Apple iPhone]]  in 2007. The iPhone and similar smartphone such as Android allowed more intelligence to be placed in the client as well offering a larger format and maps and so much more usable interfaces could be created. The incorporation of the current spatial location from the mobile device's GPS also simplified some interactions. The first iPhone App for UK rail trip planning was launched by UK Startup [[Kizoom Ltd]]  in 2008 and a large market for trip planning and travel information applications has subsequently developed around the world, with applications being provided both by transport operators and third parties. In the UK this was greatly facilitated by the open data policy of [[Transport for London]] which made its trip planning engine and other data feeds available to third party developers.\n\nAdvanced mobile applications such as [[Citymapper]] now integrate multiple types of data feed including trip planning for cities in every continent and give the user a uniform interface regardless of the country or city they are in.\n\n==Mode-specific considerations==\n=== Public transport routing ===\nA public transport route planner is an [[intermodal journey planner|intermodal]] journey planner, typically accessed via the [[web application|web]] that provides information about available [[public transport]] services. The application prompts a user to input an origin and a destination, and then uses algorithms to find a good route between the two on public transit services. Time of travel may be constrained to either time of departure or arrival and other routing  preferences may be specified as well.\n\nAn intermodal journey planner supports [[Intermodal passenger transport|intermodal journeys]] i.e. using more than one [[modes of transport]], such as cycling, [[rapid transit]], [[bus]], [[ferry]], etc. Many route planners support door-to-door planning while others only work between stops on the [[transport network]], such as stations, [[airport]]s or [[bus stop]]s.\n\nFor public transport routing the trip planner is constrained by times of arrival or departure. It may also support different optimisation criteria \u2013 for example, ''fastest route, fewest changes, most accessible''.   Optimisation by price (''cheapest, \"most flexible fare'', etc.) is usually done by a separate algorithm or engine,  though trip planners that can return fare prices for the trips they find may also offer sorting or filtering of results by price and product type.  For long distance rail and air trip planning, where price is a significant consideration in price optimising trip planners may suggest the cheapest dates to travel for customers are flexible as to travel time.\n\n=== Car routing ===\nThe planning of road legs is sometimes done by a separate subsystem within a journey planner, but may consider both single mode trip calculations as well as intermodal scenarios (e.g. [[Park and Ride]], [[kiss and ride]], etc.). Typical optimisations for [[car routing]] are ''shortest route'', ''fastest route'', ''cheapest route'' and with constraints for specific ''waypoints.'' Some advanced journey planners can take into account average journey times on road sections, or even real-time predicted average journey times on road sections.\n\n=== Pedestrian routing ===\nA journey planner will ideally provide detailed routing for pedestrian access to stops, stations, points of interest etc. This will include options to take into account accessibility requirements for different types of users, for example; 'no steps', 'wheelchair access', 'no lifts', etc.\n\n=== Bicycle routing ===\nSome journey planning systems can calculate bicycle routes,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Yoon|first=Ji Won|last2=Pinelli|first2=Fabio|last3=Calabrese|first3=Francesco|date=2012|title=Cityride: A Predictive Bike Sharing Journey Advisor|journal=Mobile Data Management (MDM), 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference|volume=|pages=306\u2013311|doi=10.1109/MDM.2012.16|isbn=978-1-4673-1796-2}}</ref> integrating all paths accessible by bicycle and often including additional information like topography, traffic, on-street cycling infrastructure, etc. These systems assume, or allow the user to specify, preferences for quiet or safe roads, minimal elevation change, [[Cycling infrastructure|bicycle lanes]], etc.\n\n== Data requirements ==\nTrip planners depend on a number of different types of data and the quality and extent of this data limits their capability.  Some trip planners integrate many different kinds of data from numerous sources. Others may work with one mode only, such as flight itineraries between airports, or using only addresses and the street network for driving directions.\n\n=== Contextual data ===\n==== Point of interest data ====\nPassengers don't travel because they want to go to a particular station or stop, but because they want to go some destination of interest, such as a sports arena, tourist attraction, shopping centre, park, law court, etc., etc.  Many trip planners allow users to look for such \"Points of interest\", either by name or by category (''museum, stadium, prison,'' etc.). Data sets of systematically named, geocoded and categorized popular destinations can be obtained commercially, for example, The UK  PointX  <ref>{{cite web|author=Martin Webb |url=http://www.pointx.co.uk/ |title=Welcome |publisher=PointX |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> data set, or derived from opensource data sets such as [[Open Street Map]]. Major operators such as [[Transport for London]] or [[National Rail]] have historically had well developed sets of such data for use in their Customer Call centres, along with information on the links to the nearest stops.  For points of interest that cover a large area, such as parks, country houses or stadia, a precise geocoding of the entrances is important.\n\n==== Gazetteer data ====\nTrip planning user interfaces can be made more usable by integration of [[Gazetteer]] data. This can be associated with stops to assist with stop finding in particular, for example for disambiguation; there are 33 places named Newport in the US and 14 in the UK - a Gazetteer can be used to distinguish which is which and also in some cases to indicate the relationship of transport interchanges with towns and urban centres that passengers are trying to reach - for example only one of London's five or so Airports is actually in London. Data for this purpose typically comes from additional layers in a map data set such as that provided by [[Esri]], [[Ordnance Survey]], [[Navtech]],  or specific data sets such as the UK [[National Public Transport Gazetteer]].\n\n=== Road data ===\n==== Road network data ====\nRoad trip planners, sometimes referred to as route planners, use street and footpath network data to compute a route using simply the network connectivity (i.e. trips may run at any time and not constrained by a timetable). Such data can come from one or more public, commercial or crowdsourced datasets such as [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]], [[Esri]] or [[OpenStreetMap]].  The data is fundamental both for computing access legs to reach public transport stops, and to compute road trips in their own right. The fundamental representation is a graph of nodes and edges (i.e. points and links).  The data may be further annotated to assist trip planning for different modes;\n* Road data may be characterised by road type (highway, major road, minor road, track, etc.),  turn restrictions,  speed restrictions etc., as well as average travel times at different times of day on different day types (''Weekday, Weekend, Public Holiday,'' etc.), so that accurate travel time predictions can be offered\n* Cycle road and path data may be annotated with characteristics such as cycle route number,  traffic levels, surface, lighting, etc. that affect its usability by cyclists.\n* Footpath data may be annotated with accessibility characteristics such as steps, lifts, wheelchair access, ramps, etc., etc., and also safety indicators (e.g., lighting, [[CCTV]], help points, ) so that accessibility constrained trip plans can be computed.\n\n==== Real-time data for roads ====\nAdvanced road trip planners take into account the real-time state of the network.  They use two main types of feed to do this, obtained from road data services using interfaces such as  [[Datex II]] or  [[Urban Traffic Management and Control|UTMC]].\n* Situation data, which described the incidents, events and planned roadworks in a structured form that can be related to the network; this is used to decorate trip plans and road maps to show current bottlenecks and incident locations.\n*Link traffic flow data, which gives a quantitative measurement of the current flow on each link of the network that is monitored; this can be used to take actual current conditions into account when computing predicted journey times.\n\n=== Public transport data ===\nFor transit route planners to work, transit schedule data must always be kept up to date. To facilitate data exchange and interoperability between different trip planners, several standard data formats have emerged.\n\nThe [[General Transit Feed Specification]], developed in 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-2/pioneering-open-data-standards-the-gtfs-story/|title=Pioneering Open Data Standards: The GTFS Story|website=beyondtransparency.org|access-date=2017-05-10}}</ref> is now used by hundreds of transit agencies around the world.\n\nIn the European Union all public passenger travel operators have the obligation to provide the information under the EU railway timetable data exchange format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netex-cen.eu/ |title=NeTEx |publisher=Netex-cen.eu |date=2014-03-18 |accessdate=2018-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=SOA architecture for complying with EU railway timetable data exchange format (link in chapter Pr\u00e4sentationen) |volume=2 |pages=630\u2013631 |publisher=Ieeexplore.ieee.org |date= October 2011|doi=10.1109/TELSKS.2011.6143191 |chapter=SOA architecture for complying with EU railway timetable data exchange format |last1=Branovic |first1=Irina |last2=Veskovic |first2=Slavko |last3=Mladenovic |first3=Snezana |last4=Milinkovic |first4=Sanjin |last5=Jankovic |first5=Sladjana |isbn=978-1-4577-2019-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gip.gv.at/downloads-219.html?...Transnational%20exchang |title=Transnational exchange of timetable and GIS data as a basis for cross-border ITS services |publisher=Gip.gv.at |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}</ref> In other parts of the world there similar exchange standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.nl/search?q=timetable+data+exchange&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b&gfe_rd=cr&ei=6FRpWN3BIeiD3gPJpZJQ |title=Transit Schedule Data Exchange Architecture |publisher=Google.nl |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Stop data ====\nThe location and identity of Public transport access points such as bus, tram and coach stops, stations, airports, ferry landing and ports are fundamental to trip planning and a stop data set is an essential layer of the transport data infrastructure. In order to integrate stops with spatial searches and road routing engines they are [[Geocoding|geocoded]]. In order to integrate them with the timetables and routes they are given a unique identifier within the transport network.  In order to be recognizable to passengers they are given official names and may also have a public short code (for example the three letter [[IATA]] codes for airports)  to use in interfaces.   Historically, different operators quite often used a different identifier for the same stop and stop numbers were not unique within a country or even a region.  Systems for  managing stop data, such as the  [[International Union of Railways|International Union of Railways (UIC)]] station location code set or the  UK's  [[NaPTAN|NaPTAN (National Public Transport Access Point)]] system  for stop numbers provide a means of ensuring numbers are unique and the stops are fully described,   greatly facilitate the integration of data.   Timetable exchange formats, such as [[GTFS]], [[TransXChange]] or [[NeTEx]] include  stop data in their  formats  and spatial data sets such as   [[OpenStreetMap]] allow stop identifiers to be geocoded.\n\n==== Public transport network topology data ====\nFor public transport networks with a very high frequency of service, such as urban metro cities and inner city bus services, the topology of the network can also be used for route planning,  with an average interval being assumed rather than specific departure times.  Data on the routes of trains and buses is also useful for providing visualisation of results, for example, to plot the route of a train on a map.  National mapping bodies, such as the UK's [[Ordnance Survey]] typically include a Transport layer in their data sets and the European [[Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community|INSPIRE]] framework includes public transport infrastructure links in its set of strategic digital data.  The CEN [[NeTEx]] format  allows both the physical layer (e.g. road and railway track infrastructure links)  and the logical layer (e.g. links between scheduled stopping points on a given line)  of the transport infrastructure to be exchanged\n\n=== Public transport timetables ===\nData on public transport schedules is used by trip planners to determine the available journeys at specific times. Historically rail data has been widely available in national formats, and many countries also have bus and other mode data in national formats such as [[Association of German Transport Companies|VDV 452]] (Germany),  [[TransXChange]] (UK) and Neptune (France). Schedule data is also increasingly becoming available in international formats such as  [[General Transit Feed Specification|GTFS]] and [[NeTEx]]. To allow a route to be projected onto a map,  GTFS allows the specification of a simple shape plot; whilst [[Transmodel]] based standards such as CEN [[NeTEx]], [[TransXChange]] additionally allow  a more detailed representation which can recognize the constituent links and distinguish several different semantic layers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Real-time prediction information for Public Transport ===\nTrip planners may be able to incorporate real-time information into their database and consider them in the selection of optimal routes for travel in the immediate future. [[Automatic Vehicle Location|Automatic vehicle location]] (AVL) systems <ref name=\":2\" /> monitor the position of vehicles using [[Global Positioning System|GPS systems]] and can pass on real-time and forecast information to the journey planning system.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Jing-Quan|last2=Zhou|first2=Kun|last3=Zhang|first3=Liping|last4=Zhang|first4=Wei-Bin|date=2012-04-01|title=A Multimodal Trip Planning System With Real-Time Traffic and Transit Information|journal=Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems|volume=16|issue=2|pages=60\u201369|doi=10.1080/15472450.2012.671708|issn=1547-2450}}</ref> A trip planner may use a real time interface such as the CEN [[Service Interface for Real Time Information]] to obtain this data.\n\n=== Situation information ===\nA situation is a software representation of an incident{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} or event that is affecting or is likely to affect the transport network. A trip planner can integrate situation information and use it both to revise its trip planning computations and to annotate its responses so as to inform users through both text and map representations. A trip planner will typically use a standard interface such as [[Service Interface for Real Time Information|SIRI]], [[TPEG]] or [[Datex II]] to obtain situation information.\n\nIncidents are captured through an [[Incident Capturing System|incident capturing system]] (ICS) by different operators and stakeholders, for example in transport operator control rooms, by broadcasters or by the emergency services. Text and image information can be combined with the trip result. Recent incidents can be considered within the routing as well as visualized in an interactive map.\n\n== Technology ==\n\nTypically journey planners use an efficient in-memory representation of the network and timetable to allow the rapid searching of a large number of paths. Database queries may also be used where the number of nodes needed to compute a journey is small, and to access ancillary information relating to the journey. A single engine may contain the entire transport network, and its schedules, or may allow the [[Distributed computing|distributed computation]] of journeys using a distributed journey planning protocol such as [[JourneyWeb]] or [[Delfi Protocol]]. A journey planning engine may be accessed by different front ends, using a software protocol or [[Application Program Interface|application program interface]] specialised for journey queries, to provide a [[User Interface|user interface]] on different types of device.\n\nThe development of journey planning engines has gone hand in hand with the development of data standards for representing the stops, routes and timetables of the network, such as [[TransXChange]], [[NaPTAN]], [[Transmodel]] or [[General Transit Feed Specification|GTFS]] that ensure that these fit together. Journey planning algorithms are a classic example of problems in the field of [[Computational complexity theory]]. Real-world implementations involve a tradeoff of computational resources between accuracy, completeness of the answer, and the time required for calculation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe sub-problem of route planning is an easier problem to solve<ref>{{Cite book|title=Algorithmics of Large and Complex Networks|last=Delling|first=Daniel|last2=Sanders|first2=Peter|last3=Schultes|first3=Dominik|last4=Wagner|first4=Dorothea|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642020933|editor-last=Lerner|editor-first=J\u00fcrgen|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|location=|pages=117\u2013139|language=en|chapter=Engineering Route Planning Algorithms|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-02094-0_7|editor-last2=Wagner|editor-first2=Dorothea|editor-last3=Zweig|editor-first3=Katharina A.|citeseerx = 10.1.1.164.8916}}</ref> as it generally involves less data and fewer constraints. However, with the development of \"road timetables\", associating different journey times for road links at different times of day, time of travel is increasingly relevant for route planners as well.\n\n=== Algorithms ===\nJourney planners use a [[Routing|routing algorithm]] to search a [[Graph (data structure)|graph]] representing the transport network. In the simplest case where routing is independent of time, the graph uses (directed) [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] to represent street/path segments and [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] to represent [[Intersection (road)|intersections]]. Routing on such a graph can be accomplished effectively using any of a number of routing algorithms such as [[Dijkstra's algorithm|Dijkstra's]], [[A* search algorithm|A*]], [[Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm|Floyd-Warshall]], or [[Johnson's algorithm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.pgrouting.org/2.0/en/src/index.html#routing-functions|title=Routing Functions \u2014 pgRouting Manual (2.0.0)|website=docs.pgrouting.org|access-date=2017-05-13}}</ref> Different weightings such as distance, cost or accessibility may be associated with each edge, and sometimes with nodes.\n\nWhen time-dependent features such as public transit are included, there are several proposed ways of representing the transport network as a graph and different algorithms may be used such as RAPTOR<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Delling|first=Daniel|last2=Pajor|first2=Thomas|last3=Werneck|first3=Renato F.|date=2014-10-30|title=Round-Based Public Transit Routing|journal=Transportation Science|volume=49|issue=3|pages=591\u2013604|doi=10.1287/trsc.2014.0534|issn=0041-1655|citeseerx=10.1.1.652.775}}</ref>\n\n=== Automated trip planner ===\nAutomated trip planners generate your [[Travel itinerary|itinerary]] automatically, based on the information you provide.
