The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as [[List of Khazar rulers|Irbis]] and describe him as a scion of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is whether he can be identified with one of the many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk rulers of the same name.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and other priorities, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Mako|2010|p=45}}</ref> The Khazars launched a few raids into Transcaucasian principalities under Muslim dominion, including a large-scale raid in 683\u2013685 during the [[Second Fitna|Second Muslim Civil War]] that rendered much booty and many prisoners.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\">{{harvnb|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}}</ref> There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in Transoxiana.\n\n[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|300px|{{center|Caucasus region, c. 740}}]]\n\nThe Second Arab-Khazar War began with a series of raids across the Caucasus in the early 8th century. The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2010|p=127}}</ref> The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered.<ref name=\"Khazar Studies\">{{cite book|last1=Golden|first1=Peter B.|title=Khazar Studies|date=1980|page=64}}</ref> The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia.<ref name=\"Khazar Studies\"/> The Qa\u011fan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Wasserstein|2007|pp=375\u2013376}}</ref> The suggestion that the Khazars adopted [[Judaism]] as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}:'The Khazars, the close allies of the Byzantines, adopted Judaism, as their official religion, apparently by 740, three years after an invasion by the Arabs under Marwan ibn Muhammad. Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,<ref>{{harvnb|Moss|2002|p=16}}.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld. [[Ancestor worship]] was observed. The key religious figure appears to have been a [[shamanism|shaman]]-like ''qam'',<ref>{{harvnb|Golden|2007|pp=131\u2013133}}</ref> and it was these (''qozm\u00edm'') that were, according to the Khazar Hebrew conversion stories, driven out.\n\nMany sources suggest, and a notable number of scholars have argued, that the charismatic \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 clan played a germinal role in the early Khazar state, although Zuckerman dismisses the widespread notion of their pivotal role as a 'phantom'. The \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 were closely associated with the [[Tengrism|Tengri cult]], whose practices involved rites performed to assure a tribe of heaven's protective providence.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittow |1996|p=220}}</ref> The qa\u011fan was deemed to rule by virtue of ''qut'', \"the heavenly mandate/good fortune to rule.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Golden|2007b|p=133}}. {{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=220}} notes that this native institution, given the constant, lengthy, military and acculturating pressures on the tribes from China to the East, was influenced also by the [[Sinocentrism|sinocentric]] doctrine of the [[Mandate of Heaven|Mandate of Heaven (Ti\u0101nm\u00ecng:(\u5929\u547d)]], which signaled legitimacy of rule.</ref>\n\n===Christianity===\nKhazaria long served as a [[buffer state]] between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]] and both the nomads of the northern steppes and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad empire]], after serving as Byzantium's proxy against the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian Persian empire]].

Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737.

Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld.

She let them in and nursed her wounded husband till he died that night to her devastation\n. \nVery soon after her husband's death, devastated maire rua knew that she and her children would be hung and her lands fortifed so she rode by horse to limreck city to the camp of general Henry Ireton dressed in all her finery proclaiming that she was willing to marry any of the officers.she married a Cromwellian officer John cooper and secured her property and castle from seizure. and was living with him in Limerick for a while after there marriage before returning to Leamaneh.

It is also said that she victimised passers-by and trespassers. The folklorist [[M\u00e1ire MacNeill]] found parallels between some of the stories told about O'Brien, such as challenging suitors to ride a wide stallion, to those of traditional Irish sovereign-goddess myths.<ref name=\"Murphy\" />\n\nDuring the Irish wars from [[Confederate Ireland|1641 to 1652]], her husband led and financed one of the five militia companies of Clare which raided towers houses of Dutch and English settlers, with O'Brien riding with him during some raids. In the proceeding depositions about the siege of Barntick castle, O'Brien is charged with the murder of a servant. Conor O'Brien was commissioned colonel of horse in 1650 to the army of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], dying in 1651 from wounds he received fighting against [[Edmund Ludlow]] at the pass of Inchecrogan.

It is suggested that she may have wanted to marry a Cromwellian officer in an effort of secure her property and land from seizure.<ref name=\"Clare Library\" />\n\nVery soon after her husband's death, she petitioned Charles I's lord deputy in Ireland, [[Ulick Burke, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde|Ulick Burke]], to become the custodian of the O'Brien estate. She was able to secure the land for her children, she could not retain Leamaneh Castle, which fell to the Cromwellian army and was turned into a garrison. In 1653, she is recorded as the wife of a former parliamentary officer, Cornet John Cooper and was living with him in Limerick for a while after there marriage before returning to Leamaneh.

Her family did not want her name to appear in print, since writing was not considered a proper occupation for a society woman of her time. Consequently, the poem was published under the name of a friend's father, E. A.

[[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Bernard Berenson]], and [[Kenneth Clark]] were valued friends as well. Particularly notable was her meeting with [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], described by the editors of her letters as \"one of the better known failed encounters in the American literary annals\". She spoke fluent French, Italian, and German, and many of her books were published in both French and English.\n\nIn 1934 Wharton's [[autobiography]] ''A Backward Glance'' was published. In the view of Judith E. Funston, writing on Edith Wharton in ''American National Biography'', <blockquote>What is most notable about ''A Backward Glance,'' however, is what it does not tell: her criticism of Lucretia Jones [her mother], her difficulties with Teddy, and her affair with Morton Fullerton, which did not come to light until her papers, deposited in Yale's [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|Beinecke Rare Book Room and Manuscript Library]], were opened in 1968.<ref>Judith E.

In addition to\nher 15 novels, seven novellas, and eighty-five short stories, she published poetry, books on design, travel, literary and cultural criticism, and a memoir.{{sfn|Benstock|1994}}\n\nIn 1873, Wharton wrote a [[short story]] and gave it to her mother to read. Her mother criticized the story, so Wharton decided to just write [[poetry]]. While she constantly sought her mother's approval and love, it was rare that she received either. From the start, the relationship with her mother was a troubled one.<ref>, Armitage, Robert. \"Edith Wharton, A Writing Life: Childhood.\" Edith Wharton, A Writing Life: Childhood. New York Public Library, 6 May 2013. Web. 11 Mar. 2015.</ref> Before she was 15, she wrote ''Fast and Loose'' (1877). In her youth, she wrote about society. Her central [[theme (narrative)|theme]]s came from her experiences with her parents. She was very critical of her work and wrote public reviews criticizing it. She also wrote about her own experiences with life. \"Intense Love\u2019s Utterance\" is a poem written about Henry Stevens.<ref name=\"Edith Wharton: A Biography\"/>\n\nIn 1889, she sent out three poems for publication. They were sent to ''[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner\u2019s]]'', ''Harper\u2019s'' and ''[[The Century Magazine|Century]]''. [[Edward L. Burlingame] published \"The Last Giustiniani\" for ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner\u2019s]]''. It was not until Wharton was 29 that her first [[short story]] was published. \"Mrs. Manstey's View\" had very little success, and it took her more than a year to publish another story. She completed \"The Fullness of Life\" following her annual European trip with Teddy. Burlingame was critical of this story but Wharton did not want to make edits to it. This story, along with many others, speaks about her marriage. She sent ''Bunner Sisters'' to Scribner's in 1892. Burlingame wrote back that it was too long for Scribner's to publish. This story is believed to be based on an experience she had as a child. It did not see publication until 1916 and is included in the collection called ''Xingu''.\nAfter a visit with her friend, [[Paul Bourget]], she wrote \"The Good May Come\" and \"The Lamp of Psyche\". \"The Lamp of Psyche\" was a [[Comedy|comical]] story with verbal wit and sorrow. After \"Something Exquisite\" was rejected by Burlingame, she lost confidence in herself. She started \"[[travel writing]]\" in 1894.<ref name=\"Edith Wharton: A Biography\"/>\n\nIn 1901, Wharton wrote a two-act play called ''Man of Genius''. This play was about an English man who was having an affair with his secretary. The play was rehearsed but was never produced. Another 1901 play, ''The Shadow of a Doubt'', which also came close to being staged but fell through, was thought to be lost, until it was discovered in 2017. Its world premiere was a radio adaptation broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 2018.<ref>Drama on 3 ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0000xfl The Shadow of a Doubt'']. BBC Radio 3</ref>  She collaborated with [[Marie Tempest]] to write another play, but the two only completed four acts before Marie decided she was no longer interested in costume plays. One of her earliest literary endeavors (1902) was the translation of the play, ''Es Lebe das Leben'' (\"The Joy of Living\"), by Hermann Sudermann. ''The Joy of Living'' was criticized for its name because the heroine swallows poison at the end, and was a short-lived [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. It was, however, a successful book.<ref name=\"Edith Wharton: A Biography\"/>\n\nMany of Wharton's novels are characterized by subtle use of [[dramatic irony]]. Having grown up in upper-class, late-19th-century society, Wharton became one of its most astute critics, in such works as ''[[The House of Mirth]]'' and ''[[The Age of Innocence]]''.\n\n===Themes in writings===\nVersions of her mother, Lucretia Jones, often appeared in Wharton's fiction. Biographer [[Hermione Lee]] described it as \"one of the most lethal acts of revenge ever taken by a writing daughter.\"{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=35}} In her memoir, ''A Backward Glance'', Wharton describes her mother as indolent, spendthrift, censorious, disapproving, superficial, icy, dry and ironic.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=35}}\n\nWharton's writings often dealt with themes such as \u201c\u2026social and individual fulfillment, repressed sexuality, and the manners of old families and the new elite...\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mulalic|first=Almasa|date=2012|title=Material Details in Edith Wharton's Writings|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301944958|journal=Epiphany: Journal of Transdisciplinary Studies|volume=5|pages=95\u2013107|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> [[Maureen Howard]], editor of ''Edith Wharton: Collected Stories,  ''notes several recurring themes in Wharton's short stories, including confinement and attempts at freedom, the morality of the author, critiques of intellectual pretension, and the \u201cunmasking\u201d of the truth.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.loa.org/news-and-views/141-remarks-on-edith-whartons-_collected-stories_-by-editor-maureen-howard|title=Remarks on Edith Wharton's Collected Stories by editor Maureen Howard|last=Howard|first=Maureen|date=2001|website=Library of America}}</ref> Wharton's writing also explored themes of \u201csocial mores and social reform\u201d as they relate to the \u201cextremes and anxieties of the Gilded Age\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA key recurring theme in Wharton's writing is the relationship between the house as a physical space and its relationship to its inhabitant's characteristics and emotions.

Her family did not want her name to appear in print, since writing was not considered a proper occupation for a society woman of her time. Consequently, the poem was published under the name of a friend's father, E. A.

Funston, writing on Edith Wharton in ''American National Biography'', <blockquote>What is most notable about ''A Backward Glance,'' however, is what it does not tell: her criticism of Lucretia Jones [her mother], her difficulties with Teddy, and her affair with Morton Fullerton, which did not come to light until her papers, deposited in Yale's [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|Beinecke Rare Book Room and Manuscript Library]], were opened in 1968.<ref>Judith E. Funston, \"Edith Wharton\", in ''American National Biography''; New York: Oxford University Press, 1999; Vol. 23, pp. 111\u2013112. {{ISBN|0-19-512802-8}}.</ref></blockquote>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Death===\nOn June 1, 1937, Wharton was at the French country home of [[Ogden Codman]], where she was at work on a revised edition of ''The Decoration of Houses,'' when she suffered a heart attack and collapsed.{{sfn|Benstock|1994|p=86}}\n\n[[File:Gardens at Pavilion Colombe Edith Wharton's villa.jpg|thumb|Wharton's ''Le Pavilion Colombe'', [[Saint-Brice-sous-For\u00eat]], France]]\n\nEdith Wharton later died of a [[stroke]] on August 11, 1937 at ''Le Pavillon Colombe'', her 18th-century house on [[Rue de Montmorency]] in [[Saint-Brice-sous-For\u00eat]]. She died at 5:30&nbsp;p.m., but her death was not known in Paris. At her bedside was her friend, Mrs. Royall Tyler.<ref>\"Edith Wharton, 75, Is Dead in France.\" Www.nytimes.com. The New York Times, 13 Aug. 1937. Web. 11 Mar. 2015.</ref> Wharton was buried in the American Protestant section of the [[Cimeti\u00e8re des Gonards]] in Versailles, \"with all the honors owed a war hero and a chevalier of the Legion of Honor...a group of some one hundred friends sang a verse of the hymn 'O Paradise'...\"{{sfn|Benstock|1994|p=456}}\n\n==Writing==\n\n===Career===\nDespite not publishing her first novel until she was forty, Wharton became an extraordinarily productive writer. In addition to\nher 15 novels, seven novellas, and eighty-five short stories, she published poetry, books on design, travel, literary and cultural criticism, and a memoir.{{sfn|Benstock|1994}}\n\nIn 1873, Wharton wrote a [[short story]] and gave it to her mother to read. Her mother criticized the story, so Wharton decided to just write [[poetry]]. While she constantly sought her mother's approval and love, it was rare that she received either. From the start, the relationship with her mother was a troubled one.<ref>, Armitage, Robert. \"Edith Wharton, A Writing Life: Childhood.\" Edith Wharton, A Writing Life: Childhood. New York Public Library, 6 May 2013. Web. 11 Mar. 2015.</ref> Before she was 15, she wrote ''Fast and Loose'' (1877). In her youth, she wrote about society. Her central [[theme (narrative)|theme]]s came from her experiences with her parents. She was very critical of her work and wrote public reviews criticizing it. She also wrote about her own experiences with life. \"Intense Love\u2019s Utterance\" is a poem written about Henry Stevens.<ref name=\"Edith Wharton: A Biography\"/>\n\nIn 1889, she sent out three poems for publication. They were sent to ''[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner\u2019s]]'', ''Harper\u2019s'' and ''[[The Century Magazine|Century]]''. [[Edward L. Burlingame] published \"The Last Giustiniani\" for ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner\u2019s]]''. It was not until Wharton was 29 that her first [[short story]] was published. \"Mrs. Manstey's View\" had very little success, and it took her more than a year to publish another story. She completed \"The Fullness of Life\" following her annual European trip with Teddy. Burlingame was critical of this story but Wharton did not want to make edits to it. This story, along with many others, speaks about her marriage. She sent ''Bunner Sisters'' to Scribner's in 1892. Burlingame wrote back that it was too long for Scribner's to publish. This story is believed to be based on an experience she had as a child. It did not see publication until 1916 and is included in the collection called ''Xingu''.\nAfter a visit with her friend, [[Paul Bourget]], she wrote \"The Good May Come\" and \"The Lamp of Psyche\". \"The Lamp of Psyche\" was a [[Comedy|comical]] story with verbal wit and sorrow. After \"Something Exquisite\" was rejected by Burlingame, she lost confidence in herself. She started \"[[travel writing]]\" in 1894.<ref name=\"Edith Wharton: A Biography\"/>\n\nIn 1901, Wharton wrote a two-act play called ''Man of Genius''. This play was about an English man who was having an affair with his secretary. The play was rehearsed but was never produced. Another 1901 play, ''The Shadow of a Doubt'', which also came close to being staged but fell through, was thought to be lost, until it was discovered in 2017. Its world premiere was a radio adaptation broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 2018.<ref>Drama on 3 ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0000xfl The Shadow of a Doubt'']. BBC Radio 3</ref>  She collaborated with [[Marie Tempest]] to write another play, but the two only completed four acts before Marie decided she was no longer interested in costume plays. One of her earliest literary endeavors (1902) was the translation of the play, ''Es Lebe das Leben'' (\"The Joy of Living\"), by Hermann Sudermann. ''The Joy of Living'' was criticized for its name because the heroine swallows poison at the end, and was a short-lived [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. It was, however, a successful book.<ref name=\"Edith Wharton: A Biography\"/>\n\nMany of Wharton's novels are characterized by subtle use of [[dramatic irony]]. Having grown up in upper-class, late-19th-century society, Wharton became one of its most astute critics, in such works as ''[[The House of Mirth]]'' and ''[[The Age of Innocence]]''.\n\n===Themes in writings===\nVersions of her mother, Lucretia Jones, often appeared in Wharton's fiction. Biographer [[Hermione Lee]] described it as \"one of the most lethal acts of revenge ever taken by a writing daughter.\"{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=35}} In her memoir, ''A Backward Glance'', Wharton describes her mother as indolent, spendthrift, censorious, disapproving, superficial, icy, dry and ironic.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=35}}\n\nWharton's writings often dealt with themes such as \u201c\u2026social and individual fulfillment, repressed sexuality, and the manners of old families and the new elite...\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mulalic|first=Almasa|date=2012|title=Material Details in Edith Wharton's Writings|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301944958|journal=Epiphany: Journal of Transdisciplinary Studies|volume=5|pages=95\u2013107|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> [[Maureen Howard]], editor of ''Edith Wharton: Collected Stories,  ''notes several recurring themes in Wharton's short stories, including confinement and attempts at freedom, the morality of the author, critiques of intellectual pretension, and the \u201cunmasking\u201d of the truth.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.loa.org/news-and-views/141-remarks-on-edith-whartons-_collected-stories_-by-editor-maureen-howard|title=Remarks on Edith Wharton's Collected Stories by editor Maureen Howard|last=Howard|first=Maureen|date=2001|website=Library of America}}</ref> Wharton's writing also explored themes of \u201csocial mores and social reform\u201d as they relate to the \u201cextremes and anxieties of the Gilded Age\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA key recurring theme in Wharton's writing is the relationship between the house as a physical space and its relationship to its inhabitant's characteristics and emotions.

The German government and several health officials stated that the country was well prepared and at first saw no need in taking special measures to stock up or to limit public freedom.

Two days later, borders to neighbouring countries were closed. On 22 March, the government announced a national curfew, almost identical to those in to Austria and Bavaria, where it had been implemented seven days and three days before, respectively.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It was described as: \"Children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\", \"the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\" - all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |language=de |date=2020-03-24 |work=ZDF Frontal 21}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs. [[Johns Hopkins University]] seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI rechtfertigt sich \u2013 und h\u00e4lt sich bei einer Frage konsequent zur\u00fcck |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article206783949/Coronavirus-RKI-rechtfertigt-sich-und-haelt-sich-dann-konsequent-zurueck.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Welt |date=25 March 2020 |ref=WELT2503}}</ref>\n\nThe number of unknown cases could be tenfold according to some virologists.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It was described as: \"Children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\", \"the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\" - all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |language=de |date=2020-03-24 |work=ZDF Frontal 21}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Data discussion ===\n====Testing====\nIn spite of widespread availability of laboratory testing but due to the restrictive RKI testing criteria, Germans without any or unspecific symptoms could not be tested until late March. On 25 March 2020, the Robert Koch Institute announced that people no longer needed to come from risk areas to be allowed to get tested, and prioritized loosened restrictions to test health care workers.<ref name=\"Focus2503\">{{cite news |last1=Schneider |first1=Paula |title=Statistikerin fordert Tests, die endlich das wahre Corona-Ausma\u00df in Deutschland zeigen |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/es-grassiert-ungewissheit-repraesentative-tests-sollen-wahres-ausmass-in-deutschland-zeigen_id_11813688.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Focus |date=25 March 2020}}</ref> RKI criticised that too many people without symptoms were tested.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI kassiert Kriterium f\u00fcr Corona-Tests |url=https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/RKI-kassiert-Kriterium-fuer-Corona-Tests-article21667740.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=ntv |date=25 March 2020}}</ref> On 26 March, virologist Streeck said that testing labs were at the limit of their capacity.<ref name=\"Focus2703\">{{cite news |last1=Obermeier |first1=Ludwig |title=Zahlen-Chaos: Bonner Virologe zeigt mit 3 Beispielen, warum wir im Corona-Dilemma stecken |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/covid-19-pandemie-top-virologe-wir-stecken-in-einem-dilemma-weil-uns-entscheidende-daten-fehlen_id_11811994.html |accessdate=27 March 2020 |publisher=Focus |date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\nThe more a pandemic has spread, the harder it becomes to increase the number of tests because the healthcare system becomes overburdened.<ref name=\"Focus2403\"/>\n\n====Reporting lag====\nIncubation period, and turn around time of the only diagnostic test (PCR) can lead to a reporting lag of up to five and ten days.<ref name=\"Focus2503\"/>\n\nBecause of the federal health care system in Germany, states vary in data collection, aggregation and time of release to the public. Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs. [[Johns Hopkins University]] seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI rechtfertigt sich \u2013 und h\u00e4lt sich bei einer Frage konsequent zur\u00fcck |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article206783949/Coronavirus-RKI-rechtfertigt-sich-und-haelt-sich-dann-konsequent-zurueck.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Welt |date=25 March 2020 |ref=WELT2503}}</ref>\n\nThe number of unknown cases could be tenfold according to some virologists.

In response to its nationals being taken hostage by Iranian students, the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]] had frozen all financial assets held by Iran and its nationals. \n\nAlgeria intervened as an intermediary between the two governments, consulting with both sides extensively to determine mutually agreeable resolutions. These commitments were recorded in two declarations made on 19 January 1981: the \"General Declaration\" and the \"Claims Settlement Declaration\", known collectively as the \"Algiers Declarations\". Both Iran and the U.S. adhered to the final accord; U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who took office the day after the Algiers Accords, affirmed the agreement, and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld its [[constitutionality]] in ''Dames & Moore v. Reagan''.<ref>''Dames & Moore v. Regan'', 453 U.S. 654 (1981)</ref>\n\nThe final accord stipulated that, in exchange for the release of the hostages, the U.S. would terminate litigation against Iran in U.S. courts and release Iranian assets. Pending commercial claims by U.S. nationals against Iran and its State enterprises would be addressed through \"binding arbitration\" by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal and \"excluded from the jurisdiction of the courts of Iran, or of the United States, or of any other court.\"\n\nThe Tribunal held its first meeting in the [[Peace Palace]] on July 1, 1981, moving to its own premises in The Hague the following year. \n\n== Jurisdiction and procedure ==\nPursuant to the Algiers Declarations, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide four classes of claims:\n\n# Claims of U.S. nationals against Iran and of Iranian nationals against the U.S. that arise from debts, contracts, and other measures affecting property rights; \n# Certain \"official claims\" between the U.S. and Iranian governments relating to the purchase and sale of goods and services;\n# Disputes between Iran and the U.S. concerning the interpretation or performance of the Algiers Declarations; and\n# Certain claims between banking institutions.\n\nThe Tribunal operates largely in accordance with the arbitration rules of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)]], albeit with some modifications.\n\nClaims had to be filed with the Tribunal within one year of its establishment, 19 January 1982; there is no time limit regarding disputes between the two governments concerning matters of interpretation or performance of the Declarations. The majority of claims (approximately 2,800 claims) concerned amounts of less than $250,000, while around 1,000 claims\u00a0were filed for amounts of $250,000 or more. \n\nThe Tribunal consists of nine members, three appointed by Iran, three by the U.S., and three from third-party countries that are appointed by the other six members. Claims are decided by one of the three Chambers of the Tribunal or by the Full Tribunal if it concerns disputes between the two governments or important questions referred to it by the Chambers. Cases between individuals are presided over by three-member chambers, consisting of one Iranian, one American, and one third-party national. Claims are distributed among the Chambers by lot.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== Additional readings ==\n\n* ''American Hostages In Iran: The Conduct of a Crisis'' (Yale 1985)\n* ''Revolutionary Days: The Iran Hostage Crisis and the Hague Claims Tribunal, A Look Back'' (Juris 1996)\n* Symposium on the Settlement with Iran, March 6\u20137, 1981, Lawyer of the Americas, U Miami J.

Regan'', 453 U.S. 654 (1981)</ref>\n\nThe final accord stipulated that, in exchange for the release of the hostages, the U.S. would terminate litigation against Iran in U.S. courts and release Iranian assets. Pending commercial claims by U.S. nationals against Iran and its State enterprises would be addressed through \"binding arbitration\" by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal and \"excluded from the jurisdiction of the courts of Iran, or of the United States, or of any other court.\"\n\nThe Tribunal held its first meeting in the [[Peace Palace]] on July 1, 1981, moving to its own premises in The Hague the following year. \n\n== Jurisdiction and procedure ==\nPursuant to the Algiers Declarations, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide four classes of claims:\n\n# Claims of U.S. nationals against Iran and of Iranian nationals against the U.S. that arise from debts, contracts, and other measures affecting property rights; \n# Certain \"official claims\" between the U.S. and Iranian governments relating to the purchase and sale of goods and services;\n# Disputes between Iran and the U.S. concerning the interpretation or performance of the Algiers Declarations; and\n# Certain claims between banking institutions.\n\nThe Tribunal operates largely in accordance with the arbitration rules of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)]], albeit with some modifications.\n\nClaims had to be filed with the Tribunal within one year of its establishment, 19 January 1982; there is no time limit regarding disputes between the two governments concerning matters of interpretation or performance of the Declarations. The majority of claims (approximately 2,800 claims) concerned amounts of less than $250,000, while around 1,000 claims\u00a0were filed for amounts of $250,000 or more. \n\nThe Tribunal consists of nine members, three appointed by Iran, three by the U.S., and three from third-party countries that are appointed by the other six members. Claims are decided by one of the three Chambers of the Tribunal or by the Full Tribunal if it concerns disputes between the two governments or important questions referred to it by the Chambers. Cases between individuals are presided over by three-member chambers, consisting of one Iranian, one American, and one third-party national. Claims are distributed among the Chambers by lot.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== Additional readings ==\n\n* ''American Hostages In Iran: The Conduct of a Crisis'' (Yale 1985)\n* ''Revolutionary Days: The Iran Hostage Crisis and the Hague Claims Tribunal, A Look Back'' (Juris 1996)\n* Symposium on the Settlement with Iran, March 6\u20137, 1981, Lawyer of the Americas, U Miami J.
