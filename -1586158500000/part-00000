As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a triple threat ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a triple threat tag team ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |English commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe \"Firefly Fun House match\" between The Fiend and John Cena was billed by Wyatt as a fight between Cena and himself. The sequence began in the Firefly Fun House, transporting Cena to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thugonomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], Wyatt and Cena suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in their match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to an episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''\u2014entering in an [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] shirt. In the ring, Cena attempted to once again tackle Wyatt, but was suddenly replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend snuck in from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (with [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar then came back with three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. McIntyre then countered an F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks to win the match and the championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of [[The A.

The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|Hosts\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|Spanish commentators\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Interviewers\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|Pre-show panel\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe \"Firefly Fun House match\" between The Fiend and John Cena was billed by Wyatt as a fight between Cena and himself. The sequence began in the Firefly Fun House, transporting Cena to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thugonomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], Wyatt and Cena suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in their match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to an episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''\u2014entering in an [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] shirt. In the ring, Cena attempted to once again tackle Wyatt, but was suddenly replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend snuck in from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (with [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar then came back with three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. McIntyre then countered an F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks to win the match and the championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of [[The A.

Threshing does not remove the [[bran]] from the grain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/threshing.aspx#1|title=threshing|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThreshing may be done by beating the grain using a [[flail]] on a [[threshing floor]]. Another traditional method of threshing is to make donkeys or oxen walk in circles on the grain on a hard surface. A modern version of this in some areas is to spread the grain on the surface of a country road so the grain may be threshed by the wheels of passing vehicles.<ref>M.

Today, in developed areas, it is now mostly done by [[machine]], usually by a [[combine harvester]], which harvests, threshes, and winnows the grain while it is still in the field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringhalloffame.org/profile-meikle.html|title=Andrew Meikle (1719-1811) engineer and inventor of the threshing machine, the predecessor of the combine harvester|publisher=Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edinformatics.com/inventions_inventors/threshing_machine.htm|title=The Threshing Machine -- Separation of Grain from Stalks and Husks|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe cereal may be stored in a [[barn]] or [[silo]]s.\n\nA threshing bee was traditionally a [[communal work|bee]] in which local people gathered together to [[wikt:pitch in#Verb|pitch in]] and get the season's threshing done. Such bees were sometimes [[festival]]s or events within larger [[harvest festival]]s. Today the original purpose is largely obsolete, but the festival tradition lives on in some modern examples that commemorate the past and include [[flea market]]s, [[Pig wrestling|hog wrestling]], and [[dance]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://threshingbee.org/|title=home|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://www.dufurthreshingbee.org</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donnellythreshingbee.com|title=Welcome to the Donnelly Threshing Bee|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Threshing-with-flail-RSJ.jpg|Threshing with hand flails, Great Britain, c. 1750.
