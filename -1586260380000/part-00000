They established a patchwork of independent Aramaic kingdoms in the [[Levant]] and seized tracts of [[Anatolia]] as well as briefly conquering [[Babylonia]].\n\nThe Arameans never formed a unified state but had small independent kingdoms across parts of the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]], (present-day [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Israel]], [[Palestinian territories]], the northwestern [[Arabian peninsula]] and south-central [[Turkey]]). Their political influence was confined to a number of states such as [[Aram Damascus]], [[Hamath]], [[Palmyra]], [[Aleppo]] and the partly Aramean [[Syro-Hittite states]], which were entirely absorbed into the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (935\u2013605 BC) by the 9th century BC. In the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the Aramaeans, Chaldeans, Suteans and indigenous Assyrians-Babylonians became largely indistinguishable, as these groups were culturally and ethnically absorbed into the native populace of Mesopotamia.<ref name=brit>\n[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aramaean \"Aramaean (people)\"]. ''Encyclopaedia Britannica.''\n</ref>\n\nBy contrast, [[Imperial Aramaic]] came to be the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the entire [[Near East]] and [[Asia Minor]] after King [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] of Assyria (ruled 745\u2013727 BC) made it one of two official languages of the vast [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (the other being [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]) in the mid-8th century BC, in recognition of the mostly-Aramean speaking population in areas Assyria had conquered west of the [[Euphrates]] and the large numbers of Arameans in Mesopotamia. This empire stretched from [[Cyprus]] and the [[East Mediterranean]] in the west to [[Persia]] and [[Elam]] in the east, and from [[Armenia]] and the [[Caucasus]] in the north to [[Egypt]], [[Libya]] and [[Arabia]] in the south. The [[Achaemenid Empire]] ({{circa}} 550\u2013330 BC) greatly spread Imperial Aramaic: north to the coast of the Black Sea and eastward to the [[Indus Valley]]. This version of Aramaic, influenced by [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and later by [[Old Persian]], later developed into the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] dialect of [[Edessa]].\n\nBetween the 1st and 4th centuries AD, the Arameans began to adopt [[Christianity]] in place of the polytheist [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Aramean religion]], and the Levant became an important centre of [[Syriac Christianity]], along with the Aramean kingdom Osroene to the east from where the [[Syriac language]] and [[Syriac script]] emerged.\n\nUse of the [[Western Aramaic]] language has steadily declined in the face of [[Arabic]] since the [[Islamic conquest]] of the area in the 7th century AD, and the last vestiges of the spoken tongue in and around [[Maalula]] are in danger of extinction, although [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population maintain spoken dialects of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] influenced [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]] as well as [[Syriac language|Syriac]] as a [[liturgical language]]. Similarly, some [[Jewish]] communities and the [[Mandean]] people also retain dialects of Aramaic. Today, an [[Aramean identity]] is mainly held by a small number of largely Arabic-speaking [[Syriac Christians]] in south-central [[Turkey]], in Syria, and in the [[Aramean diaspora]] overseas. In 2014, Israel recognized the [[Arameans in Israel|Aramean minority]], an Arabic- and Aramaic-speaking Christian community.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/24936/Default.aspx|title = Israeli Christians Officially Recognized as Arameans, Not Arabs|date = September 18, 2014|accessdate = 27 April 2015 |website = Israel Today|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref name=\"Arutz Sheva\">{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/304458|title=Ministry of Interior to Admit Arameans to National Population Registry - Latest News Briefs - Arutz Sheva|work=Arutz Sheva}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Arameans}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Aramean funeral stele Louvre AO3026.jpg|left|thumb|Basalt funeral stele bearing an Aramaic inscription, c. 7th century BC.

One of the annals of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]] (c. 2250 BC) mentions that he captured \"Dubul, the [[ens\u00ed]] of ''A-ra-me''\" (''Arame'' is seemingly a [[genitive]] form), in the course of a campaign against [[Simurrum]] in the northern mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/yearnames/HTML/T2K3.htm|title=T2K3.htm|publisher=UCLA}}</ref> Other early references to a place or people of \"Aram\" have appeared at the archives of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] (c. 1900 BC) and at [[Ugarit]] (c. 1300 BC).\n\nHowever, there is absolutely no historical, archaeological or linguistic evidence that the ''Aramu'', ''Armi'' or ''Arame'' were actually Arameans or even related to them; and the earliest ''undisputed'' historical attestation of Arameans as a people appears much later, in the inscriptions of [[Tiglath Pileser I]] (c. 1100 BC).<ref name=Lipinskip25>Lipinski, 2000, p. 25\u201327.</ref>\n\nNomadic pastoralists have long played a prominent role in the history and economy of the [[Middle East]], but their numbers seem to vary according to climatic conditions and the force of neighbouring states inducing permanent settlement. The period of the [[Late Bronze Age]] seems to have coincided with increasing aridity, which weakened neighbouring states and induced [[transhumance]] pastoralists to spend longer and longer periods with their flocks. Urban settlements (hitherto largely [[Amorite]], [[Canaan]]ite, [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Ugarit]]e inhabited) in [[The Levant]] diminished in size, until eventually fully nomadic pastoralist lifestyles came to dominate much of the region. These highly mobile, competitive tribesmen with their sudden raids continually threatened long-distance trade and interfered with the collection of taxes and tribute.\n\nThe people who had long been the prominent population within what is today Syria (called the ''Land of the Amurru'' during their tenure) were the [[Amorites]], a [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] speaking group of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semites]] who had appeared during the 25th century BC, destroying the hitherto dominant [[East Semitic]] speaking state of [[Ebla]], founding the powerful state of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in the Levant, and during the 19th century BC founding [[Babylonia]] in southern Mesopotamia. However, they seem to have been displaced or wholly absorbed by the appearance of a people called the [[Ahlamu]] by the 13th century BC, disappearing from history.\n\nAhlam\u00fb appears to be a [[generic term]] for a new wave of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic]] wanderers and nomads of varying origins who appeared during the 13th century BC across the Near East, Arabian Peninsula, Asia Minor, and Egypt. The presence of the Ahlam\u00fb is attested during the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365\u20131020 BC), which already ruled many of the lands in which the Ahlam\u00fb arose, in the Babylonian city of [[Nippur]] and even at [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Bahrain]]). [[Shalmaneser I]] (1274\u20131245 BC) is recorded as having defeated [[Shattuara]], King of the [[Mitanni]] and his [[Hittites|Hittite]] and Ahlam\u00fb mercenaries. In the following century, the Ahlam\u00fb cut the road from [[Babylon]] to [[Hattusas]], and [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1244\u20131208 BC) conquered [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Hanigalbat]] and [[Rapiqum]] on the [[Euphrates]] and \"the mountain of the Ahlam\u00fb\", apparently the region of [[Jebel Bishri]] in northern Syria.\n\nThe Arameans would appear to be one part of the larger generic Ahlam\u00fb group rather than synonymous with the Ahlamu.\n\n===Bronze Age collapse===\n[[File:Si Gabbor funeral stele Louvre AO3027.jpg|thumb|right|Funeral stele of Si` Gabbor, priest of the Moon God. Basalt, early 7th century BC, found in Neirab (Syria), bears an Aramaic inscription.]]\n\nThe emergence of the Arameans occurred during the [[Bronze Age collapse]] (1200\u2013900 BC), which saw great upheavals and mass movements of peoples across the [[Middle East]], [[Asia Minor]], [[The Caucasus]], [[East Mediterranean]], [[North Africa]], [[Ancient Iran]], [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Balkans]], leading to the genesis of new peoples and polities across these regions.\n\nThe first certain reference to the Arameans appears in an inscription of [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115\u20131077 BC), which refers to subjugating the \"Ahlam\u00fb-Aramaeans\" (''Ahlame Armaia''). Shortly after, the Ahlam\u00fb rapidly disappear from [[Assyria]]n annals, to be replaced by the Aramaeans (''Aramu, Arimi''). This indicates that the Arameans had risen to dominance amongst the nomads; however, it is possible that the two peoples had nothing in common, but operated in the same area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9005278/Akhlame|title=Akhlame|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> By the late 12th century BC, the Arameans were firmly established in [[Syria]]; however, they were conquered by the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], as had been the Amorites and Ahlamu before them.\n\nThe [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365\u20131050 BC), which had dominated the [[Near East]] and [[Asia Minor]] since the first half of the 14th century BC, began to shrink rapidly after the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]], its last great ruler in 1056 BC, and the Assyrian withdrawal allowed the Arameans and others to gain independence and take firm control of what was then [[Eber-Nari]] (and is today Syria) during the late 11th century BC. It is from this point that the region was called [[Aramea]].\n\nSome of the major Aramean speaking kingdoms included: [[Aram-Damascus]], [[Hamath]], [[Bit Adini]], [[Bit Bahiani]], [[Bit Hadipe]], [[Aram Rehob|Aram-Bet Rehob]], [[Aram-Zobah]], [[Bit-Zamani]], [[Bit-Halupe]] and [[Maacah|Aram-Ma'akah]], as well as the Aramean tribal polities of the [[Gambulu]], [[Litau]] and [[Puqudu]].<ref>Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', pp. 280-281</ref>\n\nLater [[Biblical]] sources tell us that [[Saul]], [[David]] and [[Solomon]] (late 11th to 10th centuries) fought against the small Aramean kingdoms ranged across the northern frontier of Israel: [[Zobah|Aram-S\u00f4vah]] in the [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]], [[Aram Rehob|Aram-B\u00eat-Rehob]] ([[Rehov]]) and [[Maacah|Aram-Ma'akah]] around [[Mount Hermon]], [[Geshur]] in the [[Hauran]], and [[Aram-Damascus]]. An Aramean king's account dating at least two centuries later, the [[Tel Dan Stele]], was discovered in northern Israel, and is famous for being perhaps the earliest non-Israelite extra-biblical historical reference to the Israelite royal dynasty, the [[Davidic line|House of David]]. In the early 11th century BC, much of Israel came under Aramean rule for eight years according to the Biblical [[Book of Judges]], until [[Othniel]] defeated the forces led by [[Chushan-Rishathaim]], the King of [[Aram-Naharaim]].<ref>Boling, Robert G., revised by Richard D. Nelson, Harper Collins Study Bible: The Book of Judges</ref>\n\nFurther north, the Arameans gained possession of Neo-Hittite [[Hamath]] on the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] and were soon to become strong enough to dissociate with the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speaking [[Neo-Hittite]] states.\n\nDuring the 11th and the 10th centuries BC, the Arameans conquered [[Sam'al]] (modern Zenjirli), also known as [[Yaudi]], the region from [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]] to [[Aleppo]], which they renamed [[Bit Agusi|B\u00eet-Agushi]], and [[Til Barsip]], which became the chief town of [[Bit Adini|B\u00eet-Adini]], also known as Beth Eden. North of [[Sam'al]] was the Aramean state of [[Bit-Gabbari]], which was sandwiched between the [[Syro-Hittite]] states of [[Carchemish]], [[Gurgum]], [[Khattina]], [[Unqi]] and the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] state of [[Tabal]].\n\nAt the same time, Arameans moved to the east of the [[Euphrates]], where they settled in such numbers that, for a time, the whole region became known as Aram-Naharaim or \"Aram of the two rivers\". Eastern Aramaean tribes spread into Babylonia and an Aramaean usurper was crowned king of Babylon under the name of Adad-apal-iddin.<ref name=brit/> One of their earliest semi-independent kingdoms in southern [[Mesopotamia]] was B\u00eet-Bahi\u00e2ni ([[Tell Halaf]]).\n\n===Neo-Assyrian Empire, 911\u2013605 BC===\n[[File:092.The Israelites Slaughter the Syrians.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] from the 1866 ''La Sainte Bible'' depicting an Israelite victory over the army of [[Ben-Hadad I|Ben-Hadad]], described in 1 Kings 20:26-34]]\nAssyrian annals from the end of the Middle Assyrian Empire c. 1050 BC and the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in 911 BC contain numerous descriptions of battles between Arameans and the Assyrian army.<ref>Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq''</ref> The Assyrians would launch repeated raids into Aramea, Babylonia, Ancient Iran, Elam, Asia Minor, and even as far as the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], in order to keep its trade routes open. The Aramean kingdoms, like much of the Near East and Asia Minor, were subjugated by the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911\u2013605 BC), beginning with the reign of [[Adad-nirari II]] in 911 BC, who cleared Arameans and other tribal peoples from the borders of Assyria, and began to expand in all directions (See [[Assyrian conquest of Aram]]). This process was continued by [[Ashurnasirpal II]], and his son [[Shalmaneser III]], who between them destroyed many of the small Aramean tribes, and conquered the whole of Aramea (modern Syria) for the [[Assyria]]ns. In 732 BC [[Aram-Damascus]] fell and was conquered by the Assyrian king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]]. The Assyrians named their Aramean colonies [[Eber Nari]], whilst still using the term Aramean to describe many of its peoples. The Assyrians conducted forced deportations of hundreds of thousands Arameans into both Assyria and Babylonia (where a migrant population already existed).<ref>^ \"The destruction of the Assyrian Empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers, and since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, descendants of the Assyrian peasants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carried on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries, and after various vicissitudes, these people became Christians. These Christians, and the Jewish communities scattered amongst them, not only kept alive the memory of their Assyrian predecessors but also combined them with traditions from the Bible.\" - [[H. W. F. Saggs]]. ''The Might That Was Assyria''. pp. 290</ref> Conversely, the eastern Aramaic language was adopted as the ''lingua franca'' of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BC, and the native Assyrians and Babylonians began to make a gradual language shift to distinctly Mesopotamian [[Eastern Aramaic]] dialects (including the [[Syriac language]], which evolved in 5th century BC Assyria) and still survives to this day amongst the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]] and [[Mandeans]] of northern [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northeast [[Syria]] and northwest [[Iran]].\n\nThe Neo Assyrian Empire descended into a bitter series of brutal internal civil wars from 626 BC, weakening it greatly. This allowed a coalition of many its former subject peoples; the [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Scythians]], [[Sargatians]] and [[Cimmerians]] to attack Assyria in 616 BC, sacking [[Nineveh]] in 612 BC, and finally defeating it between 605 and 599 BC. During the war against Assyria, hordes of horse borne Scythian and Cimmerian marauders ravaged through Aramea and all the way into Egypt.\n\nAramea/Eber-Nari was then ruled by the succeeding [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (612\u2013539 BC), initially headed by a short lived [[Chaldea]]n dynasty. The Aramean regions became a battleground between the Babylonians and the [[Egypt]]ian 26th Dynasty, which had been installed by the Assyrians as vassals after they had conquered Egypt, ejected the previous [[Nubia]]n dynasty and destroyed the [[Kushite Empire]]. The Egyptians, having entered the region in a belated attempt to aid their former Assyrian masters, fought the Babylonians (initially with the help of remnants of the Assyrian army) in the region for decades before being finally vanquished.\n\nThe Babylonians remained masters of the Aramean lands only until 539 BC, when the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] overthrew [[Nabonidus]], the Assyrian born last king of Babylon, who had himself previously overthrown the Chaldean dynasty in 556 BC.\n\n===Classic era===\nThe Arameans were later conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539\u2013332 BC). However, little changed from the Assyrian period, as the Persians, seeing themselves as successors to the Assyrians and having spent three centuries under Assyrian rule, maintained Imperial Aramaic as the state language, together with Assyrian administrative structures, and the name [[Eber Nari]] still applied to the region.\n\nHowever, during the Greek [[Seleucid Empire]] (312\u2013150 BC), when the Greeks conquered [[Assyria]] from the Achaemenids, they applied the 9th century BC [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] name for ''Assyria'' to that land, which read ''Syria'', a derivative of \"\ud808\udc38\ud808\uded7\ud808\udc7a \ud800\udfb9\" [[A\u0161\u0161\u016br\u0101yu]], which had hitherto only referred historically and geographically to Assyria and the Assyrians, a land and people in modern terms situated in the northern half of Iraq, north-eastern Syria, south-eastern Turkey and the north-western fringe of Iran, and not to the Levant or its largely Aramean populace<ref>The Encyclopedia Americana.

From the late 4th or early 3rd century BC the Seleucid Greeks also applied this name to Aram/Eber-Nari to the west of Assyria/Syria, which had been an Assyrian colony for three centuries. This caused both the Assyrians from Assyria and the Arameans to the west in Aram, to be labelled ''Syrians'' (and later ''Syriacs'') in [[Greco-Roman]] culture, despite the two peoples being geographically, historically and ethnically distinct from one another.<ref>Silvio Zaorani (Turin, 1993) under the chapter entitled \"The Modern Assyrians - Name and Nation\", pp. 106-107)</ref> This confusion would continue in the Western world until modern times with the ''Syria versus Assyria naming controversy'' (see [[Name of Syria]]).\n\nThe [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s followed, with the Aramean lands becoming the front line initially between the Parthian and Roman empires, and then between the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] and Byzantine Empires. There was also a brief period of [[Armenia]]n rule during the Roman Period. Between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, the Arameans began to adopt [[Christianity]] in place of the polytheist [[Aramean religion]], and the Levant became an important centre of [[Syriac Christianity]], along with Assyria to the east from where the [[Syriac language]] and [[Syriac script]] emerged.\n\nSyriac Christianity survives among the indigenous pre-Arab population to the present day. Arameans continued to be the majority population in their homeland (most of modern [[Syria]] and part of south-central [[Asia Minor]]) until well after the [[Arab]] [[Islamic Conquest]] of the mid-7th century AD. A number of Aramaean kingdoms sprang up in the region, the most important being [[Palmyra]], (which for a brief period became the [[Palmyrene Empire]], rivaling Rome). There was probably some synthesis with pre-Islamic [[Arab]] migrants in the southern deserts (and possibly [[Greeks]] and [[Phoenicians]] also).\n\n===Legacy and modern Aramean identity===\n{{see|Aramean identity|Western Neo-Aramaic language|Syriac Christianity}}\nAfter the Arab Islamic conquest of the region in the 7th century AD, native Arameans gradually became a minority in their homelands, the language was gradually replaced by [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as increasing numbers of Arabs (together with [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Iranian peoples]]) began to move into the region. Many Syriac Christians still speak various [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Aramaic]] dialects, including a small number of Arameans who still speak the [[Western Neo-Aramaic language]].\n\nAn [[Aramean identity]] is mainly held by a number of [[Syriac Christians]] in southcentral [[Turkey]], southeastern Turkey, western, central, northern and southern Syria and in the [[Aramean diaspora]] especially in Germany and Sweden.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In 2014, Israel recognized the [[Arameans in Israel|Aramean minority]], an Arabic- and Aramaic-speaking Christian community.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/24936/Default.aspx|title = Israeli Christians Officially Recognized as Arameans, Not Arabs|date = September 18, 2014|accessdate = 27 April 2015|website = Israel Today|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref name=\"Arutz Sheva\"/>\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Old Aramaic language}}\n{{Further|Aramaic language}}\nArameans are mostly defined by their use of the West Semitic [[Old Aramaic language]] (1100 BC \u2013 AD 200), first written using the [[Phoenician alphabet]], over time modified to a specifically-[[Aramaic alphabet]].\n\nAs early as the 8th century BC, Aramaic competed with the East Semitic [[Akkadian language]] and script in [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]], and it spread then throughout the [[Near East]] in various dialects. By around 800 BC, Aramaic had become the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]]. Although marginalized by Greek in the [[Hellenistic period]], Aramaic in its varying dialects remained unchallenged as the common language of all [[Semitic peoples]] of the region until the [[Arab]] [[Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia]] in the 7th century AD, when it became gradually superseded by Arabic.\n\nThe late Old Aramaic language of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and [[Achaemenid]] [[Persian Empire]] developed into the Middle Aramaic [[Syriac language]] of [[Persia]]n [[Assyria]], which would become the liturgical language of [[Syriac Christianity]]. The descendant dialects of this branch of [[Eastern Aramaic]], which still retains [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] loanwords, still survive as the spoken and written language of the [[Assyrian people]]. It is found mostly in northern [[Iraq]], northwestern [[Iran]], southeastern [[Turkey]] and northeastern [[Syria]] and, to a lesser degree, in migrant communities in [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], southern Russia, [[Lebanon]], Israel, [[Jordan]] and [[Azerbaijan]] as well as in diaspora communities in the West, particularly the United States, Canada, [[Great Britain]] and Sweden, Australia and Germany. A small number of [[Israeli Jews]], particularly those originating from Iraq and, to a lesser degree, Iran and eastern [[Turkey]], still speak  Eastern Aramaic, but it is largely being eroded by [[Hebrew]], especially within the Israeli-born generations.\n\nThe [[Western Neo-Aramaic|Western Aramaic]] dialect is now only spoken by Muslims and Christians in [[Ma'loula]], [[Jubb'adin]] and [[Al-Sarkha (Bakhah)|Bakhah]]. [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] is spoken by up to 75,000 speakers of the ethnically-Mesopotamian [[Gnostic]] [[Mandaeans|Mandaean]] sect, mainly in [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]].\n\n==Religion and art==\n{{See also|Canaanite religion}}\nIt appears from their inscriptions as well as from their names that Arameans worshipped [[Mesopotamian]] gods such as [[Haddad]] ([[Adad]]), [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], [[Ishtar]] (whom they called [[Astarte]]), [[Shamash]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]] and [[Nergal]], and [[Canaan|Canaanite]]-[[Phoenicia]]n deities such as the storm-god, [[El (deity)|El]], the supreme deity of Canaan, in addition to [[Anat]] (\u2018Atta) and others.\n\nThe Arameans who lived outside their homelands apparently followed the traditions of the country where they settled. The King of [[Damascus]], for instance, employed [[Phoenicia]]n sculptors and ivory-carvers. In Tell Halaf-Guzana, the palace of [[Kapara]], an Arameans ruler (9th century BC), was decorated with orthostats and with statues that display a mixture of [[Mesopotamian]], [[Hittites|Hittite]], and [[Hurrian]] influences.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Arameans in Israel]]\n* [[Aramaic language]]\n* [[Maronites in Israel]]\n* [[Assyrians in Israel]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Commons category|Aramaeans}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* S.

They established a patchwork of independent Aramaic kingdoms in the [[Levant]] and seized tracts of [[Anatolia]] as well as briefly conquering [[Babylonia]].\n\nThe Arameans never formed a unified state but had small independent kingdoms across parts of the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]], (present-day [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Israel]], [[Palestinian territories]], the northwestern [[Arabian peninsula]] and south-central [[Turkey]]). Their political influence was confined to a number of states such as [[Aram Damascus]], [[Hamath]], [[Palmyra]], [[Aleppo]] and the partly Aramean [[Syro-Hittite states]], which were entirely absorbed into the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (935\u2013605 BC) by the 9th century BC. In the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the Aramaeans, Chaldeans, Suteans and indigenous Assyrians-Babylonians became largely indistinguishable, as these groups were culturally and ethnically absorbed into the native populace of Mesopotamia.<ref name=brit>\n[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aramaean \"Aramaean (people)\"]. ''Encyclopaedia Britannica.''\n</ref>\n\nBy contrast, [[Imperial Aramaic]] came to be the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the entire [[Near East]] and [[Asia Minor]] after King [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] of Assyria (ruled 745\u2013727 BC) made it one of two official languages of the vast [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (the other being [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]) in the mid-8th century BC, in recognition of the mostly-Aramean speaking population in areas Assyria had conquered west of the [[Euphrates]] and the large numbers of Arameans in Mesopotamia. This empire stretched from [[Cyprus]] and the [[East Mediterranean]] in the west to [[Persia]] and [[Elam]] in the east, and from [[Armenia]] and the [[Caucasus]] in the north to [[Egypt]], [[Libya]] and [[Arabia]] in the south. The [[Achaemenid Empire]] ({{circa}} 550\u2013330 BC) greatly spread Imperial Aramaic: north to the coast of the Black Sea and eastward to the [[Indus Valley]]. This version of Aramaic, influenced by [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and later by [[Old Persian]], later developed into the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] dialect of [[Edessa]].\n\nBetween the 1st and 4th centuries AD, the Arameans began to adopt [[Christianity]] in place of the polytheist [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Aramean religion]], and the Levant became an important centre of [[Syriac Christianity]], along with the Aramean kingdom Osroene to the east from where the [[Syriac language]] and [[Syriac script]] emerged.\n\nUse of the [[Western Aramaic]] language has steadily declined in the face of [[Arabic]] since the [[Islamic conquest]] of the area in the 7th century AD, and the last vestiges of the spoken tongue in and around [[Maalula]] are in danger of extinction, although [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population maintain spoken dialects of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] influenced [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]] as well as [[Syriac language|Syriac]] as a [[liturgical language]]. Similarly, some [[Jewish]] communities and the [[Mandean]] people also retain dialects of Aramaic. Today, an [[Aramean identity]] is mainly held by a small number of largely Arabic-speaking [[Syriac Christians]] in south-central [[Turkey]], in Syria, and in the [[Aramean diaspora]] overseas. In 2014, Israel recognized the [[Arameans in Israel|Aramean minority]], an Arabic- and Aramaic-speaking Christian community.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/24936/Default.aspx|title = Israeli Christians Officially Recognized as Arameans, Not Arabs|date = September 18, 2014|accessdate = 27 April 2015 |website = Israel Today|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref name=\"Arutz Sheva\">{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/304458|title=Ministry of Interior to Admit Arameans to National Population Registry - Latest News Briefs - Arutz Sheva|work=Arutz Sheva}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Arameans}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Aramean funeral stele Louvre AO3026.jpg|left|thumb|Basalt funeral stele bearing an Aramaic inscription, c. 7th century BC.

One of the annals of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]] (c. 2250 BC) mentions that he captured \"Dubul, the [[ens\u00ed]] of ''A-ra-me''\" (''Arame'' is seemingly a [[genitive]] form), in the course of a campaign against [[Simurrum]] in the northern mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/yearnames/HTML/T2K3.htm|title=T2K3.htm|publisher=UCLA}}</ref> Other early references to a place or people of \"Aram\" have appeared at the archives of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] (c. 1900 BC) and at [[Ugarit]] (c. 1300 BC).\n\nHowever, there is absolutely no historical, archaeological or linguistic evidence that the ''Aramu'', ''Armi'' or ''Arame'' were actually Arameans or even related to them; and the earliest ''undisputed'' historical attestation of Arameans as a people appears much later, in the inscriptions of [[Tiglath Pileser I]] (c. 1100 BC).<ref name=Lipinskip25>Lipinski, 2000, p. 25\u201327.</ref>\n\nNomadic pastoralists have long played a prominent role in the history and economy of the [[Middle East]], but their numbers seem to vary according to climatic conditions and the force of neighbouring states inducing permanent settlement. The period of the [[Late Bronze Age]] seems to have coincided with increasing aridity, which weakened neighbouring states and induced [[transhumance]] pastoralists to spend longer and longer periods with their flocks. Urban settlements (hitherto largely [[Amorite]], [[Canaan]]ite, [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Ugarit]]e inhabited) in [[The Levant]] diminished in size, until eventually fully nomadic pastoralist lifestyles came to dominate much of the region. These highly mobile, competitive tribesmen with their sudden raids continually threatened long-distance trade and interfered with the collection of taxes and tribute.\n\nThe people who had long been the prominent population within what is today Syria (called the ''Land of the Amurru'' during their tenure) were the [[Amorites]], a [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] speaking group of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semites]] who had appeared during the 25th century BC, destroying the hitherto dominant [[East Semitic]] speaking state of [[Ebla]], founding the powerful state of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in the Levant, and during the 19th century BC founding [[Babylonia]] in southern Mesopotamia. However, they seem to have been displaced or wholly absorbed by the appearance of a people called the [[Ahlamu]] by the 13th century BC, disappearing from history.\n\nAhlam\u00fb appears to be a [[generic term]] for a new wave of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic]] wanderers and nomads of varying origins who appeared during the 13th century BC across the Near East, Arabian Peninsula, Asia Minor, and Egypt. The presence of the Ahlam\u00fb is attested during the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365\u20131020 BC), which already ruled many of the lands in which the Ahlam\u00fb arose, in the Babylonian city of [[Nippur]] and even at [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Bahrain]]). [[Shalmaneser I]] (1274\u20131245 BC) is recorded as having defeated [[Shattuara]], King of the [[Mitanni]] and his [[Hittites|Hittite]] and Ahlam\u00fb mercenaries. In the following century, the Ahlam\u00fb cut the road from [[Babylon]] to [[Hattusas]], and [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1244\u20131208 BC) conquered [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Hanigalbat]] and [[Rapiqum]] on the [[Euphrates]] and \"the mountain of the Ahlam\u00fb\", apparently the region of [[Jebel Bishri]] in northern Syria.\n\nThe Arameans would appear to be one part of the larger generic Ahlam\u00fb group rather than synonymous with the Ahlamu.\n\n===Bronze Age collapse===\n[[File:Si Gabbor funeral stele Louvre AO3027.jpg|thumb|right|Funeral stele of Si` Gabbor, priest of the Moon God. Basalt, early 7th century BC, found in Neirab (Syria), bears an Aramaic inscription.]]\n\nThe emergence of the Arameans occurred during the [[Bronze Age collapse]] (1200\u2013900 BC), which saw great upheavals and mass movements of peoples across the [[Middle East]], [[Asia Minor]], [[The Caucasus]], [[East Mediterranean]], [[North Africa]], [[Ancient Iran]], [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Balkans]], leading to the genesis of new peoples and polities across these regions.\n\nThe first certain reference to the Arameans appears in an inscription of [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115\u20131077 BC), which refers to subjugating the \"Ahlam\u00fb-Aramaeans\" (''Ahlame Armaia''). Shortly after, the Ahlam\u00fb rapidly disappear from [[Assyria]]n annals, to be replaced by the Aramaeans (''Aramu, Arimi''). This indicates that the Arameans had risen to dominance amongst the nomads; however, it is possible that the two peoples had nothing in common, but operated in the same area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9005278/Akhlame|title=Akhlame|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> By the late 12th century BC, the Arameans were firmly established in [[Syria]]; however, they were conquered by the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], as had been the Amorites and Ahlamu before them.\n\nThe [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365\u20131050 BC), which had dominated the [[Near East]] and [[Asia Minor]] since the first half of the 14th century BC, began to shrink rapidly after the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]], its last great ruler in 1056 BC, and the Assyrian withdrawal allowed the Arameans and others to gain independence and take firm control of what was then [[Eber-Nari]] (and is today Syria) during the late 11th century BC. It is from this point that the region was called [[Aramea]].\n\nSome of the major Aramean speaking kingdoms included: [[Aram-Damascus]], [[Hamath]], [[Bit Adini]], [[Bit Bahiani]], [[Bit Hadipe]], [[Aram Rehob|Aram-Bet Rehob]], [[Aram-Zobah]], [[Bit-Zamani]], [[Bit-Halupe]] and [[Maacah|Aram-Ma'akah]], as well as the Aramean tribal polities of the [[Gambulu]], [[Litau]] and [[Puqudu]].<ref>Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', pp. 280-281</ref>\n\nLater [[Biblical]] sources tell us that [[Saul]], [[David]] and [[Solomon]] (late 11th to 10th centuries) fought against the small Aramean kingdoms ranged across the northern frontier of Israel: [[Zobah|Aram-S\u00f4vah]] in the [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]], [[Aram Rehob|Aram-B\u00eat-Rehob]] ([[Rehov]]) and [[Maacah|Aram-Ma'akah]] around [[Mount Hermon]], [[Geshur]] in the [[Hauran]], and [[Aram-Damascus]]. An Aramean king's account dating at least two centuries later, the [[Tel Dan Stele]], was discovered in northern Israel, and is famous for being perhaps the earliest non-Israelite extra-biblical historical reference to the Israelite royal dynasty, the [[Davidic line|House of David]]. In the early 11th century BC, much of Israel came under Aramean rule for eight years according to the Biblical [[Book of Judges]], until [[Othniel]] defeated the forces led by [[Chushan-Rishathaim]], the King of [[Aram-Naharaim]].<ref>Boling, Robert G., revised by Richard D. Nelson, Harper Collins Study Bible: The Book of Judges</ref>\n\nFurther north, the Arameans gained possession of Neo-Hittite [[Hamath]] on the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] and were soon to become strong enough to dissociate with the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speaking [[Neo-Hittite]] states.\n\nDuring the 11th and the 10th centuries BC, the Arameans conquered [[Sam'al]] (modern Zenjirli), also known as [[Yaudi]], the region from [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]] to [[Aleppo]], which they renamed [[Bit Agusi|B\u00eet-Agushi]], and [[Til Barsip]], which became the chief town of [[Bit Adini|B\u00eet-Adini]], also known as Beth Eden. North of [[Sam'al]] was the Aramean state of [[Bit-Gabbari]], which was sandwiched between the [[Syro-Hittite]] states of [[Carchemish]], [[Gurgum]], [[Khattina]], [[Unqi]] and the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] state of [[Tabal]].\n\nAt the same time, Arameans moved to the east of the [[Euphrates]], where they settled in such numbers that, for a time, the whole region became known as Aram-Naharaim or \"Aram of the two rivers\". Eastern Aramaean tribes spread into Babylonia and an Aramaean usurper was crowned king of Babylon under the name of Adad-apal-iddin.<ref name=brit/> One of their earliest semi-independent kingdoms in southern [[Mesopotamia]] was B\u00eet-Bahi\u00e2ni ([[Tell Halaf]]).\n\n===Neo-Assyrian Empire, 911\u2013605 BC===\n[[File:092.The Israelites Slaughter the Syrians.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] from the 1866 ''La Sainte Bible'' depicting an Israelite victory over the army of [[Ben-Hadad I|Ben-Hadad]], described in 1 Kings 20:26-34]]\nAssyrian annals from the end of the Middle Assyrian Empire c. 1050 BC and the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in 911 BC contain numerous descriptions of battles between Arameans and the Assyrian army.<ref>Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq''</ref> The Assyrians would launch repeated raids into Aramea, Babylonia, Ancient Iran, Elam, Asia Minor, and even as far as the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], in order to keep its trade routes open. The Aramean kingdoms, like much of the Near East and Asia Minor, were subjugated by the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911\u2013605 BC), beginning with the reign of [[Adad-nirari II]] in 911 BC, who cleared Arameans and other tribal peoples from the borders of Assyria, and began to expand in all directions (See [[Assyrian conquest of Aram]]). This process was continued by [[Ashurnasirpal II]], and his son [[Shalmaneser III]], who between them destroyed many of the small Aramean tribes, and conquered the whole of Aramea (modern Syria) for the [[Assyria]]ns. In 732 BC [[Aram-Damascus]] fell and was conquered by the Assyrian king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]]. The Assyrians named their Aramean colonies [[Eber Nari]], whilst still using the term Aramean to describe many of its peoples. The Assyrians conducted forced deportations of hundreds of thousands Arameans into both Assyria and Babylonia (where a migrant population already existed).<ref>^ \"The destruction of the Assyrian Empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers, and since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, descendants of the Assyrian peasants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carried on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries, and after various vicissitudes, these people became Christians. These Christians, and the Jewish communities scattered amongst them, not only kept alive the memory of their Assyrian predecessors but also combined them with traditions from the Bible.\" - [[H. W. F. Saggs]]. ''The Might That Was Assyria''. pp. 290</ref> Conversely, the eastern Aramaic language was adopted as the ''lingua franca'' of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BC, and the native Assyrians and Babylonians began to make a gradual language shift to distinctly Mesopotamian [[Eastern Aramaic]] dialects (including the [[Syriac language]], which evolved in 5th century BC Assyria) and still survives to this day amongst the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]] and [[Mandeans]] of northern [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northeast [[Syria]] and northwest [[Iran]].\n\nThe Neo Assyrian Empire descended into a bitter series of brutal internal civil wars from 626 BC, weakening it greatly. This allowed a coalition of many its former subject peoples; the [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Scythians]], [[Sargatians]] and [[Cimmerians]] to attack Assyria in 616 BC, sacking [[Nineveh]] in 612 BC, and finally defeating it between 605 and 599 BC. During the war against Assyria, hordes of horse borne Scythian and Cimmerian marauders ravaged through Aramea and all the way into Egypt.\n\nAramea/Eber-Nari was then ruled by the succeeding [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (612\u2013539 BC), initially headed by a short lived [[Chaldea]]n dynasty. The Aramean regions became a battleground between the Babylonians and the [[Egypt]]ian 26th Dynasty, which had been installed by the Assyrians as vassals after they had conquered Egypt, ejected the previous [[Nubia]]n dynasty and destroyed the [[Kushite Empire]]. The Egyptians, having entered the region in a belated attempt to aid their former Assyrian masters, fought the Babylonians (initially with the help of remnants of the Assyrian army) in the region for decades before being finally vanquished.\n\nThe Babylonians remained masters of the Aramean lands only until 539 BC, when the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] overthrew [[Nabonidus]], the Assyrian born last king of Babylon, who had himself previously overthrown the Chaldean dynasty in 556 BC.\n\n===Classic era===\nThe Arameans were later conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539\u2013332 BC). However, little changed from the Assyrian period, as the Persians, seeing themselves as successors to the Assyrians and having spent three centuries under Assyrian rule, maintained Imperial Aramaic as the state language, together with Assyrian administrative structures, and the name [[Eber Nari]] still applied to the region.\n\nHowever, during the Greek [[Seleucid Empire]] (312\u2013150 BC), when the Greeks conquered [[Assyria]] from the Achaemenids, they applied the 9th century BC [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] name for ''Assyria'' to that land, which read ''Syria'', a derivative of \"\ud808\udc38\ud808\uded7\ud808\udc7a \ud800\udfb9\" [[A\u0161\u0161\u016br\u0101yu]], which had hitherto only referred historically and geographically to Assyria and the Assyrians, a land and people in modern terms situated in the northern half of Iraq, north-eastern Syria, south-eastern Turkey and the north-western fringe of Iran, and not to the Levant or its largely Aramean populace<ref>The Encyclopedia Americana.

From the late 4th or early 3rd century BC the Seleucid Greeks also applied this name to Aram/Eber-Nari to the west of Assyria/Syria, which had been an Assyrian colony for three centuries. This caused both the Assyrians from Assyria and the Arameans to the west in Aram, to be labelled ''Syrians'' (and later ''Syriacs'') in [[Greco-Roman]] culture, despite the two peoples being geographically, historically and ethnically distinct from one another.<ref>Silvio Zaorani (Turin, 1993) under the chapter entitled \"The Modern Assyrians - Name and Nation\", pp. 106-107)</ref> This confusion would continue in the Western world until modern times with the ''Syria versus Assyria naming controversy'' (see [[Name of Syria]]).\n\nThe [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s followed, with the Aramean lands becoming the front line initially between the Parthian and Roman empires, and then between the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] and Byzantine Empires. There was also a brief period of [[Armenia]]n rule during the Roman Period. Between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, the Arameans began to adopt [[Christianity]] in place of the polytheist [[Aramean religion]], and the Levant became an important centre of [[Syriac Christianity]], along with Assyria to the east from where the [[Syriac language]] and [[Syriac script]] emerged.\n\nSyriac Christianity survives among the indigenous pre-Arab population to the present day. Arameans continued to be the majority population in their homeland (most of modern [[Syria]] and part of south-central [[Asia Minor]]) until well after the [[Arab]] [[Islamic Conquest]] of the mid-7th century AD. A number of Aramaean kingdoms sprang up in the region, the most important being [[Palmyra]], (which for a brief period became the [[Palmyrene Empire]], rivaling Rome). There was probably some synthesis with pre-Islamic [[Arab]] migrants in the southern deserts (and possibly [[Greeks]] and [[Phoenicians]] also).\n\n===Legacy and modern Aramean identity===\n{{see|Aramean identity|Western Neo-Aramaic language|Syriac Christianity}}\nAfter the Arab Islamic conquest of the region in the 7th century AD, native Arameans gradually became a minority in their homelands, the language was gradually replaced by [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as increasing numbers of Arabs (together with [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Iranian peoples]]) began to move into the region. Many Syriac Christians still speak various [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Aramaic]] dialects, including a small number of Arameans who still speak the [[Western Neo-Aramaic language]].\n\nAn [[Aramean identity]] is mainly held by a number of [[Syriac Christians]] in southcentral [[Turkey]], southeastern Turkey, western, central, northern and southern Syria and in the [[Aramean diaspora]] especially in Germany and Sweden.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In 2014, Israel recognized the [[Arameans in Israel|Aramean minority]], an Arabic- and Aramaic-speaking Christian community.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/24936/Default.aspx|title = Israeli Christians Officially Recognized as Arameans, Not Arabs|date = September 18, 2014|accessdate = 27 April 2015|website = Israel Today|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref name=\"Arutz Sheva\"/>\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Old Aramaic language}}\n{{Further|Aramaic language}}\nArameans are mostly defined by their use of the West Semitic [[Old Aramaic language]] (1100 BC \u2013 AD 200), first written using the [[Phoenician alphabet]], over time modified to a specifically-[[Aramaic alphabet]].\n\nAs early as the 8th century BC, Aramaic competed with the East Semitic [[Akkadian language]] and script in [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]], and it spread then throughout the [[Near East]] in various dialects. By around 800 BC, Aramaic had become the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]]. Although marginalized by Greek in the [[Hellenistic period]], Aramaic in its varying dialects remained unchallenged as the common language of all [[Semitic peoples]] of the region until the [[Arab]] [[Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia]] in the 7th century AD, when it became gradually superseded by Arabic.\n\nThe late Old Aramaic language of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and [[Achaemenid]] [[Persian Empire]] developed into the Middle Aramaic [[Syriac language]] of [[Persia]]n [[Assyria]], which would become the liturgical language of [[Syriac Christianity]]. The descendant dialects of this branch of [[Eastern Aramaic]], which still retains [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] loanwords, still survive as the spoken and written language of the [[Assyrian people]]. It is found mostly in northern [[Iraq]], northwestern [[Iran]], southeastern [[Turkey]] and northeastern [[Syria]] and, to a lesser degree, in migrant communities in [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], southern Russia, [[Lebanon]], Israel, [[Jordan]] and [[Azerbaijan]] as well as in diaspora communities in the West, particularly the United States, Canada, [[Great Britain]] and Sweden, Australia and Germany. A small number of [[Israeli Jews]], particularly those originating from Iraq and, to a lesser degree, Iran and eastern [[Turkey]], still speak  Eastern Aramaic, but it is largely being eroded by [[Hebrew]], especially within the Israeli-born generations.\n\nThe [[Western Neo-Aramaic|Western Aramaic]] dialect is now only spoken by Muslims and Christians in [[Ma'loula]], [[Jubb'adin]] and [[Al-Sarkha (Bakhah)|Bakhah]]. [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] is spoken by up to 75,000 speakers of the ethnically-Mesopotamian [[Gnostic]] [[Mandaeans|Mandaean]] sect, mainly in [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]].\n\n==Religion and art==\n{{See also|Canaanite religion}}\nIt appears from their inscriptions as well as from their names that Arameans worshipped [[Mesopotamian]] gods such as [[Haddad]] ([[Adad]]), [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], [[Ishtar]] (whom they called [[Astarte]]), [[Shamash]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]] and [[Nergal]], and [[Canaanite]]-[[Phoenicia]]n deities such as the storm-god, [[El (deity)|El]], the supreme deity of Canaan, in addition to [[Anat]] (\u2018Atta) and others.\n\nThe Arameans who lived outside their homelands apparently followed the traditions of the country where they settled. The King of [[Damascus]], for instance, employed [[Phoenicia]]n sculptors and ivory-carvers. In Tell Halaf-Guzana, the palace of [[Kapara]], an Arameans ruler (9th century BC), was decorated with orthostats and with statues that display a mixture of [[Mesopotamian]], [[Hittites|Hittite]], and [[Hurrian]] influences.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Arameans in Israel]]\n* [[Aramaic language]]\n* [[Maronites in Israel]]\n* [[Assyrians in Israel]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Commons category|Aramaeans}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* S.

It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.<ref name=\"Fisher1\">{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YToEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=application+programming+interface&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWlZHBrYPoAhXlQd8KHWiECLMQ6AEwBHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=application%20programming%20interface&f=false |title=OS/2 EE to Get 3270 Interface Early |last=Fisher |first=Sharon |date=1989 |website=Google Books}}</ref> An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be designed based on an industry standard to ensure interoperability. Some APIs have to be documented, others are designed so that they can be \"interrogated\" to determine supported functionality. Since other components/systems rely only on the API, the system that provides the API can (ideally) change its internal details \"behind\" that API without affecting its users.  \n\nToday, with the rise of [[REST]] and [[web services]] over [[HTTP]], the term is often assumed to refer to APIs of such services when given no other context (see the [[#Web APIs|Web APIs]] section).  \n\nSometimes the term API is, by extension, used to refer to the subset of software entities (code, subcomponents, modules, etc.) that serve to actually implement the API of some encompassing component or system.\n\n== Purpose ==\nIn building applications, an API (application programming interface) simplifies programming by [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstracting]] the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs. While a graphical interface for an [[email client]] might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file [[input/output]] might give the developer a [[Subroutine|function]] that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the [[Journaling file system|file system]] operations occurring behind the scenes.<ref name=\"Clarke4\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/measuring-api-usability/184405654 |title=Measuring API Usability |last=3333Clarke |first=Steven |date=2004 |website=Dr. Dobb's |access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\n\n===Libraries and frameworks===\nAn API usually is related to a [[library (computing)|software library]]. The API describes and prescribes the \"expected behavior\" (a specification) while the library is an \"actual implementation\" of this set of rules.\n\nA single API can have multiple implementations (or none, being abstract) in the form of different libraries that share the same programming interface.\n\nThe separation of the API from its implementation can allow programs written in one language to use a library written in another. For example, because [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] compile to compatible [[bytecode]], Scala developers can take advantage of any Java API.<ref name=\"OderskySpoonVenners8\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/combining-scala-and-java.html |title=Combining Scala and Java |last=Odersky |first=Martin |last2=Spoon |first2=Lex |date=10 December 2008 |website=www.artima.com |access-date=29 July 2016 |last3=Venners |first3=Bill}}</ref>\n\nAPI use can vary depending on the type of programming language involved.\nAn API for a [[procedural programming|procedural language]] such as [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] could consist primarily of basic routines to execute code, manipulate data or handle errors while an API for an [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented language]], such as Java, would provide a specification of classes and its [[class method]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=de Figueiredo |first=Luiz Henrique |last2=Ierusalimschy |first2=Roberto |last3=Filho |first3=Waldemar Celes |title=The design and implementation of a language for extending applications |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2778436 |journal=TeCGraf Grupo de Tecnologia Em Computacao Grafica |access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Sintes16\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077392/java-se/just-what-is-the-java-api-anyway.html |title=Just what is the Java API anyway? |last=Sintes |first=Tony |date=2001-07-13 |website=JavaWorld |access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Language binding]]s are also APIs.

An API approach is an architectural approach that revolves around providing a program interface to a set of services to different applications serving different types of consumers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/apis_for_dsi.pdf |title=API-fication |date=August 2014 |website=www.hcltech.com |format=PDF download}}</ref>\n\nWhen used in the context of [[Web development tools|web development]], an API is typically defined as a set of specifications, such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, usually in an Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]) or JavaScript Object Notation ([[JSON]]) format. An example might be a shipping company API that can be added to an eCommerce-focused website to facilitate ordering shipping services and automatically include current shipping rates, without the site developer having to enter the shipper's rate table into a web database. While \"web API\" historically has been virtually synonymous with [[web service]], the recent trend (so-called [[Web 2.0]]) has been moving away from Simple Object Access Protocol ([[SOAP]]) based web services and [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA) towards more direct [[representational state transfer]] (REST) style [[web resource]]s and [[resource-oriented architecture]] (ROA).<ref>{{cite web\n |first        = Djamal\n |last         = Benslimane\n |author2      = Schahram Dustdar\n |author3      = Amit Sheth\n |title        = Services Mashups: The New Generation of Web Applications\n |url          = http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline/2008/09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |work         = IEEE Internet Computing, vol. 12, no. 5\n |publisher    = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n |pages        = 13\u201315\n |year         = 2008\n |access-date  = 2019-10-01\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928211221/http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline%2F2008%2F09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |archive-date = 2011-09-28\n |url-status   = dead\n}}</ref> Part of this trend is related to the [[Semantic Web]] movement toward [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), a concept to promote web-based [[ontology engineering]] technologies.

It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.<ref name=\"Fisher1\">{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YToEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=application+programming+interface&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWlZHBrYPoAhXlQd8KHWiECLMQ6AEwBHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=application%20programming%20interface&f=false |title=OS/2 EE to Get 3270 Interface Early |last=Fisher |first=Sharon |date=1989 |website=Google Books}}</ref> An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be designed based on an industry standard to ensure interoperability. Some APIs have to be documented, others are designed so that they can be \"interrogated\" to determine supported functionality. Since other components/systems rely only on the API, the system that provides the API can (ideally) change its internal details \"behind\" that API without affecting its users.  \n\nToday, with the rise of [[REST]] and [[web services]] over [[HTTP]], the term is often assumed to refer to APIs of such services when given no other context (see the [[#Web APIs|Web APIs]] section).  \n\nSometimes the term API is, by extension, used to refer to the subset of software entities (code, subcomponents, modules, etc.) that serve to actually implement the API of some encompassing component or system.\n\n== Purpose ==\nIn building applications, an API (application programming interface) simplifies programming by [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstracting]] the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs. While a graphical interface for an [[email client]] might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file [[input/output]] might give the developer a [[Subroutine|function]] that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the [[Journaling file system|file system]] operations occurring behind the scenes.<ref name=\"Clarke4\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/measuring-api-usability/184405654 |title=Measuring API Usability |last=3333Clarke |first=Steven |date=2004 |website=Dr. Dobb's |access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\n\n===Libraries and frameworks===\nAn API usually is related to a [[library (computing)|software library]]. The API describes and prescribes the \"expected behavior\" (a specification) while the library is an \"actual implementation\" of this set of rules.\n\nA single API can have multiple implementations (or none, being abstract) in the form of different libraries that share the same programming interface.\n\nThe separation of the API from its implementation can allow programs written in one language to use a library written in another. For example, because [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] compile to compatible [[bytecode]], Scala developers can take advantage of any Java API.<ref name=\"OderskySpoonVenners8\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/combining-scala-and-java.html |title=Combining Scala and Java |last=Odersky |first=Martin |last2=Spoon |first2=Lex |date=10 December 2008 |website=www.artima.com |access-date=29 July 2016 |last3=Venners |first3=Bill}}</ref>\n\nAPI use can vary depending on the type of programming language involved.\nAn API for a [[procedural programming|procedural language]] such as [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] could consist primarily of basic routines to execute code, manipulate data or handle errors while an API for an [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented language]], such as Java, would provide a specification of classes and its [[class method]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=de Figueiredo |first=Luiz Henrique |last2=Ierusalimschy |first2=Roberto |last3=Filho |first3=Waldemar Celes |title=The design and implementation of a language for extending applications |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2778436 |journal=TeCGraf Grupo de Tecnologia Em Computacao Grafica |access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Sintes16\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077392/java-se/just-what-is-the-java-api-anyway.html |title=Just what is the Java API anyway? |last=Sintes |first=Tony |date=2001-07-13 |website=JavaWorld |access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Language binding]]s are also APIs.

An example might be a shipping company API that can be added to an eCommerce-focused website to facilitate ordering shipping services and automatically include current shipping rates, without the site developer having to enter the shipper's rate table into a web database. While \"web API\" historically has been virtually synonymous with [[web service]], the recent trend (so-called [[Web 2.0]]) has been moving away from Simple Object Access Protocol ([[SOAP]]) based web services and [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA) towards more direct [[representational state transfer]] (REST) style [[web resource]]s and [[resource-oriented architecture]] (ROA).<ref>{{cite web\n |first        = Djamal\n |last         = Benslimane\n |author2      = Schahram Dustdar\n |author3      = Amit Sheth\n |title        = Services Mashups: The New Generation of Web Applications\n |url          = http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline/2008/09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |work         = IEEE Internet Computing, vol. 12, no. 5\n |publisher    = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n |pages        = 13\u201315\n |year         = 2008\n |access-date  = 2019-10-01\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928211221/http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline%2F2008%2F09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |archive-date = 2011-09-28\n |url-status   = dead\n}}</ref> Part of this trend is related to the [[Semantic Web]] movement toward [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), a concept to promote web-based [[ontology engineering]] technologies.

For example, Internet service providers like Cloudflare or Voxility, use RESTful APIs to allow customers and resellers access to their infrastructure information, DDoS stats, network performance or dashboard controls.<ref name=\"Cloudflare\">{{Cite web |url=https://api.cloudflare.com/ |title=Cloudflare API v4 Documentation |date=25 February 2020 |website=cloudflare |access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref> Access to such APIs is granted either by \u201cAPI tokens\u201d, or customer status validations.<ref name=\"SmashMagazine\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/ |title=Car Service APIs Are Everywhere, But What's In It For Partner Apps |last=Liew |first=Zell |date=17 January 2018 |website=Smashing Magazine |access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Public API implications===\nAn important factor when an API becomes public is its \"interface stability\". Changes to the API \u2014for example adding new parameters to a function call\u2014could break compatibility with the clients that depend on that API.<ref name=\"researchgate.net\">{{Cite book |last=Shi |first=Lin |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225147411 |title=An Empirical Study on Evolution of API Documentation |last2=Zhong |first2=Hao |last3=Xie |first3=Tao |last4=Li |first4=Mingshu |date=2011 |work=International Conference on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering |isbn=978-3-642-19810-6 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=6603 |pages=416\u2013431 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-19811-3_29 |access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen parts of a publicly presented API are subject to change and thus not stable, such parts of a particular API should be documented explicitly as \"unstable\". For example, in the [[Google Guava]] library, the parts that are considered unstable, and that might change in the near future, are marked with the [[Java annotation]] <code>@Beta</code>.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/ |title=guava-libraries - Guava: Google Core Libraries for Java 1.6+ - Google Project Hosting |date=2014-02-04 |access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref>\n\nA public API can sometimes declare parts of itself as ''deprecated'' or rescinded. This usually means that part of the API should be considered a candidate for being removed, or modified in a backward incompatible way. Therefore, these changes allows developers to transition away from parts of the API that will be removed or not supported in the future.<ref name=\"OracleDeprecation16\">{{Cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/deprecation/deprecation.html |title=How and When to Deprecate APIs |last=Oracle |website=Java SE Documentation |access-date=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nClient code may contain innovative or opportunistic usages that were not intended by the API designers.

The title is a consequence of the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in the fifth century, in which Mary was proclaimed \"[[Theotokos]]\", a title rendered in Latin as ''{{lang|la|Mater Dei}}'', in English \"[[Mother of God]]\".\n\nThe Catholic teaching on this subject is expressed in the papal encyclical ''Ad Caeli Reginam'', issued by [[Pope Pius XII]].{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam}} It states that Mary is called Queen of [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] because her son, [[Jesus Christ]], is the king of Israel and heavenly king of the universe; indeed, the Davidic tradition of Israel recognized the mother of the king as the [[Queen mother|Queen Mother]] of Israel.\n\nThe title \u201cQueen of Heaven\u201d has long been a Catholic tradition, included in [[prayer]]s and [[devotional literature]], and seen in Western art in the subject of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], from the [[High Middle Ages]], long before it was given a formal definition status by the Church.\n\n==Theological basis==\nQueen of Heaven ({{lang-la|Regina Caeli}}) is one of many Queen titles used of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]]. The title derived in part from the ancient Catholic teaching that Mary, at the end of her earthly life, was bodily and spiritually [[Assumption of Mary|assumed]] into heaven, and that she is there honored as [[Coronation of the Virgin|Queen]].<ref name=\"Otto\">{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Mary |editor-first=John |editor-last=Otto |publisher=Catholic Book Publishing Co. |location=New York |year=1985 |pages=283\u2013284}}</ref>\n\nPius XII explained on the theological reasons for her title of Queen in a radio message to Fatima of May 13, 1946, ''Bendito seja'':<ref>''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' 38. 266</ref> <blockquote>He, the Son of God, reflects on His heavenly Mother the glory, the majesty and the dominion of His kingship, for, having been associated to the King of Martyrs in the ... work of human Redemption as Mother and cooperator, she remains forever associated to Him, with a practically unlimited power, in the distribution of the graces which flow from the Redemption. Jesus is King throughout all eternity by nature and by right of conquest: through Him, with Him, and subordinate to Him, Mary is Queen by grace, by divine relationship, by right of conquest, and by singular choice [of the Father].<ref name=most/></blockquote>\n\nIn his 1954 encyclical ''[[Ad caeli reginam]]'' (\"To the Queen of Heaven\"), Pius XII asserts that Mary deserves the title because she is Mother of God, because she is closely associated as the New Eve with Jesus' redemptive work, because of her preeminent perfection and because of her intercessory power.<ref name=foley/> ''Ad caeli reginam'' states that the main principle on which the royal dignity of Mary rests is her Divine Motherhood. ... So with complete justice St. John Damascene could write: \"When she became Mother of the Creator, she truly became Queen of every creature.\".{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam|loc=section 34}}\n\n==Biblical basis ==\nIn the Hebrew Bible, under some Davidic kings, the [[gebirah]], the \"Great Lady\", usually the Mother of the King, held great power as advocate with the king. In 1 Kings 2:20, Solomon said to his Mother Bathsheba, seated on a throne at his right, \"Make your request, Mother, for I will not refuse you.\" William G.

A reflection of the biblical image in Revelation 12. Statue by Attard, [[Malta]].]]\nIn the New Testament, the title has several biblical sources. At the Annunciation, the archangel Gabriel announces that [Jesus] \"... will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David. He will rule over the house of Jacob forever and his reign will be without end.\"(Luke 1:32) The biblical precedent in ancient Israel is that the mother of the king becomes the queen mother.<ref>Taylor Marshall, ''The Crucified Rabbi: Judaism and the Origins of Catholic Christianity'', Saint John Press, 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-578-03834-6}} page 41</ref>  Mary's queenship is a share in Jesus\u2019 kingship.<ref name=foley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1115 Foley O.F.M., Leonard.

She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads.\" The Church accepts Revelation 12 as a reference to Mary, Israel, and the Church as a three-fold symbolism through the Book of Isaiah and affirms Mary as the mother of Jesus as the prophetic fulfilment described in Revelation 12 (cf. Isaiah 7:14, 26:17, 54:1, 66:7).<ref name=\"Rev12\">[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0769.html Saunder, Rev.

The prophet [[Jeremiah]] writing circa 628 BC refers to a \"queen of heaven\" in chapters 7 and 44 of the [[Book of Jeremiah]] when he scolds the people for having \"sinned against the Lord\" due to their idolatrous practices of burning incense, making cakes, and pouring out drink offerings to her. This title was probably given to [[Asherah]], a [[Canaan|Canaanite]] idol and goddess worshipped in ancient Israel and Judah.<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=30&chapter=7&verse=18&version=31&context=verse Biblegateway Jeremiah]</ref> For a discussion of \"queen of heaven\" in the [[Hebrew Bible]], see [[Queen of heaven (Antiquity)]].\n\n==Historical practice==\n[[File:Fra Angelico 082.jpg|thumb|Fra Angelico, c. 1434-35]]\nIn the fourth century St. Ephrem called Mary \"Lady\" and \"Queen\". Later Church fathers and doctors continued to use the title. A text probably coming from Origen (died {{circa|254}}) gives her the title domina, the feminine form of Latin dominus, Lord. That same title also appears in many other early writers, e.g., [[Jerome]], and [[Peter Chrysologus]]. The first [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological]] definition and basis for the title of ''Mary Queen of Heaven'' developed at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], where Mary was defined to be the Mother of God. The Council fathers specifically approved this version against the opinion, that Mary is \"only\" the mother of Jesus.

In the vernacular, as a prayer to the Virgin Mary, the Hail Holy Queen is the final prayer of the Rosary. A German [[Benedictine]] monk, [[Hermann of Reichenau]] (1013\u20131054), allegedly composed it and it originally appeared in Latin, the prevalent language of the Catholic Church until [[Vatican II]]. Traditionally it has been sung in Latin, though many translations exist. In the Middle Ages, ''Salve Regina'' offices were held every Saturday.<ref>Marienlexikon, 648</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the 13th century, the custom developed to greet the Queen of Heaven with the ''Salve Regina'', which is considered the oldest of the four Marian antiphons. As a part of the [[Catholic Reformation]], the ''Salve Regina'' was prayed every Saturday by members of the [[Sodality of Our Lady]], a Jesuit Marian congregation. The ''Hail Holy Queen'' is also the final prayer of the Rosary.\n\n=== ''Ave Regina caelorum'' ===\n{{Main|Ave Regina caelorum}}\nThe ''[[Ave Regina caelorum]]'' (Hail, Queen of Heaven) is an early Marian antiphon, praising Mary, the Queen of Heaven. It is traditionally said or sung after each of the [[canonical hours]] of the Liturgy of the Hours. The prayer is used especially after [[Compline]], the final canonical hour of prayer before going to sleep. It is prayed from the [[Feast of the Presentation]] (February 2) through the Wednesday of Holy Week. It used to be sung on the feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]].

Mary should be called Queen, not only because of her [[Divinity|Divine]] [[Motherhood]] of Jesus Christ, but also because God has willed her to have an exceptional role in the work of eternal [[salvation]]. [[Roman Catholicism]] employs the liturgical Latin phrase ''[[Catholicism|Ora Pro Nobis]]'', meaning ''pray for us'', and does not teach adherents to worship saints, but rather ask (asking is a form of prayer) those saints to pray for them.  The encyclical ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'' maintains that Christ as redeemer is Lord and King. The [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin]] is Queen, because of the unique manner in which she assisted in our [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]], by giving of her own substance, by freely offering Him for us, by her singular desire and petition for, and active interest.{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam|loc=section 38}} Mary was chosen Mother of Christ so she might help fulfill God's plan in the redemption of humankind; The Catholic Church from the earliest times venerated the Queen of Heaven, according to Pius XII:\n{{quote|From the earliest ages of the Catholic Church a Christian people, whether in time of triumph or more especially in time of crisis, has addressed prayers of petition and hymns of praise and veneration to the '''Queen of Heaven''' and never has that hope wavered which they placed in the Mother of the Divine King, Jesus Christ; nor has that faith ever failed by which we are taught that Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, reigns with a mother's solicitude over the entire world, just as she is crowned in heavenly blessedness with the glory of a Queen.{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam|loc=section 1}}}}\n\nThe Queenship of Mary is commemorated in the last of the Glorious Mysteries of the Holy Rosary\u2014the Coronation of the Virgin as Queen of Heaven and Earth.\n\nParishes and private groups often process and crown an image of Mary with flowers. This often is referred to as a \"May Crowning\".

Mary, his mother, assumed into heaven by her son, participates in his heavenly glory.\n\nThe earliest known Roman depiction of ''Santa Maria Regina'' depicting Mary as a queen dates to the 6th century and is found in the modest church of [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] (i.e., ancient St. Mary) built in the 5th century in the [[Forum Romanum]].

Also in the 8th century, the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] decreed that such pictures of Mary should be venerated.{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=590}}\n\nIn the early 16th century, Protestant reformers began to discourage [[Marian art in the Catholic Church|Marian art]], and some like [[John Calvin]] or [[Zwingli]] even encouraged its destruction. But after the [[Council of Trent]] in the mid-16th century confirmed the veneration of [[Marian art in the Catholic Church|Marian paintings]] for Catholics, Mary was often painted as a Madonna with crown, surrounded by stars, standing on top of the world or the partly visible moon. After the victory against the Turks at Lepanto, Mary is depicted as the Queen of Victory, sometimes wearing the crown of the Habsburg empire.{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=595}} National interpretations existed in France as well, where [[Jean Fouquet]] painted the Queen of Heaven in 1450 with the face of the mistress of King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]]{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}} Statues and pictures of Mary were crowned by kings in [[Poland]], France, [[Bavaria]], [[Hungary]] and Austria,{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}} sometimes apparently using crowns previously worn by earthly monarchs. A surviving small crown presented by [[Margaret of York]] seems to have been that worn by her at her wedding to [[Charles the Bold]] in 1463. A recent coronation was that of the picture of the ''[[Salus Populi Romani]]'' in 1954 by [[Pius XII]]. The veneration of Mary as queen continues into the 21st Century, but artistic expressions do not have the leading role as in previous times{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}}\n\nArtworks, including paintings, mosaics and carvings of the coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven, became increasingly popular from the 13th century onward. Works follow a set pattern, showing Mary kneeling in the [[Throne of God|heavenly court]], and being crowned either by Jesus alone, or else by Jesus and God the Father together, with the Holy Spirit, usually in the form of a dove, completing the [[Trinity]]. The Coronation of Mary is almost entirely a theme of western art.

The prophet [[Jeremiah]] writing circa 628 BC refers to a \"queen of heaven\" in chapters 7 and 44 of the [[Book of Jeremiah]] when he scolds the people for having \"sinned against the Lord\" due to their idolatrous practices of burning incense, making cakes, and pouring out drink offerings to her. This title was probably given to [[Asherah]], a [[Canaanite]] idol and goddess worshipped in ancient Israel and Judah.<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=30&chapter=7&verse=18&version=31&context=verse Biblegateway Jeremiah]</ref> For a discussion of \"queen of heaven\" in the [[Hebrew Bible]], see [[Queen of heaven (Antiquity)]].\n\n==Historical practice==\n[[File:Fra Angelico 082.jpg|thumb|Fra Angelico, c. 1434-35]]\nIn the fourth century St. Ephrem called Mary \"Lady\" and \"Queen\". Later Church fathers and doctors continued to use the title. A text probably coming from Origen (died {{circa|254}}) gives her the title domina, the feminine form of Latin dominus, Lord. That same title also appears in many other early writers, e.g., [[Jerome]], and [[Peter Chrysologus]]. The first [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological]] definition and basis for the title of ''Mary Queen of Heaven'' developed at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], where Mary was defined to be the Mother of God. The Council fathers specifically approved this version against the opinion, that Mary is \"only\" the mother of Jesus. Nobody had participated in the life of her son more, than Mary, who gave birth to the Son of God.{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=590}}\n\nThe word \"Queen\" is common during and after the sixth century.<ref name=most>[http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/marya6.htm Most, William G. \"Mary's Queenship\", ''Our Lady in Doctrine and Devotion'', 1994]</ref> Hymns of the 11th to 13th centuries address Mary as queen: \u201cHail, Holy Queen,\u201d \u201cHail, Queen of Heaven,\u201d \u201cQueen of Heaven.\u201d The Dominican rosary and the Franciscan crown as well as numerous invocations in Mary\u2019s litany celebrate her queenship.<ref name=foley/>  For centuries she has been invoked as the Queen of Heaven.<ref name=gandolpho/>\n\n==Litany of Loreto==\n[[File:Coronation-of-the-Virgin.jpg|thumb|Rubens, 1609]]\nShe is invoked in the [[Litany of Loreto]] as:\n* Queen of the Angels, \n* Queen of Patriarchs,\n* Queen of Prophets, \n* Queen of Apostles, \n* Queen of Martyrs, \n* Queen of Confessors, \n* Queen of Virgins, \n* Queen of all Saints\n* Queen of Families.<ref name=gandolpho/>\n* Queen conceived without original sin\n* Queen assumed into Heaven\n* Queen of the Most Holy Rosary\n* Queen of Peace<ref>[http://www.thequeenofangels.com/mary-the-queen/the-queenship-of-mary/ Pope Paul VI, ''Christi Matris'', 1966]</ref>\n\n=== Other titles ===\n\nThe [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964 referred to Mary as ''Queen of the Universe''.<ref name=\"lumengentium59\">[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html ''Lumen gentium'', Chapter 8, Section 59.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906031754/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |date=September 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Liturgy of the Hours ==\n[[File:Beslotentuinfeest.jpg|thumb|180px|Crowned statue of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]], [[Warfhuizen]], the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe four ancient Marian [[antiphon]]s of the Liturgy of the Hours express the queenship of Mary: the ''[[Salve Regina]]'', the ''[[Ave Regina caelorum]]'', the ''[[Alma Redemptoris Mater]]'', and the ''[[Regina Caeli]]''. These are prayed at different times of the year, at the end of [[Compline]].\n\n=== ''Salve Regina'' ===\n{{Main|Salve Regina}}\nMary as Queen of Heaven is praised in the ''[[Salve Regina]]'' \"(Hail Queen)\", which is sung in the time from Trinity Sunday until the Saturday before the first Sunday of Advent. In the vernacular, as a prayer to the Virgin Mary, the Hail Holy Queen is the final prayer of the Rosary. A German [[Benedictine]] monk, [[Hermann of Reichenau]] (1013\u20131054), allegedly composed it and it originally appeared in Latin, the prevalent language of the Catholic Church until [[Vatican II]]. Traditionally it has been sung in Latin, though many translations exist. In the Middle Ages, ''Salve Regina'' offices were held every Saturday.<ref>Marienlexikon, 648</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the 13th century, the custom developed to greet the Queen of Heaven with the ''Salve Regina'', which is considered the oldest of the four Marian antiphons. As a part of the [[Catholic Reformation]], the ''Salve Regina'' was prayed every Saturday by members of the [[Sodality of Our Lady]], a Jesuit Marian congregation. The ''Hail Holy Queen'' is also the final prayer of the Rosary.\n\n=== ''Ave Regina caelorum'' ===\n{{Main|Ave Regina caelorum}}\nThe ''[[Ave Regina caelorum]]'' (Hail, Queen of Heaven) is an early Marian antiphon, praising Mary, the Queen of Heaven. It is traditionally said or sung after each of the [[canonical hours]] of the Liturgy of the Hours. The prayer is used especially after [[Compline]], the final canonical hour of prayer before going to sleep. It is prayed from the [[Feast of the Presentation]] (February 2) through the Wednesday of Holy Week. It used to be sung on the feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]]. The ''Ave Regina caelorum'' dates back in a different musical intonation to the 12th century.<ref>C Bernt Marienlexikon 321</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}} Today's version is slightly different from a 12th-century intonation. The ''Ave Regina caelorum'' has four parts: ''Ave'', ''Salve'', ''Gaude'' and ''Vale'' (in English: hail, rejoice, farewell). It was used for processions in honour of the ''Queen of Heaven.'' The ''Ave Regina caelorum'' received numerous musical versions, a famous one of which was composed in 1773 by Joseph Haydn.<ref name=\"Haydn, in Marienlexikon, 88\">Haydn, in Marienlexikon, 88</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== ''Alma Redemptoris Mater'' ===\n{{Main|Alma Redemptoris Mater}}\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 079.jpg|right|thumb|180px|''The coronation of the Virgin Mary'' by [[Rubens]], {{circa|1625}}]]\nThe ''[[Alma Redemptoris Mater]]'' (Loving Mother of our Savior) is recited in the Catholic Church at Compline only from the first Sunday in Advent until the Feast of the Purification (February 2). Continuing theological discussions exist as to the origin and exact timing of this Marian antiphon. It has two equal parts: The Virgin Mary is the loving Mother of the Savior, the ever-virgin with a very high position in heaven.

Different musical settings of the words were composed throughout the centuries by known and unknown composers. Not all attributions are correct, as an often quoted ''Regina Caeli'' by [[Joseph Haydn]] was not by him.<ref name=\"Haydn, in Marienlexikon, 88\"/> The anthem is of unknown authorship, and was in [[Franciscan]] use in the first half of the 13th century. Together with three other Marian [[anthems]], it was incorporated in the Minorite Roman Curia Office, which the Franciscans soon popularized everywhere, and which by order of [[Pope Nicholas III]] (1277\u20131280) replaced all the older [[breviary|breviaries]] in the churches of Rome.{{sfn|Henry|1913}}\n\n==Veneration==\nThe Catholic faith states, as a dogma, that Mary was assumed into heaven and is with [[Jesus Christ]], her divine son. Mary should be called Queen, not only because of her [[Divinity|Divine]] [[Motherhood]] of Jesus Christ, but also because God has willed her to have an exceptional role in the work of eternal [[salvation]]. [[Roman Catholicism]] employs the liturgical Latin phrase ''[[Catholicism|Ora Pro Nobis]]'', meaning ''pray for us'', and does not teach adherents to worship saints, but rather ask (asking is a form of prayer) those saints to pray for them.  The encyclical ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'' maintains that Christ as redeemer is Lord and King. The [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin]] is Queen, because of the unique manner in which she assisted in our [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]], by giving of her own substance, by freely offering Him for us, by her singular desire and petition for, and active interest.{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam|loc=section 38}} Mary was chosen Mother of Christ so she might help fulfill God's plan in the redemption of humankind; The Catholic Church from the earliest times venerated the Queen of Heaven, according to Pius XII:\n{{quote|From the earliest ages of the Catholic Church a Christian people, whether in time of triumph or more especially in time of crisis, has addressed prayers of petition and hymns of praise and veneration to the '''Queen of Heaven''' and never has that hope wavered which they placed in the Mother of the Divine King, Jesus Christ; nor has that faith ever failed by which we are taught that Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, reigns with a mother's solicitude over the entire world, just as she is crowned in heavenly blessedness with the glory of a Queen.{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam|loc=section 1}}}}\n\nThe Queenship of Mary is commemorated in the last of the Glorious Mysteries of the Holy Rosary\u2014the Coronation of the Virgin as Queen of Heaven and Earth.\n\nParishes and private groups often process and crown an image of Mary with flowers. This often is referred to as a \"May Crowning\". This rite may be done on solemnities and feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or other festive days, and offers the Church a chance to reflect on Mary\u2019s role in the history of salvation.<ref name=lewis>[http://www.pastoralliturgy.org/resources/0703CrowningImageOfBVM.php Lewis, Suzaanne M. \"Crowning an Image of the Blessed Virgin Mary\", ''Pastoral Liturgy'']</ref>\n\nThe Virgin has been called \"Queen of France\" since 1638 when, partly in thanksgiving for a victory over the Huguenots and also in hope of the birth of an heir after years of childless marriage, Louis XIII officially gave her that title.

She carries her divine son in her hands, or holds him. After he ascended into heaven, he reigns in divine glory. Mary, his mother, assumed into heaven by her son, participates in his heavenly glory.\n\nThe earliest known Roman depiction of ''Santa Maria Regina'' depicting Mary as a queen dates to the 6th century and is found in the modest church of [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] (i.e., ancient St. Mary) built in the 5th century in the [[Forum Romanum]].

Also in the 8th century, the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] decreed that such pictures of Mary should be venerated.{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=590}}\n\nIn the early 16th century, Protestant reformers began to discourage [[Marian art in the Catholic Church|Marian art]], and some like [[John Calvin]] or [[Zwingli]] even encouraged its destruction. But after the [[Council of Trent]] in the mid-16th century confirmed the veneration of [[Marian art in the Catholic Church|Marian paintings]] for Catholics, Mary was often painted as a Madonna with crown, surrounded by stars, standing on top of the world or the partly visible moon. After the victory against the Turks at Lepanto, Mary is depicted as the Queen of Victory, sometimes wearing the crown of the Habsburg empire.{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=595}} National interpretations existed in France as well, where [[Jean Fouquet]] painted the Queen of Heaven in 1450 with the face of the mistress of King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]]{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}} Statues and pictures of Mary were crowned by kings in [[Poland]], France, [[Bavaria]], [[Hungary]] and Austria,{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}} sometimes apparently using crowns previously worn by earthly monarchs. A surviving small crown presented by [[Margaret of York]] seems to have been that worn by her at her wedding to [[Charles the Bold]] in 1463. A recent coronation was that of the picture of the ''[[Salus Populi Romani]]'' in 1954 by [[Pius XII]]. The veneration of Mary as queen continues into the 21st Century, but artistic expressions do not have the leading role as in previous times{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}}\n\nArtworks, including paintings, mosaics and carvings of the coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven, became increasingly popular from the 13th century onward. Works follow a set pattern, showing Mary kneeling in the [[Throne of God|heavenly court]], and being crowned either by Jesus alone, or else by Jesus and God the Father together, with the Holy Spirit, usually in the form of a dove, completing the [[Trinity]]. The Coronation of Mary is almost entirely a theme of western art.

have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system

/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190522_chrispatten\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" />  and infringe on privacy and [[Freedom of speech by country|freedom of speech]] laws. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June 2019,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June 2019, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp; June 2019.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede on the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4&nbsp;October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism.

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June 2019, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

Their claim it was impossible to recognise a person in the video footage was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged police misconducts in the protests, although the protesters demand an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and IPCC lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> [[Carrie Lam]] has rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8 November, a five-member expert panel, headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while the IPCC chairman [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nThe police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1 October confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

both the government and the police \"for years to come\".<ref name=\"guardian_20190811_lacktrust\"/> According to ''[[The Diplomat]]'', there was also the emergence of the concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts

force.<ref name=\"scmp_3038039\"/> Due to internal redeployment of staff within the force to deal with the protests, anti-crime operations were \"smaller and less frequent than in the past\". Criminals also had taken advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain types of crimes such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency as compared to the same period in 2018.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government has spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests have deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who oppose the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests. On the other hand, protesters justified their actions by what they saw as the greater good of protecting the city's freedoms against the encroachment of mainland China.<ref

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer youth in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June 2019, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners.

Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts

Criminals also had taken advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain types of crimes such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency as compared to the same period in 2018.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government has spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests have deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who oppose the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests. On the other hand, protesters justified their actions by what they saw as the greater good of protecting the city's freedoms against the encroachment of mainland China.<ref

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

It is thought to have been [[nocturnal]] as it had a much larger brain<ref name=\"Fur and Fangs: Mammal Origins\"/> than its [[cynodont]] relatives and the enlarged areas of its brain  were found to be those that process sounds and smells. This was probably in order to avoid being in competition with the [[reptiles]] or becoming prey to the [[dinosaur]]s.<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1976RSPTB.273..387J Smithsonian Science Abstract]</ref>\n\nAlthough considered a mammal (or [[mammaliaform]]), it did have some non-mammalian characteristics inherited from its predecessors: the first two vertebrae (atlas and axis) were still unfused as in cynodonts, and it only had three sacral vertebrae instead of the usual mammalian five.<ref>Kemp, ''The Origin and Evolution of Mammals'', (2004). Oxford Univ. Press, p. 146.</ref> An interclavicle is also present, another trait inherited from non-mammlian cynodonts, and still present in [[monotremes]]. \n\n==Evolution==\n''Megazostrodon'' is the only well-known genus of the family [[Megazostrodontidae]], part of the larger group called [[Morganucodonta]]. The other members of this family that are currently known are ''[[Indozostrodon]]'', ''[[Dinnetherium]]'', ''[[Wareolestes]]'' and ''[[Brachyzostrodon]]''. The megazostrodontids used to be classified as members of a group of mammals called the [[Triconodont]]s, which are thought to have evolved from a specific group of [[cynodonts]]<ref name=\"Mammalogy\">[http://www.shsu.edu/~bio_mlt/mammalogy1.html Mammalogy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027093451/http://www.shsu.edu/~bio_mlt/mammalogy1.html |date=2006-10-27 }} Sam Houston State University.</ref> during the late [[Triassic]] and early [[Jurassic]] periods. However, recent classifications consider the megazostrodontids to be mammaliaforms outside of the stricter grouping of Mammalia proper, while the triconodonts remain in the (crowngroup) Mammalia. The distinction between true Mammalia and Mammaliaformes is purely a cladistic and phylogenetic one: mammaliaforms are mammals in the general sense of the word.\n\nThese early mammals developed many traits which were to make them well-suited for a very active lifestyle. They developed four types of teeth<ref name=\"FMA\">[http://www.stellar.co.nz/tl10.html First Mammals Appear]</ref> (as opposed to the uniform teeth of the reptiles), [[incisors]], [[canine tooth|canines]], [[premolars]] and [[molars]], which enabled them to chew and therefore process their food more thoroughly than their reptilian cousins. There is evidence that the movement of the mandible allowed a shearing action to chew food.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Savage, R.J.G. |author2=Long, M.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Mammal Evolution: an illustrated guide|url=https://archive.org/details/mammalevolutioni0000sava |url-access=registration |publisher= Facts On File Inc| year=1986| isbn= 0-8160-1194-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/mammalevolutioni0000sava/page/41 41]}}</ref> Their skeletons changed so that their limbs were more mobile, being less laterally splayed,<ref>[http://www.shsu.edu/~bio_mlt/mammals.html Mammalian Characteristics]. Sam Houston State University.</ref> and allowing faster forward motion. They had a shorter ribcage and larger lungs<ref name=\"FMA\"/> which allowed more efficient [[Respiratory system|respiration]]. Ther lower jaw comprised a single bone &mdash; the [[dentary]] (as opposed to the multiple bones in the jaws of their ancestors, or seven different bones found in reptilian lower jaws). The other bones which once made up the jaw had reduced, and in later mammals would become incorporated into the middle ear<ref name=\"Fur and Fangs: Mammal Origins\"/>, enhancing their hearing.\n\nProbably the most important change in the evolution of the first mammals was that their ancestors, the [[cynodonts]], had become [[warm-blooded]]. This meant that they generated their own body heat, relying on the food they ate to help sustain their body temperature rather than depending on their surrounding environment. This permitted higher, more sustained activity levels during the day than reptiles (reptiles must frequently perform temperature regulation activities such as sun basking and seeking shade). It was probably the key to becoming nocturnal &mdash; a major advantage in a world where most predators were active during the day.\n\n;Phylogeny <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Close|first1=Roger A.|last2=Friedman|first2=Matt|last3=Lloyd|first3=Graeme T.|last4=Benson|first4=Roger BJ|year=2015|title=Evidence for a mid-Jurassic adaptive radiation in mammals.|journal=Current Biology|volume=25|issue=16|pages=2137\u20132142|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.06.047|pmid=26190074}}</ref>\n{{clade |style=font-size:95%;line-height:80%;\n|label1=''[[Mammaliaformes]]''&nbsp;\n|1={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;''[[Adelobasileus]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;''[[Sinoconodon]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;''[[Morganucodon]]''\n|2=&nbsp;'''''Megazostrodon'''''\n}}\n|2={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;[[Haramiyida]]\n|2={{clade\n|1={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;''[[Haldanodon]]''\n|2=&nbsp;''[[Castorocauda]]''\n}}\n|2={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;''[[Hadrocodium]]''\n|2=&nbsp;''[[Mammalia]]''\n}} }} }} }} }} }} }}\n\n==Reproduction==\nLike [[placentals]] and possibly ''[[Erythrotherium]]'', ''Megazostrodon'' is unique among mammaliformes in lacking [[epipubic]] bones.\n<ref>Jason A.

It is thought to have been [[nocturnal]] as it had a much larger brain<ref name=\"Fur and Fangs: Mammal Origins\"/> than its [[cynodont]] relatives and the enlarged areas of its brain  were found to be those that process sounds and smells. This was probably in order to avoid being in competition with the [[reptiles]] or becoming prey to the [[dinosaur]]s.<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1976RSPTB.273..387J Smithsonian Science Abstract]</ref>\n\nAlthough considered a mammal (or [[mammaliaform]]), it did have some non-mammalian characteristics inherited from its predecessors: the first two vertebrae (atlas and axis) were still unfused as in cynodonts, and it only had three sacral vertebrae instead of the usual mammalian five.<ref>Kemp, ''The Origin and Evolution of Mammals'', (2004). Oxford Univ. Press, p. 146.</ref> An interclavicle is also present, another trait inherited from non-mammlian cynodonts, and still present in [[monotremes]]. \n\n==Evolution==\n''Megazostrodon'' is the only well-known genus of the family [[Megazostrodontidae]], part of the larger group called [[Morganucodonta]]. The other members of this family that are currently known are ''[[Indozostrodon]]'', ''[[Dinnetherium]]'', ''[[Wareolestes]]'' and ''[[Brachyzostrodon]]''. The megazostrodontids used to be classified as members of a group of mammals called the [[Triconodont]]s, which are thought to have evolved from a specific group of [[cynodonts]]<ref name=\"Mammalogy\">[http://www.shsu.edu/~bio_mlt/mammalogy1.html Mammalogy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027093451/http://www.shsu.edu/~bio_mlt/mammalogy1.html |date=2006-10-27 }} Sam Houston State University.</ref> during the late [[Triassic]] and early [[Jurassic]] periods. However, recent classifications consider the megazostrodontids to be mammaliaforms outside of the stricter grouping of Mammalia proper, while the triconodonts remain in the (crowngroup) Mammalia. The distinction between true Mammalia and Mammaliaformes is purely a cladistic and phylogenetic one: mammaliaforms are mammals in the general sense of the word.\n\nThese early mammals developed many traits which were to make them well-suited for a very active lifestyle. They developed four types of teeth<ref name=\"FMA\">[http://www.stellar.co.nz/tl10.html First Mammals Appear]</ref> (as opposed to the uniform teeth of the reptiles), [[incisors]], [[canine tooth|canines]], [[premolars]] and [[molars]], which enabled them to chew and therefore process their food more thoroughly than their reptilian cousins. There is evidence that the movement of the mandible allowed a shearing action to chew food.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Savage, R.J.G. |author2=Long, M.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Mammal Evolution: an illustrated guide|url=https://archive.org/details/mammalevolutioni0000sava |url-access=registration |publisher= Facts On File Inc| year=1986| isbn= 0-8160-1194-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/mammalevolutioni0000sava/page/41 41]}}</ref> Their skeletons changed so that their limbs were more mobile, being less laterally splayed,<ref>[http://www.shsu.edu/~bio_mlt/mammals.html Mammalian Characteristics]. Sam Houston State University.</ref> and allowing faster forward motion. They had a shorter ribcage and larger lungs<ref name=\"FMA\"/> which allowed more efficient [[Respiratory system|respiration]]. Ther lower jaw comprised a single bone &mdash; the [[dentary]] (as opposed to the multiple bones in the jaws of their ancestors, or seven different bones found in reptilian lower jaws). The other bones which once made up the jaw had reduced, and in later mammals would become incorporated into the middle ear<ref name=\"Fur and Fangs: Mammal Origins\"/>, enhancing their hearing.\n\nProbably the most important change in the evolution of the first mammals was that their ancestors, the [[cynodonts]], had become [[warm-blooded]]. This meant that they generated their own body heat, relying on the food they ate to help sustain their body temperature rather than depending on their surrounding environment. This permitted higher, more sustained activity levels during the day than reptiles (reptiles must frequently perform temperature regulation activities such as sun basking and seeking shade). It was probably the key to becoming nocturnal &mdash; a major advantage in a world where most predators were active during the day.\n\n;Phylogeny <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Close|first1=Roger A.|last2=Friedman|first2=Matt|last3=Lloyd|first3=Graeme T.|last4=Benson|first4=Roger BJ|year=2015|title=Evidence for a mid-Jurassic adaptive radiation in mammals.|journal=Current Biology|volume=25|issue=16|pages=2137\u20132142|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.06.047|pmid=26190074}}</ref>\n{{clade |style=font-size:95%;line-height:80%;\n|label1=''[[Mammaliaformes]]''&nbsp;\n|1={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;''[[Adelobasileus]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;''[[Sinoconodon]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;''[[Morganucodon]]''\n|2=&nbsp;'''''Megazostrodon'''''\n}}\n|2={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;[[Haramiyida]]\n|2={{clade\n|1={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;''[[Haldanodon]]''\n|2=&nbsp;''[[Castorocauda]]''\n}}\n|2={{clade\n|1=&nbsp;''[[Hadrocodium]]''\n|2=&nbsp;''[[Mammalia]]''\n}} }} }} }} }} }} }}\n\n==Reproduction==\nLike [[placentals]] and possibly ''[[Erythrotherium]]'', ''Megazostrodon'' is unique among mammaliformes in lacking [[epipubic]] bones.\n<ref>Jason A.

He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>.

The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>.

Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]].

As a result many players from the struggling [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] team made the trip to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Win for South Auckland/Auckland Defeated By 21 To 5/Mediocre Representative Team\n| page =4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18820\n| date = 1924-09-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240922.2.7.5\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 4 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 15-7\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Visiting League Team/Australian Universities/Auckland Wins First Game/Fifteen Points to Seven/Superiority Throughout\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18727\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240605.2.124\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]], [[Ivan Littlewood]] 2\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Bert Laing]]\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 = Barry\n| con2 = Ryan\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = Neild\n}}\n \n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 7 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 17-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Beaten Again/Aussies\u2019 Poor Exhibition/Auckland Too Good/Football in the Mud\n| page =10\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 135\n| date = 1924-06-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240609.2.122\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]], McNeil, [[Nelson Bass]]\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 3\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Gallagher\n}}\n \n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n[[Frank Delgrosso]] had to come on the replace [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] after he collided badly with team mate [[Clarrie Polson]] when they were both going after the ball.

Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\n\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on [[Carlaw Park]]. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\n\n[[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at [[Carlaw Park]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist Win Final Replay/Twenty Points to Seventeen/Devonport Just Beaten\n| page =6\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18826\n| date = 1924-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240929.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-09}}</ref>.

He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. On the 18th of July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, August 23 onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

In eukaryotes, this is known as pre-mRNA which undergoes post-transcriptional processing to produce mature mRNA. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so only mature mRNA is produced. \n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, [[Complementary (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]] between the complementary base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA corresponding to a gene to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] then binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the [[Directionality (molecular biology|3-prime]] (3') end to the [[Directionality (molecular biology|5-prime]] (5') end. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand. The pre-mRNA molecule is built by the addition of single nucleotides by RNA polymerase as it moves along the DNA template strand, behind the RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin so only 12 base pairs on the DNA are exposed at a time <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

The purpose of the 5' cap is to prevent the pre-mRNA and mature mRNA molecules from being broken down in the cell before they are translated, the cap also aids binding of the ribosome to the mRNA to start translation. In contrast, the 3' Poly(A) tail is added to the 3' end of the mRNA molecule.

This mature mRNA molecule is then exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm using nuclear pores in the nuclear envelope of the nucleus.  \n\n==Translation==\n{{main|Translation (biology)}}\n[[File:Translation - cycle.png|500px|thumb|Translation process showing the cycle of tRNA addition and amino acid incorporation into the growing polypeptide chain]]\n\nTranslation is the process of synthesising an amino acid polypeptide chain from the mRNA template molecule. In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].

In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA|transfer RNAs]] (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule. <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid. \n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome.

The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease.

This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility.

However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so only mature mRNA is produced. \n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, [[Complementary (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]] between the complementary base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA corresponding to a gene to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] then binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the [[Directionality (molecular biology|3-prime]] (3') end to the [[Directionality (molecular biology|5-prime]] (5') end. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand.

The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level. Student book |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Great Clarendon Street, Oxford, OX2 6DP, UK |isbn=9780198351771 |edition=Second}}</ref>. Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease. Haemoglobin is composed of four subunits - two A subunits and two B subunits. <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=March 2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref>. Patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia have a missense mutation in the haemoglobin B subunit gene. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon. In the case of sickle cell anaemia, the most common missense mutation is the single nucleotide mutation from thymine to adenine in the haemoglobin B subunit gene <ref name=\"StatPearls 2020\">{{cite journal |last1=Mangla |first1=Ankit |last2=Ehsan |first2=Moavia |last3=Maruvada |first3=Smita |title=Sickle Cell Anemia |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482164/ |website=StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |accessdate=12 March 2020 |date=2020|pmid=29489205 }}</ref> which changes codon 6 from encoding glutamic acid to encoding valine <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=March 2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref>. \n\nThis change in the primary structure of the haemoglobin B subunit alters the functionality of the haemoglobin multi-subunit complex in low oxygen conditions. When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can aggregate in blood vessels creating a blockage. The blockage prevents blood flow to the tissue and can lead to [[tissue death|necrosis]] which causes pain to the individual <ref name=\"Ilesanmi 2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Ilesanmi |first1=Oluwatoyin Olatundun |title=Pathological basis of symptoms and crises in sickle cell disorder: implications for counseling and psychotherapy |journal=Hematology Reports |date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.4081/hr.2010.e2}}</ref>. \n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translation modification which can occur, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm <ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049}}</ref>.

These proteases are often highly specific and cause [[hydrolysis]] of a limited number of peptide bonds within the target protein. The resulting shortened protein has new beginning and end of the amino acid chain. This post-translational modification often alters the proteins function, a cleaved protein can be rendered inactive or newly activated and can display new biological activities <ref name=\"Ciechanover 2005\">{{cite journal |last1=Ciechanover |first1=Aaron |last2=Overall |first2=Christopher M. |title=Proteolysis: from the lysosome to ubiquitin and the proteasome |journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |date=2005 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=79\u201387 |doi=10.1038/nrm1552}}</ref>.\n\n===Addition of chemical groups===\nFollowing translation, small low molecular weight molecules can be added onto amino acids within the mature protein structure <ref name=\"Brenner 2001\">{{cite book |last1=Brenner |first1=Sydney |last2=Miller |first2=Jefferey H. |title=Encyclopedia of genetics |date=2001 |publisher=Elsevier Science Inc |isbn=978-0-12-227080-2 |pages=2800}}</ref>. Examples of processes which add chemical groups to the target protein include [[Protein methylation|methylation]], [[Protein phosphorylation|phosphorylation]] and [[Protein acetylation|acetylation]]. \n\nMethylation is the reversible addition of a [[methyl group]] onto an amino acid catalysed by an enzyme known as a [[methyltransferase]]. Methylation occurs on at least 9 of the 20 common amino acids, however, it mainly occurs on the amino acids [[lysine]] and [[arginine]]. One example of a protein which is commonly methylated is a [[histone]], DNA is wrapped around histones in the nucleus, a highly specific pattern of [[histone methylation]] is used to control gene transcription in the nucleus <ref name=\"Murn 2017\">{{cite journal |last1=Murn |first1=Jernej |last2=Shi |first2=Yang |title=The winding path of protein methylation research: milestones and new frontiers |journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |date=2017 |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=517\u2013527 |doi=10.1038/nrm.2017.35}}</ref>. \n\nPhosphorylation is another reversible post-translational addition of a small chemical group to a protein. A small [[phosphate]] group is covalently bound to specific amino acids within the protein, mainly [[serine]], [[threonine]] and [[tyrosine]], by a protein [[kinase]]. Phosphorylation can drive the phosphorylated proteins to interact with other proteins to produce a large, multi-protein complex <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=Sixth}}</ref>.\n\nThe final, prevalent chemical group post-translational modification is acetylation. Acetylation is the reversible covalent addition of an [[acetyl group]] onto a [[lysine]] amino acid, from a donor molecule known as [[Acetyl-CoA|acetyl coenzyme A]], by the enzyme [[acetyltransferase]]. The previously mentioned nuclear proteins [[Histone acetylation and deacetylation|histones undergo acetylation]] as well as methylation, this process again has a role in regulating gene transcription in the nucleus.  \n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modification can incorporate more complex, larger molecules into the mature protein structure by covalently adding the molecule onto amino acids within the polypeptide chain. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification <ref name=\"Schubert 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=Mario |last2=Walczak |first2=Michal J. |last3=Aebi |first3=Markus |last4=Wider |first4=Gerhard |title=Posttranslational Modifications of Intact Proteins Detected by NMR Spectroscopy: Application to Glycosylation |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=2015 |volume=54 |issue=24 |pages=7096\u20137100 |doi=10.1002/anie.201502093}}</ref>. \n\nIn glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to a protein by enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the cytoplasmic organelles the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of target protein - in some cases glycosylation of the protein is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|chaperones]].   \n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently bound to the nitrogen atom on an [[asparagine]] amino acid within the polypeptide chain. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the covalent sequential addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen atom in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=Sixth}}</ref>.\n\n===Formation of intramolecular bonds===\nDisulphide bond \n\n==See also==\n*[[Central dogma of molecular biology]]\n*[[Genetic code]]\n*[[Gene expression]]\n*[[Post-translational modification]]\n*[[Protein folding]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA A useful video visualising the process of converting DNA to protein via transcription and translation]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hok2hyED9go Video visualising the process of protein folding from the non-functional primary structure to a mature, folded 3D protein structure with reference to the role of mutations and protein mis-folding in disease]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2bGjTaNsnM A more advanced video detailing the different types of post-translational modifications and their chemical structures]\n\n{{Protein primary structure}}\n{{protein biosynthesis}}{{Protein topics}}\n\n[[Category:Gene expression]]\n[[Category:Proteins]]\n[[Category:Biosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Metabolism]]\n[[Category:Protein biosynthesis| ]]\n\n{{portal bar|Metabolism}}\n", "name_user": "Kep17", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor changes to post-translational modification section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis"}
