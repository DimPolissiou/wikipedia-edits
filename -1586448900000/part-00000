It became a hit in 1992, reaching number 3 in the United States. A 1993 re-release of the song in the [[United Kingdom]], where the initial release had been a minor hit, peaked at number 8. \"Jump Around\" was featured at position 580 on ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]''{{'}}s ''1001 Best Songs Ever'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref> number 24 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Songs of the 90s'',<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/ | title = 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120214035830/http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s |archive-date= 2012-02-14 |url-status= dead }}</ref> number 66 on VH1's ''100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop'', number 325 on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''{{'}}s ''500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born'' and number 47 on ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s ''100 Best Songs Of The 1990s''. The song is popular among [[dancehall]] [[disc jockey|DJ]]s and is widely regarded in the United Kingdom as a club classic.\n\n==Development==\nDJ Muggs has stated that he originally produced the beat for Cypress Hill, but rapper B-Real did not want to record at that time. It was subsequently offered to [[Ice Cube]], who refused it, before finally being taken and used by House of Pain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/12/how-we-made-cypress-hill-insane-in-the-brain-muggs-sen-dog|title=How we made Cypress Hill's Insane in the Brain|last=Simpson|first=Interviews by Dave|date=2019-02-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-23|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\n===Samples===\nThe song features a distinctive [[French horn|horn]] [[fanfare]] intro, sampled from [[Bob & Earl|Bob & Earl's]] 1963 track \"[[Harlem Shuffle]]\". The song also samples \"Popeye the Hitchhiker\" by [[Chubby Checker]], but it is best known for a high-pitched squealing sound that appears at the beginning of almost every bar\u201466 times in the course of the recording.\n\nThe origin of the squeal has been the subject of debate. The website [[WhoSampled]] credits the 1967 [[Junior Walker|Junior Walker & the All Stars]] track \"Shoot Your Shot\", in which a [[tenor saxophone]] makes the noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/2335/House-of-Pain-Jump-Around-Jr.-Walker-&-the-All-Stars-Shoot-Your-Shot/|title=House of Pain's 'Jump Around' - Discover the Sample Source|author=|date=|website=WhoSampled}}</ref> However, Americans blogger [[Anil Dash]] and musician [[Questlove]] of hip-hop band [[The Roots]] have insisted on [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] \"[[Gett Off]]\" as the source. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' reader performed a [[spectrogram]] where the sample more closely matches \"Shoot Your Shot\", and House of Pain member [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] himself told Questlove that it is a horn making the squeal and not Prince.

Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year.

It became a hit in 1992, reaching number 3 in the United States. A 1993 re-release of the song in the [[United Kingdom]], where the initial release had been a minor hit, peaked at number 8. \"Jump Around\" was featured at position 580 on ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]''{{'}}s ''1001 Best Songs Ever'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref> number 24 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Songs of the 90s'',<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/ | title = 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120214035830/http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s |archive-date= 2012-02-14 |url-status= dead }}</ref> number 66 on VH1's ''100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop'', number 325 on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''{{'}}s ''500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born'' and number 47 on ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s ''100 Best Songs Of The 1990s''.

The website [[WhoSampled]] credits the 1967 [[Junior Walker|Junior Walker & the All Stars]] track \"Shoot Your Shot\", in which a [[tenor saxophone]] makes the noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/2335/House-of-Pain-Jump-Around-Jr.-Walker-&-the-All-Stars-Shoot-Your-Shot/|title=House of Pain's 'Jump Around' - Discover the Sample Source|author=|date=|website=WhoSampled}}</ref> However, Americans blogger [[Anil Dash]] and musician [[Questlove]] of hip-hop band [[The Roots]] have insisted on [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] \"[[Gett Off]]\" as the source. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' reader performed a [[spectrogram]] where the sample more closely matches \"Shoot Your Shot\", and House of Pain member [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] himself told Questlove that it is a horn making the squeal and not Prince.

When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year. The \"official\" start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers Homecoming game against the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]].<ref name=\"GBO\">{{cite web |author= Andy Bitter |url= http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |title= \"An A - to - Z Guide to Camp Randall'' |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704173545/http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |archive-date=2008-07-04 | accessdate= July 31, 2019 }}</ref> After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, and en route to their second 6\u20130 start of the modern football era, one of the Badgers' marketing agents, who was in charge of sound, piped the song through the loudspeakers.<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin Football: More Than a Game|first=Jen|last=Brown|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=1172725&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> It stirred up fans and players and eventually became a tradition.<ref name=\"ABC News\" />\n\nHowever, on September 6, 2003 (the Badgers' first home game of the season), with construction of skyboxes surrounding [[Camp Randall Stadium]], UW officials decided to cancel the \"Jump Around\" due to worries about structural integrity.

He lives in Pottsville which has a population of \"1280 souls\".\n\nSheriff Nick Corey presents himself as a genial fool, simplistic, over-accommodating, and harmless to a fault, given he is Pottsville's sole lawman. In reality, he is a clever psychopath able to manipulate people by appealing to their worst instincts and to get away with multiple murders. \n\nThe novel begins with Nick visiting Ken Lacey, the sheriff of a nearby county. Nick visits Sheriff Lacey ostensibly to ask for advice as he has in the past. Nick has two pimps in charge of a whorehouse on the river at the edge of town who regularly insult and abuse him. Nick asks Lacey what to do about them and Lacey mocks and belittles Nick including literally kicking him in the behind multiple times. Lacey finally explains that he is doing all this to show Nick that when someone hurts you, you need to hurt them back twice as hard, finishing with the boast that if any pimps tried to disrespect him, he would shoot them dead on the spot. In the process of suffering the abuse of Lacey and his deputy Buck, Nick realizes that Buck harbors ill will toward sheriff Lacey as well. He manipulates Lacey to have Buck see him off at the train station and has a discussion with Buck before heading back home.\n\nEarly that evening Nick goes to see the two pimps.  As usual they berate and mock him for taking their graft and for being generally spineless. Nick plays the fool and takes their abuse waiting for a steamboat to traverse a bend in the river and blow its whistle. When it does, to the shock of the pimps, Nick pulls his gun and kills them both, relying on the noise of the whistle to cover the sound of his gun.\n\nHe dumps their bodies in the river and returns home to take a nap. He's awakened by his wife Myra to find that Sheriff Lacey has come to see him. At the prodding of his deputy Buck, Sheriff Lacey became concerned that Nick might actually kill the pimps and make him an accessory for encouraging the crime. Nick reassures Lacey that the thought never entered his mind. He gets Lacey drunk and then apologizes that even though it's too late to get a train back Nick doesn't have room to let Lacey stay the night and there are no hotels in Pottsville. He tells Lacey the only place to spend the night is the whorehouse run by the pimps. In his drunken state Lacey is eager to spend the night this way. As Nick walks him there he manipulates Lacey to brag to several people that he would never take abuse from the pimps, virtually claiming he would kill them if they tried. He further manipulates Lacey to make similar claims to the prostitutes at the house.\n\nThe next day, the county attorney Robert Lee Jefferson berates Nick for not doing his job and never making any arrests. Jefferson warns Nick that he will face a strong opponent in the coming election from Sam Gaddis. Nick replies that the people don't really want him to do his job, that they enjoy petty crimes such as gambling, public drunkenness, and prostitution and that if he started to arrest people for such crimes  he would have to arrest the whole town. Jefferson is adamant that Nick needs to stop being so lazy and cowardly because Gaddis is everything that Nick is not. Nick agrees with Jefferson that Gaddis is a man of the highest moral quality regardless of all the rumors about him people are spreading. Jefferson asks and then demands to know what these rumors are but Nick refuses to tell him. In reality there are no rumors but Nick realizes that he has planted a seed that will result in them.\n\nNick then goes to find Tom Hauck, the husband of Rose Hauck who Nick is having an affair with. He finds Hauck drinking and fishing at the river. Nick tells Hauck that he has been having sex with his wife and as Hauck begins to sputter with rage Nick picks up Hauck's shotgun and lets him have both barrels in the stomach. As Hauck lies in agonizing pain Nick kicks him a few times and leaves him to die a painful death. Nick leaves Hauck to go see Hauck's wife Rose. He encourages Rose to have sex with him, but as much as she wants to, she has work that must be done at her farm or her husband will viciously beat her when he returns from fishing. Nick toys with her a while then finally gives her the news that he has killed her husband. She is overjoyed and they retreat to her bedroom to have passionate sex.\n\nIn addition to Rose Hauck, Nick is also having an affair with Amy Mason. He sometimes has difficulties juggling both affairs while keeping either woman as well as his wife Myra and her imbecile brother Lennie from discovering them but by quick thinking and manipulation he is always able to.\n\nWhere as Rose is foul mouthed and hypocritical, Amy is the only person in Pottsville that is beyond Nick's manipulation because she has a strong sense of morality. As she learns that Nick is planning to frame Sheriff Lacey for the murder of the two pimps which Nick committed she threatens to tell the authorities regardless of any potential consequences for her and Nick realizes that she would actually do it. This makes Amy more appealing to Nick than Rose. He realizes that he must choose between them because Amy is too intelligent to try and deceive about his relation with Rose and she will no longer tolerate Nick seeing Rose. \n\nNick comes up with a way to get rid of his wife Myra, her brother, and Rose all at once. He manipulates Rose, who thinks she is taking part in a scheme to get rid of Nick's wife, to tell Myra's brother Lennie that she has seen him and Myra having passionate sex. Upon hearing this, Myra takes Lennie and heads for Rose's house. Myra breaks in on Rose and tells her that because she discovered her and Lennie's secret (what seemed like a vicious rumor turned out to be the truth) she is going to have Lennie rape her while she takes photos in order to blackmail Rose and force her to leave town. Rose gets a pistol that she purchased to protect herself from her abusive husband and kills both Myra and her brother. \n\nRose finally realizes she has been manipulated by Nick. When she confronts Nick he just laughs at her and suggests she get out of town as soon as possible before the bodies are discovered. Toward the end of the novel, Nick's inner dialogue becomes more and more delusional as he comes to believe he is Jesus come to Earth to dispense justice on the guilty, hypocritical people of Pottsville. The novel ends without Nick being caught for any of his crimes but with the impression that circumstances are finally catching up to him while he becomes more delusional.\n\n==Themes==\nThe character of a sheriff who plays the fool but is in reality highly intelligent is used several times by Thompson. Sometimes, as in this novel and ''[[The Killer Inside Me]]'', the sheriff is a psychopath. In the novels ''[[Wild Town]]'' and ''[[The Transgressors]]'', the sheriff is heroic, a highly intelligent man who was forced by circumstances to take a job that didn't allow him to take full advantage of his abilities and who plays at being a clown to fit in to his role and to manipulate people for altruistic ends.\n\nIn his autobiography ''Bad Boy'', Thompson wrote that this character was based on an actual deputy who pursued him when he neglected to pay a fine for being drunk and disturbing the peace. As recounted in a NY Times article,<ref name=NY>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=CRIME/MYSTERY; A Tale of Pulp and Passion: The Jim Thompson Revival|first=Lawrence|last=Block|date=October 14, 1990|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/books/crime-mystery-a-tale-of-pulp-and-passion-the-jim-thompson-revival.html?pagewanted=all|authorlink=Lawrence Block}}</ref> Thompson describes the encounter he had with the deputy: {{Blockquote| Alone with him on the vast prairie, the deputy becomes a creature of menace:'' 'Lived here all my life. . . . Everyone knows me. No one knows you. And we're all alone. What do you make o' that, a smart fella like you? . . . What do you think an ol' stupid country boy might do in a case like this?' ''\n\nThe deputy grins, puts on a pair of gloves, smacks a fist into the palm of his other hand.\n\n'' 'I'll tell you something. . . . Tell you a couple of things. There ain't no way of telling what a man is by looking at him. There ain't no way of knowing what he'll do if he has the chance. You think maybe you can remember that?' ''}}\n\nThe sheriff also is quite likely based to some degree on Thompson's own father, who had many of the same characteristics: a born politician who knew just what to say to win favor with anyone and who appeared friendly on the outside but inside harbored a great deal of pent up rage and misanthropy. \n\n''Pop. 1280'' is also one of Thompson's most overtly political books. Nick constantly uses jokes to point out the racism, classism, and sexism of American society, for example at the end of Nick's discussion with the county attorney who is after Nick to make more arrests when Nick promises to arrest anyone who breaks the law, \"Providing o' course, that he's either colored or some poor white trash that can't pay his pole tax\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Polito |first1=Robert |title=Savage Art: A Biography of Jim Thompson |date=1995 |publisher=Vintage Books |pages=450-458}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n''Pop. 1280'' was adapted as the French film ''[[Coup de Torchon]]'' (1981), directed by [[Bertrand Tavernier]], set in [[French West Africa]] in 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE6D71038F933A15751C1A964948260|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2012-04-10|title=Clean Slate (1981) 'Coup De Torchon,' Life In A French Colony|author=Maslin, Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|date=1982-12-20}}</ref>\n\nGreek director [[Yorgos Lanthimos]] has been tapped to direct a new adaptation for release in 2020.<ref name= \"Lanthimos\">{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Clare |url= https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/02/yorgos-lanthimos-pop-1280.html |title=Yorgos Lanthimos to Write, Direct Adaptation of Crime Novel ''Pop. 1280'' |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=February 22, 2019 |accessdate=February 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books/about/Pop_1280.html?id=_tfD2GBkwEsC ''Pop. 1280'' at Google Books]\n\n{{Jim Thompson}}\n\n[[Category:1964 American novels]]\n[[Category:American crime novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Jim Thompson]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Texas]]\n[[Category:English-language novels]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1917]]\n[[Category:Hardboiled crime novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the 1910s]]\n[[Category:Fiction with unreliable narrators]]\n[[Category:Historical crime novels]]\n[[Category:American novels adapted into films]]\n\n\n{{1960s-crime-novel-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n|name         = Pop. 1280\n|image        = File:Pop1280Novel.jpg\n|border       = yes    \n|caption= First edition\n|author       = [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]]\n|cover_artist = \n|country      = United States\n|language     = [[English language|English]]\n|genre        = [[Crime novel]]\n|publisher    = [[Gold Medal Books]]\n|release_date = 1964\n|media_type   = Print\n|pages        = 143 pp\n|isbn         = \n}}\n\n'''''Pop. 1280''''' is a [[Crime fiction|crime novel]] by [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]], published in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/21/movies/in-the-desert-a-jim-thompson-novel-blossoms-on-film.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=In the Desert, a Jim Thompson Novel Blossoms on Film|author=Farber, Stephen|date=1990-01-21|accessdate=2012-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/movies/06killer.html?pagewanted=all|title=Filmed to a Pulp|author=McGrath, Charles|date=2010-06-03|accessdate=2012-04-10|work=The New York Times}}</ref> [[NPR]]'s [[Stephen Marche]] described it as Thompson's \"true masterpiece, a preposterously upsetting, ridiculously hilarious layer cake of nastiness, a romp through a world of nearly infinite deceit.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Bad Sheriff: Murder, Lies And Southern Fried Catfish|url = https://www.npr.org/2012/09/26/161756068/bad-sheriff-murder-lies-and-southern-fried-catfish|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2015-05-08|first=Stephen|last=Marche}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''Pop. 1280'' is the first-person narrative of Nick Corey, the listless [[sheriff]] of Potts County, the \"47th (out of 47) largest [[county]] in the state\".

He manipulates Rose, who thinks she is taking part in a scheme to get rid of Nick's wife, to tell Myra's brother Lennie that she has seen him and Myra having passionate sex. Upon hearing this, Myra takes Lennie and heads for Rose's house. Myra breaks in on Rose and tells her that because she discovered her and Lennie's secret (what seemed like a vicious rumor turned out to be the truth) she is going to have Lennie rape her while she takes photos in order to blackmail Rose and force her to leave town. Rose gets a pistol that she purchased to protect herself from her abusive husband and kills both Myra and her brother. \n\nRose finally realizes she has been manipulated by Nick. When she confronts Nick he just laughs at her and suggests she get out of town as soon as possible before the bodies are discovered. Toward the end of the novel, Nick's inner dialogue becomes more and more delusional as he comes to believe he is Jesus come to Earth to dispense justice on the guilty, hypocritical people of Pottsville. The novel ends without Nick being caught for any of his crimes but with the impression that circumstances are finally catching up to him while he becomes more delusional.\n\n==Themes==\nThe character of a sheriff who plays the fool but is in reality highly intelligent is used several times by Thompson. Sometimes, as in this novel and ''[[The Killer Inside Me]]'', the sheriff is a psychopath. In the novels ''[[Wild Town]]'' and ''[[The Transgressors]]'', the sheriff is heroic, a highly intelligent man who was forced by circumstances to take a job that didn\u2019t allow him to take full advantage of his abilities and who plays at being a clown to fit in to his role and to manipulate people for altruistic ends.\n\nIn his autobiography ''Bad Boy'', Thompson wrote that this character was based on an actual deputy who pursued him when he neglected to pay a fine for being drunk and disturbing the peace. As recounted in a NY Times article,<ref name=NY>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=CRIME/MYSTERY; A Tale of Pulp and Passion: The Jim Thompson Revival|first=Lawrence|last=Block|date=October 14, 1990|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/books/crime-mystery-a-tale-of-pulp-and-passion-the-jim-thompson-revival.html?pagewanted=all|authorlink=Lawrence Block}}</ref> Thompson describes the encounter he had with the deputy: {{Blockquote| Alone with him on the vast prairie, the deputy becomes a creature of menace:'' 'Lived here all my life. . . . Everyone knows me. No one knows you. And we're all alone. What do you make o' that, a smart fella like you? . . . What do you think an ol' stupid country boy might do in a case like this?' ''\n\nThe deputy grins, puts on a pair of gloves, smacks a fist into the palm of his other hand.\n\n'' 'I'll tell you something. . . . Tell you a couple of things. There ain't no way of telling what a man is by looking at him. There ain't no way of knowing what he'll do if he has the chance. You think maybe you can remember that?' ''}}\n\nThe sheriff also is quite likely based to some degree on Thompson's own father, who had many of the same characteristics: a born politician who knew just what to say to win favor with anyone and who appeared friendly on the outside but inside harbored a great deal of pent up rage and misanthropy. \n\n''Pop. 1280'' is also one of Thompson's most overtly political books. Nick constantly uses jokes to point out the racism, classism, and sexism of American society, for example at the end of Nick's discussion with the county attorney who is after Nick to make more arrests when Nick promises to arrest anyone who breaks the law, \"Providing o' course, that he's either colored or some poor white trash that can't pay his pole tax\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Polito |first1=Robert |title=Savage Art: A Biography of Jim Thompson |date=1995 |publisher=Vintage Books |pages=450-458}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n''Pop. 1280'' was adapted as the French film ''[[Coup de Torchon]]'' (1981), directed by [[Bertrand Tavernier]], set in [[French West Africa]] in 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE6D71038F933A15751C1A964948260|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2012-04-10|title=Clean Slate (1981) 'Coup De Torchon,' Life In A French Colony|author=Maslin, Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|date=1982-12-20}}</ref>\n\nGreek director [[Yorgos Lanthimos]] has been tapped to direct a new adaptation for release in 2020.<ref name= \"Lanthimos\">{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Clare |url= https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/02/yorgos-lanthimos-pop-1280.html |title=Yorgos Lanthimos to Write, Direct Adaptation of Crime Novel ''Pop. 1280'' |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=February 22, 2019 |accessdate=February 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books/about/Pop_1280.html?id=_tfD2GBkwEsC ''Pop. 1280'' at Google Books]\n\n{{Jim Thompson}}\n\n[[Category:1964 American novels]]\n[[Category:American crime novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Jim Thompson]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Texas]]\n[[Category:English-language novels]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1917]]\n[[Category:Hardboiled crime novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the 1910s]]\n[[Category:Fiction with unreliable narrators]]\n[[Category:Historical crime novels]]\n[[Category:American novels adapted into films]]\n\n\n{{1960s-crime-novel-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: doesn\u2019t \u2192 doesn't (3), He\u2019s \u2192 He's, it\u2019s \u2192 it's, \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop._1280"}

dance classes happened to be interested in acting and were attending [[Barry John (theatre director)|Barry John]]'s drama classes. Influenced by them, Rajput also joined the acting classes. Here, he found his passion for acting: \"I found the experience liberating. I realised that I could communicate with the audience. I knew I wanted to do this forever.\"<ref name=\"filmfare.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfare.com/interviews/i-want-to-be-on-the-cover-of-filmfare-sushant-singh-rajput-3428.html|title=\"I want to be on the cover of Filmfare\" \u2013 Sushant Singh Rajput|publisher=Filmfare.com |author=Anuradha Choudhary |date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWithin a few months of joining the dance class, Rajput was selected to be a member of Davar's standard dance troupe. In 2005, he was chosen to be one of the group of background dancers at the [[51st Filmfare Awards]]. In 2006, he was part of the troupe that went to Australia to perform in the cultural program at the opening ceremony of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]. By this time, he was tired of engineering. He was happy and successful in the dance and drama classes, and decided to do what he was good at. He dropped out of engineering and devoted himself full-time to dancing and acting.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nTo make a break into films, Rajput moved to [[Mumbai]] and joined [[Nadira Babbar]]'s ''Ekjute'' theatre group, which he remained a part of for two and a half years.<ref name=\"Sushant Singh Interview\"/> During this time, he was featured in a TV advertisement for Nestle Munch, which became famous throughout India.\n\n===Television (2008\u201312)===\nIn 2008, the casting team of [[Balaji Telefilms]] saw Rajput's personality and acting talent while he was on stage for one of Ekjute's plays. They invited him to audition for them and Rajput landed the role of Preet Juneja in [[Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil]]. His character was killed quite early in the show, but he was such a popular character with the viewers that he was brought back for the series finale in the form of a [[spirit]], looking on as his family celebrates after going through difficult times.\n\nIn June 2009, Rajput began starring in [[Pavitra Rishta]] as Manav Deshmukh, a serious and mature character working as a mechanic to help support his family. His work in this serial received wide appreciation, and Rajput received three major television awards for best male actor and most popular actor. This performance was his breakthrough and gave him a stepping stone into films.\n\nIn May 2010, Rajput joined the dance reality show [[Zara Nachke Dikha]] 2. He had already proven his acting talents by winning awards for his performance in [[Pavitra Rishta]], and he wanted to establish that he had good dancing skills and could be trained further. In ''Zara Nachke Dikha'', Rajput was a part of the Mast Kalandar Boys Team. He did the shooting for both ''Pavitra Rishta'' and ''Zara Nachke Dikha 2'' at the same time.
