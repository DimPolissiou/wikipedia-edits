[[Byron Kilbourn]], one of the highway commissioners, and Jasper Vliet, a surveyor, were put in charge of determining the route the road would take and of identifying a good halfway point for travelers. The path they chose is now [[U.S. Route 45]] and the rest stop is present-day West Bend. Because many people used the resting place, it evolved into a popular area. The [[Milwaukee River]] running through the town eventually played a major role in the city's history. It was because of the western bend in the river that West Bend got its name. The river also produced enough energy to power saw mills and gristmills. Early buildings included Holy Angels Catholic Church, built in 1852 at the corner of Hickory and 7th. In 1866 this building was converted into a school, and a new church was built at Elm and 7th under the direction of Reverend Johann Baptist Reindl (1827\u20131891);<ref>Heming, Harry Hooper. 1899.

[[Byron Kilbourn]], one of the highway commissioners, and Jasper Vliet, a surveyor, were put in charge of determining the route the road would take and of identifying a good halfway point for travelers. The path they chose is now [[U.S. Route 45]] and the rest stop is present-day West Bend. Because many people used the resting place, it evolved into a popular area. The [[Milwaukee River]] running through the town eventually played a major role in the city's history. It was because of the western bend in the river that West Bend got its name. The river also produced enough energy to power saw mills and gristmills. Early buildings included Holy Angels Catholic Church, built in 1852 at the corner of Hickory and 7th. In 1866 this building was converted into a school, and a new church was built at Elm and 7th under the direction of Reverend Johann Baptist Reindl (1827\u20131891);<ref>Heming, Harry Hooper. 1899.
