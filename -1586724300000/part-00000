Waxing involves applying melted, usually hot, wax to the pubic hair that an individual would like to remove. The wax, which adheres to the hair as it hardens, is then covered with small strips of cloth. When the wax hardens sufficiently, the cloth is pulled off quickly, removing the hair from its roots as the wax is pulled away. Waxing can be performed on oneself privately using a home kit or by a [[cosmetologist]] at a salon or spa.<ref name=Cosmo/>\n\n<!-- Do not remove these images, Wikipedia is not censored and the current consensus is for this article to have images -->\n[[File:Ceretta a calo inguinale.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Wax being applied to female pubic hair]]\n\nIf a person has never been waxed before, or has not been waxed for a long time, it may be necessary to trim the pubic hair using scissors or an electric razor prior to waxing.<ref name=\"milady\">Helen Bickmore; ''Milady's Hair Removal Techniques: A Comprehensive Manual''; Thomson Delmar Learning; 2003; {{ISBN|1-4018-1555-3}}</ref><ref name=\"Ovat\">Lia Schorr, Shari Miller Sims & Shari Sims, ''SalonOvations' Advanced Skin Care Handbook'', pages 94\u201395, 117-118, Cengage Learning, 1994, {{ISBN|1-56253-045-3}}</ref> A patch test is recommended, usually on the upper thigh, to test for allergies or skin sensitivities to the ingredients in the wax.

Waxing involves applying melted, usually hot, wax to the pubic hair that an individual would like to remove. The wax, which adheres to the hair as it hardens, is then covered with small strips of cloth. When the wax hardens sufficiently, the cloth is pulled off quickly, removing the hair from its roots as the wax is pulled away.

The film expands the original story to include [[sex in film|sex]] and broad adult humor, as well as original songs. The film was directed by Bud Townsend, produced by [[Bill Osco|William Osco]], and written by Bucky Searles, based on a concept by Jason Williams.<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nThe plot revolves around Alice ([[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]]), a librarian who falls asleep reading the book ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', and dreams of the [[White Rabbit]] ([[Larry Gelman]]), who she follows into [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]], where she begins to experiment with her unexplored sexuality. Through a series of sexual encounters, Alice loses her sexual inhibitions and allows herself to become sexually liberated. The film is a [[softcore pornography|softcore]] erotic comedy with orchestrated musical numbers which move the plot forward, and contribute to the film's humor.\n\nAfter premiering in a longer version, three minutes were edited from the film, and it was [[R rating (Motion Picture Association of America)|rated R]] by the [[MPAA]], and released theatrically by General National, a company formed by producers Jason Williams and William Osco, due to other distributors being unwilling to distribute a sex film.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The film grossed over $90 million at the box office.<ref name=\"Alice Beyond Wonderland\"/> Osco later re-edited the film as a [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] film, incorporating explicit sex that was not part of the film's original production.<ref name=RialtoReport/> In 2004, Osco staged an [[Off-Broadway]] stage adaptation of the musical.<ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\"Off Broadway Musicals\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter rejecting the advances of her boyfriend, William (Ron Nelson), mousy librarian Alice falls asleep reading ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The [[White Rabbit]] appears to her in a dream and she follows him into [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]]. Finding herself in a room and too large to fit through the small door, Alice drinks a potion which causes her to shrink while her dress remains the same size, leaving her naked. While chasing the Rabbit, she falls into a river and begins to drown, but is saved by a group of local inhabitants. After making friends with them, Alice is given a new (albeit very revealing) dress before setting off after the Rabbit again. While walking through the woods, she begins to experiment with her sexuality by stripping naked and masturbating.The Rabbit happens upon her and takes her to meet the [[Mad Hatter]].\n\nAfter being initially uncomfortable when the Mad Hatter exposes his penis to her, Alice ultimately performs fellatio on him. She is then called to assist [[Humpty Dumpty#In Through the Looking-Glass|Humpty Dumpty]], who has fallen off a wall, causing him to lose the ability to achieve an erection. The situation is rectified when Alice performs fellatio on Dumpty. She is then taken to meet siblings [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]], whom she watches having passionate but incestuous intercourse. Following this encounter, Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Mad Hatter continue on toward the [[King's Ball]]. On the way, they come across a couple having sex in an open field; Alice chastises them but she is ignored. At the royal court, [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the King]] converses with Alice, speaking with her about self-empowerment and ignoring the judgements of others; he ultimately seduces her.\n\n[[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen]] suddenly appears, catching Alice and the king in bed together. A hurried trial is held and Alice is \"convicted\" of being a virgin. As punishment, the Queen orders Alice to have sex with her. A number of sexual escapades ensue among various characters as Alice prepares to carry out her sentence, including a brief lesbian encounter between Alice and the Queen's maids. Alice and the Queen engage in lesbian sex, but as a result of the cunnilingus she receives from Alice, the Queen experiences an orgasm so strong it briefly incapacitates her. The Mad Hatter and White Rabbit assist Alice in escaping the Queen, who pursues to no avail.\n\nWaking from her dream and thereby returning to the real world, Alice meets William again. Having experienced a sexual awakening while in Wonderland, Alice accepts William's advances and they have sex in the library. In a closing sequence, Alice travels through Wonderland naked before she and William set off toward their new home where they live \"happily ever after.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]] as Alice\n* [[Larry Gelman]] as the [[White Rabbit]]\n* Alan Novak as the [[The Hatter|Mad Hatter]]\n* Terry Hall as Nurse\n* Jason Williams as the [[White Knight (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Knight]]\n* Ron Nelson as William\n* Bucky Searles as [[Humpty Dumpty]] / Queen of Hearts's Brother\n* [[Gela Nash-Taylor|Gila Havana]] as the Black Knight's Girl\n* J.P.

Williams pitched the film to producer [[Bill Osco|William Osco]], who liked the idea, and hired comedian Bucky Searles to write the screenplay and songs, and raised $100,000 for the budget.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nProduction took place in New York City. Williams ran an ad in the ''[[Village Voice]]'' seeking auditions for a \"X-rated musical\", instructing that applicants \"must be able to sing and dance\".<ref name=RialtoReport/> Williams was too busy with other aspects of the film's production to direct, so Bud Townsend was hired to direct instead. Townsend was a prolific director of television commercials, who Williams had met auditioning for his horror film ''[[Terror at Red Wolf Inn]]''. Though Townsend had never directed a sex film before, he was hired to helm ''Alice in Wonderland'', along with his wife, Patty, who served as the script supervisor.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The dancing was choreographed by Buddy Schwab, who was a successful choreographer with Broadway credits.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The film was initially going to be shot on [[16mm film]], but Townsend talked the producers into filming on [[35 mm movie film|35mm film]].<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nJuliet Graham auditioned for the role of Alice, but was offered the role of the Queen of Hearts instead, which she accepted. Through a modeling agency, [[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]] was cast as Alice. The 20-year-old fashion model had a background in musical theater, and could sing and dance. Many of the actors were regulars of New York's porn scene, while others were prominent character actors such as Larry Gelman, a friend of the screenwriter, who agreed to play the White Rabbit if he didn't have to appear nude, and if his wife and children could be flown out to New York on the production's budget.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The auditions for singing and dancing performers primarily emphasized the actors' dancing abilities, as the producers planned to re-record most of the singing with professional singers.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nFilming took place in 10 continuous days in either June or July 1975.<ref name=RialtoReport/> During filming, most of the actors stayed in the house used in the film.<ref name=RialtoReport/> A scratch track of the film's musical numbers was used for the actors to lip synch to during filming.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nThe initial plan was to produce the film as a [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] film, but once filming commenced, Williams said \"the vision for the film rapidly started expanding. We had these big sets, elaborate design, and we had this big opportunity. So we had this relatively short shooting schedule and we didn\u2019t have much time to go in and do a lot of close-up stuff that you need for hardcore\", so the sex scenes were filmed in wide shots.<ref name=RialtoReport/> De Bell performed in a [[unsimulated sex|unsimulated]] lesbian sex scene with Juliet Graham.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nCast and crew described Osco as being an intimidating figure, with Juliet Graham saying that Osco threatened not to pay her if she didn't spend an evening in his hotel room, and she did, but didn't have sex with him, telling Osco she was the girlfriend of porn actor [[Jamie Gillis]].<ref name=RialtoReport>{{cite web |url=https://www.therialtoreport.com/2015/03/22/alice-in-wonderland-1976-what-really-happened/ |title=Alice in Wonderland (1976): What really happened? |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Rialto Report |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Osco convinced De Bell to allow him to film her performing oral sex on Osco, saying it was necessary for the film.<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nThe film's budget was entirely spent on filming, and the production company Kaleidoscope Films provided $250,000 to $300,000 for the film's post-production.<ref name=RialtoReport/> Musician and composer Peter Matz re-recorded the film's songs in full orchestral arrangements, and post-production was completed by the end of 1975.<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\n==Release==\n\nThe film's premiere was held on Times Square in 1976, at an event attended by [[Andy Warhol]]. It was well-received, but the producers could not interest a distributor because of an unwillingness to release a sex film, so Williams and Osco decided to form a new company to distribute it, calling it General National, explaining, \"At that time, there was a company called \u2018National General\u2019 [...] so if we just call ourselves \u2018General National\u2019 everybody will think it's the same damn big company, and we'll get treated in the same way\".<ref name=RialtoReport/> For the general release, three minutes were removed, and the [[MPAA]] gave it a [[R rating (Motion Picture Association of America)|R rating]].<ref name=RialtoReport/> Concurrent with the film's release, De Bell appeared on the cover of ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]''.<ref name=RialtoReport/> Osco sold the foreign distribution rights to multiple distributors within the same territories, telling each distributor they had exclusive distribution rights.<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nThe film grossed over $90 million globally.<ref name=\"Alice Beyond Wonderland\">{{cite book|last=Hollingsworth|first=Cristopher|title=Alice Beyond Wonderland: Essays for the Twenty-first Century|year=2009|publisher=[[University of Iowa Press]]|location=[[Iowa City, Iowa]]|isbn=978-1587298196|page=182}}</ref> According to De Bell, the film grossed over $100 million, and although she told an interviewer that she had 1% ownership of the film, she didn't see any profits from the film's release.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nIn October 1976, lawyers for the Taconic Park Commission threatened a lawsuit against Osco after finding out that Osco had filmed on historical sites without permission.<ref name=RialtoReport/> A month later, the film was reviewed by film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who wrote, \"Maybe because I went with low expectations, I found the movie a pleasant surprise. And its most pleasant surprise is its star, Kristine De Bell, who projects such a freshness and naivete that she charms us even in scenes where some rather alarming things are going on.

Kaleidoscope ended up owning the rights to the film as a result of the lawsuit.

The film expands the original story to include [[sex in film|sex]] and broad adult humor, as well as original songs. The film was directed by Bud Townsend, produced by [[Bill Osco|William Osco]], and written by Bucky Searles, based on a concept by Jason Williams.<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nThe plot revolves around Alice ([[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]]), a librarian who falls asleep reading the book ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', and dreams of the [[White Rabbit]] ([[Larry Gelman]]), who she follows into [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]], where she begins to experiment with her unexplored sexuality. Through a series of sexual encounters, Alice loses her sexual inhibitions and allows herself to become sexually liberated. The film is a [[softcore pornography|softcore]] erotic comedy with orchestrated musical numbers which move the plot forward, and contribute to the film's humor.\n\nAfter premiering in a longer version, three minutes were edited from the film, and it was [[R rating (Motion Picture Association of America)|rated R]] by the [[MPAA]], and released theatrically by General National, a company formed by producers Jason Williams and William Osco, due to other distributors being unwilling to distribute a sex film.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The film grossed over $90 million at the box office.<ref name=\"Alice Beyond Wonderland\"/> Osco later re-edited the film as a [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] film, incorporating explicit sex that was not part of the film's original production.<ref name=RialtoReport/> In 2004, Osco staged an [[Off-Broadway]] stage adaptation of the musical.<ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\"Off Broadway Musicals\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter rejecting the advances of her boyfriend, William (Ron Nelson), mousy librarian Alice falls asleep reading ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The [[White Rabbit]] appears to her in a dream and she follows him into [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]]. Finding herself in a room and too large to fit through the small door, Alice drinks a potion which causes her to shrink while her dress remains the same size, leaving her naked. While chasing the Rabbit, she falls into a river and begins to drown, but is saved by a group of local inhabitants. After making friends with them, Alice is given a new (albeit very revealing) dress before setting off after the Rabbit again. While walking through the woods, she begins to experiment with her sexuality by stripping naked and masturbating.The Rabbit happens upon her and takes her to meet the [[Mad Hatter]].\n\nAfter being initially uncomfortable when the Mad Hatter exposes his penis to her, Alice ultimately performs fellatio on him. She is then called to assist [[Humpty Dumpty#In Through the Looking-Glass|Humpty Dumpty]], who has fallen off a wall, causing him to lose the ability to achieve an erection. The situation is rectified when Alice performs fellatio on Dumpty. She is then taken to meet siblings [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]], whom she watches having passionate but incestuous intercourse. Following this encounter, Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Mad Hatter continue on toward the [[King's Ball]]. On the way, they come across a couple having sex in an open field; Alice chastises them but she is ignored. At the royal court, [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the King]] converses with Alice, speaking with her about self-empowerment and ignoring the judgements of others; he ultimately seduces her.\n\n[[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen]] suddenly appears, catching Alice and the king in bed together. A hurried trial is held and Alice is \"convicted\" of being a virgin. As punishment, the Queen orders Alice to have sex with her. A number of sexual escapades ensue among various characters as Alice prepares to carry out her sentence, including a brief lesbian encounter between Alice and the Queen's maids. Alice and the Queen engage in lesbian sex, but as a result of the cunnilingus she receives from Alice, the Queen experiences an orgasm so strong it briefly incapacitates her. The Mad Hatter and White Rabbit assist Alice in escaping the Queen, who pursues to no avail.\n\nWaking from her dream and thereby returning to the real world, Alice meets William again. Having experienced a sexual awakening while in Wonderland, Alice accepts William's advances and they have sex in the library. In a closing sequence, Alice travels through Wonderland naked before she and William set off toward their new home where they live \"happily ever after.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]] as Alice\n* [[Larry Gelman]] as the [[White Rabbit]]\n* Alan Novak as the [[The Hatter|Mad Hatter]]\n* Terry Hall as Nurse\n* Jason Williams as the [[White Knight (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Knight]]\n* Ron Nelson as William\n* Bucky Searles as [[Humpty Dumpty]] / Queen of Hearts's Brother\n* [[Gela Nash-Taylor|Gila Havana]] as the Black Knight's Girl\n* J.P.

Williams pitched the film to producer [[Bill Osco|William Osco]], who liked the idea, and hired comedian Bucky Searles to write the screenplay and songs, and raised $100,000 for the budget.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nProduction took place in New York City. Williams ran an ad in the ''[[Village Voice]]'' seeking auditions for a \"X-rated musical\", instructing that applicants \"must be able to sing and dance\".<ref name=RialtoReport/> Williams was too busy with other aspects of the film's production to direct, so Bud Townsend was hired to direct instead. Townsend was a prolific director of television commercials, who Williams had met auditioning for his horror film ''[[Terror at Red Wolf Inn]]''. Though Townsend had never directed a sex film before, he was hired to helm ''Alice in Wonderland'', along with his wife, Patty, who served as the script supervisor.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The dancing was choreographed by Buddy Schwab, who was a successful choreographer with Broadway credits.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The film was initially going to be shot on [[16mm film]], but Townsend talked the producers into filming on [[35 mm movie film|35mm film]].<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nJuliet Graham auditioned for the role of Alice, but was offered the role of the Queen of Hearts instead, which she accepted. Through a modeling agency, [[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]] was cast as Alice. The 20-year-old fashion model had a background in musical theater, and could sing and dance. Many of the actors were regulars of New York's porn scene, while others were prominent character actors such as Larry Gelman, a friend of the screenwriter, who agreed to play the White Rabbit if he didn't have to appear nude, and if his wife and children could be flown out to New York on the production's budget.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The auditions for singing and dancing performers primarily emphasized the actors' dancing abilities, as the producers planned to re-record most of the singing with professional singers.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nFilming took place in 10 continuous days in either June or July 1975.<ref name=RialtoReport/> During filming, most of the actors stayed in the house used in the film.<ref name=RialtoReport/> A scratch track of the film's musical numbers was used for the actors to lip synch to during filming.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nThe initial plan was to produce the film as a [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] film, but once filming commenced, Williams said \"the vision for the film rapidly started expanding. We had these big sets, elaborate design, and we had this big opportunity. So we had this relatively short shooting schedule and we didn\u2019t have much time to go in and do a lot of close-up stuff that you need for hardcore\", so the sex scenes were filmed in wide shots.<ref name=RialtoReport/> De Bell performed in a [[unsimulated sex|unsimulated]] lesbian sex scene with Juliet Graham.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nCast and crew described Osco as being an intimidating figure, with Juliet Graham saying that Osco threatened not to pay her if she didn't spend an evening in his hotel room, and she did, but didn't have sex with him, telling Osco she was the girlfriend of porn actor [[Jamie Gillis]].<ref name=RialtoReport>{{cite web |url=https://www.therialtoreport.com/2015/03/22/alice-in-wonderland-1976-what-really-happened/ |title=Alice in Wonderland (1976): What really happened? |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Rialto Report |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Osco convinced De Bell to allow him to film her performing oral sex on Osco, saying it was necessary for the film.<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nThe film's budget was entirely spent on filming, and the production company Kaleidoscope Films provided $250,000 to $300,000 for the film's post-production.<ref name=RialtoReport/> Musician and composer Peter Matz re-recorded the film's songs in full orchestral arrangements, and post-production was completed by the end of 1975.<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\n==Release==\n\nThe film's premiere was held on Times Square in 1976, at an event attended by [[Andy Warhol]]. It was well-received, but the producers could not interest a distributor because of an unwillingness to release a sex film, so Williams and Osco decided to form a new company to distribute it, calling it General National, explaining, \"At that time, there was a company called \u2018National General\u2019 [...] so if we just call ourselves \u2018General National\u2019 everybody will think it's the same damn big company, and we'll get treated in the same way\".<ref name=RialtoReport/> For the general release, three minutes were removed, and the [[MPAA]] gave it a [[R rating (Motion Picture Association of America)|R rating]].<ref name=RialtoReport/> Concurrent with the film's release, De Bell appeared on the cover of ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]''.<ref name=RialtoReport/> Osco sold the foreign distribution rights to multiple distributors within the same territories, telling each distributor they had exclusive distribution rights.<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nThe film grossed over $90 million globally.<ref name=\"Alice Beyond Wonderland\">{{cite book|last=Hollingsworth|first=Cristopher|title=Alice Beyond Wonderland: Essays for the Twenty-first Century|year=2009|publisher=[[University of Iowa Press]]|location=[[Iowa City, Iowa]]|isbn=978-1587298196|page=182}}</ref> According to De Bell, the film grossed over $100 million, and although she told an interviewer that she had 1% ownership of the film, she didn't see any profits from the film's release.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nIn October 1976, lawyers for the Taconic Park Commission threatened a lawsuit against Osco after finding out that Osco had filmed on historical sites without permission.<ref name=RialtoReport/> A month later, the film was reviewed by film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who wrote, \"Maybe because I went with low expectations, I found the movie a pleasant surprise. And its most pleasant surprise is its star, Kristine De Bell, who projects such a freshness and naivete that she charms us even in scenes where some rather alarming things are going on.

Baba Voss, the chieftain of the Alkenny tribe, takes in and marries a woman, Maghra, who comes to the Alkenny seeking shelter. Baba Voss has been unable to father children, and the woman is pregnant when she first arrives. To both the woman and Baba Voss's surprise, the woman has twins who can see. The twins are named Kofun and Haniwa, and their biological father is Jerlamarel. \n\nAs word spreads, it gets the attention of a cynical tribe and its queen who will stop at nothing to get their hands on the twins. The queen knows Jermarel had the ability to see and wants his children. Jermarel was also the queen's favored consort who ran away with Maghra. In order to protect his children, Voss is forced to rely on his instincts and must rally fellow tribes to take down the queen and her tyrannical cult before they can capture the children.\n\nThe series is set in the village of Alkenny, protected by a Kanzua Dam. \"Alkenny\" and \"Kanzua\" are alterations of [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Kinzua Dam|Kinzua]], real-life locations in present-day western Pennsylvania.\n\n==Cast and characters==<!--As per IMDB credited cast and as per WP: MOS: TV cast and characters-->\n===Main===\n* [[Jason Momoa]] as Baba Voss, leader of the Alkenny tribe - father of Kofun and Haniwa.\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Paris, a wise elder member of the Alkenny who also serves as a the [[Shamanism|shaman]] of the tribe, and the foster mother to Baba Voss.\n* [[Sylvia Hoeks]] as Queen Kane, ruler of the Payan Kingdom.\n* [[Hera Hilmar]] as Maghra, a newcomer to the Alkenny - mother to Kofun and Haniwa, and wife of Baba Voss.\n* [[Christian Camargo]] as Tamacti Jun, the Witchfinder General and leader of Queen Kane's army.\n* Archie Madekwe as Kofun, son of Baba Voss and Maghra, and the biological son of Jerlamarel, who has the ability to see.\n* [[Nesta Cooper]] as Haniwa, daughter of Baba Voss and Maghra, and the biological daughter of Jerlamarel, who also has the ability to see.\n* [[Yadira Guevara-Prip]] as Bow Lion, an Alkenny warrior with the skill of moving undetected.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Mojean Aria]] as Gether Bax, an untrustworthy member of the Alkenny\n* Luc Roderique as Arca, an Alkenny warrior loyal to Baba Voss.\n* [[Tantoo Cardinal]] as The Dreamer, an Alkenny tribe elder and mother of Bow Lion.\n* Marilee Talkington as Souter Bax, an Alkenny tribe member and aunt of Gether Bax.\n* [[Lauren Glazier]] as Nyrie, Queen Kane's loyal [[lady-in-waiting]].\n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Boots, a mysterious member of a scavenger tribe.

Meanwhile, Queen Kane - the ruler of the city of Kanzua and the Witchfinder army, has ordered her Witchfinder General, Tamacti Jun to hunt down any so called 'witches' - those who promote the concept of vision or who spread the knowledge of 'Jerlamarel', a man with the ability to see. At the Alkenny settlement, tribe leader Baba Voss - the adopted father of the babies and Maghra' partner - prepares the village for battle. Tribe member Gether Bax betrays the Alkenny by disclosing the location of the settlement to Tamacti Jun, and also mentions the birth of the babies and the rumors that their father is the mythical Jerlamarel. Baba Voss and the Alkenny engage in a bloody battle to defend the settlement and the Witchfinder army retreats. With their location compromised and the Witchfinder army now in pursuit, Baba Voss and Paris follow Jerlamarel's clues and lead the Alkenny to a newly-discovered bridge which provides the tribe passage out of the valley.

Baba Voss retrieves the box which contains dozens of books. Meanwhile, Gether Bax continues to stoke discontent towards Voss' leadership of the Alkenny. Together with his aunt Souter Bax, they secretly enlist another tribe member - Bow Lion, acting as a ''Shadow'' (a person skilled in obtaining information covertly), to spy\u00a0on Paris. Maghra, Baba Voss and Paris discover that the babies - now named Kofun and Haniwa - can see, and agree not to speak of the discovery again for twelve summers.

Queen Kane receives Gether Bax' message reporting the location of the Alkenny and has a change of heart towards Tamacti Jun, instead ordering him once again to hunt down the children. At the Alkenny's settlement, Gether and Souter Bax' incestuous relationship results in a stillborn and disfigured child. In response, Baba Voss, Maghra and Paris along with several younger Alkenny seek out a nearby 'festival' to encourage tribe members to seek partners from outside their tribe.

The lone occupant is revealed to be a young man by the name of Boots - another of Jerlamarel's children who also has the ability to see. Boots pledges his loyalty to Baba Voss on the condition he can join the group in their journey. Meanwhile, Queen Kane, Nyrie and her driver are attacked by two ''Shadow Warriors''. Nyrie and the driver are killed while Queen Kane is captured and taken to a nearby silk manufacturing settlement known as the City of Worms where she is presented to its leader, a man named Cutter.

Meanwhile at the City of Worms, a slave by the name of Cora befriends the captive Queen Kane who later reveals her royal status in confidence. Cora is revealed to be acting on Cutter's orders to gain information. Queen Kane is brought to him before Cutter removes a royal amulet embedded within her chest. Back at the river, Boots falsely claims he witnessed Maghra's death and betrays the group by leading them to a cave where they are held in captivity. A woman claiming to be Boots' mother approaches the group and offers to help them escape on the condition that one of them kill Boots due to his past actions. Baba Voss fights off several of their captors allowing Kofun, Haniwa, Paris and Bow Lion to reach the surface, before Baba Voss himself barely escapes alive. Nearby, Boots allows himself to be taken captive by the Witchfinder army and is taken to Maghra. Shortly after, messengers deliver a ransom note from Cutter to Tamacti Jun informing them of Queen Kane's imprisonment, along with the royal amulet as proof of her identity.

Locating the City of Worms, Tamacti Jun sends Boots to scout the area, then uses the information to infiltrate the site himself. After killing the guards he finds the injured Queen, who has been helped by Cora during the commotion to overpower Cutter and strangle him with her chains. Maghra comes to aid her sister, who deduces her identity. Queen Kane reveals that she destroyed the dam at Kanzua as she fled in order to kill her opposers. Tamacti Jun reacts with anger at her selfish actions and considers whether Maghra would be a more suitable replacement as monarch. Meanwhile the others continue on foot, finally locating The Lavender Road\u2014a path lined with lavender described as a route to Jerlamarel's location. The group meet resistance whilst attempting to cross a mountain pass and Bow Lion is injured.

Nearby, Baba Voss and Paris leave a seriously injured Bow Lion in the care of another tribe. Meanwhile, at the City of Worms, Tamacti Jun agrees with Maghra that Queen Kane should abdicate or face dire consequences. Boots is approached by Cora and attempts to influence him. Maghra informs Queen Kane of the choices open to her, but that ultimately it will not be her decision. Back at the House of Enlightenment, Kofun wakes and overhears Jerlamarel secretly discussing the handover of the twins to a Colonel from the Trivantian tribe who acts on behalf of a mysterious General seeking the children of Baba Voss. Jerlamarel agrees to only hand over Haniwa, which the Colonel accepts. Kofun is discovered and imprisoned before confronting Jerlamarel who fails to convince Kofun of his actions. Kofun attacks Jerlamarel who then orders guards to execute him. Outside, Kofun is saved by Baba Voss and the two re-enter the settlement. Kofun shuts down the generator, while Baba Voss discovers Jerlamarel handed Haniwa over to General Edo Voss - Baba Voss' brother. Baba defeats and blinds Jerlamarel in combat before he and Kofun escape and reunite with Paris. At the City of Worms, Tamacti Jun and Maghra press Queen Kane for her answer, before Boots appears and seriously wounds Tamacti Jun, apparently working in conjunction with Cora. Maghra and Queen Kane emerge - they address the Witchfinder army as joint rulers and announce Tamacti Jun committed suicide out of shame, before Maghra orders the army head to the Lavender Road to look for her family.

Baba Voss, the chieftain of the Alkenny tribe, takes in and marries a woman, Maghra, who comes to the Alkenny seeking shelter.

The queen knows Jermarel had the ability to see and wants his children. Jermarel was also the queen's favored consort who ran away with Maghra. In order to protect his children, Voss is forced to rely on his instincts and must rally fellow tribes to take down the queen and her tyrannical cult before they can capture the children.\n\nThe series is set in the village of Alkenny, protected by a Kanzua Dam. \"Alkenny\" and \"Kanzua\" are alterations of [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Kinzua Dam|Kinzua]], real-life locations in present-day western Pennsylvania.\n\n==Cast and characters==<!--As per IMDB credited cast and as per WP: MOS: TV cast and characters-->\n===Main===\n* [[Jason Momoa]] as Baba Voss, leader of the Alkenny tribe - father of Kofun and Haniwa.\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Paris, a wise elder member of the Alkenny who also serves as a the [[Shamanism|shaman]] of the tribe, and the foster mother to Baba Voss.\n* [[Sylvia Hoeks]] as Queen Kane, ruler of the Payan Kingdom.\n* [[Hera Hilmar]] as Maghra, a newcomer to the Alkenny - mother to Kofun and Haniwa, and wife of Baba Voss.\n* [[Christian Camargo]] as Tamacti Jun, the Witchfinder General and leader of Queen Kane's army.\n* Archie Madekwe as Kofun, son of Baba Voss and Maghra, and the biological son of Jerlamarel, who has the ability to see.\n* [[Nesta Cooper]] as Haniwa, daughter of Baba Voss and Maghra, and the biological daughter of Jerlamarel, who also has the ability to see.\n* [[Yadira Guevara-Prip]] as Bow Lion, an Alkenny warrior with the skill of moving undetected.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Mojean Aria]] as Gether Bax, an untrustworthy member of the Alkenny\n* Luc Roderique as Arca, an Alkenny warrior loyal to Baba Voss.\n* [[Tantoo Cardinal]] as The Dreamer, an Alkenny tribe elder and mother of Bow Lion.\n* Marilee Talkington as Souter Bax, an Alkenny tribe member and aunt of Gether Bax.\n* [[Lauren Glazier]] as Nyrie, Queen Kane's loyal [[lady-in-waiting]].\n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Boots, a mysterious member of a scavenger tribe.

Meanwhile, Queen Kane - the ruler of the city of Kanzua and the Witchfinder army, has ordered her Witchfinder General, Tamacti Jun to hunt down any so called 'witches' - those who promote the concept of vision or who spread the knowledge of 'Jerlamarel', a man with the ability to see. At the Alkenny settlement, tribe leader Baba Voss - the adopted father of the babies and Maghra' partner - prepares the village for battle. Tribe member Gether Bax betrays the Alkenny by disclosing the location of the settlement to Tamacti Jun, and also mentions the birth of the babies and the rumors that their father is the mythical Jerlamarel. Baba Voss and the Alkenny engage in a bloody battle to defend the settlement and the Witchfinder army retreats. With their location compromised and the Witchfinder army now in pursuit, Baba Voss and Paris follow Jerlamarel's clues and lead the Alkenny to a newly-discovered bridge which provides the tribe passage out of the valley.

Baba Voss retrieves the box which contains dozens of books. Meanwhile, Gether Bax continues to stoke discontent towards Voss' leadership of the Alkenny. Together with his aunt Souter Bax, they secretly enlist another tribe member - Bow Lion, acting as a ''Shadow'' (a person skilled in obtaining information covertly), to spy\u00a0on Paris. Maghra, Baba Voss and Paris discover that the babies - now named Kofun and Haniwa - can see, and agree not to speak of the discovery again for twelve summers. Aware of this information, Gether Bax sends a message in a bottle down river.

Queen Kane receives Gether Bax' message reporting the location of the Alkenny and has a change of heart towards Tamacti Jun, instead ordering him once again to hunt down the children. At the Alkenny's settlement, Gether and Souter Bax' incestuous relationship results in a stillborn and disfigured child. In response, Baba Voss, Maghra and Paris along with several younger Alkenny seek out a nearby 'festival' to encourage tribe members to seek partners from outside their tribe. Unknown to them, Kofun and Haniwa curiously follow behind. The group reach the festival but discover the Witchfinder's rumors of witches have spread and witness innocent people being burned alive. Kofun is captured by slave traders. Haniwa informs her parents and the group track the slave traders to a former mining quarry.

The following morning the group discover their weapons missing as well as a small bag containing an item of value belonging to Maghra.

The lone occupant is revealed to be a young man by the name of Boots - another of Jerlamarel's children who also has the ability to see. Boots pledges his loyalty to Baba Voss on the condition he can join the group in their journey. Meanwhile, Queen Kane, Nyrie and her driver are attacked by two ''Shadow Warriors''. Nyrie and the driver are killed while Queen Kane is captured and taken to a nearby silk manufacturing settlement known as the City of Worms where she is presented to its leader, a man named Cutter. Unaware of her true identity, Cutter forces Queen Kane into slavery. At the river, Haniwa returns the small bag to Maghra. The group are located by the Witchfinder army once again and forced to retreat into the forest. Maghra and Paris take shelter while Baba Voss and the rest of the group fight off their pursuers. Maghra comes out of hiding and confronts the Witchfinder General, Tamacti Jun. The item inside Maghra's bag is revealed to be a ring worn only by royalty.

Meanwhile at the City of Worms, a slave by the name of Cora befriends the captive Queen Kane who later reveals her royal status in confidence. Cora is revealed to be acting on Cutter's orders to gain information. Queen Kane is brought to him before Cutter removes a royal amulet embedded within her chest. Back at the river, Boots falsely claims he witnessed Maghra's death and betrays the group by leading them to a cave where they are held in captivity. A woman claiming to be Boots' mother approaches the group and offers to help them escape on the condition that one of them kill Boots due to his past actions. Baba Voss fights off several of their captors allowing Kofun, Haniwa, Paris and Bow Lion to reach the surface, before Baba Voss himself barely escapes alive. Nearby, Boots allows himself to be taken captive by the Witchfinder army and is taken to Maghra. Shortly after, messengers deliver a ransom note from Cutter to Tamacti Jun informing them of Queen Kane's imprisonment, along with the royal amulet as proof of her identity. Boots requests that Maghra let him serve as her lieutenant and offers to track down her sister.\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = The Lavender Road\n |DirectedBy      = [[Frederick E.O.

Leaving behind a small faction of soldiers to search for Maghra's family, Tamacti Jun takes Maghra, Boots, and the rest of his army to rescue Queen Kane. Locating the City of Worms, Tamacti Jun sends Boots to scout the area, then uses the information to infiltrate the site himself. After killing the guards he finds the injured Queen, who has been helped by Cora during the commotion to overpower Cutter and strangle him with her chains. Maghra comes to aid her sister, who deduces her identity. Queen Kane reveals that she destroyed the dam at Kanzua as she fled in order to kill her opposers. Tamacti Jun reacts with anger at her selfish actions and considers whether Maghra would be a more suitable replacement as monarch. Meanwhile the others continue on foot, finally locating The Lavender Road\u2014a path lined with lavender described as a route to Jerlamarel's location. The group meet resistance whilst attempting to cross a mountain pass and Bow Lion is injured. Kofun and Haniwa reveal themselves as the children of Jerlamarel, however only they are permitted by the guards to pass through to a bridge to the House of Enlightenment. Baba Voss insists that Kofun and Haniwa proceed, to continue to their destiny. Retreating out of earshot with Bow Lion and Paris, Baba Voss reveals that they are not leaving and will to continue to stay close. Kofun and Haniwa continue across the bridge, where they are met for the first time in their lives by bright electrically powered spot lights.\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = House of Enlightenment\n |DirectedBy      = [[Salli Richardson-Whitfield]]\n |WrittenBy       = Steven Knight and [[Jonathan Tropper]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|6}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jerlamarel appears and welcomes the twins to the House of Enlightenment - a former prison converted into a settlement with electricity, hot water and an extensive library. He introduces them to half a dozen other sighted individuals - also his offspring. The pair realize Jerlamarel views himself as a savior of mankind and that he has been chosen by God to bring back vision to the world.  Nearby, Baba Voss and Paris leave a seriously injured Bow Lion in the care of another tribe. Meanwhile, at the City of Worms, Tamacti Jun agrees with Maghra that Queen Kane should abdicate or face dire consequences. Boots is approached by Cora and attempts to influence him. Maghra informs Queen Kane of the choices open to her, but that ultimately it will not be her decision. Back at the House of Enlightenment, Kofun wakes and overhears Jerlamarel secretly discussing the handover of the twins to a Colonel from the Trivantian tribe who acts on behalf of a mysterious General seeking the children of Baba Voss. Jerlamarel agrees to only hand over Haniwa, which the Colonel accepts. Kofun is discovered and imprisoned before confronting Jerlamarel who fails to convince Kofun of his actions. Kofun attacks Jerlamarel who then orders guards to execute him. Outside, Kofun is saved by Baba Voss and the two re-enter the settlement. Kofun shuts down the generator, while Baba Voss discovers Jerlamarel handed Haniwa over to General Edo Voss - Baba Voss' brother. Baba defeats and blinds Jerlamarel in combat before he and Kofun escape and reunite with Paris. At the City of Worms, Tamacti Jun and Maghra press Queen Kane for her answer, before Boots appears and seriously wounds Tamacti Jun, apparently working in conjunction with Cora. Maghra and Queen Kane emerge - they address the Witchfinder army as joint rulers and announce Tamacti Jun committed suicide out of shame, before Maghra orders the army head to the Lavender Road to look for her family. Baba Voss, Kofun and Paris come across a large abandoned city and vow to save Haniwa.\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn January 10, 2018, it was announced that Apple had given the production a series order for a single eight-episode season.
