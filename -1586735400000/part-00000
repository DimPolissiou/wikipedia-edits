Accelerators used for proton therapy typically produce protons with energies in the range of 70 to 250 [[MeV]]. Adjusting proton energy during the treatment maximizes the cell damage the proton beam causes within the tumor. Tissue closer to the surface of the body than the tumor receives reduced radiation, and therefore reduced damage. Tissues deeper in the body receive very few protons, so the dosage becomes immeasurably small.<ref name=\"OncoLink - Cancer Treatment Information\">{{cite news|first=James|last=Metz|title=Differences Between Protons and X-rays|date=2006-07-31|publisher=Abramson Cancer Center of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]|url=http://www.oncolink.org/treatment/article.cfm?c=9&s=70&id=210|accessdate=2008-02-04|quote=the beam then stops, resulting in virtually no radiation to the tissue beyond the target\u2014or no 'exit dose'|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217124457/http://www.oncolink.org/treatment/article.cfm?c=9&s=70&id=210|archivedate=2008-12-17}}</ref>\n\nIn most treatments, protons of different energies with Bragg peaks at different depths are applied to treat the entire tumor.

In these cases, the tumor dose is the same as in conventional therapy, so there is no expectation of an increased probability of curing the disease.

Radiation-induced secondary malignancy is another very serious adverse effect that has been reported. As there is no exit dose when using proton radiation therapy, the dose to surrounding normal tissues can be significantly limited, reducing the acute toxicity which positively impacts the risk for these long-term side effects. Cancers requiring craniospinal irradiation, for example, benefit from the absence of exit dose with proton therapy: dose to the heart, mediastinum, bowel, bladder and other tissues anterior to the vertebrae is eliminated, resulting in a reduction of acute thoracic, gastrointestinal and bladder side effects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2015|title=TREATING PEDIATRIC TUMORS WITH PROTON THERAPY |url=https://iba-worldwide.com/download/iba-white-paper-treating-pediatric-tumors-with-proton-therapy|journal=IBA White Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Prostate cancer===\nIn [[prostate cancer]] cases, the issue is less clear.

This is particularly useful for treating head and neck tumors because of the anatomic constraints encountered in nearly all cancers in this region. The dosimetric advantage unique to proton therapy translates into toxicity reduction. For recurrent head and neck cancer requiring reirradiation, proton therapy is able to maximize a focused dose of radiation to the tumor while minimizing dose to surrounding tissues which results in a minimal acute toxicity profile, even in patients who have received multiple prior courses of radiotherapy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016-10-04|title=TREATING HEAD AND NECK CARCINOMA WITH PROTON THERAPY|url=https://iba-worldwide.com/download/iba-white-paper-treating-head-and-neck-cancer-proton-therapy|journal=IBA White Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Lymphoma (Tumors of lymphatic tissue)===\n\nAlthough chemotherapy is the primary treatment for patients with lymphoma, consolidative radiation is often used in Hodgkin lymphoma and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while definitive treatment with radiation alone is used in a small fraction of lymphoma patients. Unfortunately, treatment-related toxicities caused by chemotherapy agents and radiation exposure to healthy tissues are major concerns for lymphoma survivors. Advanced radiation therapy technologies such as proton therapy may offer significant and clinically relevant advantages such as sparing important organs at risk and decreasing the risk for late normal tissue damage while still achieving the primary goal of disease control.

A tumor with a sizable thickness is covered by the IMRT spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) shown as the red lined distribution in the figure. The SOBP is an overlap of several pristine Bragg peaks (blue lines) at staggered depths.\n\nMegavoltage X-ray therapy has less \"skin scarring potential\" than proton therapy: X-ray radiation at the skin, and at very small depths, is lower than for proton therapy. One study estimates that passively scattered proton fields have a slightly higher entrance dose at the skin (~75%) compared to therapeutic megavoltage (MeV) photon beams (~60%).<ref name=\"SOBP\"/> X-ray radiation dose falls off gradually, unnecessarily damaging tissue deeper in the body and damaging the skin and surface tissue opposite the beam entrance. The differences between the two methods depends on the:\n* Width of the SOBP\n* Depth of the tumor\n* Number of beams that treat the tumor\nThe X-ray advantage of reduced damage to skin at the entrance is partially counteracted by damage to skin at the exit point.\n\nSince X-ray treatments are usually done with multiple exposures from opposite sides, each section of skin is exposed to both entering and exiting X-rays. In proton therapy, skin exposure at the entrance point is higher, but tissues on the opposite side of the body to the tumor receive no radiation. Thus, X-ray therapy causes slightly less damage to the skin and surface tissues, and proton therapy causes less damage to deeper tissues in front of and beyond the target.<ref name=zap/>\n\nAn important consideration in comparing these treatments is whether the equipment delivers protons via the scattering method (historically, the most common) or a spot scanning method. Spot scanning can adjust the width of the SOBP on a spot-by-spot basis, which reduces the volume of normal (healthy) tissue inside the high dose region. Also, spot scanning allows for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), which determines individual spot intensities using an optimization algorithm that lets the user balance the competing goals of irradiating tumors while sparing normal tissue. Spot scanning availability depends on the machine and the institution. Spot scanning is more commonly known as [[pencil-beam scanning]] and is available on [[Ion Beam Applications|IBA]], Hitachi, Mevion (known as hyperscan<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.mevion.com/hyperscan | title=Introducing Hyperscan | website= mevion.com| publisher=Mevion Medical Systems |date=2015-04-19}}</ref> and not US FDA approved as of 2015) and Varian.\n\n===Surgery===\nPhysicians base the decision to use surgery or proton therapy (or any radiation therapy) on the tumor type, stage, and location. In some instances, surgery is superior (such as cutaneous [[melanoma]]), in some instances radiation is superior (such as skull base [[chondrosarcoma]]), and in some instances they are comparable (for example, [[prostate cancer]]). In some instances, they are used together (e.g., rectal cancer or early stage breast cancer). The benefit of external beam proton radiation lies in the [[Dosimetry|dosimetric]] difference from external beam X-ray radiation and [[brachytherapy]] in cases where the use of radiation therapy is already indicated, rather than as a direct competition with surgery.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> However, in the case of prostate cancer, the most common indication for proton beam therapy, no clinical study directly comparing proton therapy to surgery, brachytherapy, or other treatments has shown any clinical benefit for proton beam therapy. Indeed, the largest study to date showed that IMRT compared with proton therapy was associated with less gastrointestinal [[morbidity]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Sheets| first1= NC| last2= Goldin| first2= GH| last3= Meyer| first3= AM| last4= Wu| first4= Y| last5= Chang| first5= Y| last6= St\u00fcrmer| first6= T| last7= Holmes| first7= JA| last8= Reeve| first8= BB| last9= Godley| first9= PA| last10= Carpenter| first10= WR| last11= Chen| first11= RC|display-authors= 4 |title=Intensity-modulated radiation therapy, proton therapy, or conformal radiation therapy and morbidity and disease control in localized prostate cancer.|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|date= April 18, 2012| volume= 307| issue= 15| pages= 1611\u201320| pmid= 22511689| doi= 10.1001/jama.2012.460| pmc= 3702170}}</ref>\n\n==Side effects and risks==\n{{Main|Radiation therapy#Side effects|Adverse effect}}\n\nProton therapy is a type of external beam radiotherapy, and shares risks and [[side effects]] of other forms of radiation therapy.

Accelerators used for proton therapy typically produce protons with energies in the range of 70 to 250 [[MeV]]. Adjusting proton energy during the treatment maximizes the cell damage the proton beam causes within the tumor. Tissue closer to the surface of the body than the tumor receives reduced radiation, and therefore reduced damage.

As there is no exit dose when using proton radiation therapy, the dose to surrounding normal tissues can be significantly limited, reducing the acute toxicity which positively impacts the risk for these long-term side effects.

The dosimetric advantage unique to proton therapy translates into toxicity reduction. For recurrent head and neck cancer requiring reirradiation, proton therapy is able to maximize a focused dose of radiation to the tumor while minimizing dose to surrounding tissues which results in a minimal acute toxicity profile, even in patients who have received multiple prior courses of radiotherapy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016-10-04|title=TREATING HEAD AND NECK CARCINOMA WITH PROTON THERAPY|url=https://iba-worldwide.com/download/iba-white-paper-treating-head-and-neck-cancer-proton-therapy|journal=IBA White Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Lymphoma (Tumors of lymphatic tissue)===\n\nAlthough chemotherapy is the primary treatment for patients with lymphoma, consolidative radiation is often used in Hodgkin lymphoma and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while definitive treatment with radiation alone is used in a small fraction of lymphoma patients. Unfortunately, treatment-related toxicities caused by chemotherapy agents and radiation exposure to healthy tissues are major concerns for lymphoma survivors. Advanced radiation therapy technologies such as proton therapy may offer significant and clinically relevant advantages such as sparing important organs at risk and decreasing the risk for late normal tissue damage while still achieving the primary goal of disease control. This is especially important for lymphoma patients who are being treated with curative intent and have long life expectancies following therapy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=September 2016|title=TREATING HODGKIN AND NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA WITH PROTON THERAPY|url=https://iba-worldwide.com/download/iba-white-paper-treating-hodgkin-and-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-proton-therapy|journal=IBA White Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Gastrointestinal malignancy===\n\nAn increasing amount of data has shown that proton therapy has great potential to increase therapeutic tolerance for patients with GI malignancies.

A tumor with a sizable thickness is covered by the IMRT spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) shown as the red lined distribution in the figure. The SOBP is an overlap of several pristine Bragg peaks (blue lines) at staggered depths.\n\nMegavoltage X-ray therapy has less \"skin scarring potential\" than proton therapy: X-ray radiation at the skin, and at very small depths, is lower than for proton therapy. One study estimates that passively scattered proton fields have a slightly higher entrance dose at the skin (~75%) compared to therapeutic megavoltage (MeV) photon beams (~60%).<ref name=\"SOBP\"/> X-ray radiation dose falls off gradually, unnecessarily damaging tissue deeper in the body and damaging the skin and surface tissue opposite the beam entrance. The differences between the two methods depends on the:\n* Width of the SOBP\n* Depth of the tumor\n* Number of beams that treat the tumor\nThe X-ray advantage of reduced damage to skin at the entrance is partially counteracted by damage to skin at the exit point.\n\nSince X-ray treatments are usually done with multiple exposures from opposite sides, each section of skin is exposed to both entering and exiting X-rays. In proton therapy, skin exposure at the entrance point is higher, but tissues on the opposite side of the body to the tumor receive no radiation. Thus, X-ray therapy causes slightly less damage to the skin and surface tissues, and proton therapy causes less damage to deeper tissues in front of and beyond the target.<ref name=zap/>\n\nAn important consideration in comparing these treatments is whether the equipment delivers protons via the scattering method (historically, the most common) or a spot scanning method. Spot scanning can adjust the width of the SOBP on a spot-by-spot basis, which reduces the volume of normal (healthy) tissue inside the high dose region. Also, spot scanning allows for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), which determines individual spot intensities using an optimization algorithm that lets the user balance the competing goals of irradiating tumors while sparing normal tissue. Spot scanning availability depends on the machine and the institution. Spot scanning is more commonly known as [[pencil-beam scanning]] and is available on [[Ion Beam Applications|IBA]], Hitachi, Mevion (known as hyperscan<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.mevion.com/hyperscan | title=Introducing Hyperscan | website= mevion.com| publisher=Mevion Medical Systems |date=2015-04-19}}</ref> and not US FDA approved as of 2015) and Varian.\n\n===Surgery===\nPhysicians base the decision to use surgery or proton therapy (or any radiation therapy) on the tumor type, stage, and location. In some instances, surgery is superior (such as cutaneous [[melanoma]]), in some instances radiation is superior (such as skull base [[chondrosarcoma]]), and in some instances they are comparable (for example, [[prostate cancer]]). In some instances, they are used together (e.g., rectal cancer or early stage breast cancer). The benefit of external beam proton radiation lies in the [[Dosimetry|dosimetric]] difference from external beam X-ray radiation and [[brachytherapy]] in cases where the use of radiation therapy is already indicated, rather than as a direct competition with surgery.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> However, in the case of prostate cancer, the most common indication for proton beam therapy, no clinical study directly comparing proton therapy to surgery, brachytherapy, or other treatments has shown any clinical benefit for proton beam therapy. Indeed, the largest study to date showed that IMRT compared with proton therapy was associated with less gastrointestinal [[morbidity]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Sheets| first1= NC| last2= Goldin| first2= GH| last3= Meyer| first3= AM| last4= Wu| first4= Y| last5= Chang| first5= Y| last6= St\u00fcrmer| first6= T| last7= Holmes| first7= JA| last8= Reeve| first8= BB| last9= Godley| first9= PA| last10= Carpenter| first10= WR| last11= Chen| first11= RC|display-authors= 4 |title=Intensity-modulated radiation therapy, proton therapy, or conformal radiation therapy and morbidity and disease control in localized prostate cancer.|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|date= April 18, 2012| volume= 307| issue= 15| pages= 1611\u201320| pmid= 22511689| doi= 10.1001/jama.2012.460| pmc= 3702170}}</ref>\n\n==Side effects and risks==\n{{Main|Radiation therapy#Side effects|Adverse effect}}\n\nProton therapy is a type of external beam radiotherapy, and shares risks and [[side effects]] of other forms of radiation therapy.
