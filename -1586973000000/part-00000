While some authors like Powell believe that the Black Legend continues to influence modern-day policies and international relationships, other authors, like [[Henry Kamen]], believe it has been left behind. Some have attributed many of the problems between the Episcopal Church and the Latin Community to the Black Legend.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Guzm\u00e1n|first=Roland|title=Dismantling the Discourses of the \u201cBlack Legend\u201d as They Still Function in The Episcopal Church: A Case against Latinx Ministries as a Program of the Church.|publisher=Anglican Theological Review|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=603-624}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|History}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Anti-Catholicism]]\n*[[Atrocity propaganda]]\n*[[Black armband view of history]], a similar concept in Australia\n*[[Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition]]\n*[[Blood libel]]\n*[[Colonial mentality]]\n*[[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n*[[Historical revisionism]]\n*[[History wars]]\n*[[Information warfare]]\n{{div col end|2}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|3}}\n{{reflist|group=nota}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Ardolino, Frank.

On February 1, 2006, Macy's East assumed operating control over the [[Filene's]], [[Strawbridge's]], many of the [[Kaufmann's]] stores in upstate New York and the [[Hecht's]] stores in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], D.C. and northern Virginia. These locations assumed the Macy's moniker officially on September 9, 2006.

Federated also merged its [[Abraham & Straus]]/[[Jordan Marsh]] division with the new \"Macy's East\" organization based in New York, renaming the [[Abraham & Straus]] stores in metropolitan New York with the Macy's nameplate in 1995, and then erasing the [[Jordan Marsh]] moniker in [[New England]] in early 1996.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/07/15/macys-plans-merger-with-federated/6059c11a-2dcb-4f4e-b819-3ab374150057/|title=MACY'S PLANS MERGER WITH FEDERATED|last=Grimsley|first=Kirstin Downey|date=July 15, 1994|work=Washington Post|access-date=June 21, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\nFederated followed that by leading a bid in mid-1995 to acquire the bankrupt [[Woodward & Lothrop]]/[[Wanamaker's|John Wanamaker]] organization in the mid-Atlantic region, a bid it lost to rival group led by long-time rival and future acquisition target [[The May Department Stores Company]]. Instead Federated soon agreed to purchase [[Broadway Stores]], Inc. (owner of [[The Broadway]], [[The Emporium, San Francisco|Emporium]] and [[Weinstock's]] stores in California, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico), from its majority shareholder, [[Sam Zell]], thereby gaining a leading position in Southern California and a dominant one in the Northern California marketplace. In early 1996 Federated dissolved Broadway Stores, incorporating the majority of its locations into [[Macy's West]], rebadging them as Macy's and using the opportunity to retire the Bullock's name. Several of the redundant Broadway locations were used to establish [[Bloomingdale's]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], while many other were sold to [[Sears]].\n\nIn 2001 Federated dissolved its [[Stern's]] division in the New York metropolitan area, with the bulk of the stores being absorbed into [[Macy's East]]. Additionally, in July 2001 it acquired the [[Liberty House (US)|Liberty House]] chain with department and specialty stores in Hawaii and Guam, consolidating it with Macy's West.\n\nIn early 2003 Federated closed the majority of its historic [[Davison's]] franchise in Atlanta (operating as Macy's since 1985), rebranding its other Atlanta division [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]] with the unwieldy name, Rich's\u2013Macy's. The downtown location\u2014formerly the Davison's flagship store at [[Davison's|180 Peachtree Street]] \u2013 was shuttered at this time as well. The original Macy's [[Lenox Square]] and [[Perimeter Mall]] locations were extensively remodeled and opened in October 2003 as the first [[Bloomingdale's]] stores in Atlanta. The company rapidly followed suit in May 2003 with similar rebranding announcements for its other nameplates, [[Burdines]] in Florida, [[Goldsmith's]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Lazarus (department store)|Lazarus]] in the lower Midwest, and [[The Bon March\u00e9]] in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nOn March 6, 2005, the [[The Bon March\u00e9|Bon-Macy's]], [[Burdines|Burdines-Macy's]], [[Goldsmith's|Goldsmith's-Macy's]], [[Lazarus (department store)|Lazarus-Macy's]], and [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's-Macy's]] stores were renamed as simply \"Macy's\", the first two as the new [[Macy's West]] and [[Macy's Florida]] divisions respectively and the later three as part of the [[Macy's Central]] division.

This included May's [[Marshall Field's]] (which had just been purchased by the May Company from [[Target Corporation|Target]] in 2004), [[Kaufmann's]], [[Famous-Barr]], [[Filene's]], [[Foley's]], [[Hecht's]], [[The Jones Store]], [[L. S. Ayres]], [[Meier & Frank]], [[Robinsons-May]], and [[Strawbridge & Clothier]] chains, pending approval of the merger by federal regulators.\n\nThe rebranding of the May stores was disliked in Chicago and elsewhere because the stores were regarded as beloved local institutions. The renaming of Filene's, Marshall Field's, and Kaufmann's, which were well known for their downtown flagship stores and local traditions provoked the most outrage. For example, Kaufmann's operated the Kaufmann's [[Celebrate the Season Parade]] which was traditionally broadcast live throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on television. Many customers publicly vowed to never again shop at the renamed May stores and to switch to competitors. Prominent film critic [[Roger Ebert]] voiced the grief of many Chicagoans at the loss of Field's when he wrote in his column on September 21, 2005:\n\n{{quote|I thought the day would never come.

On June 22, 2006, Macy's announced that NDRC Equity Partners, LLC would purchase Lord & Taylor for US$1.2&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|1200000000|2006|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}),<ref name=\"macysprjun2006\">{{cite press release | url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=84477&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=875337 | title=Federated Agrees to Sell Lord & Taylor to NRDC Equity Partners; Transaction Expected to Close in Third Quarter of 2006 | publisher=Macy's | date=June 22, 2006 | via=NASDAQ Investor Relations Platform }}</ref> and completed the sale in October 2006.\n\nBy September 9, 2006, after renaming the former May Company stores, Macy's operated approximately 850 stores in the United States. To promote its largest and most recent expansion, Macy's used a version of the [[Martha and the Vandellas]] hit song, \"Dancing in the Street\", in its advertising. Also, the company took [[Theatrical property|props]] from its annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade|Thanksgiving Day parade]] to various re-labeled stores throughout the nation, in what the company marketed as its \"Parade on Parade\".\n\nIn October 2006, Federated Department Stores entered into an agreement with [[Zoom Systems]] to test more than 100 stores within retail giant Macy's. Terry Lundgren, CEO of Federated, raved about the ability to provide consumers with a convenient means to purchase iPods and other consumer electronics, saying \"This is exciting because it brings most-wanted merchandise into stores in a unique new way.... How cool is that?\" Today, Macy's has converted its entire Electronics section in every store to (over 400) eSpot [[ZoomShops]].\n\n==Current operations under Macy's, Inc.==\n===2007&ndash;2014===\n[[File:Macy's Fairview.jpg|right|thumb|Macy's Lifestyle Store in [[Fairview, Texas]] opened on August 5, 2009]]\nMacy's significantly increased its use of television advertising and product placement in 2006 and 2007, using branding spots that featured the new Macy's star logo.

During two episodes of the popular [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Desperate Housewives]] ''(\"[[I Remember That]]\" and \"[[Now You Know (Desperate Housewives)|Now You Know]]\"), a Macy's location in the fictional city of Fairview was featured, rare instances of [[product placement]] promoting a department store chain in a scripted series.

Macy & Co., Inc., led a leveraged buy-out of the company and subsequently engaged in a takeover battle for [[Federated Department Stores, Inc.]], in 1988 that he lost to Canada's [[Campeau Corporation]]. As part of its settlement with Campeau, Macy's purchased Federated's California-based, fashion-oriented [[Bullock's]] and its high-end [[Bullocks Wilshire]] and [[I. Magnin]] divisions. It followed with a reorganization of its divisions into Macy's Northeast (former Macy's New York and Macy's New Jersey), Macy's South/Bullock's (Macy's Atlanta stores plus Macy's New York's operations in Texas, Florida and Louisiana), and Macy's California, the latter including a semi-autonomous I. Magnin/Bullocks Wilshire organization. The Bullocks Wilshire stores were renamed I. Magnin in 1989. Subsequently, R. H. Macy & Co., Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 27, 1992, after which point its banks brought in a new management team, which shut several underperforming stores, jettisoned two-thirds of the luxury I.

On February 1, 2006, Macy's East assumed operating control over the [[Filene's]], [[Strawbridge's]], many of the [[Kaufmann's]] stores in upstate New York and the [[Hecht's]] stores in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], D.C. and northern Virginia.

Instead Federated soon agreed to purchase [[Broadway Stores]], Inc. (owner of [[The Broadway]], [[The Emporium, San Francisco|Emporium]] and [[Weinstock's]] stores in California, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico), from its majority shareholder, [[Sam Zell]], thereby gaining a leading position in Southern California and a dominant one in the Northern California marketplace. In early 1996 Federated dissolved Broadway Stores, incorporating the majority of its locations into [[Macy's West]], rebadging them as Macy's and using the opportunity to retire the Bullock's name. Several of the redundant Broadway locations were used to establish [[Bloomingdale's]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], while many other were sold to [[Sears]].\n\nIn 2001 Federated dissolved its [[Stern's]] division in the New York metropolitan area, with the bulk of the stores being absorbed into [[Macy's East]]. Additionally, in July 2001 it acquired the [[Liberty House (US)|Liberty House]] chain with department and specialty stores in Hawaii and Guam, consolidating it with Macy's West.\n\nIn early 2003 Federated closed the majority of its historic [[Davison's]] franchise in Atlanta (operating as Macy's since 1985), rebranding its other Atlanta division [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]] with the unwieldy name, Rich's\u2013Macy's. The downtown location\u2014formerly the Davison's flagship store at [[Davison's|180 Peachtree Street]] \u2013 was shuttered at this time as well. The original Macy's [[Lenox Square]] and [[Perimeter Mall]] locations were extensively remodeled and opened in October 2003 as the first [[Bloomingdale's]] stores in Atlanta. The company rapidly followed suit in May 2003 with similar rebranding announcements for its other nameplates, [[Burdines]] in Florida, [[Goldsmith's]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Lazarus (department store)|Lazarus]] in the lower Midwest, and [[The Bon March\u00e9]] in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nOn March 6, 2005, the [[The Bon March\u00e9|Bon-Macy's]], [[Burdines|Burdines-Macy's]], [[Goldsmith's|Goldsmith's-Macy's]], [[Lazarus (department store)|Lazarus-Macy's]], and [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's-Macy's]] stores were renamed as simply \"Macy's\", the first two as the new [[Macy's West]] and [[Macy's Florida]] divisions respectively and the later three as part of the [[Macy's Central]] division.

This included May's [[Marshall Field's]] (which had just been purchased by the May Company from [[Target Corporation|Target]] in 2004), [[Kaufmann's]], [[Famous-Barr]], [[Filene's]], [[Foley's]], [[Hecht's]], [[The Jones Store]], [[L. S. Ayres]], [[Meier & Frank]], [[Robinsons-May]], and [[Strawbridge & Clothier]] chains, pending approval of the merger by federal regulators.\n\nThe rebranding of the May stores was disliked in Chicago and elsewhere because the stores were regarded as beloved local institutions. The renaming of Filene's, Marshall Field's, and Kaufmann's, which were well known for their downtown flagship stores and local traditions provoked the most outrage. For example, Kaufmann's operated the Kaufmann's [[Celebrate the Season Parade]] which was traditionally broadcast live throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on television. Many customers publicly vowed to never again shop at the renamed May stores and to switch to competitors. Prominent film critic [[Roger Ebert]] voiced the grief of many Chicagoans at the loss of Field's when he wrote in his column on September 21, 2005:\n\n{{quote|I thought the day would never come.

Eckert''' (born May 6, 1941) is an American political and diplomatic figure and writer. He is best known for his unwavering conservative principles while holding public office and his early advocacy during the 1970s of causes that many years later became major public policy issues, such as public pension reform and replacing lifelong teacher tenure with renewable contracts.\n\nHe is also known for the high regard in which he was held by President Ronald Reagan, who said of him: \"He has a quality that is all too rare in the political world \u2013 he has political courage; I am a personal witness to that courage.\"<ref>Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, January 27, 1982</ref>  Reagan referred to Eckert as \"a good friend and valued advisor\"<ref>TV, radio and direct mail ads, Eckert for Congress, 1986</ref>  and \"a man of great experience and wisdom \u2013 one of a kind.\"<ref>TV, radio and direct mail ads, Eckert for Congress, 1986</ref>  Eckert was one of the few of Reagan's legion of backers whom he asked to call him \"Ron,\" a practice Eckert declined to follow after he became President.\n\n==Early life and career==\nAmbassador Eckert was born in Rochester, New York, and grew up in its largest suburb, the [[Greece, New York|Town of Greece]]. He is a graduate of the University of North Texas, where he majored in government and minored in both history and journalism. He worked as a journalist for the Richardson, Texas, Daily News while attending college.<ref>New York State Redbook, 1973</ref>  A movement conservative while in college, he was a contributing editor to The New Guard, the magazine of Young Americans for Freedom.<ref>Masthead of The New Guard magazine, March 1962</ref>\n\nFollowing college and his marriage to his college sweetheart, Karen Laughlin of Morton, Mississippi, he served as Assistant Director of Mass Communications for the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America (Maryknoll Fathers) and was recruited to join the public relations staff of a major Fortune 500 corporation, General Foods, at its White Plains, New York, headquarters. While living in the New York City area he took advanced courses in advertising, public relations and television scriptwriting at New York University and at The New School for Social Research.<ref>New York State Redbook, 1973</ref>\n\nReturning to Rochester he joined the area's largest advertising and public relations agency as an account executive working on Kodak and Mobil Chemical accounts. At age 27 he challenged the local Republican Party establishment in a primary election contest for control of the government of the Town of Greece (pop: 75,000) in the area's first primary election in fifty years. He sought the Supervisor (elected CEO) office, handily winning in what was viewed as a stunning upset and carried his entire town council team with him.<ref>Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, June 18, 1969</ref>  Despite the defeated party establishment then fielding an \"independent\" slate in the general election, the Eckert team again won in a landslide.<ref>Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, November 5, 1969</ref>  Two years later the Old Guard Republicans challenged him in a primary for re-election and he again won both the primary and general elections by landslide margins.<ref>Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, November 3, 1971</ref>\n\nIn 1972, the party establishment asked him to be the Republican candidate against a well-entrenched Democratic State Senator and agreed to his terms for doing so. He won in what was again viewed as a stunning upset. A major part of his campaign was his constant warning that the state's public pension costs were \"a ticking time bomb that will eventually blow huge holes in state and local government and school district budgets unless reined in,\" an issue no other candidate in the state was raising.<ref>Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, November 8, 1972</ref>\n\nIn Albany Eckert was viewed as a steadfast conservative often in conflict with the state's liberal Republican establishment \u2013 but yet an unusually effective legislator.<ref>Rochester City Newspaper, October 4, 1984</ref>  Among his legislative achievements: he was the prime sponsor of major reforms of the state's laws dealing with local government; prime sponsor of many election law reforms; prime sponsor of its landmark Fresh Water Wetlands law and prime sponsor of the legislation that rescued the state's conservation fund from fiscal disaster and placed it on sound financial footing.<ref>Rochester City Newspaper, October 4, 1984</ref>\n\nTo try to stem the growth of state government, Eckert introduced a state constitutional amendment that restricted the rate of increasing government spending to an inflation and population based formula similar to ideas that had been put forth in California by Governor Ronald Reagan. Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Freeman personally worked with Eckert on the legislative language and publicly endorsed his measure.<ref>Statement by Dr. Milton Friedman, July 12, 1979</ref>  The state legislature never took it up even though, following the state and New York City financial crises, Eckert's proposal was eventually endorsed by Democratic Governor Hugh L. Carey.\n\nThe legislative accomplishment for which Eckert is best remembered was his success in obtaining the greatest ever check against runaway state government spending in passing a public pension reform law for which he had crusaded from his first day in office. During a week in June 1976 in which the legislature was in recess Eckert barnstormed the state campaigning for his bill which was publicly supported by only one other state legislator and opposed by the Democratic governor and both the Democratic and Republican leadership of both houses of the legislature.  It was also bitterly opposed by every public employee union in the state. He ignited such an outpouring of public support that days later his bill passed the Senate by a vote of 45-9 and the Assembly by a vote of 119-26 and was signed into law by the Governor.<ref>Newsday, October 21, 2011</ref>  The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and every other major newspaper in the state hailed Eckert's remarkable accomplishment, one calling it \"a miracle\"<ref>Syracuse Post-Standard</ref>  and all saying he had accomplished it \"single-handedly.\"<ref>Wall Street Journal</ref>  A state commission estimated that the law would save New York State taxpayers $2\u20133 billion in the first ten years and triple that in the second decade, but with Eckert gone future legislatures watered down some of the reforms.\n\n==Diplomat and Congressman==\nEckert resigned as state senator when President Ronald Reagan appointed him US Ambassador to Fiji & other South Pacific Island countries. The two had become friends years earlier when Eckert was the only New York State Republican officeholder of any stature to endorse Reagan when he challenged President Gerald Ford for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination.<ref>Rochester Democrat & Chronicle</ref>  Despite a private appeal from Ford in a White House one-on-one meeting, Eckert told Ford he found Ford's approach to dealing with Soviet communism weak and dangerous.  He told Ford that he was totally in accord with Reagan about the need to challenge the Soviets more forcefully and that he would be a Reagan delegate at the 1976 Republican National Convention, where he played an active role personally with Reagan.<ref>Book, Reagan's Revolution, by Craig Shirley</ref>  He endorsed Reagan for the 1980 nomination in October, 1978, while introducing Reagan at a luncheon honoring Eckert held in Rochester and was a Reagan delegate in 1980, campaigning with Reagan and personally writing Reagan's newspaper ads for the New York primary.<ref>Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, January 27, 1982</ref>\n\nHis performance as US Ambassador brought him wide acclaim. At the time of his arrival Fiji, following New Zealand's lead, was banning visits by any US Navy ships that did not swear absence of anything nuclear when firm US policy was to neither confirm nor deny. At the time of his resignation to return home to Rochester to seek election to Congress US Navy visits were warmly invited and welcomed while Soviet Union ship visits were banned. The Navy, the Reagan Administration Defense Department and Fiji's government and media all attributed that complete turnaround to Eckert's personal diplomacy.<ref>Statement by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, May 24, 1984</ref>  The Fiji Sun wrote, \"He has done more than any previous American Ambassador to bring our two countries closer together.\"<ref>Fiji Sun, April 14, 1984</ref>   The US Foreign Service bestowed its \"Meritorious Honor Award\" upon him, which was personally presented by Secretary of State George Schulz.\n\nFollowing winning the Republican nomination and being elected to Congress, Eckert beat out all other newly elected Republican representatives and scores of more senior ones to secure a seat on the powerful Energy & Commerce Committee, which had jurisdiction over some 40% of the legislation coming before the House.<ref>US Congressional Handbook, 1st Session, 1985 edition</ref>\n\nCongressional Quarterly ranked Eckert as the Member of Congress most supportive of President Reagan<ref>Congressional Quarterly, Spring 1986</ref> and Reader's Digest ran a profile feature portraying him as an example of the sort of \"gutsy\" leader unintimidated by special interests that Washington needs.<ref>Reader's Digest, February, 1986</ref>  In May 1966 England's Oxford University Union, the world's oldest and most prestigious debating society, selected Eckert to debate the British's government Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs on how best to counter international terrorism; Eckert was criticized by newspapers in his district for arguing at Oxford that state-sponsored terrorism needed to be regarded as acts of war as opposed to mere violations of laws and dealt with by effective military force.<ref>Rochester Times Union, May 8, 1986</ref>  His one major break with the Reagan Administration was his vote in opposition to the 1986 Simpson-Mazzoli amnesty immigration reform bill which Eckert viewed as rewarding illegal immigrants who broke US immigration law and encouraging more of the same in the future.<ref>Congressional Record, October 15, 1986</ref>  Reagan later said his signing that bill into law was a mistake.\n\nVice President George H.W. Bush was nearly as effusive in his praise of Eckert's career in public office as President Reagan, characterizing him as \"exemplary in every single way\" and calling him \"a courageous Congressman.\"<ref>Rochester Times Union, April 17, 1986</ref>\n\nFollowing Eckert's very narrow defeat for re-election, President Reagan appointed him US Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food & Agriculture based in Rome, Italy, which include the UN's Food & Agricultural Organization and the World Food Program.<ref>White House news release, April 22, 1987</ref>  The Western European, Japan and North America block of OECD [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries selected Eckert when it was this block's turn to name the presiding officer for FAO's most important conference.\n\n==Private Life and Retirement==\nHe resigned as US Ambassador and returned from Rome to the United States and private life to accept an offer from the Government of Fiji to be a strategic advisor in its efforts to restore the country to parliamentary democracy following a military coup and to represent it in the US and internationally. Fiji's Prime Minister publicly praised his work as \"invaluable.\"<ref>Report of the Prime Minister of Fiji, 1992</ref>  He also did other consulting work and teamed up with a friend to develop real estate subdivisions.\n\nIn retirement, Eckert, who as a public official had always written his own speeches, newspaper columns and newsletters and occasionally authored magazine and newspaper feature articles and op-eds for publications as varied as The Wall Street Journal and Outdoor Life, continued his fondness for writing and often combined it with his enthusiasm for photography. While still in college he had sold two magazine articles, one to Writer's Digest about lessons he had learned from his friend and writing mentor the great author/historian Bruce Catton,<ref>Writer's Digest, November 1964</ref> the other for the second largest Sunday supplement magazine, Family Weekly, about the richest person in the world, Texas oil billionaire H. L. Hunt,<ref>Family Weekly, July 12, 1964</ref> with whom he later conducted a Playboy interview.<ref>Playboy, August 1966</ref>\n\nHe wrote the Reader's Digest profile about a then little known computer entrepreneur named Michael Dell<ref>Reader's Digest, March 1994</ref> also authored the Digest's iconic \"Unforgettable\" tribute to his friend and mentor Bruce Catton, a friendship that had developed when as a 15-year-old Eckert had called to Catton's attention a couple minor historical errors in This Hallowed Ground while it was the number one best-selling book in the country.<ref>Reader's Digest, September 1991</ref>  His early age interest in, and knowledge about, history and government was such that the nuns who operated Saint Charles Borromeo elementary school had him teach eighth grade social studies to his fellow eighth graders.<ref>Rochester Times Union, June 18, 1969</ref>\n\nHe combined his writing skill and well-known sense of humor to produce a political satire novel, Hank Harrison for President,<ref>Vandamere Press, {{ISBN|978-0-918339-24-9}}</ref>  which received highly favorable reviews, such as Library Journal's hailing it as \"one of the best political spoofs since Leonard Wimberley's The Mouse That Roared\"<ref>Library Journal, November 15, 1991</ref>  and newspaper reviews calling it intelligent and \"hilarious.\"<ref>Fort Worth, Texas, Star-Telegram, January 5, 1992</ref>  His novel received bi-partisan praise, with Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole calling it \"Great political satire\" and Democrat New York Governor Mario Cuomo, who also wrote a jacket blurb declaring, \"It's funny!\"<ref>The New Republic, October 12, 1992</ref>\n\nHe is also author/photographer of two coffee table books on Fiji \u2013 Fiji: Pacific Paradise<ref>Bison Books, 1986, {{ISBN|0-86124-295-5}}</ref>  and Fiji: Some Enchanted Islands<ref>Brompton Books, 1991, {{ISBN|0-86124-916-X}}</ref>  \u2013 and one on Tonga \u2013 Tonga: The Friendly Islands.<ref>Burgess Books, 1993, {{ISBN|1-882793-00-5}}</ref>  A semi-professional photographer, his images have also appeared in books, magazines, advertisements, encyclopedias, postcards and travel brochures throughout the world and have won awards in competitions.\n\nHe opted to retire early to fulfill a lifelong dream of being a world traveler and has visited all seven continents, including most areas of each inhabited one; he's also visited all 50 states. His travel feature articles, illustrated by his own photographic images and nationally-syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate, Copley News Service and Creator's Syndicate, have appeared as the lead travel feature in well over 100 of the leading newspapers in the United States and Canada. They also have appeared in travel and in-flight magazines and have been translated into several languages. He received The State of Mississippi Governor's Award for Travel Writer of the Year.\n\nIn retirement he has also written numerous op-eds on political issues for such outlets as National Review Online, Politico, TownHall.com, The Daily Caller, American Thinker, PJ Media and Human Events.\n\nSince leaving the political and diplomatic arena he has consistently stated he has no interest in holding any elective or appointive government position but says his only big regret from the years he did is that he was not able to obtain the comedy rights to the New York State Legislature, Congress or the State Department.\n\nAmbassador Eckert and his wife, Karen, live in Raleigh, North Carolina. They have three grown children (including pharmaceutical heavy hitter [[Cindy Eckert]]) and four grandchildren.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Fred J.

Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Freeman personally worked with Eckert on the legislative language and publicly endorsed his measure.<ref>Statement by Dr. Milton Friedman, July 12, 1979</ref>  The state legislature never took it up even though, following the state and New York City financial crises, Eckert's proposal was eventually endorsed by Democratic Governor Hugh L. Carey.\n\nThe legislative accomplishment for which Eckert is best remembered was his success in obtaining the greatest ever check against runaway state government spending in passing a public pension reform law for which he had crusaded from his first day in office. During a week in June 1976 in which the legislature was in recess Eckert barnstormed the state campaigning for his bill which was publicly supported by only one other state legislator and opposed by the Democratic governor and both the Democratic and Republican leadership of both houses of the legislature.  It was also bitterly opposed by every public employee union in the state. He ignited such an outpouring of public support that days later his bill passed the Senate by a vote of 45-9 and the Assembly by a vote of 119-26 and was signed into law by the Governor.<ref>Newsday, October 21, 2011</ref>  The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and every other major newspaper in the state hailed Eckert's remarkable accomplishment, one calling it \"a miracle\"<ref>Syracuse Post-Standard</ref>  and all saying he had accomplished it \"single-handedly.\"<ref>Wall Street Journal</ref>  A state commission estimated that the law would save New York State taxpayers $2\u20133 billion in the first ten years and triple that in the second decade, but with Eckert gone future legislatures watered down some of the reforms.\n\n==Diplomat and Congressman==\nEckert resigned as state senator when President Ronald Reagan appointed him US Ambassador to Fiji & other South Pacific Island countries. The two had become friends years earlier when Eckert was the only New York State Republican officeholder of any stature to endorse Reagan when he challenged President Gerald Ford for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination.<ref>Rochester Democrat & Chronicle</ref>  Despite a private appeal from Ford in a White House one-on-one meeting, Eckert told Ford he found Ford's approach to dealing with Soviet communism weak and dangerous.  He told Ford that he was totally in accord with Reagan about the need to challenge the Soviets more forcefully and that he would be a Reagan delegate at the 1976 Republican National Convention, where he played an active role personally with Reagan.<ref>Book, Reagan's Revolution, by Craig Shirley</ref>  He endorsed Reagan for the 1980 nomination in October, 1978, while introducing Reagan at a luncheon honoring Eckert held in Rochester and was a Reagan delegate in 1980, campaigning with Reagan and personally writing Reagan's newspaper ads for the New York primary.<ref>Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, January 27, 1982</ref>\n\nHis performance as US Ambassador brought him wide acclaim. At the time of his arrival Fiji, following New Zealand's lead, was banning visits by any US Navy ships that did not swear absence of anything nuclear when firm US policy was to neither confirm nor deny. At the time of his resignation to return home to Rochester to seek election to Congress US Navy visits were warmly invited and welcomed while Soviet Union ship visits were banned. The Navy, the Reagan Administration Defense Department and Fiji's government and media all attributed that complete turnaround to Eckert's personal diplomacy.<ref>Statement by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, May 24, 1984</ref>  The Fiji Sun wrote, \"He has done more than any previous American Ambassador to bring our two countries closer together.\"<ref>Fiji Sun, April 14, 1984</ref>   The US Foreign Service bestowed its \"Meritorious Honor Award\" upon him, which was personally presented by Secretary of State George Schulz.\n\nFollowing winning the Republican nomination and being elected to Congress, Eckert beat out all other newly elected Republican representatives and scores of more senior ones to secure a seat on the powerful Energy & Commerce Committee, which had jurisdiction over some 40% of the legislation coming before the House.<ref>US Congressional Handbook, 1st Session, 1985 edition</ref>\n\nCongressional Quarterly ranked Eckert as the Member of Congress most supportive of President Reagan<ref>Congressional Quarterly, Spring 1986</ref> and Reader's Digest ran a profile feature portraying him as an example of the sort of \"gutsy\" leader unintimidated by special interests that Washington needs.<ref>Reader's Digest, February, 1986</ref>  In May 1966 England's Oxford University Union, the world's oldest and most prestigious debating society, selected Eckert to debate the British's government Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs on how best to counter international terrorism; Eckert was criticized by newspapers in his district for arguing at Oxford that state-sponsored terrorism needed to be regarded as acts of war as opposed to mere violations of laws and dealt with by effective military force.<ref>Rochester Times Union, May 8, 1986</ref>  His one major break with the Reagan Administration was his vote in opposition to the 1986 Simpson-Mazzoli amnesty immigration reform bill which Eckert viewed as rewarding illegal immigrants who broke US immigration law and encouraging more of the same in the future.<ref>Congressional Record, October 15, 1986</ref>  Reagan later said his signing that bill into law was a mistake.\n\nVice President George H.W. Bush was nearly as effusive in his praise of Eckert's career in public office as President Reagan, characterizing him as \"exemplary in every single way\" and calling him \"a courageous Congressman.\"<ref>Rochester Times Union, April 17, 1986</ref>\n\nFollowing Eckert's very narrow defeat for re-election, President Reagan appointed him US Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food & Agriculture based in Rome, Italy, which include the UN's Food & Agricultural Organization and the World Food Program.<ref>White House news release, April 22, 1987</ref>  The Western European, Japan and North America block of OECD [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries selected Eckert when it was this block's turn to name the presiding officer for FAO's most important conference.\n\n==Private Life and Retirement==\nHe resigned as US Ambassador and returned from Rome to the United States and private life to accept an offer from the Government of Fiji to be a strategic advisor in its efforts to restore the country to parliamentary democracy following a military coup and to represent it in the US and internationally. Fiji's Prime Minister publicly praised his work as \"invaluable.\"<ref>Report of the Prime Minister of Fiji, 1992</ref>  He also did other consulting work and teamed up with a friend to develop real estate subdivisions.\n\nIn retirement, Eckert, who as a public official had always written his own speeches, newspaper columns and newsletters and occasionally authored magazine and newspaper feature articles and op-eds for publications as varied as The Wall Street Journal and Outdoor Life, continued his fondness for writing and often combined it with his enthusiasm for photography. While still in college he had sold two magazine articles, one to Writer's Digest about lessons he had learned from his friend and writing mentor the great author/historian Bruce Catton,<ref>Writer's Digest, November 1964</ref> the other for the second largest Sunday supplement magazine, Family Weekly, about the richest person in the world, Texas oil billionaire H. L. Hunt,<ref>Family Weekly, July 12, 1964</ref> with whom he later conducted a Playboy interview.<ref>Playboy, August 1966</ref>\n\nHe wrote the Reader's Digest profile about a then little known computer entrepreneur named Michael Dell<ref>Reader's Digest, March 1994</ref> also authored the Digest's iconic \"Unforgettable\" tribute to his friend and mentor Bruce Catton, a friendship that had developed when as a 15-year-old Eckert had called to Catton's attention a couple minor historical errors in This Hallowed Ground while it was the number one best-selling book in the country.<ref>Reader's Digest, September 1991</ref>  His early age interest in, and knowledge about, history and government was such that the nuns who operated Saint Charles Borromeo elementary school had him teach eighth grade social studies to his fellow eighth graders.<ref>Rochester Times Union, June 18, 1969</ref>\n\nHe combined his writing skill and well-known sense of humor to produce a political satire novel, Hank Harrison for President,<ref>Vandamere Press, {{ISBN|978-0-918339-24-9}}</ref>  which received highly favorable reviews, such as Library Journal's hailing it as \"one of the best political spoofs since Leonard Wimberley's The Mouse That Roared\"<ref>Library Journal, November 15, 1991</ref>  and newspaper reviews calling it intelligent and \"hilarious.\"<ref>Fort Worth, Texas, Star-Telegram, January 5, 1992</ref>  His novel received bi-partisan praise, with Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole calling it \"Great political satire\" and Democrat New York Governor Mario Cuomo, who also wrote a jacket blurb declaring, \"It's funny!\"<ref>The New Republic, October 12, 1992</ref>\n\nHe is also author/photographer of two coffee table books on Fiji \u2013 Fiji: Pacific Paradise<ref>Bison Books, 1986, {{ISBN|0-86124-295-5}}</ref>  and Fiji: Some Enchanted Islands<ref>Brompton Books, 1991, {{ISBN|0-86124-916-X}}</ref>  \u2013 and one on Tonga \u2013 Tonga: The Friendly Islands.<ref>Burgess Books, 1993, {{ISBN|1-882793-00-5}}</ref>  A semi-professional photographer, his images have also appeared in books, magazines, advertisements, encyclopedias, postcards and travel brochures throughout the world and have won awards in competitions.\n\nHe opted to retire early to fulfill a lifelong dream of being a world traveler and has visited all seven continents, including most areas of each inhabited one; he's also visited all 50 states. His travel feature articles, illustrated by his own photographic images and nationally-syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate, Copley News Service and Creator's Syndicate, have appeared as the lead travel feature in well over 100 of the leading newspapers in the United States and Canada. They also have appeared in travel and in-flight magazines and have been translated into several languages. He received The State of Mississippi Governor's Award for Travel Writer of the Year.\n\nIn retirement he has also written numerous op-eds on political issues for such outlets as National Review Online, Politico, TownHall.com, The Daily Caller, American Thinker, PJ Media and Human Events.\n\nSince leaving the political and diplomatic arena he has consistently stated he has no interest in holding any elective or appointive government position but says his only big regret from the years he did is that he was not able to obtain the comedy rights to the New York State Legislature, Congress or the State Department.\n\nAmbassador Eckert and his wife, Karen, live in Raleigh, North Carolina. They have three grown children (including pharmaceutical heavy hitter [[Cindy Eckert]]) and four grandchildren.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Fred J.

In 1919 Dr. Passot was known to publish one of the first papers on face-lifting, this consisted mainly on the elevating and redraping of the facial skin. After this many others began to write papers on face-lifting in the 1920s. From then the esthetic surgery was being performed on a large scale, from the basis of the reconstructive surgery. The first female plastic surgeon, [[Suzanne No\u00ebl]], played a large role in its development and she wrote one of the first books about esthetic surgery named ''Chirurgie Esthetique, son r\u00f4le social''.\n\n===SMAS period (1970\u20131980)===\nIn 1968 [[Tord Skoog]] introduced the concept of subfacial dissection, therefore providing suspension of the stronger deeper layer rather than relying on skin tension to achieve his facelift (he publishes his technique in 1974, with subfacial dissection of the [[platysma]] without detaching the skin in a posterior direction).<ref>{{cite book|last=Skoog|first=Tord Gustav|title=Plastic Surgery: New Methods and Refinements|year=1974|publisher=Saunders|isbn=978-0721683553|pages=500}}</ref> In 1976 Mitz and Peyronie described the anatomical Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System, or SMAS,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mitz|first=V.|author2=Peyronie M. |title=The superficial musculo-aponeurotic system (SMAS) in the parotid and cheek area|journal=Plast Reconstr Surg|date=July 1976|volume=58|series=1|pages=80\u20138|pmid=935283|issue=1|doi=10.1097/00006534-197607000-00013}}</ref> a term coined by [[Paul Tessier]], Mitz and Peyronie\u2019s tutor in [[craniofacial surgery]], after he had become familiar with Skoog\u2019s technique.

Each surgeon practices multiple different types of facelift surgery. At a consultation the procedure with the best outcome is chosen for every patient. Expectations of the patient, the age, possible recovery time  and areas to improve are some of the many factors taken in consideration before choosing a technique of rhytidectomy.\n\nIn the traditional facelift, an incision is made in front of the ear extending up into the hairline. The incision curves around the bottom of the ear and then behind it, usually ending near the hairline on the back of the neck. After the skin incision is made, the skin is separated from the deeper tissues with a scalpel or scissors (also called undermining) over the cheeks and neck. At this point, the deeper tissues (SMAS, the fascial suspension system of the face) can be tightened with sutures, with or without removing some of the excess deeper tissues. The skin is then redraped, and the amount of excess skin to be removed is determined by the surgeon's judgement and experience. The excess skin is then removed, and the skin incisions are closed with [[Surgical suture|sutures]] and [[staple (fastener)|staple]]s.\n\n[[File:SMAS Facelift.jpg|thumb|left|The technique of a SMAS facelift, consisting of mobilisation, repositioning and fixating.]]\n\n===SMAS lift===\nThe SMAS (Superficial Musculo Aponeurotic System) layer consists of suspensory ligaments that encase the cheek fat, thereby causing them to remain in their normal position. Resuspension and securing the SMAS anatomical layer can lead to rejuvenation of the face, by counteracting aging and gravity caused [[ligamentous laxity|laxity]]. Modifications to this technique led to development of the \"Composite Facelift\" and \"Deep plane Facelift.\"\n\n===Deep-plane facelift===\nIn order to correct the deepening of the nasolabial fold more accurately, the deep plane facelift was developed. Differing from the SMAS lift by freeing cheek fat and some muscles from their bone implement. This technique has a higher risk at damaging the facial nerve. The SMAS lift is an effective procedure to reposition the platysma muscle; however, the nasolabial fold is according to some surgeons better addressed by a deep plane facelift or composite facelift.\n\n===Composite facelift===\nAs well as in the deep plane facelift, in the composite facelift a deeper layer of tissue is mobilised and repositioned. The difference between these operating techniques is the extra repositioning and fixation of the orbicularis oculi muscle in the composite facelift procedure. The malar crescent caused by the orbicularis oculi ptosis can be addressed in a composite facelift.\n\n===Mid face-lift===\nThe mid face area, the area between the cheeks, flattens and makes a woman\u2019s face look slightly more masculine. The mid face-lift is suggested to people where these changes occur, yet without a significant degree of [[jowling]] or sagging of the neck. In these cases a mid face-lift is sufficient to rejuvenate the face opposed to a full facelift, which is a more drastic surgery.\nThe ideal candidates for a mid face-lift is when a person is in his 40s, or if the cheeks appear to be sagging and the nasolabial area has laxity or skin folds.\nTo achieve a younger appearance the surgeon makes several small incisions along the hairline and inside the mouth, this way the fatty tissue layers can be lifted and repositioned. This way there are practically no scars. The fatty layer that lies over the cheekbones is also lifted and repositioned. This improves the nose-to-mouth lines and the roundness over the cheekbones. The recovery time is rather short and this procedure is often combined with a blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery)\n\n===Mini-facelift===\nThe mini-facelift is the least invasive type of facelift which is similar to a full facelift, the only difference is the omission of the neck lift in the mini lift procedure. It is also called the \u2018S\u2019 lift because of the shape of the incision that is used or the \u2018short-scar\u2019 facelift. This lift is a more temporary solution to the ageing of the face which also has less downtime and is done on people who have deep nasolabial folds, sagging facial structures, yet still have a firm and well-contoured neck. The position of the incision is usually made from the hairline around the ear with scars hidden in the natural crease of the skin. The mini lift can be performed with an [[endoscope]], which is used to reposition the soft tissues. After this, the skin is repositioned by the surgeon with small sutures. This type of lift is a good alternative to the full facelift to people with premature ageing.[[File:Facelift incisions and undermining of different procedures.jpg|thumb|Blue represents the incisions in the Skin only facelift. Green represents the S-lift. Red is the extensive undermining done in several facelift techniques.]]\n\n===Subperiosteal facelift===\nThe subperiosteal facelift technique is done by vertically lifting the soft tissues of the face, completely separating it from the underlying facial bones and elevating it to a more esthetically pleasing position, correcting deep nasolabial folds and sagging cheeks. The technique is often combined with standard techniques, which provide a long-lasting rejuvenation of the face and is done in all age groups. The difference between this and other lifts is that the subperiosteal facelift has a longer period of facial swelling after the procedure.\n\n===Skin-only facelift===\nWith the skin-only facelift only the skin of the face is lifted and not the underlying SMAS, muscles or other structures. As the elastin fibers disintegrate, the skin itself loses elasticity in older pati\u00ebnts. A skin only face lift requires skill in understanding the extent of safe removal of skin and the Vector of pull to get an optimal result. It can be done with a simple ellipse of skin removed with minimal undermining of skin flaps or more extensively with large skin flaps. It can last 5 to 10 years but some patients may want a touch-up at  6 to 12 months after the procedure. The reason that this option is considered is that it has fewer complications and quicker recovery. One of the father's of plastic surgery Sir Harold Gilles described a simple ellipse of skin excision in a socialite who was pleased with her quick recovery and outcome. Can be done for a simple jowl lift in a 35 to 45 year old patient.\n\n===MACS facelift===\nThe term MACS-lift \u2013 or Minimal Access Cranial Suspension lift \u2013 allows for the correction of sagging facial features through a short, minimal incision, elevating them vertically by suspending them from above. There are many advantages to having a MACS facelift versus a traditional facelift. For starters, the MACS-lift uses a shorter scar that is in front of the ear, instead of behind, which is much easier to hide. Overall, the MACS-lift surgery is safer because less skin is raised. This means that there is less risk of bleeding and nerve damage. The operation also takes less time, lasting 2.5 hours instead of the 3.5 hours that the traditional facelift requires. There is also a shorter recovery period, 2\u20133 weeks instead of 3\u20134 weeks. Finally, the results of the MACS-lift are very natural while the traditional facelift will often result in a \"windswept\" look. The MACS lift has been successfully used for to correct complication after thread-lift with APTOS<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 23052379 | doi=10.1007/s00266-012-9975-1 | volume=36 | title=Successful treatment of thread-lifting complication from APTOS sutures using a simple MACS lift and fat grafting. | date=Dec 2012 | journal=Aesthetic Plast Surg | pages=1307\u201310}}</ref>\n\n==Complications==\nThe most common complication is bleeding which usually requires a return to the operating room. Less common, but potentially serious, complications may include damage to the facial nerves and necrosis of the skin flaps or [[infection]]. Although the facial plastic surgeon attempts to prevent and minimise the risk of complications, a rhytidectomy can have complications. As a risk to every operation, complications can be derived as a reaction to the anesthetics.\n\n[[Hematoma]] is the most seen complication after rhytidectomy.<ref name=\"Moyer\"/><ref name=\"Baker\"/><ref name=\"Rees\">{{cite journal|last=Rees|first=TD|author2=Aston, SJ |title=Complications of rhytidectomy.|journal=Clinics in Plastic Surgery|date=January 1978|volume=5|issue=1|pages=109\u201319|pmid=639438}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=SR|author2=Webster, RC |title=\"How I do it\"\u2014head and neck and plastic surgery.

In men, the sideburns can be pulled backwards and upwards, resulting in an unnatural appearance if appropriate techniques are not employed to address this issue. Achieving a natural appearance following surgery in men can be more challenging due to their hair-bearing preauricular skin.\nIn both men and women, one of the signs of having had a facelift can be an earlobe which is pulled forwards and/or distorted. If too much skin is removed, or a more vertical vector not employed, the face can assume a pulled-back, \"windswept\" appearance. This appearance can also be due to changes in bone structure that generally happen with age.[2]\n\nOne of the most often overlooked (or not discussed) areas of a traditional facelift procedure is the effects on the anatomical positioning and angles of the ears. Most patients are, in many cases, not made aware that the vector forces in a facelift will lower the ears as well as change the angle of the ears. Ear lowering can be as much as 1&nbsp;cm and change in the angle as much as 10 degrees.\n\nInfection is a rare complication for patients who have undergone a rhytidectomy.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=LeRoy JL, Rees TD, Nolan WB |title=Infections requiring hospital readmission following face lift surgery: incidence, treatment, and sequelae.|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|date=March 1994|volume=93|issue=3|pages=533\u20136|pmid=8115508|doi=10.1097/00006534-199493030-00013}}</ref> Staphylococcus is the most usual causative organism for an infection after facelift surgery.<ref name=\"Moyer\"/>\n\n==Society==\nCost varies by country where surgery is performed, {{as of|2008|lc=y}}:<ref>{{cite book | author = Comarow, Avery |title = Under the Knife in Bangalore | publisher = US News and World Report | date = 12 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n*[[Canada]] \u2013 US$7,000\u201315,000\n*[[Pakistan]] \u2013 US$5,500\n*[[Malaysia]] \u2013 US$6,400\n*[[Panama]] \u2013 US$2,500\n*[[Russia]] \u2013 US$10,000\n*[[Singapore]] \u2013 US$7,500\n*[[South Korea]] \u2013 US$6,650\n*[[India]] \u2013 US$2500\n*[[Taiwan]] \u2013 US$8,500\n*[[Thailand]] \u2013 US$5,000\n*[[United States]] \u2013 US$7,000\u2013$15,000\nAdditional Notes on Costs in Europe, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}:<ref>{{cite news | title = Face Lift Fact Sheet | publisher = BuyAssociation | year = 2009}}</ref>\n*[[Belgium]] \u2013 GBP \u00a31,650 and up\n*[[Italy]] \u2013 GBP \u00a35,000\n*[[United Kingdom]] \u2013 \u00a34,000\u2013\u00a39,000\n*[[Serbia]] \u2013 GBP \u00a34000\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cosmetic surgery]]\n*[[Facial toning]]\n*[[Electrotherapy (cosmetic)#Micro-current treatment|Micro-current treatment]] (\"non-surgical\" facelift)\n*[[Lifestyle lift]]\n*[[Minimal access cranial suspension]]\n*[[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n*[[Otolaryngology]]\n*[[Plastic surgery]]\n*[[Superficial muscular aponeurotic system]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Skin and subcutaneous tissue procedures}}\n\n[[Category:Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n[[Category:Otorhinolaryngology]]\n[[Category:Plastic surgical procedures]]\n[[Category:Surgical removal procedures]]\n", "text_old": "{{morefootnotes|date=November 2019}}\n{{Redirect|Facelift}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}\n{{Infobox interventions\n| Name        = Rhytidectomy\n| Image       = Mid facelift (rhytidectomy) upper incision.png\n| Caption     = Temporal incision behind the hairline in [[endoscopic]] midface lift (rhytidectomy).

At the same time the British plastic surgeon [[Harold Gillies|Harold Delfs Gillies]] used the Esser-graft to school all those who flocked towards him who wanted to study under him. That\u2019s how he earned the name \"Father of 20th Century Plastic Surgery\". In 1919 Dr. Passot was known to publish one of the first papers on face-lifting, this consisted mainly on the elevating and redraping of the facial skin. After this many others began to write papers on face-lifting in the 1920s. From then the esthetic surgery was being performed on a large scale, from the basis of the reconstructive surgery. The first female plastic surgeon, [[Suzanne No\u00ebl]], played a large role in its development and she wrote one of the first books about esthetic surgery named ''Chirurgie Esthetique, son r\u00f4le social''.\n\n===SMAS period (1970\u20131980)===\nIn 1968 [[Tord Skoog]] introduced the concept of subfacial dissection, therefore providing suspension of the stronger deeper layer rather than relying on skin tension to achieve his facelift (he publishes his technique in 1974, with subfacial dissection of the [[platysma]] without detaching the skin in a posterior direction).<ref>{{cite book|last=Skoog|first=Tord Gustav|title=Plastic Surgery: New Methods and Refinements|year=1974|publisher=Saunders|isbn=978-0721683553|pages=500}}</ref> In 1976 Mitz and Peyronie described the anatomical Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System, or SMAS,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mitz|first=V.|author2=Peyronie M. |title=The superficial musculo-aponeurotic system (SMAS) in the parotid and cheek area|journal=Plast Reconstr Surg|date=July 1976|volume=58|series=1|pages=80\u20138|pmid=935283|issue=1|doi=10.1097/00006534-197607000-00013}}</ref> a term coined by [[Paul Tessier]], Mitz and Peyronie\u2019s tutor in [[craniofacial surgery]], after he had become familiar with Skoog\u2019s technique.

Each surgeon practices multiple different types of facelift surgery. At a consultation the procedure with the best outcome is chosen for every patient. Expectations of the patient, the age, possible recovery time  and areas to improve are some of the many factors taken in consideration before choosing a technique of rhytidectomy.\n\nIn the traditional facelift, an incision is made in front of the ear extending up into the hairline. The incision curves around the bottom of the ear and then behind it, usually ending near the hairline on the back of the neck. After the skin incision is made, the skin is separated from the deeper tissues with a scalpel or scissors (also called undermining) over the cheeks and neck. At this point, the deeper tissues (SMAS, the fascial suspension system of the face) can be tightened with sutures, with or without removing some of the excess deeper tissues. The skin is then redraped, and the amount of excess skin to be removed is determined by the surgeon's judgement and experience. The excess skin is then removed, and the skin incisions are closed with [[Surgical suture|sutures]] and [[staple (fastener)|staple]]s.\n\n[[File:SMAS Facelift.jpg|thumb|left|The technique of a SMAS facelift, consisting of mobilisation, repositioning and fixating.]]\n\n===SMAS lift===\nThe SMAS (Superficial Musculo Aponeurotic System) layer consists of suspensory ligaments that encase the cheek fat, thereby causing them to remain in their normal position. Resuspension and securing the SMAS anatomical layer can lead to rejuvenation of the face, by counteracting aging and gravity caused [[ligamentous laxity|laxity]]. Modifications to this technique led to development of the \"Composite Facelift\" and \"Deep plane Facelift.\"\n\n===Deep-plane facelift===\nIn order to correct the deepening of the nasolabial fold more accurately, the deep plane facelift was developed. Differing from the SMAS lift by freeing cheek fat and some muscles from their bone implement. This technique has a higher risk at damaging the facial nerve. The SMAS lift is an effective procedure to reposition the platysma muscle; however, the nasolabial fold is according to some surgeons better addressed by a deep plane facelift or composite facelift.\n\n===Composite facelift===\nAs well as in the deep plane facelift, in the composite facelift a deeper layer of tissue is mobilised and repositioned. The difference between these operating techniques is the extra repositioning and fixation of the orbicularis oculi muscle in the composite facelift procedure. The malar crescent caused by the orbicularis oculi ptosis can be addressed in a composite facelift.\n\n===Mid face-lift===\nThe mid face area, the area between the cheeks, flattens and makes a woman\u2019s face look slightly more masculine. The mid face-lift is suggested to people where these changes occur, yet without a significant degree of [[jowling]] or sagging of the neck. In these cases a mid face-lift is sufficient to rejuvenate the face opposed to a full facelift, which is a more drastic surgery.\nThe ideal candidates for a mid face-lift is when a person is in his 40s, or if the cheeks appear to be sagging and the nasolabial area has laxity or skin folds.\nTo achieve a younger appearance the surgeon makes several small incisions along the hairline and inside the mouth, this way the fatty tissue layers can be lifted and repositioned. This way there are practically no scars. The fatty layer that lies over the cheekbones is also lifted and repositioned. This improves the nose-to-mouth lines and the roundness over the cheekbones. The recovery time is rather short and this procedure is often combined with a blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery)\n\n===Mini-facelift===\nThe mini-facelift is the least invasive type of facelift which is similar to a full facelift, the only difference is the omission of the neck lift in the mini lift procedure. It is also called the \u2018S\u2019 lift because of the shape of the incision that is used or the \u2018short-scar\u2019 facelift. This lift is a more temporary solution to the ageing of the face which also has less downtime and is done on people who have deep nasolabial folds, sagging facial structures, yet still have a firm and well-contoured neck. The position of the incision is usually made from the hairline around the ear with scars hidden in the natural crease of the skin. The mini lift can be performed with an [[endoscope]], which is used to reposition the soft tissues. After this, the skin is repositioned by the surgeon with small sutures. This type of lift is a good alternative to the full facelift to people with premature ageing.[[File:Facelift incisions and undermining of different procedures.jpg|thumb|Blue represents the incisions in the Skin only facelift. Green represents the S-lift. Red is the extensive undermining done in several facelift techniques.]]\n\n===Subperiosteal facelift===\nThe subperiosteal facelift technique is done by vertically lifting the soft tissues of the face, completely separating it from the underlying facial bones and elevating it to a more esthetically pleasing position, correcting deep nasolabial folds and sagging cheeks. The technique is often combined with standard techniques, which provide a long-lasting rejuvenation of the face and is done in all age groups. The difference between this and other lifts is that the subperiosteal facelift has a longer period of facial swelling after the procedure.\n\n===Skin-only facelift===\nWith the skin-only facelift only the skin of the face is lifted and not the underlying SMAS, muscles or other structures. As the elastin fibers disintegrate, the skin itself loses elasticity in older pati\u00ebnts. A skin only face lift requires skill in understanding the extent of safe removal of skin and the Vector of pull to get an optimal result. It can be done with a simple ellipse of skin removed with minimal undermining of skin flaps or more extensively with large skin flaps. It can last 5 to 10 years but some patients may want a touch-up at  6 to 12 months after the procedure. The reason that this option is considered is that it has fewer complications and quicker recovery. One of the father's of plastic surgery Sir Harold Gilles described a simple ellipse of skin excision in a socialite who was pleased with her quick recovery and outcome. Can be done for a simple jowl lift in a 35 to 45 year old patient.\n\n===MACS facelift===\nThe term MACS-lift \u2013 or Minimal Access Cranial Suspension lift \u2013 allows for the correction of sagging facial features through a short, minimal incision, elevating them vertically by suspending them from above. There are many advantages to having a MACS facelift versus a traditional facelift. For starters, the MACS-lift uses a shorter scar that is in front of the ear, instead of behind, which is much easier to hide. Overall, the MACS-lift surgery is safer because less skin is raised. This means that there is less risk of bleeding and nerve damage. The operation also takes less time, lasting 2.5 hours instead of the 3.5 hours that the traditional facelift requires. There is also a shorter recovery period, 2\u20133 weeks instead of 3\u20134 weeks. Finally, the results of the MACS-lift are very natural while the traditional facelift will often result in a \"windswept\" look. The MACS lift has been successfully used for to correct complication after thread-lift with APTOS<ref>Sapountzis S. et al Aesthetic Plast Surg. 2012 Dec;36(6) 1307\u201310. doi: 10.1007/s00266-012-9975-1 {{PMID|23052379}}</ref>\n\n==Complications==\nThe most common complication is bleeding which usually requires a return to the operating room. Less common, but potentially serious, complications may include damage to the facial nerves and necrosis of the skin flaps or [[infection]]. Although the facial plastic surgeon attempts to prevent and minimise the risk of complications, a rhytidectomy can have complications.

A facelift requires skin incisions; however, the incisions in front of and behind the ear are usually inconspicuous.\n\n[[Hair loss]] in the portions of the incision within the hair-bearing scalp can rarely occur. A hairline distortion can result after undergoing a rhytidectomy. Especially facial hair by men after a facelift procedure.

In men, the sideburns can be pulled backwards and upwards, resulting in an unnatural appearance if appropriate techniques are not employed to address this issue. Achieving a natural appearance following surgery in men can be more challenging due to their hair-bearing preauricular skin.\nIn both men and women, one of the signs of having had a facelift can be an earlobe which is pulled forwards and/or distorted. If too much skin is removed, or a more vertical vector not employed, the face can assume a pulled-back, \"windswept\" appearance. This appearance can also be due to changes in bone structure that generally happen with age.[2]\n\nOne of the most often overlooked (or not discussed) areas of a traditional facelift procedure is the effects on the anatomical positioning and angles of the ears. Most patients are, in many cases, not made aware that the vector forces in a facelift will lower the ears as well as change the angle of the ears. Ear lowering can be as much as 1&nbsp;cm and change in the angle as much as 10 degrees.\n\nInfection is a rare complication for patients who have undergone a rhytidectomy.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=LeRoy JL, Rees TD, Nolan WB |title=Infections requiring hospital readmission following face lift surgery: incidence, treatment, and sequelae.|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|date=March 1994|volume=93|issue=3|pages=533\u20136|pmid=8115508|doi=10.1097/00006534-199493030-00013}}</ref> Staphylococcus is the most usual causative organism for an infection after facelift surgery.<ref name=\"Moyer\"/>\n\n==Society==\nCost varies by country where surgery is performed, {{as of|2008|lc=y}}:<ref>{{cite book | author = Comarow, Avery |title = Under the Knife in Bangalore | publisher = US News and World Report | date = 12 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n*[[Canada]] \u2013 US$7,000\u201315,000\n*[[Pakistan]] \u2013 US$5,500\n*[[Malaysia]] \u2013 US$6,400\n*[[Panama]] \u2013 US$2,500\n*[[Russia]] \u2013 US$10,000\n*[[Singapore]] \u2013 US$7,500\n*[[South Korea]] \u2013 US$6,650\n*[[India]] \u2013 US$2500\n*[[Taiwan]] \u2013 US$8,500\n*[[Thailand]] \u2013 US$5,000\n*[[United States]] \u2013 US$7,000\u2013$15,000\nAdditional Notes on Costs in Europe, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}:<ref>{{cite news | title = Face Lift Fact Sheet | publisher = BuyAssociation | year = 2009}}</ref>\n*[[Belgium]] \u2013 GBP \u00a31,650 and up\n*[[Italy]] \u2013 GBP \u00a35,000\n*[[United Kingdom]] \u2013 \u00a34,000\u2013\u00a39,000\n*[[Serbia]] \u2013 GBP \u00a34000\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cosmetic surgery]]\n*[[Facial toning]]\n*[[Electrotherapy (cosmetic)#Micro-current treatment|Micro-current treatment]] (\"non-surgical\" facelift)\n*[[Lifestyle lift]]\n*[[Minimal access cranial suspension]]\n*[[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n*[[Otolaryngology]]\n*[[Plastic surgery]]\n*[[Superficial muscular aponeurotic system]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Skin and subcutaneous tissue procedures}}\n\n[[Category:Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n[[Category:Otorhinolaryngology]]\n[[Category:Plastic surgical procedures]]\n[[Category:Surgical removal procedures]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhytidectomy"}

Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others. The game is known by several names including '''jackstraws''' (or '''jack straws'''), '''spellicans''', and '''spillikins'''.\n\nThe sticks may be made of almost any material, such as [[ivory]], [[bone]], [[wood]], [[water]], [[bamboo]], [[straw]], [[Phragmites|reed]], [[Juncaceae|rush]], [[yarrow]], or [[plastics]].\nSome [[Pick-up sticks (Haida)|Haida First Nation pick-up sticks]] are plain [[maple]] wood decorated with [[abalone]] shell and copper.\n\nToday, the most common pick-up sticks game is [[Mikado (game)|Mikado]].  It remains difficult in all variations.\n\n== Play ==\nThe object of the game is to pick up the most sticks.\n\nAt the begin of game play, a bundle of sticks is randomly distributed or dropped so that the sticks end up in a tangled pile. The more tangled the resulting disarray, the more challenging the game. In some versions of the game, any isolated sticks, or sticks lying alone, are removed.\n\nThe players attempt to remove a single stick at a time, without moving any other stick. In some versions of the game, players use a tool to move the stick away from the pile; this \"tool\" may be one of the sticks, held aside before the game begins. In other versions, players must pick up the sticks by hand. In either case, players must not move any other thing while attempting to remove said stick; if any other stick moves, their turn immediately ends and they lose a turn. A player who successfully \"picks-up sticks\" keeps removing sticks until they cause a secondary stick to move, ending their turn.\n\nIn some versions of the game, different-coloured sticks are worth different numbers of points, and the winner is the person with the highest score.\n\n== Jack Sticks or jack straw ==\n\nThe pieces in a jackstraw set are often thematically related to farmyard tools, such as ladders, rakes, shovels, and hoes. There are typically around 45 pieces in a set and made of wood, plastic, bone, or ivory. In addition to the Jack Sticks themselves, there is typically a helper piece with a hooked end for use in snagging and manipulating pieces. Each piece has a point value, with more challenging pieces being worth more points. Jack sticks varies from pick-up sticks in points and equipment but not in game play.
