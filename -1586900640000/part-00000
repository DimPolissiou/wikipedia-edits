Their music is characterized by the distinctive [[baritone]] voice of their American-born Canadian lead singer [[Ivan Doroschuk]], as well as their elaborate use of synthesizers and electronic processing. They achieved their greatest popularity in the 1980s with \"[[The Safety Dance]]\", a worldwide Top Ten hit (#3 in the United States) and \"[[Pop Goes the World (song)|Pop Goes the World]]\". After a hiatus for most of the 1990s and 2000s, Doroschuk reformed the band in 2010, and released ''[[Love in the Age of War]]'' (2012). The reformed group, based in [[Vancouver]], has continued to perform, including a European tour in 2015 and Australia in 2016.<ref name=\"timeout-sydney\"/>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early days===\nMen Without Hats was founded in Montreal in 1977, initially as a punk rock band featuring Ivan Doroschuk (vocals), Pete Seabrooke (guitar), Dave Hill (bass), and John Gurrin (drums). In 1980, Doroschuk restarted Men Without Hats, giving the name to a new synthesizer-based electronic group that he formed with J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Arrobas (vocals, keyboards) and his brothers Stefan Doroschuk (bass) and Colin Doroschuk (guitar).<ref name=CanRock128/> Years earlier, while in high school, Arrobas and the Doroschuk brothers had played together in a short-lived band called Wave 21,<ref name=CanRock128/> along with drummer Igor Krichevsky.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe Doroschuk brothers, all three of whom are classically trained musicians, were born in [[Champaign, Illinois]] while their father, a Canadian, was earning a doctoral degree.<ref name=69faces/> They moved to Montreal as young children when their parents returned to Canada.<ref name=\"69faces\"/> The group's name came about because the brothers, following a self-described principle of \"style before comfort\", refused to wear hats during Montreal's cold winters, calling themselves \"the men without hats\".<ref name=\"ihistory\"/>\n\nIn addition to the Doroschuks, the group has also included numerous additional members and guest or touring performers, many of whom quickly came and left during the first five years. Frontman and songwriter Ivan Doroschuk was the only constant member, while Stefan and Colin Doroschuk as well as Arrobas remained as relatively steady members through the early 1980s.<ref name=ihistory/>\n\nTheir first recording to be released was the 1980 EP ''[[Folk of the 80's]]''. At this point, the band had changed styles from punk to new wave and officially consisted of Ivan (vocals, bass) and Arrobas (keyboards); also appearing on the EP were auxiliary members Stefan Doroschuk (bass), Roman Martyn (guitars), and Lynne Thibodeau (backing vocals).{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}\n\nShortly after the release of the debut EP, Martyn left and was replaced by Jean-Marc Pisapia, who stayed only a short time before leaving, and later founded [[The Box (band)|The Box]].<ref name=ihistory/> Pisapia was replaced briefly by [[Tracy Howe]], who also left in short order, co-founding [[Rational Youth]] shortly after his departure.<ref name=ihistory/> Howe was replaced by keyboardist Mike Gabriel.<ref name=ihistory/> Arrobas and Gabriel left the group just before the recording of the next album.<ref name=CanRock170/>\n\n===International success===\nIvan and Stefan (now promoted to full membership status) subsequently recruited Allan McCarthy (percussion, electronics) to join the group, and recorded their 1982 full-length debut album ''[[Rhythm of Youth]]''. The trio subsequently enjoyed a hit in Canada with \"[[The Safety Dance]]\", which peaked at No. 11 in May 1983. The song soon charted in the United States, spending four weeks at No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was a major hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at No. 6.<ref name=UKchart/> The song also reached the top ten in various other European countries, and peaked at No. 2 in New Zealand and No. 1 in South Africa, where it was the 11th highest-selling single of 1983.\n\nAdding Colin (who had guested on ''Rhythm of Youth'') as an official fourth member, Men Without Hats released the album ''[[Folk of the 80s (Part III)|Folk of the 80's (Part III)]]'' in 1984. While lead single \"Where Do The Boys Go?\" was a top 40 hit in Canada, the album failed to match the international success of ''Rhythm of Youth''.\n\nIn 1985, the band released the EP ''[[Freeways (EP)|Freeways]]'', consisting of multiple (and multi-lingual) remixes of one of their earliest efforts, Ivan and Arrobas's 1980 song \"Freeways\" (which had previously been released as a B-side in 1982). To support the EP, the group undertook a related tour, footage from which would later (in 2006) be released on DVD as ''[[Live Hats]]''.\n\nReshuffling the line-up again, the band released the album ''[[Pop Goes the World]]'' in 1987 with Ivan, Stefan, and Lenny Pinkas. The song \"[[Pop Goes the World (song)|Pop Goes the World]]\" reached No.&nbsp;20 on the Billboard Hot 100, No.&nbsp;2 on the Canadian Singles Chart, and was No.&nbsp;1 in Austria. The song was later featured in the 1987 film ''[[Date with an Angel]]'', and became the fifteenth biggest selling single in South Africa for 1988.\n\nThe group's next album, ''[[The Adventures of Women & Men Without Hate in the 21st Century]]'', released in 1989, featured a cover of [[ABBA]]'s song \"[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]\". The musicians on the album were essentially the touring band from ''Pop Goes the World'', which included Bruce Murphy on keyboards and guitar, Marika Tjelios on bass, Richard Sampson on drums, and Heidi Garcia on vocals and keyboards.\n\nThe 1991 album ''[[Sideways (Men Without Hats album)|Sideways]]'', dominated by electric guitars instead of keyboards, revealed a dramatically different sound for the band, based in part on Ivan's exposure to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].<ref name=sharp2015/> According to Ivan, \"We had a contractual obligation for one more album with [[Polygram]] so I said to them, we'll take half of the allotted budget if they would allow us to do the record I wanted... so we did this guitar-oriented record but Polygram were horrified. 'Men Without Hats without keyboards aren't going to work,' they claimed and that was the end of the story with Polygram.\"<ref name=sharp2015/> The line-up on the album was Ivan on vocals, F\u00e9lix Matte on lead guitar, John Kastner on rhythm guitar, Stefan on bass, [[Michel Langevin]] on drums and Colin on keyboards.\n\nThe group officially disbanded in 1993,<ref name=\"slaidins\"/> after the career setback of failing to attract another American label as a result of the negative reception to ''Sideways''. The band's final concert was a benefit to support a women's shelter in Montreal,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} with guitarist [[Denis D'Amour]] replacing Matte and Kastner, who both had left the band in 1992.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Projects during the 1990s and 2000s===\nAfter disbanding, lead singer Ivan and keyboardist Bruce Murphy went on to record several demos in 1993 for a concept album tentatively titled ''UFO's are Real'', which was never released.<ref name=presse/> Ivan recorded and released a solo album, ''[[The Spell (Ivan Doroschuk album)|The Spell]]'', in 1997.  Former band member Allan McCarthy died due to AIDS complications in 1995. Under the name MacKenzie-Parker Gang, Stefan and Mack MacKenzie (of the Canadian [[alt-country]] band Three O'Clock Train) released ''Ride for Glory'' (1999), a post-modern Western-themed album.\n\nAfter a ten-year hiatus, ''[[No Hats Beyond This Point]]'' was released in November 2003, returning the band to their early new wave style. In interviews around the time of the release, the band had mentioned a tour to support the release and a box set dedicated to the band's early years, which was to include the ''Folk of the 80's'' and ''Freeways'' EPs, the band's first two albums, a concert that was televised in 1985, unreleased demos and remixes of \"The Safety Dance\". None of this came to fruition, though, and the band split up once again in early 2004. This was the end of Stefan's involvement with Men Without Hats.\n\nColin released two albums with his side solo project \"Centrifugal Force\" [\"Matter\", \"Excerpts from Matter\"] before turning his attention to opera and classical music, first serving as Artistic Director of Montreal's Northern Opera Theatre (85-91) and later as composer-in-residence at British Columbia's Ballet Victoria.<ref name=\"colin\"/> His works include the ballets \"Peter Pan\", \"Alice in Wonderland\", operas \"Medea Metamorphoses\", a opera-dance project with the Victoria Symphony & the Coast-Saalish First Nation dancers \"Heaven\"; A full production of his opera ''[[Evangeline]]'', based on a [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]] poem, was produced by L'Opera de Rimouski in 2014, and was conducted by Doroschuk. <ref name=colin/>\n\nIn 2006, the Trilogie Musique label released a DVD called ''[[Live Hats]]'', featuring a 1985 live concert at Le Spectrum theater in Montreal on August 8, 1985 that had been televised that year. The release was unauthorized by the band, and it was pulled out of print shortly after.\n\n===Reformation in 2010===\nIvan reformed Men Without Hats in 2010 as the frontman and lead vocalist, and was joined by backup musicians that he hired through auditions.<ref name=sonicabuse/> The band debuted on September 24, 2010, at the Rifflandia Music Festival in Victoria, British Columbia, performing ten songs from the Men Without Hats back catalogue. The revived band was described by the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' as \"simply singer Ivan Doroschuk and some hired guns\"<ref name=gross/> and by Stefan as a \"tribute band\".<ref name=stefan/> Despite these initial reactions, the band's \"Dance If You Want Tour\" opened in March 2011 with a well-attended and positively received performance at Austin's [[South by Southwest]] event.<ref name=saxberg/>\n\nIn June 2011, Ivan told a festival audience that the group would record a new studio album, announcing the news at [[North by Northeast]] in Toronto. The album was originally to be titled ''Folk of the 80's (Part IV)'', but in March 2012, the band posted on Facebook that it would instead be called ''[[Love in the Age of War]]'', and would be released that summer.\n\n''Love in the Age of War'', produced by [[Dave Ogilvie]] of [[Skinny Puppy]], was released in June 2012 and received mostly favorable reviews. Ogilvie and Doroschuk set out to faithfully reproduce and update the group's classic synthesizer sound of the 1980s, intentionally making a follow-up album to 1982's ''Rhythm of Youth''.<ref name=rollingstone/> According to Doroschuk, they pretended to be \"working on a 24-track machine, for example, and not the virtual, infinity-plus-one number of tracks that you can get today. We went out and got the old synths that we used back then... the identical instruments, so it wasn't soft synths, it was really real synthesizers.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nBy 2011, Doroschuk had taken on three of his touring musicians as full band members: [[James Love (musician)|James Love]] on guitar and backing vocals, Louise (Lou) Dawson on keyboards and backing vocals, and Mark Olexson on keyboards and backing vocals, all of whom performed on ''Love in the Age of War''.<ref name=\"sharp2015\"/><ref name=\"randynow\"/> Colin Doroschuk also appeared on the album as a vocalist. After the album was recorded, Doroschuk doubled down on the band's synthesizer-heavy sound by replacing Olexson with Vancouver musician Rachel Ashmore, on keyboards and backing vocals, as the group's second synthesist.<ref name=randynow/><ref name=sonicabuse/>\n\nMen Without Hats again toured the United States in 2013, as part of the 1980s-themed \"Regeneration Tour\", with contemporaries such as [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]], [[Andy Bell (singer)|Andy Bell]] of [[Erasure]], and [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]]. The band's continuing activity has included tours in Europe in 2015 and 2016.<ref name=sharp2015/><ref name=murray/>\n\nAs part of a \"Totally '80s\" show that toured Australia in July 2016, Doroschuk performed as Men Without Hats without other band members, \"singing with the house band.... [to] set the stage for a proper visit with the full band\".<ref name=timeout-sydney/> In October 2016, prior to a European tour, Sho Murray replaced Love as guitarist.<ref name=\"murray\"/><ref name=\"jlove\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Men Without Hats discography}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''[[Rhythm of Youth]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Folk of the 80's (Part III)]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Pop Goes the

Their music is characterized by the distinctive [[baritone]] voice of their American-born Canadian lead singer [[Ivan Doroschuk]], as well as their elaborate use of synthesizers and electronic processing. They achieved their greatest popularity in the 1980s with \"[[The Safety Dance]]\", a worldwide Top Ten hit (#3 in the United States) and \"[[Pop Goes the World (song)|Pop Goes the World]]\". After a hiatus for most of the 1990s and 2000s, Doroschuk reformed the band in 2010, and released ''[[Love in the Age of War]]'' (2012). The reformed group, based in [[Vancouver]], has continued to perform, including a European tour in 2015 and Australia in 2016.<ref name=\"timeout-sydney\"/>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early days===\nMen Without Hats was founded in Montreal in 1977, initially as a punk rock band featuring Ivan Doroschuk (vocals), Pete Seabrooke (guitar), Dave Hill (bass), and John Gurrin (drums). In 1980, Doroschuk restarted Men Without Hats, giving the name to a new synthesizer-based electronic group that he formed with J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Arrobas (vocals, keyboards) and his brothers Stefan Doroschuk (bass) and Colin Doroschuk (guitar).<ref name=CanRock128/> Years earlier, while in high school, Arrobas and the Doroschuk brothers had played together in a short-lived band called Wave 21,<ref name=CanRock128/> along with drummer Igor Krichevsky.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe Doroschuk brothers, all three of whom are classically trained musicians, were born in [[Champaign, Illinois]] while their father, a Canadian, was earning a doctoral degree.<ref name=69faces/> They moved to Montreal as young children when their parents returned to Canada.<ref name=\"69faces\"/> The group's name came about because the brothers, following a self-described principle of \"style before comfort,\" refused to wear hats during Montreal's cold winters, calling themselves \"the men without hats.\"<ref name=\"ihistory\"/>\n\nIn addition to the Doroschuks, the group has also included numerous additional members and guest or touring performers, many of whom quickly came and left during the first five years. Frontman and songwriter Ivan Doroschuk was the only constant member, while Stefan and Colin Doroschuk as well as Arrobas remained as relatively steady members through the early 1980s.<ref name=ihistory/>\n\nTheir first recording to be released was the 1980 EP ''[[Folk of the 80's]]''. At this point, the band had changed styles from punk to new wave and officially consisted of Ivan (vocals, bass) and Arrobas (keyboards); also appearing on the EP were auxiliary members Stefan Doroschuk (bass), Roman Martyn (guitars), and Lynne Thibodeau (backing vocals).{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}\n\nShortly after the release of the debut EP, Martyn left and was replaced by Jean-Marc Pisapia, who stayed only a short time before leaving, and later founded [[The Box (band)|The Box]].<ref name=ihistory/> Pisapia was replaced briefly by [[Tracy Howe]], who also left in short order, co-founding [[Rational Youth]] shortly after his departure.<ref name=ihistory/> Howe was replaced by keyboardist Mike Gabriel.<ref name=ihistory/> Arrobas and Gabriel left the group just before the recording of the next album.<ref name=CanRock170/>\n\n===International success===\nIvan and Stefan (now promoted to full membership status) subsequently recruited Allan McCarthy (percussion, electronics) to join the group, and recorded their 1982 full-length debut album ''[[Rhythm of Youth]]''. The trio subsequently enjoyed a hit in Canada with \"[[The Safety Dance]]\", which peaked at No. 11 in May 1983. The song soon charted in the United States, spending four weeks at No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was a major hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at No. 6.<ref name=UKchart/> The song also reached the top ten in various other European countries, and peaked at No. 2 in New Zealand and No. 1 in South Africa, where it was the 11th highest-selling single of 1983.\n\nAdding Colin (who had guested on ''Rhythm of Youth'') as an official fourth member, Men Without Hats released the album ''[[Folk of the 80s (Part III)|Folk of the 80's (Part III)]]'' in 1984. While lead single \"Where Do The Boys Go?\" was a top 40 hit in Canada, the album failed to match the international success of ''Rhythm of Youth''.\n\nIn 1985, the band released the EP ''[[Freeways (EP)|Freeways]]'', consisting of multiple (and multi-lingual) remixes of one of their earliest efforts, Ivan and Arrobas's 1980 song \"Freeways\" (which had previously been released as a B-side in 1982). To support the EP, the group undertook a related tour, footage from which would later (in 2006) be released on DVD as ''[[Live Hats]]''.\n\nReshuffling the line-up again, the band released the album ''[[Pop Goes the World]]'' in 1987 with Ivan, Stefan, and Lenny Pinkas. The song \"[[Pop Goes the World (song)|Pop Goes the World]]\" reached No.&nbsp;20 on the Billboard Hot 100, No.&nbsp;2 on the Canadian Singles Chart, and was No.&nbsp;1 in Austria. The song was later featured in the 1987 film ''[[Date with an Angel]]'', and became the fifteenth biggest selling single in South Africa for 1988.\n\nThe group's next album, ''[[The Adventures of Women & Men Without Hate in the 21st Century]]'', released in 1989, featured a cover of [[ABBA]]'s song \"[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]].\" The musicians on the album were essentially the touring band from ''Pop Goes the World'', which included Bruce Murphy on keyboards and guitar, Marika Tjelios on bass, Richard Sampson on drums, and Heidi Garcia on vocals and keyboards.\n\nThe 1991 album ''[[Sideways (Men Without Hats album)|Sideways]]'', dominated by electric guitars instead of keyboards, revealed a dramatically different sound for the band, based in part on Ivan's exposure to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].<ref name=sharp2015/> According to Ivan, \"We had a contractual obligation for one more album with [[Polygram]] so I said to them, we'll take half of the allotted budget if they would allow us to do the record I wanted... so we did this guitar-oriented record but Polygram were horrified. 'Men Without Hats without keyboards aren't going to work,' they claimed and that was the end of the story with Polygram.\"<ref name=sharp2015/> The line-up on the album was Ivan on vocals, F\u00e9lix Matte on lead guitar, John Kastner on rhythm guitar, Stefan on bass, [[Michel Langevin]] on drums and Colin on keyboards.\n\nThe group officially disbanded in 1993,<ref name=\"slaidins\"/> after the career setback of failing to attract another American label as a result of the negative reception to ''Sideways''. The band's final concert was a benefit to support a women's shelter in Montreal,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} with guitarist [[Denis D'Amour]] replacing Matte and Kastner, who both had left the band in 1992.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Projects during the 1990s and 2000s===\nAfter disbanding, lead singer Ivan and keyboardist Bruce Murphy went on to record several demos in 1993 for a concept album tentatively titled ''UFO's are Real'', which was never released.<ref name=presse/> Ivan recorded and released a solo album, ''[[The Spell (Ivan Doroschuk album)|The Spell]]'', in 1997.  Former band member Allan McCarthy died due to AIDS complications in 1995. Under the name MacKenzie-Parker Gang, Stefan and Mack MacKenzie (of the Canadian [[alt-country]] band Three O'Clock Train) released ''Ride for Glory'' (1999), a post-modern Western-themed album.\n\nAfter a ten-year hiatus, ''[[No Hats Beyond This Point]]'' was released in November 2003, returning the band to their early new wave style. In interviews around the time of the release, the band had mentioned a tour to support the release and a box set dedicated to the band's early years, which was to include the ''Folk of the 80's'' and ''Freeways'' EPs, the band's first two albums, a concert that was televised in 1985, unreleased demos and remixes of \"The Safety Dance\". None of this came to fruition, though, and the band split up once again in early 2004. This was the end of Stefan's involvement with Men Without Hats.\n\nColin released two albums with his side solo project \"Centrifugal Force\" [\"Matter\", \"Excerpts from Matter\"] before turning his attention to opera and classical music, first serving as Artistic Director of Montreal's Northern Opera Theatre (85-91) and later as composer-in-residence at British Columbia's Ballet Victoria.<ref name=\"colin\"/> His works include the ballets \"Peter Pan\", \"Alice in Wonderland\", operas \"Medea Metamorphoses\", a opera-dance project with the Victoria Symphony & the Coast-Saalish First Nation dancers \"Heaven\"; A full production of his opera ''[[Evangeline]]'', based on a [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]] poem, was produced by L'Opera de Rimouski in 2014, and was conducted by Doroschuk. <ref name=colin/>\n\nIn 2006, the Trilogie Musique label released a DVD called ''[[Live Hats]]'', featuring a 1985 live concert at Le Spectrum theater in Montreal on August 8, 1985 that had been televised that year. The release was unauthorized by the band, and it was pulled out of print shortly after.\n\n===Reformation in 2010===\nIvan reformed Men Without Hats in 2010 as the frontman and lead vocalist, and was joined by backup musicians that he hired through auditions.<ref name=sonicabuse/> The band debuted on September 24, 2010, at the Rifflandia Music Festival in Victoria, British Columbia, performing ten songs from the Men Without Hats back catalogue. The revived band was described by the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' as \"simply singer Ivan Doroschuk and some hired guns\"<ref name=gross/> and by Stefan as a \"tribute band.\"<ref name=stefan/> Despite these initial reactions, the band's \"Dance If You Want Tour\" opened in March 2011 with a well-attended and positively received performance at Austin's [[South by Southwest]] event.<ref name=saxberg/>\n\nIn June 2011, Ivan told a festival audience that the group would record a new studio album, announcing the news at [[North by Northeast]] in Toronto. The album was originally to be titled ''Folk of the 80's (Part IV)'', but in March 2012, the band posted on Facebook that it would instead be called ''[[Love in the Age of War]]'', and would be released that summer.\n\n''Love in the Age of War'', produced by [[Dave Ogilvie]] of [[Skinny Puppy]], was released in June 2012 and received mostly favorable reviews. Ogilvie and Doroschuk set out to faithfully reproduce and update the group's classic synthesizer sound of the 1980s, intentionally making a follow-up album to 1982's ''Rhythm of Youth''.<ref name=rollingstone/> According to Doroschuk, they pretended to be \"working on a 24-track machine, for example, and not the virtual, infinity-plus-one number of tracks that you can get today. We went out and got the old synths that we used back then... the identical instruments, so it wasn't soft synths, it was really real synthesizers.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nBy 2011, Doroschuk had taken on three of his touring musicians as full band members: [[James Love (musician)|James Love]] on guitar and backing vocals, Louise (Lou) Dawson on keyboards and backing vocals, and Mark Olexson on keyboards and backing vocals, all of whom performed on ''Love in the Age of War''.<ref name=\"sharp2015\"/><ref name=\"randynow\"/> Colin Doroschuk also appeared on the album as a vocalist. After the album was recorded, Doroschuk doubled down on the band's synthesizer-heavy sound by replacing Olexson with Vancouver musician Rachel Ashmore, on keyboards and backing vocals, as the group's second synthesist.<ref name=randynow/><ref name=sonicabuse/>\n\nMen Without Hats again toured the United States in 2013, as part of the 1980s-themed \"Regeneration Tour,\" with contemporaries such as [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]], [[Andy Bell (singer)|Andy Bell]] of [[Erasure]], and [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]]. The band's continuing activity has included tours in Europe in 2015 and 2016.<ref name=sharp2015/><ref name=murray/>\n\nAs part of a \"Totally '80s\" show that toured Australia in July 2016, Doroschuk performed as Men Without Hats without other band members, \"singing with the house band.... [to] set the stage for a proper visit with the full band.\"<ref name=timeout-sydney/> In October 2016, prior to a European tour, Sho Murray replaced Love as guitarist.<ref name=\"murray\"/><ref

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

At that time the 1 ABG was composed by 25 officers and 4 enlisted personnel.\n* 1970: Brig Gen Mihel Ghilormini, PRANG, was commissioned by Brig Gen Vargas to command the 1 ABG. \n* 1982, Col Roberto Montes, PRANG, Commander of the PRANG, started a recruiting effort to manned the PR Air State Guard cadre organization in support of the 156 TFG.\n* 1986: Col(Ret) Miguel Martoranni, PRANG, former Air Force pilot, became the commander of the 1 ABG.\n* 1988: Col(Ret) Dennis L\u00f3pez, PRANG, former 156 TFG Commander, commanded the 1 ABG.\n* 1992: Col John J. Gonzalez, PRASG,  was named commander of 1 ABG. He had prior service with the US Navy and US Air Force.\n* 2004: Col Orlando Olivera, PRASG, was named 1 ABG commander.  Col Olivera served in the US Army Reserve. \n* 2010: Col Jos\u00e9 E. Pic\u00f3-Del Rosario, PRASG,  was named 1 ABG commander by BG(PR) Hector Sorrentini.\n* 2015: [[Col Jesus E. (Nesty) Delgado-Morales]], PRASG, was named 1 ABG commander by BG(PR) Carlos M. Martinez.\n* 2019: LtCol. Angel E. Resto, PRASG, was named 1 ABG commander by BG(PR) Edwin I. Rivera-Malave.\n* 2019: LtCol. Edwin Ramos-Jourdan, PRASG, was named 1st Air Support Group Commander by BG(PR) Ricardo Falcon.\n\n== 21st century ==\nAlong with Texas, California and New York, the [[Puerto Rico State Command]] is one of the few SDFs that has an air division that embrace the Air Force culture.  The 1st Air Support Group, located at [[Mu\u00f1iz Air National Guard Base]], is an excellent example of integration and teamwork with the PRANG units, especially with the current [[156th Wing]].\n\n[[File:Visit MG Neal 1.jpg|thumb|Visit MG Neal 2]] [[File:156AW PHOTO 2016.jpg|thumb|156AW Photo 2016]]\n\nThe 1st Air Support Group is composed of:\n* Headquarters Squadron (Unit 700)\n**Command & Special Staff\n**Personnel Section\n**Operations & Training Section\n* Logistic Squadron (Unit 701) \n**Transportation Flight\n**Supply Flight\n**Aerial Port Flight \n* Medical Squadron (Unit 702) \n* Mission Support Squadron (Unit 703)\n**Civil Engineering Flight\n**Force Support (Services & FSRT) Flight\n**Security Forces Flight\n**Fire Fighter Flight\n**741st Support Flight\n**740th Support Flight\n\nThe 1ASG have two support flights to provide support to the [[140th Air Defense Squadron]] in Punta Salinas and the [[141st Air Control Squadron]] in Punta Borinqu\u00e9n [[Aguadilla]]. All 1st Air Support Group units are organized to meet the military training requirements necessary to take over the Puerto Rico Air National Guard installations upon mobilization and deployment of their units. [[File:741ST SECURITY FORCES WORKING ON MAIN GATE 141ACS.jpg|thumb|741st Security Forces working on Main Gate 141ACS]]\n\nThe 1st Air Support Group training is conducted in accordance with USAF regulations, which supplements the PRSG and PRNG regulations, directives and guidance. Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs) are performed jointly with PRANG's 156th AW in a consolidated drill concept. These trainings are performed jointly with 156th AW personnel. It allows 1ASG personnel to acquire hands-on experience of what their duty will be if PRANG units are mobilize and deployed.  It also gives them the opportunity to be trained by their counterpart in their specialty and get the feeling of a real life scenario, while getting ready for it. These drills are performed concurrently with 156th AW UTA schedule.\n\nAll 1st Air Support Group units and members attend consolidated drills. This form of UTA's is used to:\n* Maintain lines of communication among all units\n* Conduct general military training and OJT with the Puerto Rico Air National Guard counterparts\n* Conduct Emergency Management training under the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) Guidelines and the SGAUS's [[Military Emergency Management Specialist]] Academy\n* Conduct promotion and award ceremonies and other special events\n* General inspections\n* Practice drills and ceremonies\n* Maintain Unit Integrity\n[[File:BG Carlos M Martinez meetng with Col Edward L.

Unlike the Civil Air Patrol or the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the PRSG is a statutory military entity of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with each PRSG member subject to the Puerto Rico Code of Military Justice (Law 62). Under state law, enlisted members and officers of the PRSG have the same similar legal status, privileges, and/or immunities as members of the state National Guard (in state status) when called to State Active Duty (SAD) or in drill status.\n\nAs a state organized militia, the PRSG ranks are official state military ranks in accordance with the Article 1, Section 8, Clause 16 of the United States Constitution were the US Congress received the power \u201cto provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress\u201d.  All PRSG appointments, commissions, warrants, and enlistments are recognized and authorized by the Governor of Puerto Rico through the Adjutant General of PR.  The PRSG military personnel render to all members of the military community, and receive from them, all courtesies common to all such members, such as saluting, and forms of address.\n\nAs a historic milestone for our Unit, From August 13 to 17, 2016, a selected group of nine 1st Air Base Group Civil Engineering Flight traveled and participated in a DFT Mission in support to the US Virgin Island National Guard. During the mission our airmen performed rehabilitation and maintenance task at the USVING Joint Forces Headquarters. The group was excellently led by 1st Lt Alexander De Jesus, 1ABG CEF Commander. They were received, greeted and their outstanding performance was recognized by the USVI TAG, BG (VI) Deborah Howell and her Senior Staff.\n\n== Uniform ==\n\n[[File:1ABG Security Forces Badge.GIF|thumb|1ABG Security Forces Badge]]\n[[File:1ABG Security Forces Patch.jpg|thumb|right|1ABG Security Forces ABU Patch]]\nAs approved by the Puerto Rico Adjutant General, the military uniforms worn by the 1st Support Base Group personnel are a variation of the U.S. Air Force's [[Airman Battle Uniform]], the USAF's Service Dress Uniform and the USAF's Mess Dress. 1st Air Base Group members must use the PRSG AIR FORCE distinctive marking on those authorized uniforms. All units commanders will ensure that all members, individually and collectively, present a professional, well-groomed appearance, which will reflect credit upon PRSG Air Force as the State Command of the Puerto Rico National Guard. The following Military and USAF Style Specialty Badges are authorized to professional members of the 1st Air Base Group:\n* [[Military Emergency Management Specialist]] (Basic, Senior or Master)\n* Civil Engineering Badge (Basic, Senior or Master)\n* Medical Corps Badge (Basic, Senior or Master)\n* Dental Corps Badge (Basic, Senior or Master)\n[[File:1ABG Security Forces Flash.GIF|thumb|1ABG Security Forces Flash]]\n* Nurse Corps Badge (Basic, Senior or Master)\n* Chaplain (Christian) Badge \n* Judge Advocate Badge\n* Security Forces Badge & Flash\n* Fire Fighter Badge\n\n[[File:1ABG FireFighters Badge.GIF|thumb|1ABG Fire Fighters Badge]]\n\nAs a regulation governing the use of those Specialty Badges, the 1ABG published the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) Policy Manual. The CFETP provides information for the Civil Engineer, Medical Corps, Dental Corps, Nurse Corps, Chaplain, Judge Advocate, Emergency Managers, Security Forces and Fire Protection occupational series. That plan outlines desired training, education, and experience to chart and execute a career in those career fields\u2014from entry-level officer/NCO through squadron commander. The CFETP also provides officers, supervisors, and commanders a means to jointly plan and program training and education opportunities. Each officer and NCO should use The CFETP to work with supervisors and commanders to determine appropriate levels and timing of education and training, and ensure they have every opportunity to attend continual education courses. Every officer or NCO should take the initiative to determine realistic milestones for achieving their goals. Completion of education, training, and experience is a joint responsibility between the officer, their supervisor, and the commander.\n\n== Training ==\n\n[[File:PRNG LOGOS.png|thumb|Puerto Rico National Guard Logos]]\nIn January 2014, the 1st Air Base Group published the 1ABG Airman Manual establishing military standards, qualifications, and as a mean to verify readiness. This manual has been created to assist 1ABG airmen in their military career. It is intended to provide quick guidance to the customs, courtesies, and basic knowledge of the United States Air Force (USAF) and life in the PRSG Air Force. Whether the member have prior military experience, or no military experience, this guide sets forth the basic military principles and policies required of an airman.\n\nThe contents of this publication are a compilation of materials from military manuals and guides and is designed to serve as a guide to all members of the 1st Air Support Group-Puerto Rico Air State Command.  This manual is intended to be used as an orientation resource for new members and a reference document for all personnel.\n\nThe 1ABG Airman Manual includes the following chapters:\n* PRSG History, Legal Definition & Capabilities\n* PRNG & USAF History\n* 1ABG History & Organization\n* Military Uniforms & Ranks\n* Customs, Courtesies & Protocols\n* Drill & Ceremonies\n* Airman's Basic Skills\n* Military Emergency Management \n* Annexes:\n** PRSG Regulations 600-100 (Officers Program Regulation)\n** PRSG Regulations 600-200 (Enlisted & NCO Program Regulation)\n** PRSG 1ABG Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) Policy Manual \n** National Guard Bureau Regulation 10-4\n\nAlso, all 1st Air Support Group personnel participate in other Professional Military Education specialized and general training:\n* Basic Military Training (Non Prior Service Leadership Course)\n* Basic and Advanced Non Commissioned Officer Training (Basic NCO Leaders Course, Advance NCO Leaders Course, and First Sergeant School)\n* Basic and Advanced Officer Training (Squadron Officer Course, Basic Officer Leaders Course & Advance Officer Leaders Course, Command & Staff Course)\n* Basic Military Marksmanship Course\n* Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) given in concert with FEMA/DHS \n* [[Military Emergency Management Specialist]] (MEMS) Certification\n\nDuring Training Year 2010-2011 the 1st Air Base Group participated as a Unit in the [[Military Emergency Management Specialist]] (MEMS) Program.  The Military Emergency Management Specialist (MEMS) Academy was established by the [[State Guard Association of the United States]], Inc. (SGAUS) in 1998 to promote and advance the practice of emergency management among the various State Defense Forces or State Military Reserves.  The program is structured around the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]'s [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS) and [[Incident Command System]] (ICS).\n\nThe 1ABG certified the 90% of their personnel as MEMS Basic and NIMS Compliance, being the first and only State Defense Force Unit in the Nation to achieve that goal.\n\nWith the support of the PRSG MEMS Academy staff & instructors, the 1ABG completed the following FEMA-[[Emergency Management Institute]] classroom courses:\n\n* IS100 Introduction to Incident Command System \n* IS200 Basic Incident Command System \n* IS700 National Incident Management System \n* IS800b National Response Framework \n* IS775 Emergency Operations Center \n* IS208 State Disaster Management \n* Q534 Emergency Response to Terrorism\n\nAlso as a Group, as a requirement for the Basic MEMS Certification, they completed a Point of Distribution Exercise planned under Incident Command principles at Puerto Rico National Guard's [[Camp Santiago]] Joint Maneuvering Training Site, Salinas, PR.\n\n[[File:POD FULL SCALE EX 2014.jpg|thumb|POD FULL SCALE EX 2014]]\n\n[[File:POD FULL SCALE EX 2014 GROUP.jpg|thumb|POD FULL SCALE EX 2014 GROUP PIC]]\n\nOn 2016, the 1st ABG, in a joint effort with the 156AW Security Forces Squadron, implemented the Security Forces Basic Orientation Course (SFBOC) for Air State Guard Personnel. The course serves as an introduction of Security Forces concepts of operations. It will also direct their knowledge toward the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard security forces culture. It will give all these personnel the basic necessary knowledge to support the PRANG Mission.

[[Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced]]\n}}\nThe '''1st Air Support Group of the Puerto Rico State Command''' ('''1ASG-PRSG''') \u2014 is the main unit of the Air State Command of the Military Forces of Puerto Rico that operates under the sole authority of the [[governor of Puerto Rico]] who, in turn, delegates such authority to the [[Puerto Rico Adjutant General]] and to the Commanding General of the [[Puerto Rico State Command]].\n\n== History ==\n\n* In 1970, Brig Gen Roberto Vargas, PRANG, Commander of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard (PRANG), and Mrs. Carmen Colbert organized the 1st Air Base Group with a similar structure to that of the then-156th Tactical Fighter Group's units. At that time the 1 ABG was composed by 25 officers and 4 enlisted personnel.\n* 1970: Brig Gen Mihel Ghilormini, PRANG, was commissioned by Brig Gen Vargas to command the 1 ABG. \n* 1982, Col Roberto Montes, PRANG, Commander of the PRANG, started a recruiting effort to manned the PR Air State Guard cadre organization in support of the 156 TFG.\n* 1986: Col(Ret) Miguel Martoranni, PRANG, former Air Force pilot, became the commander of the 1 ABG.\n* 1988: Col(Ret) Dennis L\u00f3pez, PRANG, former 156 TFG Commander, commanded the 1 ABG.\n* 1992: Col John J. Gonzalez, PRASG,  was named commander of 1 ABG. He had prior service with the US Navy and US Air Force.\n* 2004: Col Orlando Olivera, PRASG, was named 1 ABG commander.  Col Olivera served in the US Army Reserve. \n* 2010: Col Jos\u00e9 E. Pic\u00f3-Del Rosario, PRASG,  was named 1 ABG commander by BG(PR) Hector Sorrentini.\n* 2015: [[Col Jesus E. (Nesty) Delgado-Morales]], PRASG, was named 1 ABG commander by BG(PR) Carlos M. Martinez.\n* 2019: LtCol. Angel E. Resto, PRASG, was named 1 ABG commander by BG(PR) Edwin I. Rivera-Malave.\n* 2019: LtCol. Edwin Ramos-Jourdan, PRASG, was named 1st Air Support Group Commander by BG(PR) Ricardo Falcon.\n\n== 21st century ==\nAlong with Texas, California and New York, the [[Puerto Rico State Command]] is one of the few SDFs that has an air division that embrace the Air Force culture.  The 1st Air Support Group, located at [[Mu\u00f1iz Air National Guard Base]], is an excellent example of integration and teamwork with the PRANG units, especially with the current [[156th Wing]].\n\n[[File:Visit MG Neal 1.jpg|thumb|Visit MG Neal 2]] [[File:156AW PHOTO 2016.jpg|thumb|156AW Photo 2016]]\n\nThe 1st Air Support Group is composed of:\n* Headquarters Squadron (Unit 700)\n**Command & Special Staff\n**Personnel Section\n**Operations & Training Section\n* Logistic Squadron (Unit 701) \n**Transportation Flight\n**Supply Flight\n**Aerial Port Flight \n* Medical Squadron (Unit 702) \n* Mission Support Squadron (Unit 703)\n**Civil Engineering Flight\n**Force Support (Services & FSRT) Flight\n**Security Forces Flight\n**Fire Fighter Flight\n**741st Support Flight\n**740th Support Flight\n\nThe 1ASG have two support flights to provide support to the [[140th Air Defense Squadron]] in Punta Salinas and the [[141st Air Control Squadron]] in Punta Borinqu\u00e9n [[Aguadilla]]. All 1st Air Support Group units are organized to meet the military training requirements necessary to take over the Puerto Rico Air National Guard installations upon mobilization and deployment of their units. [[File:741ST SECURITY FORCES WORKING ON MAIN GATE 141ACS.jpg|thumb|741st Security Forces working on Main Gate 141ACS]]\n\nThe 1st Air Support Group training is conducted in accordance with USAF regulations, which supplements the PRSG and PRNG regulations, directives and guidance. Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs) are performed jointly with PRANG's 156th AW in a consolidated drill concept. These trainings are performed jointly with 156th AW personnel. It allows 1ASG personnel to acquire hands-on experience of what their duty will be if PRANG units are mobilize and deployed.  It also gives them the opportunity to be trained by their counterpart in their specialty and get the feeling of a real life scenario, while getting ready for it. These drills are performed concurrently with 156th AW UTA schedule.\n\nAll 1st Air Support Group units and members attend consolidated drills. This form of UTA's is used to:\n* Maintain lines of communication among all units\n* Conduct general military training and OJT with the Puerto Rico Air National Guard counterparts\n* Conduct Emergency Management training under the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) Guidelines and the SGAUS's [[Military Emergency Management Specialist]] Academy\n* Conduct promotion and award ceremonies and other special events\n* General inspections\n* Practice drills and ceremonies\n* Maintain Unit Integrity\n[[File:BG Carlos M Martinez meetng with Col Edward L.

Unlike the Civil Air Patrol or the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the PRSG is a statutory military entity of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with each PRSG member subject to the Puerto Rico Code of Military Justice (Law 62). Under state law, enlisted members and officers of the PRSG have the same similar legal status, privileges, and/or immunities as members of the state National Guard (in state status) when called to State Active Duty (SAD) or in drill status.\n\nAs a state organized militia, the PRSG ranks are official state military ranks in accordance with the Article 1, Section 8, Clause 16 of the United States Constitution were the US Congress received the power \u201cto provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress\u201d.  All PRSG appointments, commissions, warrants, and enlistments are recognized and authorized by the Governor of Puerto Rico through the Adjutant General of PR.  The PRSG military personnel render to all members of the military community, and receive from them, all courtesies common to all such members, such as saluting, and forms of address.\n\nAs a historic milestone for our Unit, From August 13 to 17, 2016, a selected group of nine 1st Air Base Group Civil Engineering Flight traveled and participated in a DFT Mission in support to the US Virgin Island National Guard. During the mission our airmen performed rehabilitation and maintenance task at the USVING Joint Forces Headquarters. The group was excellently led by 1st Lt Alexander De Jesus, 1ABG CEF Commander. They were received, greeted and their outstanding performance was recognized by the USVI TAG, BG (VI) Deborah Howell and her Senior Staff.\n\n== Uniform ==\n\n[[File:1ABG Security Forces Badge.GIF|thumb|1ABG Security Forces Badge]]\n[[File:1ABG Security Forces Patch.jpg|thumb|right|1ABG Security Forces ABU Patch]]\nAs approved by the Puerto Rico Adjutant General, the military uniforms worn by the 1st Support Base Group personnel are a variation of the U.S. Air Force's [[Airman Battle Uniform]], the USAF's Service Dress Uniform and the USAF's Mess Dress. 1st Air Base Group members must use the PRSG AIR FORCE distinctive marking on those authorized uniforms. All units commanders will ensure that all members, individually and collectively, present a professional, well-groomed appearance, which will reflect credit upon PRSG Air Force as the State Command of the Puerto Rico National Guard. The following Military and USAF Style Specialty Badges are authorized to professional members of the 1st Air Base Group:\n* [[Military Emergency Management Specialist]] (Basic, Senior or Master)\n* Civil Engineering Badge (Basic, Senior or Master)\n* Medical Corps Badge (Basic, Senior or Master)\n* Dental Corps Badge (Basic, Senior or Master)\n[[File:1ABG Security Forces Flash.GIF|thumb|1ABG Security Forces Flash]]\n* Nurse Corps Badge (Basic, Senior or Master)\n* Chaplain (Christian) Badge \n* Judge Advocate Badge\n* Security Forces Badge & Flash\n* Fire Fighter Badge\n\n[[File:1ABG FireFighters Badge.GIF|thumb|1ABG Fire Fighters Badge]]\n\nAs a regulation governing the use of those Specialty Badges, the 1ABG published the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) Policy Manual. The CFETP provides information for the Civil Engineer, Medical Corps, Dental Corps, Nurse Corps, Chaplain, Judge Advocate, Emergency Managers, Security Forces and Fire Protection occupational series. That plan outlines desired training, education, and experience to chart and execute a career in those career fields\u2014from entry-level officer/NCO through squadron commander. The CFETP also provides officers, supervisors, and commanders a means to jointly plan and program training and education opportunities. Each officer and NCO should use The CFETP to work with supervisors and commanders to determine appropriate levels and timing of education and training, and ensure they have every opportunity to attend continual education courses. Every officer or NCO should take the initiative to determine realistic milestones for achieving their goals. Completion of education, training, and experience is a joint responsibility between the officer, their supervisor, and the commander.\n\n== Training ==\n\n[[File:PRNG LOGOS.png|thumb|Puerto Rico National Guard Logos]]\nIn January 2014, the 1st Air Base Group published the 1ABG Airman Manual establishing military standards, qualifications, and as a mean to verify readiness. This manual has been created to assist 1ABG airmen in their military career. It is intended to provide quick guidance to the customs, courtesies, and basic knowledge of the United States Air Force (USAF) and life in the PRSG Air Force. Whether the member have prior military experience, or no military experience, this guide sets forth the basic military principles and policies required of an airman.\n\nThe contents of this publication are a compilation of materials from military manuals and guides and is designed to serve as a guide to all members of the 1st Air Support Group-Puerto Rico Air State Command.  This manual is intended to be used as an orientation resource for new members and a reference document for all personnel.\n\nThe 1ABG Airman Manual includes the following chapters:\n* PRSG History, Legal Definition & Capabilities\n* PRNG & USAF History\n* 1ABG History & Organization\n* Military Uniforms & Ranks\n* Customs, Courtesies & Protocols\n* Drill & Ceremonies\n* Airman's Basic Skills\n* Military Emergency Management \n* Annexes:\n** PRSG Regulations 600-100 (Officers Program Regulation)\n** PRSG Regulations 600-200 (Enlisted & NCO Program Regulation)\n** PRSG 1ABG Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) Policy Manual \n** National Guard Bureau Regulation 10-4\n\nAlso, all 1st Air Support Group personnel participate in other Professional Military Education specialized and general training:\n* Basic Military Training (Non Prior Service Leadership Course)\n* Basic and Advanced Non Commissioned Officer Training (Basic NCO Leaders Course, Advance NCO Leaders Course, and First Sergeant School)\n* Basic and Advanced Officer Training (Squadron Officer Course, Basic Officer Leaders Course & Advance Officer Leaders Course, Command & Staff Course)\n* Basic Military Marksmanship Course\n* Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) given in concert with FEMA/DHS \n* [[Military Emergency Management Specialist]] (MEMS) Certification\n\nDuring Training Year 2010-2011 the 1st Air Base Group participated as a Unit in the [[Military Emergency Management Specialist]] (MEMS) Program.  The Military Emergency Management Specialist (MEMS) Academy was established by the [[State Guard Association of the United States]], Inc. (SGAUS) in 1998 to promote and advance the practice of emergency management among the various State Defense Forces or State Military Reserves.  The program is structured around the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]'s [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS) and [[Incident Command System]] (ICS).\n\nThe 1ABG certified the 90% of their personnel as MEMS Basic and NIMS Compliance, being the first and only State Defense Force Unit in the Nation to achieve that goal.\n\nWith the support of the PRSG MEMS Academy staff & instructors, the 1ABG completed the following FEMA-[[Emergency Management Institute]] classroom courses:\n\n* IS100 Introduction to Incident Command System \n* IS200 Basic Incident Command System \n* IS700 National Incident Management System \n* IS800b National Response Framework \n* IS775 Emergency Operations Center \n* IS208 State Disaster Management \n* Q534 Emergency Response to Terrorism\n\nAlso as a Group, as a requirement for the Basic MEMS Certification, they completed a Point of Distribution Exercise planned under Incident Command principles at Puerto Rico National Guard's [[Camp Santiago]] Joint Maneuvering Training Site, Salinas, PR.\n\n[[File:POD FULL SCALE EX 2014.jpg|thumb|POD FULL SCALE EX 2014]]\n\n[[File:POD FULL SCALE EX 2014 GROUP.jpg|thumb|POD FULL SCALE EX 2014 GROUP PIC]]\n\nOn 2016, the 1st ABG, in a joint effort with the 156AW Security Forces Squadron, implemented the Security Forces Basic Orientation Course (SFBOC) for Air State Guard Personnel. The course serves as an introduction of Security Forces concepts of operations. It will also direct their knowledge toward the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard security forces culture. It will give all these personnel the basic necessary knowledge to support the PRANG Mission. The participants completed 73 contact hours of Professional Military Education including the following topics: Security Forces Concepts of Operations, Military Law and Jurisdiction, Authority, Communications, Counter Bloodborne & Pathogens, Reports, Challenge (Foot & Vehicle), Handcuffing, Individual, Areas & Vehicles Searches, ASP Baton, Individual & Small Team Tactics, Entry Control Procedures, AF Form 1109, AF Form 52, Sec Forces Combative, Arming & Use of Force, Rules of Engagement.\n\n== Meritorious Unit Citation awarded by the State Guard Association of USA ==  \n[[File:1ABG SGAUS MUC.jpg|thumb|SGAUS Meritorious Unit Citation]]\nOn May 1, 2016, the 1ABG received the Meritorious Unit Citation awarded to the 1st Air Base Group-Puerto Rico Air State Guard by the [[State Guard Association of the United States]].
