In the 4th century BC, the Greek tyrant of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Dionysius the Elder]], founded the colony ''Issa'' on the island.<ref>''An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis'': An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation by Mogens Herman Hansen, 2005, Index</ref><ref>''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites'' (eds. Richard Stillwell, William L. MacDonald, Marian Holland McAllister), ISSA (Vis) Croatia. A town on an island of the same name in the central Adriatic. It was settled by [[Illyrians]], who were under the domination of Liburni from the 8th to the 6th centuries B.C. At the beginning of the 4th century B.C. it was colonized by Syracusan Greeks as part of a plan of Dionysios the Elder to control the Adriatic. During the 3rd century Issa founded the emporia [[Tragurion]] (Tra\u00f9, now Trogir) and Epetion (Stobre\u010d) on the Illynan mainland. Its predominance in the region lasted until the first [[First Illyrian War|Illyro-Roman war]] 229-219 B.C. when it became a pawn in the battles of greater powers. In the civil war it sided with [[Pompey]] and consequently lost its privileges and autonomy in 47 B.C. when it was reduced to the rank of an oppidum civium Romanorum and was dependent on the newly founded colony at [[Salona]]. As a polis Issa minted its own money, and these coins of many types had wide circulation. The town, situated on a slope on the W side of a large bay, was defended by strong [[Hellenistic]] walls, still visible in an irregular quadrangle (265 x 360 m) that enclosed an area of 9.8 ha. The street grid and foundations of houses have been found. The necropolis has yielded many pieces of pottery, including some from S Italy. The wall of the cavea of the theater, built in the Roman period, is incorporated into the present Franciscan Monastery. It could seat about 3000 persons. Inscriptions, statues, coins, and pottery are preserved in the archaeological museums at Split and Zagreb.</ref> Later, it became an independent [[polis]], and even minted its own money and founded its own colonies, the most notable of which was [[Asp\u00e1lathos]] (the modern-day city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]]). \n\nIn the 1st century BC, the island was held by the [[Liburnians]].<ref>Wilkes, J. J. ''The Illyrians'', 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, p. 183, \"... We may begin with the Venetic peoples, Veneti, Carni, Histri and Liburni, whose language set them apart from the rest of the Illyrians. ...\"</ref> Its importance in the region ended with the first Illyro-Roman war (29\u2013219 BC). Having sided with Pompeus during the period of civil struggles in Rome, became an \"oppidum civium Romanorum\" in 47 BC.\n\nUntil 1797, the island was under the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]]. During this time large settlements developed along the coastline (Comisa (now Komi\u017ea) and Lissa (now Vis)). Administratively, the island of Lissa was for centuries bound to the island of Lesina, now named [[Hvar]]. The Venetian influence is still recognizable in architecture found on the island, and some vocabulary of the Croatian dialect spoken locally is [[Venetian language|Venetian]] in origin.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nAfter the short-lived Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], with Italian as the official language, the island was ruled by the [[Austrian Empire]] from 1814. It maintained its Italian name of Lissa. After the end of [[World War I]], it was under Italian rule again in the period from 1918 to 1921, according to the provisions of the [[Treaty of London (1915)|1915 Treaty of London]], before it was ceded to [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] as part of the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|1920 Treaty of Rapallo]].\n\nThe sea to the north of the island was the location of two battles:\n*on 13 March 1811, a small [[Royal Navy]] squadron under the command of Captain [[William Hoste]], defeated a larger French squadron in the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)]]\n*on 20 July 1866, the smaller Austrian fleet, under [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff|Admiral Tegetthoff]], attacked the [[Regia Marina|Italian fleet]], under [[Carlo Pellion di Persano|Admiral Persano]], defeating the larger Italian force and sinking the {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2|up=y}} in the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)]].\n\n===Second World War===\nVis was at one point the site of the general headquarters of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], the leader of the Yugoslav [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] resistance movement. It was occupied by Italy between 1941 and 1943, then was liberated by the Partisans and held by a British flotilla in 1943\u201344. At the end of World War II the island returned to Yugoslavia. During the war the island was mined. Allied fighter planes were based at a small airfield that was also used for emergency landings of Allied bombers, including an American [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]] flown by [[George McGovern]]. [[No. 6 Squadron RAF]] extensively used the airfield as a forward operating base, flying [[Hawker Hurricane]] Mk IV fighter aircraft, from May 1944 to February 1945.<ref>Jefford, C.G.

In the 4th century BC, the Greek tyrant of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Dionysius the Elder]], founded the colony ''Issa'' on the island.<ref>''An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis'': An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation by Mogens Herman Hansen, 2005, Index</ref><ref>''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites'' (eds. Richard Stillwell, William L. MacDonald, Marian Holland McAllister), ISSA (Vis) Croatia. A town on an island of the same name in the central Adriatic. It was settled by [[Illyrians]], who were under the domination of Liburni from the 8th to the 6th centuries B.C. At the beginning of the 4th century B.C. it was colonized by Syracusan Greeks as part of a plan of Dionysios the Elder to control the Adriatic. During the 3rd century Issa founded the emporia [[Tragurion]] (Tra\u00f9, now Trogir) and Epetion (Stobre\u010d) on the Illynan mainland. Its predominance in the region lasted until the first [[First Illyrian War|Illyro-Roman war]] 229-219 B.C. when it became a pawn in the battles of greater powers. In the civil war it sided with [[Pompey]] and consequently lost its privileges and autonomy in 47 B.C. when it was reduced to the rank of an oppidum civium Romanorum and was dependent on the newly founded colony at [[Salona]]. As a polis Issa minted its own money, and these coins of many types had wide circulation. The town, situated on a slope on the W side of a large bay, was defended by strong [[Hellenistic]] walls, still visible in an irregular quadrangle (265 x 360 m) that enclosed an area of 9.8 ha. The street grid and foundations of houses have been found. The necropolis has yielded many pieces of pottery, including some from S Italy. The wall of the cavea of the theater, built in the Roman period, is incorporated into the present Franciscan Monastery. It could seat about 3000 persons. Inscriptions, statues, coins, and pottery are preserved in the archaeological museums at Split and Zagreb.</ref> Later, it became an independent [[polis]], and even minted its own money and founded its own colonies, the most notable of which was [[Asp\u00e1lathos]] (the modern-day city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]]). \n\nIn the 1st century BC, the island was held by the [[Liburnians]].<ref>Wilkes, J. J. ''The Illyrians'', 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, p. 183, \"... We may begin with the Venetic peoples, Veneti, Carni, Histri and Liburni, whose language set them apart from the rest of the Illyrians. ...\"</ref> Its importance in the region ended with the first Illyro-Roman war (29\u2013219 BC). Having sided with Pompeus during the period of civil struggles in Rome, became an \"oppidum civium Romanorum\" in 47 BC.\n\nUntil 1797, the island was under the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]]. During this time large settlements developed along the coastline (Comisa (now Komi\u017ea) and Lissa (now Vis)). Administratively, the island of Lissa was for centuries bound to the island of Lesina, now named [[Hvar]]. The Venetian influence is still recognizable in architecture found on the island, and some vocabulary of the Croatian dialect spoken locally is [[Venetian language|Venetian]] in origin.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nAfter the short-lived Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], with Italian as the official language, the island was ruled by the [[Austrian Empire]] from 1814. It maintained its Italian name of Lissa. After the end of [[World War I]], it was under Italian rule again in the period from 1918 to 1921, according to the provisions of the [[Treaty of London (1915)|1915 Treaty of London]], before it was ceded to [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] as part of the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|1920 Treaty of Rapallo]].\n\nThe sea to the north of the island was the location of two battles:\n*on 13 March 1811, a small [[Royal Navy]] squadron under the command of Captain [[William Hoste]], defeated a larger French squadron in the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)]]\n*on 20 July 1866, the smaller Austrian fleet, under [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff|Admiral Tegetthoff]], attacked the [[Regia Marina|Italian fleet]], under [[Carlo Pellion di Persano|Admiral Persano]], defeating the larger Italian force and sinking the {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2|up=y}} in the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)]].\n\n===Second World War===\nVis was at one point the site of the general headquarters of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], the leader of the Yugoslav [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] resistance movement. It was occupied by Italy between 1941 and 1943, then was liberated by the Partisans and held by a British flotilla in 1943\u201344. At the end of World War II the island returned to Yugoslavia. During the war the island was mined. Allied fighter planes were based at a small airfield that was also used for emergency landings of Allied bombers, including an American [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]] flown by [[George McGovern]]. [[No. 6 Squadron RAF]] extensively used the airfield as a forward operating base, flying [[Hawker Hurricane]] Mk IV fighter aircraft, from May 1944 to February 1945.<ref>Jefford, C.G.
