The Portuguese lost their possessions in Ceylon due to [[Dutch Ceylon|Dutch intervention]] in the [[Eighty Years' War]]. Following the [[Kandyan Wars]], the island was united under [[British Ceylon|British rule]] in 1815.\nArmed uprisings against the British took place in the 1818 [[Uva Rebellion]] and the 1848 [[Matale Rebellion]]. Independence was finally granted in 1948 but the country remained a [[Dominion of Ceylon|Dominion]] of the British Empire until 1972.\n\nIn 1972 Sri Lanka assumed the status of a Republic. A [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|constitution]] was introduced in 1978 which made the [[President of Sri Lanka|Executive President]] the head of state. The [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] began in 1983, including an [[1987\u201389 JVP Insurrection|armed youth uprising]] in 1971 and 1987\u20131989, with the 25-year-long civil war ending in 2009.\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Main|Prehistory of Sri Lanka}}\n\nEvidence of human colonization in Sri Lanka appears at the site of Balangoda. [[Balangoda Man]] arrived on the island about 34,000 years ago and has been identified as [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s who lived in caves. Several of these caves, including the well-known [[Batadombalena]] and the [[Fa Hien Cave]], have yielded many artifacts from these people, who are currently the first known inhabitants of the island.\n\n[[Balangoda Man]] probably created [[Horton Plains National Park|Horton Plains]], in the central hills, by burning the trees in order to catch game. However, the discovery of oats and barley on the plains at about 15,000 BCE suggests that agriculture had already developed at this early date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/prehistory.htm |title=WWW Virtual Library: Prehistoric basis for the rise of civilisation in Sri Lanka and southern India |publisher=Lankalibrary.com |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nSeveral minute granite tools (about 4 centimetres in length), earthenware, remnants of charred timber, and clay burial pots date to the [[Mesolithic]]. Human remains dating to 6000 BCE have been discovered during recent excavations around a cave at [[Warana Raja Maha Vihara]] and in the Kalatuwawa area.\n\n[[Cinnamon]] is native to Sri Lanka and has been found in [[Ancient Egypt]] as early as 1500 BCE, suggesting early trade between Egypt and the island's inhabitants.

Indeed, Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s reign is recorded in the Mahavamsa. The Mahavamsa account of the period prior to Asoka's coronation, 218 years after the Buddha's death, seems to be part legend. Proper historical records begin with the arrival of [[Vijaya of Sri Lanka|Vijaya]] and his 700 followers. H. W. Codrington puts it, 'It is possible and even probable that Vijaya (`The Conqueror') himself is a composite character combining in his person...two conquests' of ancient Sri Lanka. Vijaya is an Indian prince, the eldest son of King Sinhabahu (\"Man with Lion arms\") and his sister Queen Sinhasivali. Both these Sinhalese leaders were born of a mythical union between a lion and a human princess. The Mahavamsa states that Vijaya landed on the same day as the death of the Buddha (See Geiger's preface to Mahavamsa). The story of Vijaya and Kuveni (the local reigning queen) is reminiscent of Greek legend and may have a common source in ancient Proto-Indo-European folk tales.\n\nAccording to the Mahavamsa, Vijaya landed on Sri Lanka near Mahathitha (Manthota or [[Mannar, Sri Lanka|Mannar]]<ref name=\"plum\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070330010211/http://www.geocities.com/place.names/index.html Traditional Sinhala place names of cities in Sri Lanka].

[[Sangamitta]] (sister of Mahinda) brought a [[Bodhi Tree|Bodhi]] sapling via [[Port of Jambukola|Jambukola]] (west of [[Kankesanthurai]]).

The British found that the uplands of Sri Lanka were very suitable for coffee, tea and rubber cultivation. By the mid-19th century, Ceylon tea had become a staple of the British market bringing great wealth to a small number of white tea planters. The planters imported large numbers of Tamil workers as [[indentured labourer]]s from south India to work the estates, who soon made up 10% of the island's population.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} These workers had to work in slave-like conditions living in line rooms, not very different from cattle sheds.\n[[File:Acta Eruditorum - II alfabeti monete, 1733 \u2013 BEIC 13426913.jpg|thumb|On the top: illustration from ''Delineatio characterum quorundam incognitorum, quos in insula Ceylano spectandos praebet tumulus quidam sepulchralis'' published in [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1733]]\nThe British colonialists favoured the semi-European Burghers, certain high-[[caste]] Sinhalese and the Tamils who were mainly concentrated to the north of the country.

Historian K. M. de Silva has stated that the refusal of the Ceylon Tamils to accept minority status is one of the main causes of the break up of the Ceylon National congress. The CNC did not seek independence (or \"Swaraj\"). What may be called the independence movement broke into two streams: the \"constitutionalists\", who sought independence by gradual modification of the status of Ceylon; and the more radical groups associated with the Colombo Youth League, Labour movement of Goonasinghe, and the Jaffna Youth Congress. These organizations were the first to raise the cry of \"Swaraj\" (\"outright independence\") following the Indian example when [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Sarojini Naidu and other Indian leaders visited Ceylon in 1926.<ref name=\"jane\">Russell, Jane (1982) ''Communal Politics under the Donoughmore constitution''.

Perera]] and [[Philip Gunawardena]], were aided in this struggle by other less radical members like [[Colvin R. De Silva]], [[Leslie Goonewardene]], [[Vivienne Goonewardene]], [[Edmund Samarkody]] and [[Natesa Iyer]]. They also demanded the replacement of English as the official language by Sinhala and Tamil. The Marxist groups were a tiny minority and yet their movement was viewed with great interest by the British administration. The ineffective attempts to rouse the public against the British Raj in revolt would have led to certain bloodshed and a delay in independence. British state papers released in the 1950s show that the Marxist movement had a very negative impact on the policy makers at the Colonial office.\n\nThe [[Soulbury Commission]] was the most important result of the agitation for constitutional reform in the 1930s. The Tamil organization was by then led by [[G. G. Ponnambalam]], who had rejected the \"Ceylonese identity\".<ref>Hansard 1935</ref> Ponnamblam had declared himself a \"proud Dravidian\" and proclaimed an independent identity for the Tamils. He attacked the Sinhalese and criticized their historical chronicle known as the [[Mahavamsa]]. One such conflict{{Specify|date=October 2009}} in Navalapitiya led to the first Sinhalese-Tamil riot in 1939.<ref name=\"jane\"/><ref>Hindu Organ, 1 November 1939</ref> Ponnambalam opposed [[universal franchise]], supported the [[caste system]], and claimed that the protection of minority rights requires that minorities (35% of the population in 1931) having an equal number of seats in parliament to that of the Sinhalese (65% of the population). This \"50-50\" or \"balanced representation\" policy became the hall mark of Tamil politics of the time. Ponnambalam also accused the British of having established colonization in \"traditional Tamil areas\", and having favoured the Buddhists by the Buddhist temporalities act. The [[Soulbury Commission]] rejected the submissions by Ponnambalam and even criticized what they described as their unacceptable communal character{{Clarify|date=October 2009}}. Sinhalese writers pointed to the large immigration of Tamils to the southern urban centers, especially after the opening of the Jaffna-Colombo railway. Meanwhile, Senanayake, Baron Jayatilleke, Oliver Gunatilleke and others lobbied the [[Soulbury Commission]] without confronting them officially. The unofficial submissions contained what was to later become the draft constitution of 1944.<ref name=\"jane\"/>\n\nThe close collaboration of the D. S. Senanayake government with the war-time British administration led to the support of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]]. His dispatches and a telegram to the Colonial office supporting Independence for Ceylon have been cited by historians as having helped the Senanayake government to secure the independence of Sri Lanka. The shrewd cooperation with the British as well as diverting the needs of the war market to Ceylonese markets as a supply point, managed by Oliver Goonatilleke, also led to a very favourable fiscal situation for the newly independent government.\n\n===The second world war===\n{{Main|Ceylon in World War II}}\n\nSri Lanka was a front-line British base against the Japanese during [[World War II]]. Sri Lankan opposition to the war led by the Marxist organizations and the leaders of the LSSP pro-independence group were arrested by the Colonial authorities. On 5 April 1942, the [[Indian Ocean raid (1942)|Indian Ocean raid]] saw the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] bomb Colombo. The Japanese attack led to the flight of Indian merchants, dominant in the Colombo commercial sector, which removed a major political problem facing the Senanayake government.<ref name=\"jane\" /> Marxist leaders also escaped to India where they participated in the independence struggle there. The movement in Ceylon was minuscule, limited to the English-educated intelligentsia and trade unions, mainly in the urban centres. These groups were led by Robert Gunawardena, Philip's brother. In stark contrast to this \"heroic\" but ineffective approach to the war, the Senanayake government took advantage to further its rapport with the commanding elite. Ceylon became crucial to the British Empire in the war, with [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]] using Colombo as his headquarters for the Eastern Theater. Oliver Goonatilleka successfully exploited the markets for the country's rubber and other agricultural products to replenish the treasury. Nonetheless, the Sinhalese continued to push for independence and the Sinhalese sovereignty, using the opportunities offered by the war, pushed to establish a special relationship with Britain.\n\nMeanwhile, the Marxists, identifying the war as an imperialist sideshow and desiring a [[proletarian revolution]], chose a path of agitation disproportionate to their negligible combat strength and diametrically opposed to the \"constitutionalist\" approach of Senanayake and other ethnic Sinhalese leaders. A small garrison on the [[Cocos Islands]] manned by Ceylonese [[Cocos Islands Mutiny|mutinied]] against British rule. It has been claimed that the LSSP had some hand in the action, though this is far from clear. Three of the participants were the only British colony subjects to be shot for mutiny during World War II.{{citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=the previous ref stated only one was shot and that was accidentally}}\n\nTwo members of the Governing Party, [[Junius Richard Jayawardene]] and [[Dudley Senanayake]], held discussions with the Japanese to collaborate in fighting the British. Sri Lankans in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] formed the 'Lanka Regiment' of the anti-British [[Indian National Army]].\n\nThe constitutionalists led by D. S. Senanayake succeeded in winning independence. The Soulbury constitution was essentially what Senanayake's board of ministers had drafted in 1944. The promise of Dominion status and independence itself had been given by the Colonial Office.\n\n===Independence===\nThe Sinhalese leader Don Stephen Senanayake left the CNC on the issue of independence, disagreeing with the revised aim of 'the achieving of freedom', although his real reasons were more subtle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/CJ13Df01.html |title=Asia Times: Sri Lanka: The Untold Story |publisher=Atimes.com |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> He subsequently formed the [[United National Party]] (UNP) in 1946,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/68.htm |title=Sri Lanka \u2013 Sinhalese Parties |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date=1 January 1986 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> when a new constitution was agreed on, based on the behind-the-curtain lobbying of the Soulbury commission. At the elections of 1947, the UNP won a minority of seats in parliament, but cobbled together a coalition with the Sinhala Maha Sabha party of Solomon Bandaranaike and the Tamil Congress of G.G. Ponnambalam. The successful inclusions of the Tamil-communalist leader Ponnambalam, and his Sinhalese counterpart Bandaranaike were a remarkable political balancing act by Senanayake. The vacuum in Tamil Nationalist politics, created by Ponnamblam's transition to a moderate, opened the field for the Tamil ''Arasu Kachchi'' (\"Federal party\"), a Tamil sovereignty party led by S. J. V. Chelvanaykam who was the lawyer son of a Christian minister.\n\n==Sri Lanka (1948\u2013present)==\n{{Main|History of Sri Lanka (1948\u2013present)}}\n\n===Dominion===\n{{See also|Dominion of Ceylon}}\n\nDominion status followed on 4 February 1948 with military treaties with Britain, as the upper ranks of the armed forces were initially British, and British air and sea bases remaining intact. This was later raised to independence itself and Senanayake became the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. In 1949, with the concurrence of the leaders of the [[Ceylon Tamils]], the UNP government disenfranchised the [[Hill Country Tamils|Indian Tamil]] plantation workers.<ref name=\"jane\"/><ref>Hoole, M.R.R.

Senanayke died in 1952 after falling from a horse and was succeeded by his son Dudley Senanayake, the then minister of Agriculture. In 1953 he resigned following a massive ''[[Hartal]]'' (\"general strike\") by the Left parties against the UNP. He was followed by [[John Kotelawala]], a senior politician and an uncle of Dudley Senanayke. Kotelawala did not have the enormous personal prestige or the adroit political acumen of D. S. Senanayake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/23.htm |title=Sri Lanka \u2013 United National Party \"Majority\" Rule, 1948\u201356 |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> He brought to the fore the issue of national languages that D. S. Senanayake had adroitly kept on the back burner, antagonising the Tamils and the Sinhalese by stating conflicting policies with regard to the status of [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as official languages. He also antagonized the Buddhist lobby by attacking politically active Buddhist Monks who were Bandaranaike's supporters.\n\nIn 1956, the Senate was abolished and Sinhala was established as the official language, with Tamil as a second language. Appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London were abolished and plantations were nationalised to fulfil the election pledges of the Marxist program and to \"prevent the ongoing dis-investment by the owning companies\".\n\nIn 1956, the [[Sinhala Only Act]] came into being. This established Sinhala as the first and preferred language in commerce and education. \nThe Act took effect immediately. As a consequence vast numbers of people mostly Burghers left the country to live abroad as they rightfully felt discriminated against.\n\nIn 1958, the first major riots between Sinhalese and Tamils flared up in Colombo as a direct result of the government's language policy.\n\n;1971 Uprising\n{{Main|1971 JVP Insurrection}}\n{{very long section|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe leftist Sinhalese [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] drew worldwide attention when it launched an insurrection against the Bandaranayake government in April 1971. Although the insurgents were young, poorly armed, and inadequately trained, they succeeded in seizing and holding major areas in Southern and Central provinces before they were defeated by the security forces. Their attempt to seize power created a major crisis for the government and forced a fundamental reassessment of the nation's security needs.\n\nThe movement was started in the late 1960s by Rohana Wijeweera, the son of a businessman from the seaport of Tangalla, Hambantota District. An excellent student, Wijeweera had been forced to give up his studies for financial reasons. Through friends of his father, a member of the Ceylon Communist Party, Wijeweera successfully applied for a scholarship in the Soviet Union, and in 1960 at the age of seventeen, he went to Moscow to study medicine at Patrice Lumumba University.\n\nWhile in Moscow, he studied Marxist ideology but, because of his openly expressed sympathies for Maoist revolutionary theory, he was denied a visa to return to the Soviet Union after a brief trip home in 1964. Over the next several years, he participated in the pro-Beijing branch of the Ceylon Communist Party, but he was increasingly at odds with party leaders and impatient with its lack of revolutionary purpose. His success in working with youth groups and his popularity as a public speaker led him to organize his own movement in 1967. Initially identified simply as the New Left, this group drew on students and unemployed youths from rural areas, most of them in the sixteen-to-twenty-five-age-group. Many of these new recruits were members of minority so called 'lower' castes (Karava and Durava) who felt that their economic interests had been neglected by the nation's leftist coalitions. The standard program of indoctrination, the so-called Five Lectures, included discussions of Indian imperialism, the growing economic crisis, the failure of the island's communist and socialist parties, and the need for a sudden, violent seizure of power.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1970, the group expanded rapidly, gaining control of the student socialist movement at a number of major university campuses and winning recruits and sympathizers within the armed forces. Some of these latter supporters actually provided sketches of police stations, airports, and military facilities that were important to the initial success of the revolt. In order to draw the newer members more tightly into the organization and to prepare them for a coming confrontation, Wijeweera opened \"education camps\" in several remote areas along the south and southwestern coasts. These camps provided training in Marxism\u2013Leninism and in basic military skills.\n\nWhile developing secret cells and regional commands, Wijeweera's group also began to take a more public role during the elections of 1970. His cadres campaigned openly for the United Front of Sirimavo R. D. Bandaranaike, but at the same time they distributed posters and pamphlets promising violent rebellion if Bandaranaike did not address the interests of the proletariat. In a manifesto issued during this period, the group used the name Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna for the first time. Because of the subversive tone of these publications, the United National Party government had Wijeweera detained during the elections, but the victorious Bandaranaike ordered his release in July 1970. In the politically tolerant atmosphere of the next few months, as the new government attempted to win over a wide variety of unorthodox leftist groups, the JVP intensified both the public campaign and the private preparations for a revolt. Although their group was relatively small, the members hoped to immobilize the government by selective kidnapping and sudden, simultaneous strikes against the security forces throughout the island. Some of the necessary weapons had been bought with funds supplied by the members. For the most part, however, they relied on raids against police stations and army camps to secure weapons, and they manufactured their own bombs.\n\nThe discovery of several JVP bomb factories gave the government its first evidence that the group's public threats were to be taken seriously. In March 1971, after an accidental explosion in one of these factories, the police found fifty-eight bombs in a hut in Nelundeniya, Kegalla District. Shortly afterward, Wijeweera was arrested and sent to Jaffna Prison, where he remained throughout the revolt. In response to his arrest and the growing pressure of police investigations, other JVP leaders decided to act immediately, and they agreed to begin the uprising at 11:00 P.M. on 5 April.\n\nThe planning for the countrywide insurrection was hasty and poorly coordinated; some of the district leaders were not informed until the morning of the uprising. After one premature attack, security forces throughout the island were put on alert and a number of JVP leaders went into hiding without bothering to inform their subordinates of the changed circumstances. In spite of this confusion, rebel groups armed with shotguns, bombs, and Molotov cocktails launched simultaneous attacks against seventy- four police stations around the island and cut power to major urban areas. The attacks were most successful in the south. By 10 April, the rebels had taken control of Matara District and the city of Ambalangoda in Galle District and came close to capturing the remaining areas of Southern Province.\n\nThe new government was ill-prepared for the crisis that confronted it. Although there had been some warning that an attack was imminent, Bandaranaike was caught off guard by the scale of the uprising and was forced to call on India to provide basic security functions. Indian frigates patrolled the coast and Indian troops guarded Bandaranaike International Airport at Katunayaka while Indian Air Force helicopters assisted the counteroffensive. Sri Lanka's all-volunteer army had no combat experience since World War II and no training in counterinsurgency warfare. Although the police were able to defend some areas unassisted, in many places the government deployed personnel from all three services in a ground force capacity. Royal Ceylon Air Force helicopters delivered relief supplies to beleaguered police stations while combined service patrols drove the insurgents out of urban areas and into the countryside.\n\nAfter two weeks of fighting, the government regained control of all but a few remote areas. In both human and political terms, the cost of the victory was high: an estimated 10,000 insurgents- -many of them in their teens\u2014died in the conflict, and the army was widely perceived to have used excessive force. In order to win over an alienated population and to prevent a prolonged conflict, Bandaranaike offered amnesties in May and June 1971, and only the top leaders were actually imprisoned. Wijeweera, who was already in detention at the time of the uprising, was given a twenty-year sentence and the JVP was proscribed.\n\nUnder the six years of emergency rule that followed the uprising, the JVP remained dormant. After the victory of the United National Party in the 1977 elections, however, the new government attempted to broaden its mandate with a period of political tolerance. Wijeweera was freed, the ban was lifted, and the JVP entered the arena of legal political competition. As a candidate in the 1982 presidential elections, Wijeweera finished fourth, with more than 250,000 votes (as compared with Jayewardene's 3.2 million). During this period, and especially as the Tamil conflict to the north became more intense, there was a marked shift in the ideology and goals of the JVP. Initially Marxist in orientation, and claiming to represent the oppressed of both the Tamil and Sinhalese communities, the group emerged increasingly as a Sinhalese nationalist organization opposing any compromise with the Tamil insurgency. This new orientation became explicit in the anti-Tamil riots of July 1983. Because of its role in inciting violence, the JVP was once again banned and its leadership went underground.\n\nThe group's activities intensified in the second half of 1987 in the wake of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord. The prospect of Tamil autonomy in the north together with the presence of Indian troops stirred up a wave of Sinhalese nationalism and a sudden growth of antigovernment violence. During 1987 a new group emerged that was an offshoot of the JVP\u2014the Patriotic Liberation Organization (Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya\u2014DJV). The DJV claimed responsibility for the August 1987 assassination attempts against the president and prime minister. In addition, the group launched a campaign of intimidation against the ruling party, killing more than seventy members of Parliament between July and November.\n\nAlong with the group's renewed violence came a renewed fear of infiltration of the armed forces. Following the successful raid of the Pallekelle army camp in May 1987, the government conducted an investigation that resulted in the discharge of thirty-seven soldiers suspected of having links with the JVP. In order to prevent a repetition of the 1971 uprising, the government considered lifting the ban on the JVP in early 1988 and permitting the group to participate again in the political arena. With Wijeweera still underground, however, the JVP had no clear leadership at the time, and it was uncertain whether it had the cohesion to mount any coordinated offensive, either military or political, against the government.\n\n===Republic===\nThe Socialist republic of Sri Lanka is established on 22 May 1972. By 1977, the voters were tired of Bandaranaike's socialist policies and elections returned the UNP to power under [[Junius Jayewardene]], on a manifesto pledging a market economy and \"a free ration of 8 seers (kilograms) of cereals\". The SLFP and the left-wing parties were virtually wiped out in Parliament, although they garnered 40% of the popular vote, leaving the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] led by [[Appapillai Amirthalingam]] as the official opposition. This created a dangerous ethnic division in Sri Lankan politics.\n\nAfter coming to power, Jayewardene directed the rewriting of the constitution. The document that was produced, the new Constitution of 1978, drastically altered the nature of governance in Sri Lanka. It replaced the previous Westminster style, parliamentary government with a new presidential system modeled after France, with a powerful chief executive. The president was to be elected by direct suffrage for a six-year term and was empowered to appoint, with parliamentary approval, the prime minister and to preside over cabinet meetings. Jayewardene became the first president under the new Constitution and assumed direct control of the government machinery and party.\n\nThe new regime ushered in an era that did not augur well for the SLFP. Jayewardene's UNP government accused former prime minister Bandaranaike of abusing her power while in office from 1970 to 1977. In October 1980, Bandaranaike's privilege to engage in politics was removed for a period of seven years, and the SLFP was forced to seek a new leader. After a long and divisive battle, the party chose her son, Anura. Anura Bandaranaike was soon thrust into the role of the keeper of his father's legacy, but he inherited a political party torn apart by factionalism and reduced to a minimal role in the Parliament.\n\nThe 1978 Constitution included substantial concessions to Tamil sensitivities. Although TULF did not participate in framing the Constitution, it continued to sit in Parliament in the hope of negotiating a settlement to the Tamil problem. TULF also agreed to Jayewardene's proposal of an all-party conference to resolve the island's ethnic problems. Jayewardene's UNP offered other concessions in a bid to secure peace. Sinhala remained the official language and the language of administration throughout Sri Lanka, but Tamil was given a new \"national language\" status. Tamil was to be used in a number of administrative and educational circumstances. Jayewardene also eliminated a major Tamil grievance by abrogating the \"standardization\" policy of the United Front government, which had made university admission criteria for Tamils more difficult. In addition, he offered many top-level positions, including that of minister of justice, to Tamil civil servants.\n\nWhile TULF, in conjunction with the UNP, pressed for the all-party conference, the Tamil Tigers escalated their terrorist attacks, which provoked Sinhalese backlash against Tamils and generally precluded any successful accommodation. In reaction to the assassination of a Jaffna police inspector, the Jayewardene government declared an emergency and dispatched troops, who were given an unrealistic six months to eradicate the terrorist threat.\n\nThe government passed the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act in 1979. The act was enacted as a temporary measure, but it later became permanent legislation. The International Commission of Jurists, Amnesty International, and other human rights organizations condemned the act as being incompatible with democratic traditions. Despite the act, the number of terrorist acts increased. Guerrillas began to hit targets of high symbolic value such as post offices and police outposts, provoking government counterattacks. As an increasing number of civilians were caught in the fighting, Tamil support widened for the \"boys\", as the guerrillas began to be called. Other large, well-armed groups began to compete with LTTE. The better-known included the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam, Tamil Eelam Liberation Army, and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization. Each of these groups had forces measured in the hundreds if not thousands. The government claimed that many of the terrorists were operating from training camps in India's Tamil Nadu State. The Indian government repeatedly denied this claim. With the level of violence mounting, the possibility of negotiation became increasingly distant.\n\n;Internal conflict\n{{Main|Sri Lankan Civil War|1987\u201389 JVP Insurrection}}\n\nIn July 1983, communal riots took place due to the ambush and killing of 13 Sri Lankan Army soldiers by the Tamil Tigers using the voters list, which contained the exact addresses of Tamils.

The Portuguese lost their possessions in Ceylon due to [[Dutch Ceylon|Dutch intervention]] in the [[Eighty Years' War]]. Following the [[Kandyan Wars]], the island was united under [[British Ceylon|British rule]] in 1815.\nArmed uprisings against the British took place in the 1818 [[Uva Rebellion]] and the 1848 [[Matale Rebellion]]. Independence was finally granted in 1948 but the country remained a [[Dominion of Ceylon|Dominion]] of the British Empire until 1972.\n\nIn 1972 Sri Lanka assumed the status of a Republic. A [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|constitution]] was introduced in 1978 which made the [[President of Sri Lanka|Executive President]] the head of state. The [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] began in 1983, including an [[1987\u201389 JVP Insurrection|armed youth uprising]] in 1971 and 1987\u20131989, with the 25-year-long civil war ending in 2009.\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Main|Prehistory of Sri Lanka}}\n\nEvidence of human colonization in Sri Lanka appears at the site of Balangoda. [[Balangoda Man]] arrived on the island about 34,000 years ago and has been identified as [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s who lived in caves. Several of these caves, including the well-known [[Batadombalena]] and the [[Fa Hien Cave]], have yielded many artifacts from these people, who are currently the first known inhabitants of the island.\n\n[[Balangoda Man]] probably created [[Horton Plains National Park|Horton Plains]], in the central hills, by burning the trees in order to catch game. However, the discovery of oats and barley on the plains at about 15,000 BCE suggests that agriculture had already developed at this early date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/prehistory.htm |title=WWW Virtual Library: Prehistoric basis for the rise of civilisation in Sri Lanka and southern India |publisher=Lankalibrary.com |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nSeveral minute granite tools (about 4 centimetres in length), earthenware, remnants of charred timber, and clay burial pots date to the [[Mesolithic]]. Human remains dating to 6000 BCE have been discovered during recent excavations around a cave at [[Warana Raja Maha Vihara]] and in the Kalatuwawa area.\n\n[[Cinnamon]] is native to Sri Lanka and has been found in [[Ancient Egypt]] as early as 1500 BCE, suggesting early trade between Egypt and the island's inhabitants. It is possible that Biblical [[Tarshish]] was located on the island.

The earliest manifestation of this in Sri Lanka is radiocarbon-dated to c. 1000\u2013800 BCE at Anuradhapura and Aligala shelter in Sigiriya (Deraniyagala 1992:709-29; Karunaratne and Adikari 1994:58; Mogren 1994:39; with the Anuradhapura dating corroborated by Coningham 1999).

Indeed, Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s reign is recorded in the Mahavamsa. The Mahavamsa account of the period prior to Asoka's coronation, 218 years after the Buddha's death, seems to be part legend. Proper historical records begin with the arrival of [[Vijaya of Sri Lanka|Vijaya]] and his 700 followers. H. W. Codrington puts it, 'It is possible and even probable that Vijaya (`The Conqueror') himself is a composite character combining in his person...two conquests' of ancient Sri Lanka. Vijaya is an Indian prince, the eldest son of King Sinhabahu (\"Man with Lion arms\") and his sister Queen Sinhasivali. Both these Sinhalese leaders were born of a mythical union between a lion and a human princess. The Mahavamsa states that Vijaya landed on the same day as the death of the Buddha (See Geiger's preface to Mahavamsa). The story of Vijaya and Kuveni (the local reigning queen) is reminiscent of Greek legend and may have a common source in ancient Proto-Indo-European folk tales.\n\nAccording to the Mahavamsa, Vijaya landed on Sri Lanka near Mahathitha (Manthota or [[Mannar, Sri Lanka|Mannar]]<ref name=\"plum\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070330010211/http://www.geocities.com/place.names/index.html Traditional Sinhala place names of cities in Sri Lanka].

The Mahavamsa also describes the Buddha visiting Sri Lanka three times. Firstly, to stop a war between a Naga king and his son in law who were fighting over a ruby chair. It is said that on his last visit he left his foot mark on ''Siri Pada'' (\"[[Adam's Peak]]\").\n\n[[Tamirabharani]] is the old name for the second longest river in Sri Lanka (known as [[Malvathu River|Malwatu Oya]] in Sinhala and [[Aruvi Aru]] in Tamil).

The Portuguese founded a fort at the port city of [[Colombo]] in 1517 and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas.

The agreement was breached by both parties. The Dutch captured [[Colombo]] in 1656 and the last Portuguese strongholds near [[Jaffnapatnam]] in 1658. By 1660 they controlled the whole island except the land-locked kingdom of Kandy. The Dutch (Protestants) persecuted the Catholics and the remaining Portuguese settlers but left Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims alone.

The British found that the uplands of Sri Lanka were very suitable for coffee, tea and rubber cultivation. By the mid-19th century, Ceylon tea had become a staple of the British market bringing great wealth to a small number of white tea planters. The planters imported large numbers of Tamil workers as [[indentured labourer]]s from south India to work the estates, who soon made up 10% of the island's population.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} These workers had to work in slave-like conditions living in line rooms, not very different from cattle sheds.\n[[File:Acta Eruditorum - II alfabeti monete, 1733 \u2013 BEIC 13426913.jpg|thumb|On the top: illustration from ''Delineatio characterum quorundam incognitorum, quos in insula Ceylano spectandos praebet tumulus quidam sepulchralis'' published in [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1733]]\nThe British colonialists favoured the semi-European Burghers, certain high-[[caste]] Sinhalese and the Tamils who were mainly concentrated to the north of the country.

Historian K. M. de Silva has stated that the refusal of the Ceylon Tamils to accept minority status is one of the main causes of the break up of the Ceylon National congress. The CNC did not seek independence (or \"Swaraj\"). What may be called the independence movement broke into two streams: the \"constitutionalists\", who sought independence by gradual modification of the status of Ceylon; and the more radical groups associated with the Colombo Youth League, Labour movement of Goonasinghe, and the Jaffna Youth Congress. These organizations were the first to raise the cry of \"Swaraj\" (\"outright independence\") following the Indian example when [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Sarojini Naidu and other Indian leaders visited Ceylon in 1926.<ref name=\"jane\">Russell, Jane (1982) ''Communal Politics under the Donoughmore constitution''.

Perera]] and [[Philip Gunawardena]], were aided in this struggle by other less radical members like [[Colvin R. De Silva]], [[Leslie Goonewardene]], [[Vivienne Goonewardene]], [[Edmund Samarkody]] and [[Natesa Iyer]]. They also demanded the replacement of English as the official language by Sinhala and Tamil. The Marxist groups were a tiny minority and yet their movement was viewed with great interest by the British administration. The ineffective attempts to rouse the public against the British Raj in revolt would have led to certain bloodshed and a delay in independence. British state papers released in the 1950s show that the Marxist movement had a very negative impact on the policy makers at the Colonial office.\n\nThe [[Soulbury Commission]] was the most important result of the agitation for constitutional reform in the 1930s. The Tamil organization was by then led by [[G. G. Ponnambalam]], who had rejected the \"Ceylonese identity\".<ref>Hansard 1935</ref> Ponnamblam had declared himself a \"proud Dravidian\" and proclaimed an independent identity for the Tamils. He attacked the Sinhalese and criticized their historical chronicle known as the [[Mahavamsa]]. One such conflict{{Specify|date=October 2009}} in Navalapitiya led to the first Sinhalese-Tamil riot in 1939.<ref name=\"jane\"/><ref>Hindu Organ, 1 November 1939</ref> Ponnambalam opposed [[universal franchise]], supported the [[caste system]], and claimed that the protection of minority rights requires that minorities (35% of the population in 1931) having an equal number of seats in parliament to that of the Sinhalese (65% of the population). This \"50-50\" or \"balanced representation\" policy became the hall mark of Tamil politics of the time. Ponnambalam also accused the British of having established colonization in \"traditional Tamil areas\", and having favoured the Buddhists by the Buddhist temporalities act. The [[Soulbury Commission]] rejected the submissions by Ponnambalam and even criticized what they described as their unacceptable communal character{{Clarify|date=October 2009}}. Sinhalese writers pointed to the large immigration of Tamils to the southern urban centers, especially after the opening of the Jaffna-Colombo railway. Meanwhile, Senanayake, Baron Jayatilleke, Oliver Gunatilleke and others lobbied the [[Soulbury Commission]] without confronting them officially. The unofficial submissions contained what was to later become the draft constitution of 1944.<ref name=\"jane\"/>\n\nThe close collaboration of the D. S. Senanayake government with the war-time British administration led to the support of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]]. His dispatches and a telegram to the Colonial office supporting Independence for Ceylon have been cited by historians as having helped the Senanayake government to secure the independence of Sri Lanka. The shrewd cooperation with the British as well as diverting the needs of the war market to Ceylonese markets as a supply point, managed by Oliver Goonatilleke, also led to a very favourable fiscal situation for the newly independent government.\n\n===The second world war===\n{{Main|Ceylon in World War II}}\n\nSri Lanka was a front-line British base against the Japanese during [[World War II]]. Sri Lankan opposition to the war led by the Marxist organizations and the leaders of the LSSP pro-independence group were arrested by the Colonial authorities. On 5 April 1942, the [[Indian Ocean raid (1942)|Indian Ocean raid]] saw the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] bomb Colombo. The Japanese attack led to the flight of Indian merchants, dominant in the Colombo commercial sector, which removed a major political problem facing the Senanayake government.<ref name=\"jane\" /> Marxist leaders also escaped to India where they participated in the independence struggle there. The movement in Ceylon was minuscule, limited to the English-educated intelligentsia and trade unions, mainly in the urban centres. These groups were led by Robert Gunawardena, Philip's brother. In stark contrast to this \"heroic\" but ineffective approach to the war, the Senanayake government took advantage to further its rapport with the commanding elite. Ceylon became crucial to the British Empire in the war, with [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]] using Colombo as his headquarters for the Eastern Theater. Oliver Goonatilleka successfully exploited the markets for the country's rubber and other agricultural products to replenish the treasury. Nonetheless, the Sinhalese continued to push for independence and the Sinhalese sovereignty, using the opportunities offered by the war, pushed to establish a special relationship with Britain.\n\nMeanwhile, the Marxists, identifying the war as an imperialist sideshow and desiring a [[proletarian revolution]], chose a path of agitation disproportionate to their negligible combat strength and diametrically opposed to the \"constitutionalist\" approach of Senanayake and other ethnic Sinhalese leaders. A small garrison on the [[Cocos Islands]] manned by Ceylonese [[Cocos Islands Mutiny|mutinied]] against British rule. It has been claimed that the LSSP had some hand in the action, though this is far from clear.

Sri Lankans in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] formed the 'Lanka Regiment' of the anti-British [[Indian National Army]].\n\nThe constitutionalists led by D. S. Senanayake succeeded in winning independence. The Soulbury constitution was essentially what Senanayake's board of ministers had drafted in 1944. The promise of Dominion status and independence itself had been given by the Colonial Office.\n\n===Independence===\nThe Sinhalese leader Don Stephen Senanayake left the CNC on the issue of independence, disagreeing with the revised aim of 'the achieving of freedom', although his real reasons were more subtle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/CJ13Df01.html |title=Asia Times: Sri Lanka: The Untold Story |publisher=Atimes.com |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> He subsequently formed the [[United National Party]] (UNP) in 1946,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/68.htm |title=Sri Lanka \u2013 Sinhalese Parties |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date=1 January 1986 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> when a new constitution was agreed on, based on the behind-the-curtain lobbying of the Soulbury commission. At the elections of 1947, the UNP won a minority of seats in parliament, but cobbled together a coalition with the Sinhala Maha Sabha party of Solomon Bandaranaike and the Tamil Congress of G.G. Ponnambalam. The successful inclusions of the Tamil-communalist leader Ponnambalam, and his Sinhalese counterpart Bandaranaike were a remarkable political balancing act by Senanayake. The vacuum in Tamil Nationalist politics, created by Ponnamblam's transition to a moderate, opened the field for the Tamil ''Arasu Kachchi'' (\"Federal party\"), a Tamil sovereignty party led by S. J. V.

Senanayke died in 1952 after falling from a horse and was succeeded by his son Dudley Senanayake, the then minister of Agriculture. In 1953 he resigned following a massive ''[[Hartal]]'' (\"general strike\") by the Left parties against the UNP. He was followed by [[John Kotelawala]], a senior politician and an uncle of Dudley Senanayke. Kotelawala did not have the enormous personal prestige or the adroit political acumen of D. S. Senanayake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/23.htm |title=Sri Lanka \u2013 United National Party \"Majority\" Rule, 1948\u201356 |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> He brought to the fore the issue of national languages that D. S. Senanayake had adroitly kept on the back burner, antagonising the Tamils and the Sinhalese by stating conflicting policies with regard to the status of [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as official languages. He also antagonized the Buddhist lobby by attacking politically active Buddhist Monks who were Bandaranaike's supporters.\n\nIn 1956, the Senate was abolished and Sinhala was established as the official language, with Tamil as a second language. Appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London were abolished and plantations were nationalised to fulfil the election pledges of the Marxist program and to \"prevent the ongoing dis-investment by the owning companies\".\n\nIn 1956, the [[Sinhala Only Act]] came into being. This established Sinhala as the first and preferred language in commerce and education. \nThe Act took effect immediately. As a consequence vast numbers of people mostly Burghers left the country to live abroad as they rightfully felt discriminated against.\n\nIn 1958, the first major riots between Sinhalese and Tamils flared up in Colombo as a direct result of the government's language policy.\n\n;1971 Uprising\n{{Main|1971 JVP Insurrection}}\n{{very long section|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe leftist Sinhalese [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] drew worldwide attention when it launched an insurrection against the Bandaranayake government in April 1971. Although the insurgents were young, poorly armed, and inadequately trained, they succeeded in seizing and holding major areas in Southern and Central provinces before they were defeated by the security forces. Their attempt to seize power created a major crisis for the government and forced a fundamental reassessment of the nation's security needs.\n\nThe movement was started in the late 1960s by Rohana Wijeweera, the son of a businessman from the seaport of Tangalla, Hambantota District. An excellent student, Wijeweera had been forced to give up his studies for financial reasons. Through friends of his father, a member of the Ceylon Communist Party, Wijeweera successfully applied for a scholarship in the Soviet Union, and in 1960 at the age of seventeen, he went to Moscow to study medicine at Patrice Lumumba University.\n\nWhile in Moscow, he studied Marxist ideology but, because of his openly expressed sympathies for Maoist revolutionary theory, he was denied a visa to return to the Soviet Union after a brief trip home in 1964. Over the next several years, he participated in the pro-Beijing branch of the Ceylon Communist Party, but he was increasingly at odds with party leaders and impatient with its lack of revolutionary purpose. His success in working with youth groups and his popularity as a public speaker led him to organize his own movement in 1967. Initially identified simply as the New Left, this group drew on students and unemployed youths from rural areas, most of them in the sixteen-to-twenty-five-age-group. Many of these new recruits were members of minority so called 'lower' castes (Karava and Durava) who felt that their economic interests had been neglected by the nation's leftist coalitions. The standard program of indoctrination, the so-called Five Lectures, included discussions of Indian imperialism, the growing economic crisis, the failure of the island's communist and socialist parties, and the need for a sudden, violent seizure of power.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1970, the group expanded rapidly, gaining control of the student socialist movement at a number of major university campuses and winning recruits and sympathizers within the armed forces. Some of these latter supporters actually provided sketches of police stations, airports, and military facilities that were important to the initial success of the revolt. In order to draw the newer members more tightly into the organization and to prepare them for a coming confrontation, Wijeweera opened \"education camps\" in several remote areas along the south and southwestern coasts. These camps provided training in Marxism\u2013Leninism and in basic military skills.\n\nWhile developing secret cells and regional commands, Wijeweera's group also began to take a more public role during the elections of 1970. His cadres campaigned openly for the United Front of Sirimavo R. D. Bandaranaike, but at the same time they distributed posters and pamphlets promising violent rebellion if Bandaranaike did not address the interests of the proletariat. In a manifesto issued during this period, the group used the name Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna for the first time. Because of the subversive tone of these publications, the United National Party government had Wijeweera detained during the elections, but the victorious Bandaranaike ordered his release in July 1970. In the politically tolerant atmosphere of the next few months, as the new government attempted to win over a wide variety of unorthodox leftist groups, the JVP intensified both the public campaign and the private preparations for a revolt. Although their group was relatively small, the members hoped to immobilize the government by selective kidnapping and sudden, simultaneous strikes against the security forces throughout the island. Some of the necessary weapons had been bought with funds supplied by the members. For the most part, however, they relied on raids against police stations and army camps to secure weapons, and they manufactured their own bombs.\n\nThe discovery of several JVP bomb factories gave the government its first evidence that the group's public threats were to be taken seriously. In March 1971, after an accidental explosion in one of these factories, the police found fifty-eight bombs in a hut in Nelundeniya, Kegalla District. Shortly afterward, Wijeweera was arrested and sent to Jaffna Prison, where he remained throughout the revolt. In response to his arrest and the growing pressure of police investigations, other JVP leaders decided to act immediately, and they agreed to begin the uprising at 11:00 P.M. on 5 April.\n\nThe planning for the countrywide insurrection was hasty and poorly coordinated; some of the district leaders were not informed until the morning of the uprising. After one premature attack, security forces throughout the island were put on alert and a number of JVP leaders went into hiding without bothering to inform their subordinates of the changed circumstances. In spite of this confusion, rebel groups armed with shotguns, bombs, and Molotov cocktails launched simultaneous attacks against seventy- four police stations around the island and cut power to major urban areas. The attacks were most successful in the south. By 10 April, the rebels had taken control of Matara District and the city of Ambalangoda in Galle District and came close to capturing the remaining areas of Southern Province.\n\nThe new government was ill-prepared for the crisis that confronted it. Although there had been some warning that an attack was imminent, Bandaranaike was caught off guard by the scale of the uprising and was forced to call on India to provide basic security functions. Indian frigates patrolled the coast and Indian troops guarded Bandaranaike International Airport at Katunayaka while Indian Air Force helicopters assisted the counteroffensive. Sri Lanka's all-volunteer army had no combat experience since World War II and no training in counterinsurgency warfare. Although the police were able to defend some areas unassisted, in many places the government deployed personnel from all three services in a ground force capacity. Royal Ceylon Air Force helicopters delivered relief supplies to beleaguered police stations while combined service patrols drove the insurgents out of urban areas and into the countryside.\n\nAfter two weeks of fighting, the government regained control of all but a few remote areas. In both human and political terms, the cost of the victory was high: an estimated 10,000 insurgents- -many of them in their teens\u2014died in the conflict, and the army was widely perceived to have used excessive force. In order to win over an alienated population and to prevent a prolonged conflict, Bandaranaike offered amnesties in May and June 1971, and only the top leaders were actually imprisoned. Wijeweera, who was already in detention at the time of the uprising, was given a twenty-year sentence and the JVP was proscribed.\n\nUnder the six years of emergency rule that followed the uprising, the JVP remained dormant. After the victory of the United National Party in the 1977 elections, however, the new government attempted to broaden its mandate with a period of political tolerance. Wijeweera was freed, the ban was lifted, and the JVP entered the arena of legal political competition. As a candidate in the 1982 presidential elections, Wijeweera finished fourth, with more than 250,000 votes (as compared with Jayewardene's 3.2 million). During this period, and especially as the Tamil conflict to the north became more intense, there was a marked shift in the ideology and goals of the JVP. Initially Marxist in orientation, and claiming to represent the oppressed of both the Tamil and Sinhalese communities, the group emerged increasingly as a Sinhalese nationalist organization opposing any compromise with the Tamil insurgency. This new orientation became explicit in the anti-Tamil riots of July 1983. Because of its role in inciting violence, the JVP was once again banned and its leadership went underground.\n\nThe group's activities intensified in the second half of 1987 in the wake of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord. The prospect of Tamil autonomy in the north together with the presence of Indian troops stirred up a wave of Sinhalese nationalism and a sudden growth of antigovernment violence. During 1987 a new group emerged that was an offshoot of the JVP\u2014the Patriotic Liberation Organization (Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya\u2014DJV). The DJV claimed responsibility for the August 1987 assassination attempts against the president and prime minister. In addition, the group launched a campaign of intimidation against the ruling party, killing more than seventy members of Parliament between July and November.\n\nAlong with the group's renewed violence came a renewed fear of infiltration of the armed forces. Following the successful raid of the Pallekelle army camp in May 1987, the government conducted an investigation that resulted in the discharge of thirty-seven soldiers suspected of having links with the JVP. In order to prevent a repetition of the 1971 uprising, the government considered lifting the ban on the JVP in early 1988 and permitting the group to participate again in the political arena. With Wijeweera still underground, however, the JVP had no clear leadership at the time, and it was uncertain whether it had the cohesion to mount any coordinated offensive, either military or political, against the government.\n\n===Republic===\nThe Socialist republic of Sri Lanka is established on 22 May 1972. By 1977, the voters were tired of Bandaranaike's socialist policies and elections returned the UNP to power under [[Junius Jayewardene]], on a manifesto pledging a market economy and \"a free ration of 8 seers (kilograms) of cereals\". The SLFP and the left-wing parties were virtually wiped out in Parliament, although they garnered 40% of the popular vote, leaving the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] led by [[Appapillai Amirthalingam]] as the official opposition. This created a dangerous ethnic division in Sri Lankan politics.\n\nAfter coming to power, Jayewardene directed the rewriting of the constitution. The document that was produced, the new Constitution of 1978, drastically altered the nature of governance in Sri Lanka. It replaced the previous Westminster style, parliamentary government with a new presidential system modeled after France, with a powerful chief executive. The president was to be elected by direct suffrage for a six-year term and was empowered to appoint, with parliamentary approval, the prime minister and to preside over cabinet meetings. Jayewardene became the first president under the new Constitution and assumed direct control of the government machinery and party.\n\nThe new regime ushered in an era that did not augur well for the SLFP. Jayewardene's UNP government accused former prime minister Bandaranaike of abusing her power while in office from 1970 to 1977. In October 1980, Bandaranaike's privilege to engage in politics was removed for a period of seven years, and the SLFP was forced to seek a new leader. After a long and divisive battle, the party chose her son, Anura. Anura Bandaranaike was soon thrust into the role of the keeper of his father's legacy, but he inherited a political party torn apart by factionalism and reduced to a minimal role in the Parliament.\n\nThe 1978 Constitution included substantial concessions to Tamil sensitivities. Although TULF did not participate in framing the Constitution, it continued to sit in Parliament in the hope of negotiating a settlement to the Tamil problem. TULF also agreed to Jayewardene's proposal of an all-party conference to resolve the island's ethnic problems. Jayewardene's UNP offered other concessions in a bid to secure peace. Sinhala remained the official language and the language of administration throughout Sri Lanka, but Tamil was given a new \"national language\" status. Tamil was to be used in a number of administrative and educational circumstances. Jayewardene also eliminated a major Tamil grievance by abrogating the \"standardization\" policy of the United Front government, which had made university admission criteria for Tamils more difficult. In addition, he offered many top-level positions, including that of minister of justice, to Tamil civil servants.\n\nWhile TULF, in conjunction with the UNP, pressed for the all-party conference, the Tamil Tigers escalated their terrorist attacks, which provoked Sinhalese backlash against Tamils and generally precluded any successful accommodation. In reaction to the assassination of a Jaffna police inspector, the Jayewardene government declared an emergency and dispatched troops, who were given an unrealistic six months to eradicate the terrorist threat.\n\nThe government passed the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act in 1979. The act was enacted as a temporary measure, but it later became permanent legislation. The International Commission of Jurists, Amnesty International, and other human rights organizations condemned the act as being incompatible with democratic traditions. Despite the act, the number of terrorist acts increased. Guerrillas began to hit targets of high symbolic value such as post offices and police outposts, provoking government counterattacks. As an increasing number of civilians were caught in the fighting, Tamil support widened for the \"boys\", as the guerrillas began to be called. Other large, well-armed groups began to compete with LTTE. The better-known included the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam, Tamil Eelam Liberation Army, and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization. Each of these groups had forces measured in the hundreds if not thousands. The government claimed that many of the terrorists were operating from training camps in India's Tamil Nadu State. The Indian government repeatedly denied this claim. With the level of violence mounting, the possibility of negotiation became increasingly distant.\n\n;Internal conflict\n{{Main|Sri Lankan Civil War|1987\u201389 JVP Insurrection}}\n\nIn July 1983, communal riots took place due to the ambush and killing of 13 Sri Lankan Army soldiers by the Tamil Tigers using the voters list, which contained the exact addresses of Tamils.

He appointed Wickremanayake as Prime Minister and [[Mangala Samaraweera]] as Foreign Minister. Negotiations with the LTTE stalled and a low-intensity conflict began. The violence dropped off after talks in February but escalated again in April and the conflict continued until the military defeat of the LTTE in May 2009.\n\nThe Sri Lanka government declared total victory on 18 May 2009. On 19 May 2009, the Sri Lankan military led by [[Sarath Fonseka|General Sarath Fonseka]], effectively concluded its 26-year operation against the LTTE, its military forces recaptured all remaining LTTE controlled territories in the Northern Province including Killinochchi (2 January), the Elephant Pass (9 January) and ultimately the entire district of Mullaitivu.\n\nOn 22 May 2009, Sri Lankan Defence Secretary [[Gotabhaya Rajapaksa]] confirmed that 6,261 personnel of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces had lost their lives and 29,551 were wounded during the [[Eelam War IV]] since July 2006.

It is located at the confluence of the [[Tagus]] and [[Jarama]] rivers, {{convert|42|km}} south of [[Madrid]], and {{convert|44|km}} from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. {{As of|2009}}, it had a population of 54,055. It is the 17th-largest city in the [[Community of Madrid]] and the [[Municipality of Madrid|autonomous community]]'s largest and most populous urban center outside [[Madrid metropolitan area|Greater Madrid Area]].\n\nIt has been one of the [[Patrimonio Nacional|Royal Estates]] of the [[Monarchy of Spain|Crown of Spain]] since the times of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in 1560. Until 1752, only the royalty and nobility were allowed to dwell in the town.\n\nThe Cultural Landscape of Aranjuez was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO in 2001.\n\n==History==\nThere are several theories about the origin of the name. The most widely accepted one states that it comes from the [[Basque language]], deriving from ''arantza'' (\"[[Crataegus|hawthorn]]\" in English). Another theory, attributed to Padre [[Mart\u00edn Sarmiento]], a Benedictine scholar who lived about a century after the founder of Aranjuez, [[Philip II of Spain]], claims the origin to be from [[Latin]] '''Ara Jovis''' or '''Ara Iovia''', which means the [[altar]] of the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] also known as [[Zeus]]. However the pre-Roman derivation is generally preferred.\n\nIn 1178, the area was acquired by the [[Order of Santiago]]. Ferdinand and Isabella, the \"[[Catholic monarchs]]\", converted Aranjuez into a [[Spanish royal sites|royal site]]. It was the Spring residence of the [[kings of Spain]] from the late 19th century.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Philip II of Spain]], in the second half of the 16th century, the [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|royal palace]] was constructed and the name of the enlarged settlement was changed from ''Alpajes'' to ''Aranjuez''. The site was initially designed by [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] and completed by [[Juan de Herrera]]. The town, or ''Villa'' was extensively redesigned in the 18th century by [[Santiago Bonav\u00eda]].\n\n==Bourbon Aranjuez==\n{{Infobox Historic Site\n| name =Aranjuez Cultural Landscape\n| native_name =  \n| native_language = \n| native_name2 =\n| native_language2 = \n| image = \n| caption =\n| locmapin =\n| map_caption =\n| elevation =\n| built =\n| architect = \n| architecture =\n| visitation_num =\n| visitation_year = \n| governing_body =\n| designation1 = WHS\n| designation1_offname = Aranjuez Cultural Landscape\n| designation1_date = [[List of World Heritage Sites by year of inscription#2001 (25th session)|2001]]<small>\u3000(25th [[World Heritage Committee|session]])</small>\n| designation1_number = 1044\n| designation1_criteria = ii, iv\n| designation1_type = Cultural\n| designation1_free1name = State Party\n| designation1_free1value = Spain\n| designation1_free2name = Region\n| designation1_free2value = [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe|Europe and North America]]\n}}\n\nMany significant events occurred here during the [[Enlightenment in Spain]]:\n\n*1752: During the reign of [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]] the town of Aranjuez, previously [[closed city|reserved]] for the royal family, nobles of the royal court and palace servants started to be opened as a town with overnight accommodation for visitors, who had previously been obliged to lodge in nearby settlements such as Oca\u00f1a. In that year the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1752)|First Treaty of Aranjuez]] recognized Austrian and Spanish interests in Italy\n* 1753: The [[weir]] in the [[Tagus]] River which is alongside to the Royal Palace of Aranjuez was constructed to power a [[water wheel]] for milling [[wheat flour]]. Since the mill was visible from the palace, it was architecturally attractive and sometimes used as the residence of the town governor. In the 20th century it was renovated to generate power, and was finally dismantled after a fire about 1950. As of 2014 only the mill races remained.\n* 1758: Queen [[Barbara of Portugal|Barbara de Braganza]], wife of Ferdinand VI, died in Aranjuez  \n* 1761: King [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] builds the so-called Long Bridge (about 300m long) over the river [[Jarama]]. This stone construction remains largely intact and now supports the M-305 service road about 5&nbsp;km north of the town.\n* 1765: Carlos III, a keen [[Physiocracy|physiocrat]] orders the construction of [[Real Cortijo de San Isidro]], a [[model farm]] which was abandoned by his successor (his second son, [[Charles IV of Spain]]) and later commercialized. The chapel and [[winery]] remain intact, both of which are national monuments open to the public\n* 1765 Carlos III orders the construction of the [[Franciscan]] [[Convento de San Pascual, Aranjuez|Convent of San Pascual]], later occupied by the [[Conceptionists]]. During the time of [[Francoist Spain]] it served as a [[Incarceration of women|women's prison]], and is currently a state assisted private church-run primary school. Opposite it he built Hospital San Carlos (abandoned in 1964 and now in ruins)\n* 1766 [[Isabella Farnese]], wife of [[Philip V of Spain]] and mother of Carlos III, who contributed greatly to the town's development, died in Aranjuez\n* 1767: The French architect [[Jaime Marquet]] began construction of the theatre Coliseo Carlos III, recently restored and reopened as ''Theatro Carlos III'' in 2014 \n* 1777: In the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1777)|3rd Treaty of Aranjuez]] France and Spain define their colonies in Santo Domingo\n* 1779: Spain becomes involved in the War of Independence of the United States by virtue of the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|3rd Treaty of Aranjuez]] \n* 1780 The [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1780)|4th Treaty of Aranjuez]], cedes Spanish territories in Africa to Morocco \n* 1801 in the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1801)|5th Treaty of Aranjuez]], publicly confirms the secret [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in which Spain returned the colonial territory of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]] to France.\n[[File:Ca\u00edda y prisi\u00f3n del Pr\u00edncipe de la Paz.JPG|thumb|200px|''Fall and imprisonment of [[Manuel Godoy|the Prince of Peace]]'' (Mutiny of Aranjuez) by Francisco de Paula Mart\u00ed and [[Zacar\u00edas Gonz\u00e1lez Vel\u00e1zquez|Zacar\u00edas Vel\u00e1zquez]] in 1814.]]\n* 1808 The [[Mutiny of Aranjuez]]. An uprising on 17 March 1808, when the royal family and the government were staying at Aranjuez while on their way south, anticipating a French invasion from the north. Soldiers, peasants and members of the general public assaulted [[Manuel Godoy|Godoy's]] quarters and captured him. The mutineers made King Charles dismiss Godoy, and two days later the court forced the King himself to abdicate in favor of his son and rival, who became Ferdinand VII.\n* 1833 Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] acceded to the throne and finally Aranjuez was reached by a railway line to [[Madrid]] in 1851. (a dramatized film of the event shows the former station and temporary rails leading into the palace, which is historically reasonably accurate). This was the second railway line in Spain, after that of [[Barcelona]]-[[Matar\u00f3]] (1848).\n\nIn 1939, [[Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo]] composed the ''[[Concierto de Aranjuez]]'', which would make Aranjuez famous all over the world.\n[[File:Aranjuez EstacionFFCC.jpg|thumb|left|Railway station]]\n[[File:Palacio Real de Aranjuez.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]]]]\n\n[[File:Embarcardero jardin principe aranjuez.jpg|thumb|Wharf in Tagus River.]]\n\n==Main sites==\nThe city was declared [[Conjunto Hist\u00f3rico-Art\u00edstico]] (\"Historic Artistic Junction\") in 1983.

The royal [[Church of San Antonio (Aranjuez)|Church of San Antonio]] which was built by [[Philip IV of Spain]] for both public and [[Military parade|ceremonial]] royal use, stands at the southern end of Plaza San Antonio popularly known as ''[[Mariblanca]]'', (possibly because it is a 'sea' of white sand or ''mar de arena blanca'' or else an allusion to the female statue of the fountain at the far end, which is the [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] of sculptor Juan Reyna in 1762).\n\n===Plaza de Toros===\n[[File:Aranjuez PalacioReal PlazaToros.jpg|thumb|right|View northwards over Plaza de Toros with Royal Palace and La Monta\u00f1a in the background]]\nA bullring, one of the earliest in Spain, the original was built in 1760 by order of [[Charles IV of Spain|King Charles IV]], the refurbished structure was opened by his wife, [[Maria Luisa of Parma]], on 14 May 1797. It had a capacity of 9000 spectators at a time when the population, according to the [[Manuel Godoy, Prince of the Peace|then prime minister]], was only 4226. There are twelve public entrances which lead to three circular galleries, each with 10 stone seating benches. Royalty and their guests enjoyed a private entrance with stairs leading directly to the royal box.\n\nFollowing a fire in 1809, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] had it rebuilt and donated it to the town, which installed a small museum (usually only open to the public Saturday, Sunday and Monday mornings at 11.15)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://turismoenaranjuez.com/aranjuez/plaza-de-toros|title=Plaza de toros|publisher=Turismo in Aranjuez (official site)|language=Spanish|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Buildings===\n[[File:Convento san pascual aranjuez.jpg|thumb|[[Convento de San Pascual, Aranjuez|Royal Convent of San Pascual]]]]\n[[File:Theatro Carlos III Aranjuez.JPG|thumb|Teatro Carlos III theatre built during [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]]'s reign.]]\nSights in the city include many buildings in addition to the 17th century Royal Palace and church mentioned above:\n* House of Trades and Knights\n* House of Infantes and Atarfe\n* Pleasure craft Museum\n* Farmhand's House\n* House of Employees (currently [[Town Hall]])\n* Alpajes Church\n* [[Saint Pascual's Royal Convent]]\n* Old Saint Charles' Hospital (to be restored)\n* [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III's]] Royal Theatre (recently restored and reopened in 2014)\n* Supply Market\n* Plaza de Toros and [[Bullfighting]] Museum \"Una Gran Fiesta\"\n* Medinaceli Palace\n* Governor's House (currently University of High Studies Centre Philip II)\n* Mother Queen's old garage, today cultural centre \"Isabel de Farnesio\"\n* Typical 'corralas' (buildings with running balconies around a central courtyard)\n* Godoy and Osuna Palaces\n* Silvela's Palace (also known as Bavaria's Palace)\n* Royal Country Estate of Saint Isidro\n\n[[File:Aranjuez Cultural Landscape-114470.jpg|alt=Fountain, Aranjuez Cultural Landscape|thumb|Fountain, Aranjuez Cultural Landscape]]\n\n===Parks and gardens===\nNumerous parks and gardens are open to the public (detailed in )\n* Isle Garden \u2013 to the north of the palace, bordered by the river (beyond weir) and a broad irrigation canal\n* Parterre Garden The formal garden and fountains in front of the palace and to the north of Mariblanca/San Isadro\n* Prince's Garden Along the river to the east, bordered by Calle de la Reina\n* Isabella II's Garden a small formal garden adjacent to Mariblanca/San Isidro\n* Historical thickets and woodlands\n* Centre of Interpretation of the Natural Reserve \"El Regajal-Mar de Ont\u00edgola\"\n* Tree-lined walks and rides through the former nursery gardens (now agriculture) at ''Doce Calles'' (12 ways roundabout on M-305 Northbound to Madrid)\n\n[[File:Kioscos chinescos aranjuez.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese Kiosks in 18th-century Jard\u00edn del Pr\u00edncipe garden.]]\n\n== Government and administration ==\n[[File:Aranjuez-barrios.png|thumb|right|The ''barrios'' or districts of Aranjuez]]\n[[File:Aranjuez casco.jpg|thumb|right|This is an orientation sketch of the Centro or old town and is not to scale]]\nThe city of Aranjuez is governed by a single municipal authority, which, for convenience divides into the several administrative districts which in turn may contain residential estates (''urbanizaciones):{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n* Centro, includes the royal sites, the bullring and the historic town center, with central market and shopping\n* Vergel \u2013 Olivas,\n* Pol\u00edgono de Las Aves, to the west near the railway station, near Pirelli & Jard\u00edn Narv\u00e1ez\n* Nuevo Aranjuez, to the south, on higher ground\n* Foso \u2013 Moreras associated with Garden City of Agfa, and ambitious, but as yet incomplete project\n* Urbanizaci\u00f3n Mirador de Aranjuez A vast, mostly failed (turn of the 20th\u201321st century) house-building project on a steep southerly slope overlooking the old town.\n* La Monta\u00f1a \u2013 new (turn of the 20th\u201321st century) district of about 5000 homes (Many 'toxic assets' still vacant) about {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the town.

The residents Association is known as Asociaci\u00f3n de Vecinos del Barrio de la Monta\u00f1a or AVBM.\n* Cortijo de San Isidro, a small residential settlement around a former royal hunting lodge, a volunteer sub-council represents residents interests.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe main pillars of the local economy are hotels and tourism. Aranjuez has always been an attractive city for tourists with its [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Royal Palace]], the [[gardens]], the [[Tagus]] river and the landscapes. In 2001 this city was designated as a [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] [[Cultural landscape]] by [[UNESCO]], and since then, tourism has kept on increasing until hit by the 2008 recession. Prior to 2008 much money was spent in order to beautify Aranjuez and many pubs and restaurants were opened (from 2001 to 2004 their number increased 22%).\n\n===La Monta\u00f1a===\nThis was a 'pharonic' ''proyecto de Actuaci\u00f3n Urban\u00edstica (PAU)'' of some 5000 mixed 'open market homes ''(Viviendas precio libre or VPL)'' of which, by 2012, something around one fifth were actually sold. The remainder are now owned by the 'bad bank' [[SAREB]]\nIn 2005 a major events and gambling installation [[casino|Gran Casino]] was opened in the (northern) barrio Monta\u00f1a near the existing conference centers of La Finca and Hotel Occidental Aranjuez (which includes an 18-hole golf course). Nearby, the ambitious Plaza commercial center, built but not fitted, has never opened, and the smaller enterprise center, although open, contains a local supermarket, two caf\u00e9s an English Academy and less than a dozen other small businesses. Finally, in March 2008 the University Hospital Tajo was opened. In 2013 this hospital, together with several others medical facilities in the [[Community of Madrid]] was threatened with privatisation, provoking considerable public protest known as the Marea Blanca (the white (coat) wave or tide).\n\n===Agriculture===\nAranjuez is located on the fertile plain in the deep, high sided valley (cuenca) of the river [[Tagus]] (the [[comarca]] Vega del Tajo), whose rich soil is suitable for growing wheat and other [[cereals]]. There are also horticultural [[plantations]], notably of [[asparagus]] and [[strawberry|strawberries]] but also (centered on [[Villaconejos]]) [[vineyard]]s and extensive production of [[melons]]. Typical of the neighbouring region of [[Castilla-La Mancha]] Aranjuez and the Vega del Tajo also produce a wide variety of products such as [[sorghum]], [[sunflower]]s, potatoes, tomatoes, [[artichoke]]s, [[Beta vulgaris|beets]] and [[Jalape\u00f1o]] peppers.\n\nThe Real Cortijo de San Isidro is a settlement about 6&nbsp;km north of Aranjuez where King [[Charles III of Spain]] established a royal farm in 1766, exploiting existing agricultural land. There is a village with a royal chapel (Hermitage) and a wine cellar (Bodegas del Real Cortijo de San Isidro)\n\n===Industry===\nThe proximity to [[Madrid]] and the good communications by road and rail made Aranjuez a suitable location for industry: [[detergents]], Mechanical engineering, computer and electrical material, photographic materials, [[pharmaceuticals|pharmaceutical]] products, [[paint]]s and [[varnish]]es, sugar refineries, and oil mills.\n\nThe majority of the industries are located to the west of the [[railroad|railway]] station or in the \"Gonzalo Chac\u00f3n\" [[industrial park]], in the south.

The A4 exit at kilometre 52 serves the south of the town, as does the [[R-4 motorway (Spain)|toll road Radial R-4]].\n\nSix main line bus routes serve the locality via the bus station, Las Infantas. Taxis and local bus services (four routes) link to the railway station.\n\nThe municipality provides a free public pedal bicycle scheme although there is a modest registration fee.\n\nThere is also a tourist ''Chiquitren road train'' which tours the town and the extensive ''jardin del principe'' royal garden.\n\n===Rail===\nAranjuez railway station building is richly ornamented in the neomud\u00e9jar style. It was built by the then operator ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda de los Ferrocarriles de Madrid a Zaragoza y Alicante'' between 1922 and 1927. It was recently renovated by RENFE, who operate an hourly shuttle service to Madrid and medium distance services to other destinations. The [[Strawberry train]] is a special [[Steam locomotive]] [[Heritage railway]] service provided for summer visitors and tourists.\n\n===River===\n[[File:Noria Aranjuez.webm|thumb|Hydrographic demonstration piece near the ancient noria of the barrio of La Monta\u00f1a, near Hospital Tajo, Aranjuez.]]\nThe river is obstructed and so used only by a local tourist boat and canoeists. There is an annual fun rafting competition run by ''the pirates of the tajo''.\n\nAn ancient irrigation system for the royal kitchen-gardens and orchards (now farmland) includes channels and a noria waterwheel, recently restored in a leisure area known as Talud Sur (south bank of) de La Monta\u00f1a de Aranjuez.

It is located at the confluence of the [[Tagus]] and [[Jarama]] rivers, {{convert|42|km}} south of [[Madrid]], and {{convert|44|km}} from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. {{As of|2009}}, it had a population of 54,055. It is the 17th-largest city in the [[Community of Madrid]] and the [[Municipality of Madrid|autonomous community]]'s largest and most populous urban center outside [[Madrid metropolitan area|Greater Madrid Area]].\n\nIt has been one of the [[Patrimonio Nacional|Royal Estates]] of the [[Monarchy of Spain|Crown of Spain]] since the times of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in 1560. Until 1752, only the royalty and nobility were allowed to dwell in the town.\n\nThe Cultural Landscape of Aranjuez was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO in 2001.\n\n==History==\nThere are several theories about the origin of the name. The most widely accepted one states that it comes from the [[Basque language]], deriving from ''arantza'' (\"[[Crataegus|hawthorn]]\" in English). Another theory, attributed to Padre [[Mart\u00edn Sarmiento]], a Benedictine scholar who lived about a century after the founder of Aranjuez, [[Philip II of Spain]], claims the origin to be from [[Latin]] '''Ara Jovis''' or '''Ara Iovia''', which means the [[altar]] of the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] also known as [[Zeus]]. However the pre-Roman derivation is generally preferred.\n\nIn 1178, the area was acquired by the [[Order of Santiago]]. Ferdinand and Isabella, the \"[[Catholic monarchs]]\", converted Aranjuez into a [[Spanish royal sites|royal site]]. It was the Spring residence of the [[kings of Spain]] from the late 19th century.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Philip II of Spain]], in the second half of the 16th century, the [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|royal palace]] was constructed and the name of the enlarged settlement was changed from ''Alpajes'' to ''Aranjuez''. The site was initially designed by [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] and completed by [[Juan de Herrera]]. The town, or ''Villa'' was extensively redesigned in the 18th century by [[Santiago Bonav\u00eda]].\n\n==Bourbon Aranjuez==\n{{Infobox Historic Site\n| name =Aranjuez Cultural Landscape\n| native_name =  \n| native_language = \n| native_name2 =\n| native_language2 = \n| image = \n| caption =\n| locmapin =\n| map_caption =\n| elevation =\n| built =\n| architect = \n| architecture =\n| visitation_num =\n| visitation_year = \n| governing_body =\n| designation1 = WHS\n| designation1_offname = Aranjuez Cultural Landscape\n| designation1_date = [[List of World Heritage Sites by year of inscription#2001 (25th session)|2001]]<small>\u3000(25th [[World Heritage Committee|session]])</small>\n| designation1_number = 1044\n| designation1_criteria = ii, iv\n| designation1_type = Cultural\n| designation1_free1name = State Party\n| designation1_free1value = Spain\n| designation1_free2name = Region\n| designation1_free2value = [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe|Europe and North America]]\n}}\n\nMany significant events occurred here during the [[Enlightenment in Spain]]:\n\n*1752: During the reign of [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]] the town of Aranjuez, previously [[closed city|reserved]] for the royal family, nobles of the royal court and palace servants started to be opened as a town with overnight accommodation for visitors, who had previously been obliged to lodge in nearby settlements such as Oca\u00f1a. In that year the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1752)|First Treaty of Aranjuez]] recognized Austrian and Spanish interests in Italy\n* 1753: The [[weir]] in the [[Tagus]] River which is alongside to the Royal Palace of Aranjuez was constructed to power a [[water wheel]] for milling [[wheat flour]]. Since the mill was visible from the palace, it was architecturally attractive and sometimes used as the residence of the town governor. In the 20th century it was renovated to generate power, and was finally dismantled after a fire about 1950. As of 2014 only the mill races remained.\n* 1758: Queen [[Barbara of Portugal|Barbara de Braganza]], wife of Ferdinand VI, died in Aranjuez  \n* 1761: King [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] builds the so-called Long Bridge (about 300m long) over the river [[Jarama]]. This stone construction remains largely intact and now supports the M-305 service road about 5&nbsp;km north of the town.\n* 1765: Carlos III, a keen [[Physiocracy|physiocrat]] orders the construction of [[Real Cortijo de San Isidro]], a [[model farm]] which was abandoned by his successor (his second son, [[Charles IV of Spain]]) and later commercialized.

An uprising on 17 March 1808, when the royal family and the government were staying at Aranjuez while on their way south, anticipating a French invasion from the north. Soldiers, peasants and members of the general public assaulted [[Manuel Godoy|Godoy's]] quarters and captured him. The mutineers made King Charles dismiss Godoy, and two days later the court forced the King himself to abdicate in favor of his son and rival, who became Ferdinand VII.\n* 1833 Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] acceded to the throne and finally Aranjuez was reached by a railway line to [[Madrid]] in 1851. (a dramatized film of the event shows the former station and temporary rails leading into the palace, which is historically reasonably accurate). This was the second railway line in Spain, after that of [[Barcelona]]-[[Matar\u00f3]] (1848).\n\nIn 1939, [[Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo]] composed the ''[[Concierto de Aranjuez]]'', which would make Aranjuez famous all over the world.\n[[File:Aranjuez EstacionFFCC.jpg|thumb|left|Railway station]]\n[[File:Palacio Real de Aranjuez.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]]]]\n\n[[File:Embarcardero jardin principe aranjuez.jpg|thumb|Wharf in Tagus River.]]\n\n==Main sites==\nThe city was declared [[Conjunto Hist\u00f3rico-Art\u00edstico]] (\"Historic Artistic Junction\") in 1983.

The royal [[Church of San Antonio (Aranjuez)|Church of San Antonio]] which was built by [[Philip IV of Spain]] for both public and [[Military parade|ceremonial]] royal use, stands at the southern end of Plaza San Antonio popularly known as ''[[Mariblanca]]'', (possibly because it is a 'sea' of white sand or ''mar de arena blanca'' or else an allusion to the female statue of the fountain at the far end, which is the [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] of sculptor Juan Reyna in 1762).\n\n===Plaza de Toros===\n[[File:Aranjuez PalacioReal PlazaToros.jpg|thumb|right|View northwards over Plaza de Toros with Royal Palace and La Monta\u00f1a in the background]]\nA bullring, one of the earliest in Spain, the original was built in 1760 by order of [[Charles IV of Spain|King Charles IV]], the refurbished structure was opened by his wife, [[Maria Luisa of Parma]], on 14 May 1797. It had a capacity of 9000 spectators at a time when the population, according to the [[Manuel Godoy, Prince of the Peace|then prime minister]], was only 4226. There are twelve public entrances which lead to three circular galleries, each with 10 stone seating benches. Royalty and their guests enjoyed a private entrance with stairs leading directly to the royal box.\n\nFollowing a fire in 1809, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] had it rebuilt and donated it to the town, which installed a small museum (usually only open to the public Saturday, Sunday and Monday mornings at 11.15)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://turismoenaranjuez.com/aranjuez/plaza-de-toros|title=Plaza de toros|publisher=Turismo in Aranjuez (official site)|language=Spanish|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Buildings===\n[[File:Convento san pascual aranjuez.jpg|thumb|[[Convento de San Pascual, Aranjuez|Royal Convent of San Pascual]]]]\n[[File:Theatro Carlos III Aranjuez.JPG|thumb|Teatro Carlos III theatre built during [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]]'s reign.]]\nSights in the city include many buildings in addition to the 17th century Royal Palace and church mentioned above:\n* House of Trades and Knights\n* House of Infantes and Atarfe\n* Pleasure craft Museum\n* Farmhand's House\n* House of Employees (currently [[Town Hall]])\n* Alpajes Church\n* [[Saint Pascual's Royal Convent]]\n* Old Saint Charles' Hospital (to be restored)\n* [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III's]] Royal Theatre (recently restored and reopened in 2014)\n* Supply Market\n* Plaza de Toros and [[Bullfighting]] Museum \"Una Gran Fiesta\"\n* Medinaceli Palace\n* Governor's House (currently University of High Studies Centre Philip II)\n* Mother Queen's old garage, today cultural centre \"Isabel de Farnesio\"\n* Typical 'corralas' (buildings with running balconies around a central courtyard)\n* Godoy and Osuna Palaces\n* Silvela's Palace (also known as Bavaria's Palace)\n* Royal Country Estate of Saint Isidro\n\n[[File:Aranjuez Cultural Landscape-114470.jpg|alt=Fountain, Aranjuez Cultural Landscape|thumb|Fountain, Aranjuez Cultural Landscape]]\n\n===Parks and gardens===\nNumerous parks and gardens are open to the public (detailed in )\n* Isle Garden \u2013 to the north of the palace, bordered by the river (beyond weir) and a broad irrigation canal\n* Parterre Garden The formal garden and fountains in front of the palace and to the north of Mariblanca/San Isadro\n* Prince's Garden Along the river to the east, bordered by Calle de la Reina\n* Isabella II's Garden a small formal garden adjacent to Mariblanca/San Isidro\n* Historical thickets and woodlands\n* Centre of Interpretation of the Natural Reserve \"El Regajal-Mar de Ont\u00edgola\"\n* Tree-lined walks and rides through the former nursery gardens (now agriculture) at ''Doce Calles'' (12 ways roundabout on M-305 Northbound to Madrid)\n\n[[File:Kioscos chinescos aranjuez.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese Kiosks in 18th-century Jard\u00edn del Pr\u00edncipe garden.]]\n\n== Government and administration ==\n[[File:Aranjuez-barrios.png|thumb|right|The ''barrios'' or districts of Aranjuez]]\n[[File:Aranjuez casco.jpg|thumb|right|This is an orientation sketch of the Centro or old town and is not to scale]]\nThe city of Aranjuez is governed by a single municipal authority, which, for convenience divides into the several administrative districts which in turn may contain residential estates (''urbanizaciones):{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n* Centro, includes the royal sites, the bullring and the historic town center, with central market and shopping\n* Vergel \u2013 Olivas,\n* Pol\u00edgono de Las Aves, to the west near the railway station, near Pirelli & Jard\u00edn Narv\u00e1ez\n* Nuevo Aranjuez, to the south, on higher ground\n* Foso \u2013 Moreras associated with Garden City of Agfa, and ambitious, but as yet incomplete project\n* Urbanizaci\u00f3n Mirador de Aranjuez A vast, mostly failed (turn of the 20th\u201321st century) house-building project on a steep southerly slope overlooking the old town.\n* La Monta\u00f1a \u2013 new (turn of the 20th\u201321st century) district of about 5000 homes (Many 'toxic assets' still vacant) about {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the town. It has the district Hospital-Tajo, a 4-star Hotel-Barcelo with spa and 18-hole golf-course, Gran-Casino, La Finca event venue, a vast commercial centre (Plaza) and car-park which was built but never opened, and a business campus Centro Empresial which contains the small-business support unit APME, a substantial supermarket and a few small businesses. Various shops are to be found elsewhere about the ''barrio''. The residents Association is known as Asociaci\u00f3n de Vecinos del Barrio de la Monta\u00f1a or AVBM.\n* Cortijo de San Isidro, a small residential settlement around a former royal hunting lodge, a volunteer sub-council represents residents interests.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe main pillars of the local economy are hotels and tourism. Aranjuez has always been an attractive city for tourists with its [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Royal Palace]], the [[gardens]], the [[Tagus]] river and the landscapes. In 2001 this city was designated as a [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] [[Cultural landscape]] by [[UNESCO]], and since then, tourism has kept on increasing until hit by the 2008 recession. Prior to 2008 much money was spent in order to beautify Aranjuez and many pubs and restaurants were opened (from 2001 to 2004 their number increased 22%).\n\n===La Monta\u00f1a===\nThis was a 'pharonic' ''proyecto de Actuaci\u00f3n Urban\u00edstica (PAU)'' of some 5000 mixed 'open market homes ''(Viviendas precio libre or VPL)'' of which, by 2012, something around one fifth were actually sold. The remainder are now owned by the 'bad bank' [[SAREB]]\nIn 2005 a major events and gambling installation [[casino|Gran Casino]] was opened in the (northern) barrio Monta\u00f1a near the existing conference centers of La Finca and Hotel Occidental Aranjuez (which includes an 18-hole golf course). Nearby, the ambitious Plaza commercial center, built but not fitted, has never opened, and the smaller enterprise center, although open, contains a local supermarket, two caf\u00e9s an English Academy and less than a dozen other small businesses. Finally, in March 2008 the University Hospital Tajo was opened. In 2013 this hospital, together with several others medical facilities in the [[Community of Madrid]] was threatened with privatisation, provoking considerable public protest known as the Marea Blanca (the white (coat) wave or tide).\n\n===Agriculture===\nAranjuez is located on the fertile plain in the deep, high sided valley (cuenca) of the river [[Tagus]] (the [[comarca]] Vega del Tajo), whose rich soil is suitable for growing wheat and other [[cereals]]. There are also horticultural [[plantations]], notably of [[asparagus]] and [[strawberry|strawberries]] but also (centered on [[Villaconejos]]) [[vineyard]]s and extensive production of [[melons]]. Typical of the neighbouring region of [[Castilla-La Mancha]] Aranjuez and the Vega del Tajo also produce a wide variety of products such as [[sorghum]], [[sunflower]]s, potatoes, tomatoes, [[artichoke]]s, [[Beta vulgaris|beets]] and [[Jalape\u00f1o]] peppers.\n\nThe Real Cortijo de San Isidro is a settlement about 6&nbsp;km north of Aranjuez where King [[Charles III of Spain]] established a royal farm in 1766, exploiting existing agricultural land. There is a village with a royal chapel (Hermitage) and a wine cellar (Bodegas del Real Cortijo de San Isidro)\n\n===Industry===\nThe proximity to [[Madrid]] and the good communications by road and rail made Aranjuez a suitable location for industry: [[detergents]], Mechanical engineering, computer and electrical material, photographic materials, [[pharmaceuticals|pharmaceutical]] products, [[paint]]s and [[varnish]]es, sugar refineries, and oil mills.\n\nThe majority of the industries are located to the west of the [[railroad|railway]] station or in the \"Gonzalo Chac\u00f3n\" [[industrial park]], in the south.

The A4 exit at kilometre 52 serves the south of the town, as does the [[R-4 motorway (Spain)|toll road Radial R-4]].\n\nSix main line bus routes serve the locality via the bus station, Las Infantas. Taxis and local bus services (four routes) link to the railway station.\n\nThe municipality provides a free public pedal bicycle scheme although there is a modest registration fee.\n\nThere is also a tourist ''Chiquitren road train'' which tours the town and the extensive ''jardin del principe'' royal garden.\n\n===Rail===\nAranjuez railway station building is richly ornamented in the neomud\u00e9jar style.

It was recently renovated by RENFE, who operate an hourly shuttle service to Madrid and medium distance services to other destinations.

There is an annual fun rafting competition run by ''the pirates of the tajo''.\n\nAn ancient irrigation system for the royal kitchen-gardens and orchards (now farmland) includes channels and a noria waterwheel, recently restored in a leisure area known as Talud Sur (south bank of) de La Monta\u00f1a de Aranjuez.

However, his performance in [[Sooraj R.

The film emerged as the second highest-grossing [[Bollywood films of 2005|Bollywood film of 2005]], and earned him a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]].

However, his performance in [[Sooraj R.

It covers most of the [[London postal area]] of [[W postcode area|W14]], including the area around [[Barons Court tube station]], and is defined as the area between [[Lillie Road]] and Hammersmith Road to the west, Fulham Palace Road to the south, [[Hammersmith]] to the north and [[West Brompton]] and [[Earl's Court]] to the east. The area is bisected by the major London artery the [[A4 road (England)|A4]], locally known as the [[Talgarth Road]]. Its main local thoroughfare is the [[North End Road, Fulham|North End Road]].\n\nIt is predominantly a dense residential area with the [[Queen's Club]] in its midst and is bordered by the [[Lillie Bridge Depot|Lillie Bridge railway depot]], the now defunct [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]] site, [[Olympia Exhibition Centre]] and the commercial centres at [[Fulham Broadway|Fulham]] and [[Hammersmith Broadway]].\n\n===The name===\n\"West Kensington\" is an early marketing construct, a ploy by two [[Victorian era|Victorian]] developers who found they had trouble selling their rapidly erected estate of terraced housing in the hamlet of North End on the outskirts of the village of [[Walham Green]]. In 1876 William Henry Gibbs and John P. Flew, builders from [[Dorset]], decided to capitalise on their modest success in [[Kensington]], by speculatively building 1,200 houses on the market gardens west of the [[West London Railway]] in Fulham. However, the housing slump of the 1880s left them with many unsold properties. They succeeded in persuading the [[Metropolitan Borough of Fulham]] to have North End renamed 'West Kensington' to attract new investors to their empty houses.<ref>'The Edwardes estate: Warwick Road (north) and West Cromwell Road', in Survey of London: Volume 42, Kensington Square To Earl's Court, ed.

B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Fulham Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\nFrom the [[High Middle Ages]], the hamlet of North End in the [[County of Middlesex]] was mainly farmland and market gardens, with a few scattered houses along North End Lane which wound its way from Walham Green to the trunk road linking the parishes of Hammersmith and Kensington. The main topographical feature was [[Counter's Creek]], a tributary of the [[Thames River]], rising in [[Kensal Green]], which marked the parish boundary. Among the notable residents who had settled in this quiet rural retreat were [[Samuel Richardson]], [[Samuel Foote]], [[Francesco Bartolozzi]], Sir [[John Scott Lillie|John Lillie]] and then in the late 19th century, the artists [[Edward Burne-Jones|Edward]] and [[Georgiana Burne-Jones]].\n\nThe quiet of North End was sorely disturbed from 1824 onwards when local landowner [[William Edwardes, 2nd Baron Kensington]], along with several others, decided to cash in on the already waning canal boom by converting a section of Counter's Creek into the [[Kensington Canal]].<ref name = histonline>British History Online, ''The Kensington Canal, railways and related developments'', The Institute of Historical Research and the History of Parliament Trust, online at [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50329]</ref><ref>Deposited plans, House of Lords Records Office, quoted in British History Online</ref> It was not a success. Eventually the canal was filled in, and in mid 19th century it became a railway and the creek was turned into a sewer. With it came gradual urbanisation, which drew in various developers including Gibbs and Flew. Apart from their unsold houses, there was the problem of accessibility. A bridge was needed over the railways, but despite Gibbs and Flew trying to finance it, it led to their bankruptcy and the dissolution of the partnership in 1885. Gibbs and Flew thereafter carried on separate businesses with a measure of success in Fulham.<ref>{{cite book|author=Denny, Barbara|date=1997|title= ''Fulham Past''| publisher=London: Historical Publications|pages=69\u201370|isbn= 0 948667 43 5}}</ref>\n\n===Barons Court===\n[[File:Gwendwr Gardens, Gwendwr Road W14 - geograph.org.uk - 1288544.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gwendwr Gardens]], Gwendwr Road W14]]\n[[Margravine Cemetery]] and some of the streets near Barons Court station, recall the brief sojourn in the [[County of Middlesex]] of the last Margrave of Brandenburg, [[Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]] (1736-1806) and his second wife, the English Lady [[Elizabeth Craven]], who in 1792 bought the handsome mansion on the Thames at Fulham, originally built by Sir [[Nicholas Crisp]] in the 17th century and renamed it \"Brandenburg House\". After the Margrave died, his wife, the Margravine, occupied it till her retirement to [[Naples]] in 1819. Between 1820 and 1822 it was lent by the Margravine to [[Caroline of Brunswick]], the detested consort of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] who lived and died there. After Queen Caroline's death, the Margravine first sold off the contents of the house, then had the property demolished and sold the grounds for industrial development.

There are some interesting examples of [[Victorian architecture]], with several houses and some entire streets [[listed building|listed]] \u2013 including the imposing [[mansion block]]s of Fitzgeorge Avenue (off [[North End Road, Fulham|North End Road]]) and the mansion blocks around Avonmore Road including, Glyn Mansions (Built 1897), Avonmore Mansions and Avonmore Gardens (Built 1893) which is located next to the new Kensington Village development. West Kensington Court was purpose built and completed in 1938 with a view of providing what were considered at the time luxury flats for young professionals and families wishing to move from older-style properties. There are also a number of ex-local authority and local authority buildings around the North End Road, including the recently renovated Lytton Estate. Many of buildings have been sold off. A more recent private development, St Paul's Court, was built in 1980 on part of the vast former site of St Paul's School.\n\nSince much of the housing is in the rented sector, West Kensington has become a cosmopolitan enclave. There are significant populations of Arabs, Americans, Australians, New Zealanders, Irish, Italians, Spaniards, and French, encouraged by nearby private schools teaching in their native language can be found around Brook Green. The area also has a large student population, serving [[Imperial College London]], [[Charing Cross Hospital]], [[South Kensington]], [[Hammersmith]] and other [[Central London]] Universities.\n\nAvonmore Road. built in the 1880s, has been dubbed \"Kensington Village\". [[Whiteleys]] Furniture Repositories, laundry and stables, built along the [[West London line]], belonged to London's first department store in [[Westbourne Grove]]. The high-ceilinged Warwick Building was used as a depository for Whiteleys-sourced furnishings (grand pianos, chaise longues, oriental room dividers, mahogany wardrobes) for the use of customers who were resident in the colonies. Kensington Village now consists of a blend of modernised Victorian buildings, such as the Warwick Building, and modern additions such as the Pembroke Building, built in a similar style with London stock brick and red lintels and full-height glazing.\n\n==Commerce and education==\n[[File:LAMDA building.jpg|thumb|The [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art|LAMDA]] building in Talgarth Road]]\nLocal business consists of small shops, offices and restaurants, with the [[Olympia, London|Olympia Exhibition Centre]] nearby.

It covers most of the [[London postal area]] of [[W postcode area|W14]], including the area around [[Barons Court tube station]], and is defined as the area between [[Lillie Road]] and Hammersmith Road to the west, Fulham Palace Road to the south, [[Hammersmith]] to the north and [[West Brompton]] and [[Earl's Court]] to the east. The area is bisected by the major London artery the [[A4 road (England)|A4]], locally known as the [[Talgarth Road]]. Its main local thoroughfare is the [[North End Road, Fulham|North End Road]].\n\nIt is predominantly a dense residential area with the [[Queen's Club]] in its midst and is bordered by the [[Lillie Bridge Depot|Lillie Bridge railway depot]], the now defunct [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]] site, [[Olympia Exhibition Centre]] and the commercial centres at [[Fulham Broadway|Fulham]] and [[Hammersmith Broadway]].\n\n===The name===\n\"West Kensington\" is an early marketing construct, a ploy by two [[Victorian era|Victorian]] developers who found they had trouble selling their rapidly erected estate of terraced housing in the hamlet of North End on the outskirts of the village of [[Walham Green]]. In 1876 William Henry Gibbs and John P. Flew, builders from [[Dorset]], decided to capitalise on their modest success in [[Kensington]], by speculatively building 1,200 houses on the market gardens west of the [[West London Railway]] in Fulham. However, the housing slump of the 1880s left them with many unsold properties. They succeeded in persuading the [[Metropolitan Borough of Fulham]] to have North End renamed 'West Kensington' to attract new investors to their empty houses.<ref>'The Edwardes estate: Warwick Road (north) and West Cromwell Road', in Survey of London: Volume 42, Kensington Square To Earl's Court, ed.

B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Fulham Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\nFrom the [[High Middle Ages]], the hamlet of North End in the [[County of Middlesex]] was mainly farmland and market gardens, with a few scattered houses along North End Lane which wound its way from Walham Green to the trunk road linking the parishes of Hammersmith and Kensington. The main topographical feature was [[Counter's Creek]], a tributary of the [[Thames River]], rising in [[Kensal Green]], which marked the parish boundary. Among the notable residents who had settled in this quiet rural retreat were [[Samuel Richardson]], [[Samuel Foote]], [[Francesco Bartolozzi]], Sir [[John Scott Lillie|John Lillie]] and then in the late 19th century, the artists [[Edward Burne-Jones|Edward]] and [[Georgiana Burne-Jones]].\n\nThe quiet of North End was sorely disturbed from 1824 onwards when local landowner [[William Edwardes, 2nd Baron Kensington]], along with several others, decided to cash in on the already waning canal boom by converting a section of Counter's Creek into the [[Kensington Canal]].<ref name = histonline>British History Online, ''The Kensington Canal, railways and related developments'', The Institute of Historical Research and the History of Parliament Trust, online at [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50329]</ref><ref>Deposited plans, House of Lords Records Office, quoted in British History Online</ref> It was not a success. Eventually the canal was filled in, and in mid 19th century it became a railway and the creek was turned into a sewer. With it came gradual urbanisation, which drew in various developers including Gibbs and Flew. Apart from their unsold houses, there was the problem of accessibility. A bridge was needed over the railways, but despite Gibbs and Flew trying to finance it, it led to their bankruptcy and the dissolution of the partnership in 1885. Gibbs and Flew thereafter carried on separate businesses with a measure of success in Fulham.<ref>{{cite book|author=Denny, Barbara|date=1997|title= ''Fulham Past''| publisher=London: Historical Publications|pages=69\u201370|isbn= 0 948667 43 5}}</ref>\n\n===Barons Court===\n[[File:Gwendwr Gardens, Gwendwr Road W14 - geograph.org.uk - 1288544.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gwendwr Gardens]], Gwendwr Road W14]]\n[[Margravine Cemetery]] and some of the streets near Barons Court station, recall the brief sojourn in the [[County of Middlesex]] of the last Margrave of Brandenburg, [[Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]] (1736-1806) and his second wife, the English Lady [[Elizabeth Craven]], who in 1792 bought the handsome mansion on the Thames at Fulham, originally built by Sir [[Nicholas Crisp]] in the 17th century and renamed it \"Brandenburg House\". After the Margrave died, his wife, the Margravine, occupied it till her retirement to [[Naples]] in 1819. Between 1820 and 1822 it was lent by the Margravine to [[Caroline of Brunswick]], the detested consort of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] who lived and died there. After Queen Caroline's death, the Margravine first sold off the contents of the house, then had the property demolished and sold the grounds for industrial development.

There are some interesting examples of [[Victorian architecture]], with several houses and some entire streets [[listed building|listed]] \u2013 including the imposing [[mansion block]]s of Fitzgeorge Avenue (off [[North End Road, Fulham|North End Road]]) and the mansion blocks around Avonmore Road including, Glyn Mansions (Built 1897), Avonmore Mansions and Avonmore Gardens (Built 1893) which is located next to the new Kensington Village development. West Kensington Court was purpose built and completed in 1938 with a view of providing what were considered at the time luxury flats for young professionals and families wishing to move from older-style properties. There are also a number of ex-local authority and local authority buildings around the North End Road, including the recently renovated Lytton Estate. Many of buildings have been sold off. A more recent private development, St Paul's Court, was built in 1980 on part of the vast former site of St Paul's School.\n\nSince much of the housing is in the rented sector, West Kensington has become a cosmopolitan enclave. There are significant populations of Arabs, Americans, Australians, New Zealanders, Irish, Italians, Spaniards, and French, encouraged by nearby private schools teaching in their native language can be found around Brook Green. The area also has a large student population, serving [[Imperial College London]], [[Charing Cross Hospital]], [[South Kensington]], [[Hammersmith]] and other [[Central London]] Universities.\n\nAvonmore Road. built in the 1880s, has been dubbed \"Kensington Village\". [[Whiteleys]] Furniture Repositories, laundry and stables, built along the [[West London line]], belonged to London's first department store in [[Westbourne Grove]]. The high-ceilinged Warwick Building was used as a depository for Whiteleys-sourced furnishings (grand pianos, chaise longues, oriental room dividers, mahogany wardrobes) for the use of customers who were resident in the colonies. Kensington Village now consists of a blend of modernised Victorian buildings, such as the Warwick Building, and modern additions such as the Pembroke Building, built in a similar style with London stock brick and red lintels and full-height glazing.\n\n==Commerce and education==\n[[File:LAMDA building.jpg|thumb|The [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art|LAMDA]] building in Talgarth Road]]\nLocal business consists of small shops, offices and restaurants, with the [[Olympia, London|Olympia Exhibition Centre]] nearby.
