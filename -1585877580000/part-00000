Following appearances in the musical ''[[Tom Sawyer (1973 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'' (1973) and [[Martin Scorsese]]'s comedy-drama ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), Foster's breakthrough came with Scorsese's psychological thriller ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), in which she played a child prostitute; at age 14, she received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. Her other roles as a teenager include the musical ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'' (1976) and the thriller ''[[The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane]]'' (1976), and she became a popular teen idol by starring in Disney's ''[[Freaky Friday (1976 film)|Freaky Friday]]'' (1976) and ''[[Candleshoe]]'' (1977), as well as ''[[Carny (1980 film)|Carny]]'' (1980) and ''[[Foxes (film)|Foxes]]'' (1980).\n\nAfter attending college at [[Yale University|Yale]], Foster struggled to transition into adult roles until she gained critical acclaim for playing a rape survivor in the legal drama ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'' (1988), for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She won her second Academy Award three years later for the psychological horror ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991), in which she portrayed [[Clarice Starling]]. Foster made her debut as a film director the same year with ''[[Little Man Tate]]'', and founded her own production company, Egg Pictures, in 1992. The company's first production was ''[[Nell (film)|Nell]]'' (1994), in which she also played the title role, garnering her fourth nomination for an Academy Award. Her other successful films in the 1990s were the romantic drama ''[[Sommersby]]'', western comedy ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'' (1994), science fiction ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997), and period drama ''[[Anna and the King]]'' (1999).\n\nFoster experienced career setbacks in the early 2000s, including the cancellation of a film project and the closing down of her production company, but she then starred in four commercially successful thrillers: ''[[Panic Room]]'' (2002), ''[[Flightplan]]'' (2005), ''[[Inside Man]]'' (2006), and ''[[The Brave One (2007 film)|The Brave One]]'' (2007).

During their loud discussion, they discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them what happened. The Dwarfs take pity on her, saying: \"If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want.\" They warn her to be careful when alone at home, and to not let anyone in while they are [[wikt:delve#English|delving]] in the mountains.\n\nWhen the Queen disguised as an old [[peddler]] ties a colorful, silky [[bodice]] onto Snow White which causes her to faint, the Seven Dwarfs return just in time and Snow White revives when the Dwarfs loosen the lace. When the Queen dresses as a [[comb]] seller and gives Snow White a poisoned comb, the Seven Dwarfs save her again. The Queen then appears disguised as a [[farmer]]'s wife and gives Snow White a poisoned apple, of which she takes a bite. This time, the Seven Dwarfs are unable to revive the girl, because they can't find the source of Snow White's poor health and, assuming that she is dead, they place her in a glass [[coffin]]. After some time has passed, a Prince traveling through the land sees Snow White where he strides to her coffin, and instantly falls in love with her upon being enchanted by her beauty. The Prince kisses her which revives her.\n\n==Names==\nThe following is a list of names of the Seven Dwarfs from multiple versions of the [[Snow White]] story.

He is accident-prone and mute, with Happy explaining that he has simply \"never tried\" to speak. He is unvoiced like [[The Fox and the Cat#In Disney media|Gideon the Cat]] in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', the title character as the circus elephant [[Dumbo]], and [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)#Disney's Peter Pan films|Tootles]] in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''.\n* '''Bashful''' (voiced by [[Scotty Mattraw]] in the film, [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 Bashful is very [[Shyness|shy]] and kind-hearted. He is also described as cute. He also has a rosy blushy face and a small shy smile.\n* '''Grumpy''' (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]] in the film, [[Corey Burton]]) \u2013 Grumpy initially opposes [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]'s presence in the dwarfs' home, but later warns her of the threat posed by the Queen and eagerly rushes to her aid upon realizing that she is in danger, leading the charge himself. He has the biggest nose of the dwarfs, and is frequently seen with one eye shut.\n* '''Sneezy''' (voiced by [[Billy Gilbert]] in the film, [[Bob Joles]]) \u2013 Sneezy's name is earned by his extraordinarily powerful sneezes (caused by [[hay fever]]), which are seen blowing even the heaviest of objects across a room.\n* '''Sleepy''' (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]] in the film, [[Bill Farmer]]) \u2013 Sleepy is always tired and appears [[Lethargy|lethargic]] in most situations.\n* '''Happy''' (voiced by [[Otis Harlan]] in the film, [[Stephen Stanton]]) \u2013 Happy is the jovial dwarf and is usually portrayed laughing.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs also appeared in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]''.\n[[File:B-29 Doc McConnell Air Force Base July 17, 2016.jpg|thumb|Built during World War II, ''[[Doc (aircraft)|Doc]]'', a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], was named after one of the Seven Disney Dwarfs.]]\nIn the early 2000s, [[DisneyToon Studios]] (DTS) joined [[Disney Consumer Products]] (DCP) as their internal Disney conglomerate video partner in developing the new Disney franchises. While DCP eyed other potential franchises, DisneyToon looked to the [[Seven Dwarfs#The Walt Disney Company|Seven Dwarfs]] for a male-centric franchise to counterbalance the female-centric Fairies. By 2005, ''The Seven Dwarfs'' computer-animated sequel to ''Snow White'' was officially underway. [[Paul and Ga\u00ebtan Brizzi]] was one team that was given an attempt at a movie pitch, which was to follow the Dwarfs in which they trap the villain in the magic mirror and setting it up for ''Snow White'' movie. Given the possible demand, [[Disney Interactive Studios|Buena Vista Games]] brought in [[Obsidian Entertainment]], a game developer, who pitched a video game focusing on the Dwarfs' similar ancestors. DTS executives were not feeling that the two franchise launching projects were coming together well enough that they turned to [[Mike Disa]], who worked on the Tinker Bell movie story. Disa and [[Evan Spiliotopoulos]] pitched a ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''-style epic for the dwarfs while \"connecting seamlessly\" with the original movie, which was given permission to move forward. With interfering managers wanting a tragic back story for Dopey, Disa decided that he could not go forward. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]] about two month later ended production on the film.<ref name=av0>{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Josh|title=Mike Disa and The Seven Dwarfs: How the Snow White prequel became a Dopey movie|url=http://animatedviews.com/2013/mike-disa-and-the-seven-dwarfs-how-the-snow-white-prequel-became-a-dopey-movie/|website=Animated Views.com|publisher=Animated Views|accessdate=June 12, 2014|date=August 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[The 7D]]'' is an American [[animated]] [[Television program|television series]] produced by [[Disney Television Animation]] franchise based on ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. This series is the first [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Walt Disney Animation Studios]] classic series. The TV series details the 7D working for Queen Delightful where they protect Jollywood from the Glooms and other threats.<ref name=av0/>\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs were given a new theme park attraction called the [[Seven Dwarfs Mine Train]] coaster.<ref name=av0/>\n\nIn ''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]'' and ''[[Descendants 2]]'', Dopey is shown to have a son named Doug (portrayed by Zachary Gibson) who can talk and becomes smitten by Evil Queen's daughter Evie. In the Descendants novel ''The Isle of the Lost'', Doc is shown to be sympathetic towards the Goblins that operate on the Isle of the Lost's Goblin Wharf where they want amnesty for their involvement with Maleficent.\n\n===[[Sesame Street]]===\nIn ''[[Sesame Street]]'', there were different versions of the Seven Dwarfs where each of them was made from Anything Muppets.\n* The Six Dwarfs seen in Episode 279 consisted of Sparky (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Snooky (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Pokey (performed by [[Jim Henson]]), Flakey (performed by [[Jim Henson]]), Drippy (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), and Sneaky (performed by [[Jim Henson]]). Snow White visited their house instead of the Seven Dwarfs by mistake and was able to see the difference.\n* In a [[Sesame Street News Flash]] that was seen in Episode 2787, the Seven Emotional Dwarfs appear where they were interviewed by [[Kermit the Frog]]. Their names are Cheerful (performed by [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]), Sad (performed by [[Kevin Clash]]), Angry (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Proud (performed by [[Martin P. Robinson]]), Fearful (performed by [[David Rudman]]), Lovey (performed by James Kroupa), and Surprised (performed by [[Jim Martin (puppeteer)|Jim Martin]]).\n* In Episode 4114, the Seven Dwarfs appear opposite Snow White (played by [[Amy Sedaris]]). The Seven Dwarfs consist of Clumsy (performed by [[Joey Mazzarino]]), Vertigo (performed by [[Fran Brill]]), Gassy (performed by [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]]), Itchy (performed by [[Carmen Osbahr]]), Smelly (performed by [[Martin P. Robinson]]), Sensitive-Nose (performed by Ryan Dillon), and Hammy (performed by [[Eric Jacobson]]).\n\n===Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics===\nIn the \"Snow White\" episode of ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'', the Seven Dwarfs are named Sunday (voiced by Clifton Wells in the English dub), Monday (voiced by [[Kerrigan Mahan]] in the English dub), Tuesday, Wednesday (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]] in the English dub), Thursday, Friday (voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] in the English dub), and Saturday (voiced by [[Edward Mannix]] in the English dub) and are shown to be allied with a pack of wolves.\n\n===Happily Ever After===\nIn ''[[Happily Ever After (1993 film)|Happily Ever After]]'', it was mentioned that the Seven Dwarfs have opened up a mine in the next kingdom. In their place is the Seven Dwarfelles who have received a power based on nature to help out their boss [[Mother Nature]].\n\nThe Dwarfelles consisted of:\n* '''Muddy''' (voiced by [[Carol Channing]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over the earth, and as such performs such tricks as causing minor tremors and such. She feels most comfortable playing in the mud.\n* '''Sunburn''' (voiced by [[Sally Kellerman]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over sunlight, and is able to focus sun rays in any area and to whatever extremity she so wishes. She uses her power in the film to clear away clouds and summon down a beam of light to illuminate a dark cave. She has a New Yorker accent and attitude and her catchphrase is \"This really BURNS me up!\".\n* '''Blossom''' (voiced by [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over plants and flowers, and is seen throughout the animation zapping the ground and having flowers spring up. It becomes apparent that her flora powers are less effective if the area is less natural or adaptable, as in the Realm of Doom. Blossom is very reminiscent of her voice actress with Gabor's mannerisms, penchant for the beautiful and fashionable, and even her signature accent.\n* '''Marina''' (voiced by [[Linda Gary]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over all lakes and rivers, but the only example of her powers in the film is being able to breathe underwater. Marina carries herself as a gentlewoman and has a British accent.\n* '''Critterina''' (voiced by [[Linda Gary]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power of all animals who are created by Mother Nature. She is able to communicate with all animals, regardless of their creators, but does not have control over animals who are not Mother Nature's work like Lord Maliss' one-horned wolves. Although the other Dwarfelles are human in appearance, Critterina looks anthropomorphic. She aptly has a cowgirl mentality and a Texan accent.\n* '''Moonbeam''' (voiced by [[Tracey Ullman]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle is never seen using her powers, but has the distinct characteristic of being in a deep slumber and sleepwalking in the day, and only awaking at night.\n* '''Thunderella''' (voiced by [[Tracey Ullman]]) \u2013 The seventh and youngest Dwarfelle, and is considered the 'black sheep' of the seven because of her inability to control her powers. She has power over weather, and always seems to mess her attempts at creating storms. She ends up saving the day by hitting Lord Maliss with a bolt of lightning she creates from her fingertip.\n\nThe Dwarfelles helped Snow White on her quest to rescue the Prince from the Queen's sorcerer brother Lord Maliss.\n\n===Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child===\nIn ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', the show's adaption of \"Snow White\" that takes place in the American southwest depicts the Seven Dwarves as seven mystical little men who came from the north to mine turquoise. They consist of:\n\n* '''Bright Silver''' (voiced by [[Pato Hoffmann]]) \u2013 The leader of the seven little men.\n* '''Fool's Gold''' (voiced by [[Burr DeBenning]]) \u2013 The clumsiest little man.\n* '''Smelly Sulfur''' (voiced by [[Burr DeBenning]]) \u2013 The smelliest little man.\n* '''Hard Jade''' (voiced by Tim Sampson) \u2013 The strongest little man.\n* '''Rough Copper''' (voiced by Jim Great Elk Waters) \u2013 Named for his temper. \n* '''Sharp Flint''' (voiced by [[Michael Horse]]) \u2013 Named for his sharp tongue. \n* '''Heavy Metal''' (voiced by Sonny Skyhawk/Sonny Roubideaux) \u2013 The hungriest little man.\n\n===Shrek===\nThe Seven Dwarfs appear in the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' series.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek]]'', the Seven Dwarfs appear in the first film carrying Snow White's coffin. When they place the coffin on the table, Shrek says \"Oh no no no no! Dead broad off the table!\" One of the Dwarfs says \"Where else are we supposed to put it? The bed's already been taken.\" Shrek promptly finds the [[Big Bad Wolf]] in his bed.\n\nThey are seen again at the start of ''[[Shrek 2]]'', giving Shrek a ring engraved with \"I love you\" in flaming letters for Fiona (in an allusion to the [[One Ring]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'').\n\nIn ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', one of them is given to Fiona as a wedding present (as a [[babysitter]]) from Snow White who says she has six more at home.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs are seen at the end of ''Scared Shrekless'' when Shrek and Fiona celebrate by egging them.\n \nIn ''[[Shrek The Musical]]'', one of the dwarfs [[Grumpy (dwarf)|Grumpy]] knew that he abandoned [[Farquaad]] in the woods as a child after his wife the princess [[The Princess and the Pea]] falls out of 25 mattresses. However, when the fairytale characters brought Grumpy to Farquaad's wedding, he reveals that he kicked Farquaad out because he was twenty-eight years old and living in his basement.\n\n===Mirror Mirror===\nIn ''[[Mirror Mirror (film)|Mirror Mirror]]'', the Seven Dwarfs work as [[highwayman|Highwaymen]] and rob from anyone that comes down their way by wearing boots with retractable stilts that make them look taller. The Seven Dwarfs consist of:\n* '''Will Grimm''' (played by [[Danny Woodburn]]) \u2013 The leader of the Seven Dwarfs. He is named after the Brothers Grimm.\n* '''Butcher''' (played by [[Martin Klebba]]) \u2013 A Dwarf that used to work as a [[butcher]].\n* '''Wolf''' (played by Sebastian Saraceno) \u2013 A Dwarf in a [[Gray wolf|wolf]] cape.\n* '''Napoleon''' (played by [[Jordan Prentice]]) \u2013 A Dwarf that wears a hat similar to [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n* '''Half Pint''' (played by [[Mark Povinelli]]) \u2013 A Dwarf who has a crush on Snow White.\n* '''Grub''' (played by Joe Gnoffo) \u2013 A Dwarf who is always eating.\n* '''Chuck''' (played by Ronald Lee Clark) \u2013 A Dwarf who chuckles a lot.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs help Snow White to form a resistance against Queen Clementianna.\n\n===Princesses===\nIn the ''Princesses'' series by [[Jim C. Hines]], the dwarfs are actually anthropomorphic elemental personifications, summoned by Snow to aid her based on a spell from one of her mother's books. The seven dwarfs represent Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Light, Shadow, and Magic, although the 'Magic' dwarf is essentially a spirit that just inhabits Snow and enhances her power rather than appearing on its own, with the others appearing in some form to represent their element. Although powerful fighters that will serve Snow loyally, the consequences of summoning them is that Snow must 'pay' the spirits with seven years of her life, with the result that she appears to be in her mid-thirties when she is really only in her early twenties. As a result, she has only summoned the dwarves twice, initially calling on their aid to help her defeat her mother before the series began, and summoning them again to help her and her allies defeat her mother's spirit in the first book in the series (she contemplated summoning them against to deal with the ruthless Wild Hunt in ''Red Riding's Revenge'', but was advised against it as the spiritual nature of the hunt meant that nobody could be sure if the dwarves could do anything against them).\n\n===Snow White and the Huntsman===\nIn ''[[Snow White and the Huntsman]]'', the Seven Dwarfs started out as eight dwarfs when they are encountered by Snow White and Eric the Huntsman while fleeing Queen Ravenna. The Seven Dwarfs are:\n* '''Beith''' (played by [[Ian McShane]]) \u2013 The leader of the Seven Dwarfs. His name is the name of the first letter (\"B\") in the [[Ogham]] alphabet.\n* '''Muir''' (played by [[Bob Hoskins]]) \u2013 The blind elder dwarf who possesses the powers of premonition and is the father of Quert. His name echoes ''muin'', the name of \"M\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Quert''' (played by [[Johnny Harris (actor)|Johnny Harris]]) \u2013 The son of Muir. His name echoes ''ceirt'', the name of \"Q\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Coll''' (played by [[Toby Jones]]) \u2013 The brother of Duir. His name is the name of \"C\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Duir''' (played by [[Eddie Marsan]]) \u2013 The brother of Coll. His name is the name of \"D\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Gort''' (played by [[Ray Winstone]]) \u2013 An ill-tempered dwarf. His name is the name of \"G\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Nion''' (played by [[Nick Frost]]) \u2013 Beith's right-hand dwarf. His name is the name of \"N\" in the Ogham alphabet (sometimes given as ''nuin'').\n* '''Gus''' (played by Brian Gleeson) \u2013 A dwarf who develops a bond with Snow White. He is killed during an attack by Queen Ravenna's men where he sacrifices his life to protect Snow White. His name does not correspond to an Ogham letter.\n\nThe Dwarfs were played by actors without dwarfism who had their faces digitally transmuted onto small bodies, prompting a protest from the [[Little People of America]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/dwarfs-threaten-100midget-march-over-snow-white-and-the-huntsman-film-7821156.html Dwarfs threaten '100-midget march' over Snow White and the Huntsman film], Guy Adams, The Independent (UK), Thursday 07 June 2012</ref>\n\n===Once Upon a Time===\nIn ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', the Seven Dwarfs (who started out as eight) are on the side of Snow White and go by their Disney names.\n\n* '''Grumpy''' (played by [[Lee Arenberg]]) is one of eight Dwarf brothers who hatched from their eggs at the same time. Like all dwarfs, he is immediately sent to work in the mines and is given an ax, which names him Dreamy. Because his egg was accidentally sprinkled with fairy dust by the fairy Nova, he dreams about her and falls in love with her. Later, he meets her and the pair make plans to buy a boat and see the world. However, the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]] tells him that if he and Nova run away together, she will lose her wings and she will never be truly happy. To prevent this, Dreamy ends their relationship and breaks her heart. He returns to the mines the next day and breaks his ax mining; when he is given another, it ''renames'' him Grumpy. He is later caught possessing a stolen diamond, which he did not know was stolen, and is seen in [[King George (Once Upon a Time)|King George]]'s dungeon in a cell next to Snow White's. He is freed by Stealthy, one of his brothers, and he in turn frees Snow. As he and Stealthy escape, they are discovered by George and his guards and Stealthy is killed. Before the guards can kill Grumpy, Snow goes with George in exchange for Grumpy's life. Grumpy and the remaining six dwarfs run into Snow outside the castle. Grumpy tells her that she must live with the pain of a lost love to grow as a person and does not allow her to drink a potion that makes her forget about her love for [[Prince Charming|Prince James]]. The seven dwarfs then allow her to live with them. Later, Grumpy goes to tell her that James called off his wedding, but he discovers that she drank the potion. He and his brothers try to confront Snow about her new, mean-spirited behavior, but they drive her to try and kill the Evil Queen instead. He takes her to see [[Rumplestiltskin]], who gave her the potion, but he advises her on the best way to kill the Queen instead. Eventually, Snow regains her memory and apologizes to the dwarfs for her behavior. She decides to rescue James, who was captured by George, and Grumpy and his brothers go with her. Grumpy is later seen discussing the best course of action against the Evil Queen and her curse, calling for war. He is also seen as a guard looking out for the curse in a watchtower of Snow's and James's castle. In Storybrooke, he is '''Leroy''', a [[janitor]] at the hospital and the \"[[town drunk]].\" He, like the rest of Storybrooke, is hostile toward Mary Margaret, who is Snow White, after learning about her affair with David Nolan, who is Prince James. He meets Sister Astrid, who is Nova, and decides to help Mary Margaret sell candles for the nunnery and raise money for the nunnery's rent so that he can be near Astrid. When he and Mary Margaret fail to sell enough candles, he lies about the number they sold because he is unable to disappoint Astrid. He tries to sell his boat to Mr. Gold in the hopes that he will forgive the rent. Mr. Gold refuses. Astrid later learns about the candles and is upset that he lied. That night, Leroy causes a blackout, forcing the residents to buy candles. The candles sell out and the nunnery is able to pay its rent. Leroy then offers the grateful Astrid the opportunity to be the first passenger on his boat. Leroy's memories as Grumpy are restored when the curse is broken, and he hugs Snow when he next sees her. He wishes for Regina to be killed by the mob led by Dr. Whale, though he decides against it at Snow's insistence. He unites the Dwarfs together and they begin to mine for fairy dust again.\n* '''Sleepy''' (played by Faustino Di Bauda) \u2013 Sleepy is a sleepy dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he is '''Walter''', a [[security guard]] that works at Storybrooke Hospital who occasionally dozes off on the job.\n* '''Sneezy''' (played by [[Gabe Khouth]]) \u2013 Sneezy is a dwarf who often sneezes and is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he is '''Tom Clark''', the owner of the Dark Star [[pharmacy]] where several characters are seen purchasing different products throughout the show. In Season 2, Sneezy joined the other dwarfs in an experiment that involved why the fairy tale characters can't leave Storybrooke. Upon drawing the shortest straw, Sneezy crossed the border out of Storybrooke and lost his memories of his past life in Fairy Tale Land once again.\n* '''Doc''' (played by [[David Paul Grove (actor)|David Paul Grove]]) \u2013 Doc is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he still has his name but his occupation is unknown.\n* '''Bashful''' (played by Mig Micario) \u2013 Bashful is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n* '''Dopey''' (played by Jeffrey Kaiser) \u2013 Dopey is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs and has never spoken. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n* '''Happy''' (played by [[Michael Coleman (actor)|Michael Coleman]]) \u2013 Happy is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n\nThere were some other dwarfs that were associated with the Seven Dwarfs:\n* '''Stealthy''' (played by Geoff Gustafson) was a dwarf who used to be part of the Seven Dwarfs' group. He received his name from his axe like the other dwarfs because of his skillful infiltration abilities. He once tried to break Grumpy and Snow White out of his prison cell in King George's castle, but was killed during their escape. Grumpy would later comment, \"I miss Stealthy\", when trying to sneak into an enemy lair. He later ended up in the Underworld and after Henry gives him his unfinished business being his resentment towards Bashful he is able to move and ask Henry to tell his brother he misses them. In the Wish Realm, Stealthy is seen to be alive after Queen Snow and King David defeated the Evil Queen.\n* '''Bossy''' (played by Ken Kramer) is a dwarf who is also the leader of the other dwarfs.\n* '''Watchy''' (played by [[Richard Ian Cox]]) is a dwarf who watches over the dwarf eggs until they hatch.\n\n===The Goodies===\nIn the first episode of the final series of [[The Goodies]] (which was filmed at [[ITV Studios|ITV]]), The Goodies did a story set in a fairy tale world. Where they replaced three of the seven dwarfs (two of them died of exposure and another one was eaten by a gold fish). But they are later found out because of their height. The dwarfs take their names from the Disney movie (Sleepy, Happy, and Grumpy) while Graeme and Bill renamed themselves to fit in (Soppy and Gwotty). Only Tim kept his name.\n\n==Other dwarfs==<!-- See also -->\n* The 80s sitcom [[The Charmings]] contained one of the dwarfs, whose name was Luther.\n* The TV series [[Once Upon a Time (TV series)#Cultural references|''Once Upon a Time'']] (2012) uses the same names as \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937). There is also an 8th dwarf called Stealthy, and a 9th honorary dwarf called Tiny. Grumpy was initially called Dreamy. Tiny (The Honorary Dwarf) was actually a Giant in the series (Once Upon a Time) before being cursed by Cora (The [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Evil Queen]]'s Mother) at which time he became human sized.\n* The Six Dwarfs in [[Sesame Street]] Episode 279 consisted of Sparky, Snooky, Pokey, Flakey, Drippy, and Sneaky.\n** In Episode 2787, the Seven Emotional Dwarfs are named Cheerful, Sad, Angry, Proud, Fearful, Lovey, and Surprised.\n** In Episode 18/10, the Seven Dwarfs were Clumsy, Vertigo, Gassy, Itchy, Smelly, Sensitive-Nose, and Hammy.\n* The Dwarfs in [[7 Dwarves \u2013 Men Alone in the Wood]] (and its sequels [[7 Zwerge \u2013 Der Wald ist nicht genug]] and [[The Seventh Dwarf]]) are Brummboss, Bubi, Cloudy, Cookie, Speedy, Sunny and Tschakko. When Brummboss leaves them after regaining the crown, he is replaced by Ralfie.\n*In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world of [[Middle-earth]], the Seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] were the first of their people, and each the founder of a lineage. Tolkien's seven dwarves (note the spelling) are probably unique in literature, in being unconnected to the folktale of [[Snow White]]; although his imagined story bears echoes of the folklore motif of the Barbarossa legend (\"[[King asleep in mountain]]\") and the related motif \"[[Seven Sleepers]]\".<ref>Giddings, Robert; Holland, Elizabeth (1982) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6SYeAQAAIAAJ&q=%22barbarossa%22 J.R.R.

Snow White happens upon their house after being told by the [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Huntsman]] to flee from the [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen]]'s kingdom.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs return home and immediately notice someone has sneaked in, because the house has been cleaned. During their loud discussion, they discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them what happened. The Dwarfs take pity on her, saying: \"If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want.\" They warn her to be careful when alone at home, and to not let anyone in while they are [[wikt:delve#English|delving]] in the mountains.\n\nWhen the Queen disguised as an old [[peddler]] ties a colorful, silky [[bodice]] onto Snow White which causes her to faint, the Seven Dwarfs return just in time and Snow White revives when the Dwarfs loosen the lace. When the Queen dresses as a [[comb]] seller and gives Snow White a poisoned comb, the Seven Dwarfs save her again. The Queen then appears disguised as a [[farmer]]'s wife and gives Snow White a poisoned apple, of which she takes a bite. This time, the Seven Dwarfs are unable to revive the girl, because they can't find the source of Snow White's poor health and, assuming that she is dead, they place her in a glass [[coffin]]. After some time has passed, a Prince traveling through the land sees Snow White where he strides to her coffin, and instantly falls in love with her upon being enchanted by her beauty. The Prince kisses her which revives her.\n\n==Names==\nThe following is a list of names of the Seven Dwarfs from multiple versions of the [[Snow White]] story.

He is accident-prone and mute, with Happy explaining that he has simply \"never tried\" to speak. He is unvoiced like [[The Fox and the Cat#In Disney media|Gideon the Cat]] in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', the title character as the circus elephant [[Dumbo]], and [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)#Disney's Peter Pan films|Tootles]] in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''.\n* '''Bashful''' (voiced by [[Scotty Mattraw]] in the film, [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 Bashful is very [[Shyness|shy]] and kind-hearted. He is also described as cute. He also has a rosy blushy face and a small shy smile.\n* '''Grumpy''' (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]] in the film, [[Corey Burton]]) \u2013 Grumpy initially opposes [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]'s presence in the dwarfs' home, but later warns her of the threat posed by the Queen and eagerly rushes to her aid upon realizing that she is in danger, leading the charge himself. He has the biggest nose of the dwarfs, and is frequently seen with one eye shut.\n* '''Sneezy''' (voiced by [[Billy Gilbert]] in the film, [[Bob Joles]]) \u2013 Sneezy's name is earned by his extraordinarily powerful sneezes (caused by [[hay fever]]), which are seen blowing even the heaviest of objects across a room.\n* '''Sleepy''' (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]] in the film, [[Bill Farmer]]) \u2013 Sleepy is always tired and appears [[Lethargy|lethargic]] in most situations.\n* '''Happy''' (voiced by [[Otis Harlan]] in the film, [[Stephen Stanton]]) \u2013 Happy is the jovial dwarf and is usually portrayed laughing.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs also appeared in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]''.\n[[File:B-29 Doc McConnell Air Force Base July 17, 2016.jpg|thumb|Built during World War II, ''[[Doc (aircraft)|Doc]]'', a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], was named after one of the Seven Disney Dwarfs.]]\nIn the early 2000s, [[DisneyToon Studios]] (DTS) joined [[Disney Consumer Products]] (DCP) as their internal Disney conglomerate video partner in developing the new Disney franchises. While DCP eyed other potential franchises, DisneyToon looked to the [[Seven Dwarfs#The Walt Disney Company|Seven Dwarfs]] for a male-centric franchise to counterbalance the female-centric Fairies. By 2005, ''The Seven Dwarfs'' computer-animated sequel to ''Snow White'' was officially underway. [[Paul and Ga\u00ebtan Brizzi]] was one team that was given an attempt at a movie pitch, which was to follow the Dwarfs in which they trap the villain in the magic mirror and setting it up for ''Snow White'' movie. Given the possible demand, [[Disney Interactive Studios|Buena Vista Games]] brought in [[Obsidian Entertainment]], a game developer, who pitched a video game focusing on the Dwarfs' similar ancestors. DTS executives were not feeling that the two franchise launching projects were coming together well enough that they turned to [[Mike Disa]], who worked on the Tinker Bell movie story. Disa and [[Evan Spiliotopoulos]] pitched a ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''-style epic for the dwarfs while \"connecting seamlessly\" with the original movie, which was given permission to move forward. With interfering managers wanting a tragic back story for Dopey, Disa decided that he could not go forward. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]] about two month later ended production on the film.<ref name=av0>{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Josh|title=Mike Disa and The Seven Dwarfs: How the Snow White prequel became a Dopey movie|url=http://animatedviews.com/2013/mike-disa-and-the-seven-dwarfs-how-the-snow-white-prequel-became-a-dopey-movie/|website=Animated Views.com|publisher=Animated Views|accessdate=June 12, 2014|date=August 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[The 7D]]'' is an American [[animated]] [[Television program|television series]] produced by [[Disney Television Animation]] franchise based on ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.

The TV series details the 7D working for Queen Delightful where they protect Jollywood from the Glooms and other threats.<ref name=av0/>\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs were given a new theme park attraction called the [[Seven Dwarfs Mine Train]] coaster.<ref name=av0/>\n\nIn ''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]'' and ''[[Descendants 2]]'', Dopey is shown to have a son named Doug (portrayed by Zachary Gibson) who can talk and becomes smitten by Evil Queen's daughter Evie. In the Descendants novel ''The Isle of the Lost'', Doc is shown to be sympathetic towards the Goblins that operate on the Isle of the Lost's Goblin Wharf where they want amnesty for their involvement with Maleficent.\n\n===[[Sesame Street]]===\nIn ''[[Sesame Street]]'', there were different versions of the Seven Dwarfs where each of them was made from Anything Muppets.\n* The Six Dwarfs seen in Episode 279 consisted of Sparky (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Snooky (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Pokey (performed by [[Jim Henson]]), Flakey (performed by [[Jim Henson]]), Drippy (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), and Sneaky (performed by [[Jim Henson]]). Snow White visited their house instead of the Seven Dwarfs by mistake and was able to see the difference.\n* In a [[Sesame Street News Flash]] that was seen in Episode 2787, the Seven Emotional Dwarfs appear where they were interviewed by [[Kermit the Frog]]. Their names are Cheerful (performed by [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]), Sad (performed by [[Kevin Clash]]), Angry (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Proud (performed by [[Martin P. Robinson]]), Fearful (performed by [[David Rudman]]), Lovey (performed by James Kroupa), and Surprised (performed by [[Jim Martin (puppeteer)|Jim Martin]]).\n* In Episode 4114, the Seven Dwarfs appear opposite Snow White (played by [[Amy Sedaris]]). The Seven Dwarfs consist of Clumsy (performed by [[Joey Mazzarino]]), Vertigo (performed by [[Fran Brill]]), Gassy (performed by [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]]), Itchy (performed by [[Carmen Osbahr]]), Smelly (performed by [[Martin P. Robinson]]), Sensitive-Nose (performed by Ryan Dillon), and Hammy (performed by [[Eric Jacobson]]).\n\n===Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics===\nIn the \"Snow White\" episode of ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'', the Seven Dwarfs are named Sunday (voiced by Clifton Wells in the English dub), Monday (voiced by [[Kerrigan Mahan]] in the English dub), Tuesday, Wednesday (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]] in the English dub), Thursday, Friday (voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] in the English dub), and Saturday (voiced by [[Edward Mannix]] in the English dub) and are shown to be allied with a pack of wolves.\n\n===Happily Ever After===\nIn ''[[Happily Ever After (1993 film)|Happily Ever After]]'', it was mentioned that the Seven Dwarfs have opened up a mine in the next kingdom. In their place is the Seven Dwarfelles who have received a power based on nature to help out their boss [[Mother Nature]].\n\nThe Dwarfelles consisted of:\n* '''Muddy''' (voiced by [[Carol Channing]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over the earth, and as such performs such tricks as causing minor tremors and such. She feels most comfortable playing in the mud.\n* '''Sunburn''' (voiced by [[Sally Kellerman]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over sunlight, and is able to focus sun rays in any area and to whatever extremity she so wishes. She uses her power in the film to clear away clouds and summon down a beam of light to illuminate a dark cave. She has a New Yorker accent and attitude and her catchphrase is \"This really BURNS me up!\".\n* '''Blossom''' (voiced by [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over plants and flowers, and is seen throughout the animation zapping the ground and having flowers spring up. It becomes apparent that her flora powers are less effective if the area is less natural or adaptable, as in the Realm of Doom. Blossom is very reminiscent of her voice actress with Gabor's mannerisms, penchant for the beautiful and fashionable, and even her signature accent.\n* '''Marina''' (voiced by [[Linda Gary]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over all lakes and rivers, but the only example of her powers in the film is being able to breathe underwater. Marina carries herself as a gentlewoman and has a British accent.\n* '''Critterina''' (voiced by [[Linda Gary]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power of all animals who are created by Mother Nature. She is able to communicate with all animals, regardless of their creators, but does not have control over animals who are not Mother Nature's work like Lord Maliss' one-horned wolves. Although the other Dwarfelles are human in appearance, Critterina looks anthropomorphic. She aptly has a cowgirl mentality and a Texan accent.\n* '''Moonbeam''' (voiced by [[Tracey Ullman]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle is never seen using her powers, but has the distinct characteristic of being in a deep slumber and sleepwalking in the day, and only awaking at night.\n* '''Thunderella''' (voiced by [[Tracey Ullman]]) \u2013 The seventh and youngest Dwarfelle, and is considered the 'black sheep' of the seven because of her inability to control her powers. She has power over weather, and always seems to mess her attempts at creating storms. She ends up saving the day by hitting Lord Maliss with a bolt of lightning she creates from her fingertip.\n\nThe Dwarfelles helped Snow White on her quest to rescue the Prince from the Queen's sorcerer brother Lord Maliss.\n\n===Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child===\nIn ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', the show's adaption of \"Snow White\" that takes place in the American southwest depicts the Seven Dwarves as seven mystical little men who came from the north to mine turquoise. They consist of:\n\n* '''Bright Silver''' (voiced by [[Pato Hoffmann]]) \u2013 The leader of the seven little men.\n* '''Fool's Gold''' (voiced by [[Burr DeBenning]]) \u2013 The clumsiest little man.\n* '''Smelly Sulfur''' (voiced by [[Burr DeBenning]]) \u2013 The smelliest little man.\n* '''Hard Jade''' (voiced by Tim Sampson) \u2013 The strongest little man.\n* '''Rough Copper''' (voiced by Jim Great Elk Waters) \u2013 Named for his temper. \n* '''Sharp Flint''' (voiced by [[Michael Horse]]) \u2013 Named for his sharp tongue. \n* '''Heavy Metal''' (voiced by Sonny Skyhawk/Sonny Roubideaux) \u2013 The hungriest little man.\n\n===Shrek===\nThe Seven Dwarfs appear in the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' series.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek]]'', the Seven Dwarfs appear in the first film carrying Snow White's coffin. When they place the coffin on the table, Shrek says \"Oh no no no no! Dead broad off the table!\" One of the Dwarfs says \"Where else are we supposed to put it? The bed's already been taken.\" Shrek promptly finds the [[Big Bad Wolf]] in his bed.\n\nThey are seen again at the start of ''[[Shrek 2]]'', giving Shrek a ring engraved with \"I love you\" in flaming letters for Fiona (in an allusion to the [[One Ring]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'').\n\nIn ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', one of them is given to Fiona as a wedding present (as a [[babysitter]]) from Snow White who says she has six more at home.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs are seen at the end of ''Scared Shrekless'' when Shrek and Fiona celebrate by egging them.\n \nIn ''[[Shrek The Musical]]'', one of the dwarfs [[Grumpy (dwarf)|Grumpy]] knew that he abandoned [[Farquaad]] in the woods as a child after his wife the princess [[The Princess and the Pea]] falls out of 25 mattresses. However, when the fairytale characters brought Grumpy to Farquaad's wedding, he reveals that he kicked Farquaad out because he was twenty-eight years old and living in his basement.\n\n===Mirror Mirror===\nIn ''[[Mirror Mirror (film)|Mirror Mirror]]'', the Seven Dwarfs work as [[highwayman|Highwaymen]] and rob from anyone that comes down their way by wearing boots with retractable stilts that make them look taller. The Seven Dwarfs consist of:\n* '''Will Grimm''' (played by [[Danny Woodburn]]) \u2013 The leader of the Seven Dwarfs. He is named after the Brothers Grimm.\n* '''Butcher''' (played by [[Martin Klebba]]) \u2013 A Dwarf that used to work as a [[butcher]].\n* '''Wolf''' (played by Sebastian Saraceno) \u2013 A Dwarf in a [[Gray wolf|wolf]] cape.\n* '''Napoleon''' (played by [[Jordan Prentice]]) \u2013 A Dwarf that wears a hat similar to [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n* '''Half Pint''' (played by [[Mark Povinelli]]) \u2013 A Dwarf who has a crush on Snow White.\n* '''Grub''' (played by Joe Gnoffo) \u2013 A Dwarf who is always eating.\n* '''Chuck''' (played by Ronald Lee Clark) \u2013 A Dwarf who chuckles a lot.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs help Snow White to form a resistance against Queen Clementianna.\n\n===Princesses===\nIn the ''Princesses'' series by [[Jim C. Hines]], the dwarfs are actually anthropomorphic elemental personifications, summoned by Snow to aid her based on a spell from one of her mother's books. The seven dwarfs represent Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Light, Shadow, and Magic, although the 'Magic' dwarf is essentially a spirit that just inhabits Snow and enhances her power rather than appearing on its own, with the others appearing in some form to represent their element. Although powerful fighters that will serve Snow loyally, the consequences of summoning them is that Snow must 'pay' the spirits with seven years of her life, with the result that she appears to be in her mid-thirties when she is really only in her early twenties. As a result, she has only summoned the dwarves twice, initially calling on their aid to help her defeat her mother before the series began, and summoning them again to help her and her allies defeat her mother's spirit in the first book in the series (she contemplated summoning them against to deal with the ruthless Wild Hunt in ''Red Riding's Revenge'', but was advised against it as the spiritual nature of the hunt meant that nobody could be sure if the dwarves could do anything against them).\n\n===Snow White and the Huntsman===\nIn ''[[Snow White and the Huntsman]]'', the Seven Dwarfs started out as eight dwarfs when they are encountered by Snow White and Eric the Huntsman while fleeing Queen Ravenna. The Seven Dwarfs are:\n* '''Beith''' (played by [[Ian McShane]]) \u2013 The leader of the Seven Dwarfs. His name is the name of the first letter (\"B\") in the [[Ogham]] alphabet.\n* '''Muir''' (played by [[Bob Hoskins]]) \u2013 The blind elder dwarf who possesses the powers of premonition and is the father of Quert. His name echoes ''muin'', the name of \"M\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Quert''' (played by [[Johnny Harris (actor)|Johnny Harris]]) \u2013 The son of Muir. His name echoes ''ceirt'', the name of \"Q\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Coll''' (played by [[Toby Jones]]) \u2013 The brother of Duir. His name is the name of \"C\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Duir''' (played by [[Eddie Marsan]]) \u2013 The brother of Coll. His name is the name of \"D\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Gort''' (played by [[Ray Winstone]]) \u2013 An ill-tempered dwarf. His name is the name of \"G\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Nion''' (played by [[Nick Frost]]) \u2013 Beith's right-hand dwarf. His name is the name of \"N\" in the Ogham alphabet (sometimes given as ''nuin'').\n* '''Gus''' (played by Brian Gleeson) \u2013 A dwarf who develops a bond with Snow White. He is killed during an attack by Queen Ravenna's men where he sacrifices his life to protect Snow White. His name does not correspond to an Ogham letter.\n\nThe Dwarfs were played by actors without dwarfism who had their faces digitally transmuted onto small bodies, prompting a protest from the [[Little People of America]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/dwarfs-threaten-100midget-march-over-snow-white-and-the-huntsman-film-7821156.html Dwarfs threaten '100-midget march' over Snow White and the Huntsman film], Guy Adams, The Independent (UK), Thursday 07 June 2012</ref>\n\n===Once Upon a Time===\nIn ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', the Seven Dwarfs (who started out as eight) are on the side of Snow White and go by their Disney names.\n\n* '''Grumpy''' (played by [[Lee Arenberg]]) is one of eight Dwarf brothers who hatched from their eggs at the same time. Like all dwarfs, he is immediately sent to work in the mines and is given an ax, which names him Dreamy. Because his egg was accidentally sprinkled with fairy dust by the fairy Nova, he dreams about her and falls in love with her. Later, he meets her and the pair make plans to buy a boat and see the world. However, the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]] tells him that if he and Nova run away together, she will lose her wings and she will never be truly happy. To prevent this, Dreamy ends their relationship and breaks her heart. He returns to the mines the next day and breaks his ax mining; when he is given another, it ''renames'' him Grumpy. He is later caught possessing a stolen diamond, which he did not know was stolen, and is seen in [[King George (Once Upon a Time)|King George]]'s dungeon in a cell next to Snow White's. He is freed by Stealthy, one of his brothers, and he in turn frees Snow. As he and Stealthy escape, they are discovered by George and his guards and Stealthy is killed. Before the guards can kill Grumpy, Snow goes with George in exchange for Grumpy's life. Grumpy and the remaining six dwarfs run into Snow outside the castle. Grumpy tells her that she must live with the pain of a lost love to grow as a person and does not allow her to drink a potion that makes her forget about her love for [[Prince Charming|Prince James]]. The seven dwarfs then allow her to live with them. Later, Grumpy goes to tell her that James called off his wedding, but he discovers that she drank the potion. He and his brothers try to confront Snow about her new, mean-spirited behavior, but they drive her to try and kill the Evil Queen instead. He takes her to see [[Rumplestiltskin]], who gave her the potion, but he advises her on the best way to kill the Queen instead. Eventually, Snow regains her memory and apologizes to the dwarfs for her behavior. She decides to rescue James, who was captured by George, and Grumpy and his brothers go with her. Grumpy is later seen discussing the best course of action against the Evil Queen and her curse, calling for war. He is also seen as a guard looking out for the curse in a watchtower of Snow's and James's castle. In Storybrooke, he is '''Leroy''', a [[janitor]] at the hospital and the \"[[town drunk]].\" He, like the rest of Storybrooke, is hostile toward Mary Margaret, who is Snow White, after learning about her affair with David Nolan, who is Prince James. He meets Sister Astrid, who is Nova, and decides to help Mary Margaret sell candles for the nunnery and raise money for the nunnery's rent so that he can be near Astrid. When he and Mary Margaret fail to sell enough candles, he lies about the number they sold because he is unable to disappoint Astrid. He tries to sell his boat to Mr. Gold in the hopes that he will forgive the rent. Mr. Gold refuses. Astrid later learns about the candles and is upset that he lied. That night, Leroy causes a blackout, forcing the residents to buy candles. The candles sell out and the nunnery is able to pay its rent. Leroy then offers the grateful Astrid the opportunity to be the first passenger on his boat. Leroy's memories as Grumpy are restored when the curse is broken, and he hugs Snow when he next sees her. He wishes for Regina to be killed by the mob led by Dr. Whale, though he decides against it at Snow's insistence. He unites the Dwarfs together and they begin to mine for fairy dust again.\n* '''Sleepy''' (played by Faustino Di Bauda) \u2013 Sleepy is a sleepy dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he is '''Walter''', a [[security guard]] that works at Storybrooke Hospital who occasionally dozes off on the job.\n* '''Sneezy''' (played by [[Gabe Khouth]]) \u2013 Sneezy is a dwarf who often sneezes and is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he is '''Tom Clark''', the owner of the Dark Star [[pharmacy]] where several characters are seen purchasing different products throughout the show. In Season 2, Sneezy joined the other dwarfs in an experiment that involved why the fairy tale characters can't leave Storybrooke. Upon drawing the shortest straw, Sneezy crossed the border out of Storybrooke and lost his memories of his past life in Fairy Tale Land once again.\n* '''Doc''' (played by [[David Paul Grove (actor)|David Paul Grove]]) \u2013 Doc is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he still has his name but his occupation is unknown.\n* '''Bashful''' (played by Mig Micario) \u2013 Bashful is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n* '''Dopey''' (played by Jeffrey Kaiser) \u2013 Dopey is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs and has never spoken. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n* '''Happy''' (played by [[Michael Coleman (actor)|Michael Coleman]]) \u2013 Happy is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n\nThere were some other dwarfs that were associated with the Seven Dwarfs:\n* '''Stealthy''' (played by Geoff Gustafson) was a dwarf who used to be part of the Seven Dwarfs' group. He received his name from his axe like the other dwarfs because of his skillful infiltration abilities. He once tried to break Grumpy and Snow White out of his prison cell in King George's castle, but was killed during their escape. Grumpy would later comment, \"I miss Stealthy\", when trying to sneak into an enemy lair. He later ended up in the Underworld and after Henry gives him his unfinished business being his resentment towards Bashful he is able to move and ask Henry to tell his brother he misses them. In the Wish Realm, Stealthy is seen to be alive after Queen Snow and King David defeated the Evil Queen.\n* '''Bossy''' (played by Ken Kramer) is a dwarf who is also the leader of the other dwarfs.\n* '''Watchy''' (played by [[Richard Ian Cox]]) is a dwarf who watches over the dwarf eggs until they hatch.\n\n===The Goodies===\nIn the first episode of the final series of [[The Goodies]] (which was filmed at [[ITV Studios|ITV]]), The Goodies did a story set in a fairy tale world. Where they replaced three of the seven dwarfs (two of them died of exposure and another one was eaten by a gold fish). But they are later found out because of their height. The dwarfs take their names from the Disney movie (Sleepy, Happy, and Grumpy) while Graeme and Bill renamed themselves to fit in (Soppy and Gwotty). Only Tim kept his name.\n\n==Other dwarfs==<!-- See also -->\n* The 80s sitcom [[The Charmings]] contained one of the dwarfs, whose name was Luther.\n* The TV series [[Once Upon a Time (TV series)#Cultural references|''Once Upon a Time'']] (2012) uses the same names as \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937). There is also an 8th dwarf called Stealthy, and a 9th honorary dwarf called Tiny. Grumpy was initially called Dreamy. Tiny (The Honorary Dwarf) was actually a Giant in the series (Once Upon a Time) before being cursed by Cora (The [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Evil Queen]]'s Mother) at which time he became human sized.\n* The Six Dwarfs in [[Sesame Street]] Episode 279 consisted of Sparky, Snooky, Pokey, Flakey, Drippy, and Sneaky.\n** In Episode 2787, the Seven Emotional Dwarfs are named Cheerful, Sad, Angry, Proud, Fearful, Lovey, and Surprised.\n** In Episode 18/10, the Seven Dwarfs were Clumsy, Vertigo, Gassy, Itchy, Smelly, Sensitive-Nose, and Hammy.\n* The Dwarfs in [[7 Dwarves \u2013 Men Alone in the Wood]] (and its sequels [[7 Zwerge \u2013 Der Wald ist nicht genug]] and [[The Seventh Dwarf]]) are Brummboss, Bubi, Cloudy, Cookie, Speedy, Sunny and Tschakko. When Brummboss leaves them after regaining the crown, he is replaced by Ralfie.\n*In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world of [[Middle-earth]], the Seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] were the first of their people, and each the founder of a lineage. Tolkien's seven dwarves (note the spelling) are probably unique in literature, in being unconnected to the folktale of [[Snow White]]; although his imagined story bears echoes of the folklore motif of the Barbarossa legend (\"[[King asleep in mountain]]\") and the related motif \"[[Seven Sleepers]]\".<ref>Giddings, Robert; Holland, Elizabeth (1982) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6SYeAQAAIAAJ&q=%22barbarossa%22 J.R.R.

Normally everything except the items within \"Local Settings\" is stored on the file server as part of a roaming profile.\n|}\n\nA '''roaming user profile''' is a [[file synchronization]] concept in the [[Windows NT]] family of [[operating system]]s that allows users with a [[computer]] joined to a [[Windows domain]] to log on to any computer on the same domain and access their documents and have a consistent desktop experience, such as applications remembering toolbar positions and preferences, or the desktop appearance staying the same, while keeping all related files stored locally, to not continuously depend on a fast and reliable network connection to a [[file server]].\n\n==Method of operation==\nAll Windows operating systems since [[Windows NT 3.1]] are designed to support roaming profiles. Normally, a standalone computer stores the user's documents, desktop items, application preferences, and desktop appearance on the local computer in two divided sections, consisting of the portion that could roam plus an additional temporary portion containing items such as the web browser cache. The [[Windows Registry]] is similarly divided to support roaming; there are System and Local Machine hives that stay on the local computer, plus a separate User hive (HKEY CURRENT USER) designed to be able to roam with the user profile.\n\nWhen a roaming user is created, the user's profile information is instead stored on a centralized file server accessible from any network-joined desktop computer. The login prompt on the local computer checks to see if the user exists in the domain rather than on the local computer; no pre-existing account is required on the local computer. If the domain login is successful, the roaming profile is copied from the central file server to the desktop computer, and a local account is created for the user.\n\nWhen the user logs off from the desktop computer, the user's roaming profile is merged from the local computer back to the central file server, not including the temporary local profile items. Because this is a merge and not a move/delete, the user's profile information remains on the local computer in addition to being merged to the network.\n\nWhen the user logs in on a second desktop computer, this process repeats, merging the roaming profile from the server to the second desktop computer, and then merging back from the desktop to the server when the user logs off.\n\nWhen the user returns to the first desktop computer and logs in, the roaming profile is merged with the previous profile information, replacing it. If profile caching is enabled, the server is capable of merging only the newest files to the local computer, reusing the existing local files that have not changed since the last login, and thereby speeding up the login process. \n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== Performance ===\n[[File:15395 cookies in 4 yr old roaming profile.PNG|frame|A roaming profile that is several years old can contain tens of thousands of cookies, which make network login and logout extremely slow, and contribute to file system fragmentation.]]\nDue to the profile copying at login and logout, a roaming profile set up using the default configuration can be extremely slow and waste considerable amounts of time for users with large amounts of data in their account.\n\nWhen [[Microsoft]] designed [[Internet Explorer]], the programmers made an explicit decision to store cookies and favorites as tiny individual files less than a kilobyte each, rather than storing this data as a single large consolidated file. Microsoft also stores [[Shortcut (computing)|shortcut]] files in the ''Recent'' profile folder, linking to recently opened files and folders.\n\nFile servers tend to only transfer large files several megabytes in size at the fastest possible network speed. Hundreds of very small files only a kilobyte per file can reduce network performance by 90%. As a profile ages and accumulates hundreds to thousands of cookies, favorites, and Recent items, the login and logout times become progressively slower, even though these files occupy only a few megabytes of profile data.\n\nLocal caching of the user profile on a desktop computer hard drive can reduce and improve login and logout times, but at the penalty of cluttering up the hard drive with profile data from every cached user who logs in. Local caching is more suitable where people tend to use the same computer every day. Local profile caching is not useful where hundreds to thousands of students need to be able to use any computer across a school or university campus\u2014the cumulative cached data from so many different profiles can consume all available lab computer disk space.\n\n====WAN links====\nUsers with a roaming profile can encounter crippling logon delays when logging in over a [[Wide area network|WAN]].  If connected to the domain from a remote site, after authentication, Windows will attempt to pull the user's profile from the location specified in [[Active Directory]].  If the location happens to be across a WAN link it can potentially slow the WAN down to a crawl and cause the logon to fail (after a very lengthy delay).\n\n{{clarify|reason=Please explain why (and how)|text=Users with a roaming profile working from a remote site should login to the machine ''before'' connecting to the network, (so that the machine uses its cached local copy) and connect to the network after logon has completed.  Another option is to remove the roaming profile path from Active Directory prior to their departure. |date=December 2015}} This must be done in enough time that the change is replicated to the relevant [[Domain Controller]] at the remote site.\n\n=== Profile size ===\nWorking with large files, such as editing [[Uncompressed video|raw videos]], can cause excessive login and logout times, as Windows will copy files in the roaming profile to the computer on login and back to the server on logout.\n\nIn environments where the large files are not mission-critical and do not absolutely need to be backed up to a server on a per-login basis, the applications requiring such excessively large amounts of user data are instead usually run on a stand-alone local account that does not roam, to bypass these network storage and retrieval problems.\n\n[[File:Java roaming profile bloat.PNG|frame|right|Example of third-party software (Sun Microsystems [[Java (software platform)|Java]]) storing temporary files and software updates in the roaming profile.  The bloated roaming profile increases login and logout times. The stored updates shown are unnecessary after installation, yet they are not deleted.]]\n\n=== Network congestion ===\nIn a school environment, roaming can result in severe network congestion and slowness when an entire classroom of students log off computers at the same time, and then within minutes are attempting to log in somewhere else. Inconsistency in account data can result if the students begin to log into the second location before the profile uploading and log out from the first location has finished.\n\n=== Misbehaving programs don't exit ===\nSome programs installed on desktop computers do not properly release control of the User registry during logoff, and can result in corrupted profiles because the User registry copying never successfully completes. To deal with this, Microsoft created a utility known as the ''User Profile Hive Cleanup Service'' which will forcibly remap the [[file handles]] for these misbehaving programs so that the profile copying can finish successfully and the account logoff is successful.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=1B286E6D-8912-4E18-B570-42470E2F3582 |title=User Profile Hive Cleanup Service |access-date=2010-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308072005/http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=1B286E6D-8912-4E18-B570-42470E2F3582 |archive-date=2006-03-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the hung program may remain on the local computer still holding the local cached copy of the User registry in a busy state, until the computer is rebooted.\n\n=== Synchronization at logoff ===\nThe most recent version of a file in a roaming profile without redirection is stored only on the local computer, and stays there until the user logs off, whereupon it transfers to the server. If nightly server backups are done, and a roaming user does not log off for days at a time, their roaming account documents are not being included in the nightly backup.\n\nFurther, if a roaming user uses standby or hibernation to turn off the computer at night, their profile is still not copied to the network. In this manner it is possible for a roaming account's documents to not be backed up for days to weeks at a time, and there is the potential for considerable data loss if the local hard drive suffers a catastrophic failure during these long periods of not logging off the roaming account from the local computer.\n\n=== Access conflict ===\nDue to the underlying file copying mechanism from server to desktop, roaming assumes the user account is logged on to only a single computer at a time. Documents in a roaming profile copied down to the local machine have no network awareness of each other, and it is not possible to use [[file locking]] to alert the user that the file is already open.\n\nLogging onto multiple computers with one account, and opening the same document multiple times on each computer can result in inconsistencies and loss of saved changes if the file is modified on two different computers at the same time:\n* When the first computer with the modified document logs off, the changes are written to the network copy of the profile.\n* When the second computer logs off, the different document version overwrites the previously saved changes during profile logout.\n\n=== Compatibility ===\nDifferent versions of Windows may employ different incompatible user profile layouts. As such, a user that roams between computers with different operating systems needs separate roaming profiles for each operating system. [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] add \".v2\" suffix to the user profile folder to isolate it from the user profiles of [[Windows XP]] and earlier. Even so, [[Microsoft TechNet]] advises users not roam between computers running Windows Vista/[[Windows Server 2008]] and Windows 7/[[Windows Server 2008 R2]]. User profiles in [[Windows 8]]/[[Windows Server 2012]] and [[Windows 8.1]]/[[Windows Server 2012 R2]] are also not entirely backward-compatible, although they initially used \".v2\" suffix as well. Microsoft later released [[hotfix]]<nowiki/>es and instructions to enable these operating systems to append \".v3\" and \".v4\" suffixes respectively, segregating them from cross-OS access.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deploy Roaming User Profiles|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj649079.aspx|website=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=19 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Incompatibility between Windows 8 roaming user profiles and roaming profiles in other versions of Windows|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2887239|website=Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=26 January 2014|edition=3.0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Incompatibility between Windows 8.1 roaming user profiles and those in earlier versions of Windows|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2890783|website=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=18 December 2013|edition=3.0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Roaming Profile Compatibility - The Windows 7 to Windows 8 Challenge|url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/askds/archive/2013/07/31/roaming-profile-compatibility-the-windows-7-to-windows-8-challenge.aspx|website=Ask the Directory Services Team|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=31 July 2013|first=David|last=Beach}}</ref>\n\n== Folder redirection ==\n{{Further|Folder redirection}}\n\nTo deal with these profile copying problems, it is possible to override the default operation of roaming, and set up user accounts so that certain parts of the profile are accessed by the local computer directly on a central file server rather than copying to the local computer first.<ref>Microsoft TechNet, Windows Server 2008, Group Policy Management, User Folder Redirection, Folder Redirection Overview [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732275(WS.10).aspx]</ref> If the server goes down, users can still access some files with [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd637828%28v=ws.10%29.aspx Offline Files Enhancements].\n\nTo the end-user, folder redirection generally does not appear to function any differently from using a normal standalone computer. Redirecting the user's My Documents and Desktop to be accessed directly on a file server are the first two big steps for speeding up roaming profiles. However, as 3rd party software have begun to store more and more data in the ''Application Data'' portion of the roaming profile, it has also become useful to redirect that to also be accessed directly on the server.\n\nThe question may be raised as to why the entire roaming profile can not be accessed directly on the server, and no copying needs to be done at all. The reasoning for this appears to be that certain Microsoft programs running all the time on the client computer can not tolerate the sudden loss of their data folders if the server goes down or the network is disconnected. Some portions must still be copied back and forth before the desktop appears so that these folders are available if the network-redirected folders go down.\n\n=== Caveats ===\n\nSome programs do not work properly with redirected profile folders that refer to a UNC file path on a server share: ''\\\\server\\share\\username\\Application Data''\n\n* Windows Command prompt cannot have a UNC working directory, so [[batch files]] usually fail.\n* It is not possible to install Microsoft Office [[VSTO]] add-ins on a UNC path.  (AppData can be a natural place for users to install addins without administration privileges.)\n* [[Adobe Reader]] has been incompatible with Application Data located on a UNC file path since at least version 9.0, which would crash with a runtime error.<ref>Adobe knowledge-base: Runtime error.

Very surprising}}</ref> 2013.\n\nThese problems with UNC paths can usually be fixed by having the folders redirected to a drive mapping for the UNC share:\n* Drive N: (say) is mapped to \\\\server\\share\\userhomedir\n* AppDir folder redirection to user home directory:N:\\Application Data\nHowever, use of drive mappings is generally deprecated by Microsoft, and UNC-only redirection paths are the preferred implementation.\n* Application software versions on various machines used with the same profile may need to be kept in sync, with the same options installed, otherwise software configuration files may refer to dynamic libraries or extensions or other resources that are not available on another machine, causing system crash or limited features or corruption of the configuration.\n* Installing software under one account may cause software to be only partially functional for other accounts due to the resources being unavailable to other users depending on their access rights to the installer's personal folders.\n\n==Mandatory profiles==\n{{Expand section|date = September 2014}}\n===Folder redirection with mandatory profiles===\nFolder redirection may be used with mandatory profiles, and is useful in situations where it is desirable to \"lock down\" the general desktop appearance but still allow users to save documents to the network. For example, this can be used as a generic account for anyone to use without a password for temporary use.\n\nRedirecting My ''Documents'' and the ''Desktop'' in a mandatory profile will allow documents to be saved, but at logoff, any changes to the desktop appearance such as the desktop picture, Internet Explorer cookies, Favorites, and the Recent documents opened list are reverted to the original state.<ref>Microsoft MSDN, 2012-06-06, \"Mandatory User Profiles\", Quote: \"[...] a user can modify his or her desktop, but the changes are not saved when the user logs off.\", http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb776895(v=vs.85).aspx</ref>\n\nFolder redirection with mandatory profiles is accomplished by denying write access to the central copy of the profile. When users log off, they may expect to regularly receive an error that the profile could not successfully be copied back to the server. A user should also be aware that storing data in certain locations may cause their data to be lost. For example, if the desktop is reset every time a user logs on with the mandatory profile's desktop, then although it seems fine to save files on the desktop, when the user logs off, the profile does not get copied to the server, and when the user logs back on, any work saved on the desktop is permanently lost without any advance notice other than the error on logout that the profile could not be copied.\n\n==Setup methods==\n\n===Active Directory===\n\nWhen user <var>U</var> logs into a Windows computer <var>C</var> joined to a domain, then <var>C</var> will consult the following locations to determine if the user has a roaming profile path configured:\n\n# the \u201cSet path for Remote Desktop Services Roaming User Profile\u201d [[group policy]] for <var>C</var>, if the login is to a terminal server\n# the [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-mstsprofilepath msTSProfilePath] attribute of <var>U</var>'s [[LDAP]] object, if the login is to a terminal server\n# the \u201cSet roaming profile path for all users logging onto this computer\u201d group policy for <var>C</var>\n# the [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-profilepath profilePath] attribute of <var>U</var>'s [[LDAP]] object\n\nThe first of these configuration settings that has a value overrides any later ones. LDAP attributes can be set by a domain administrator, or anyone else who has write access to the respective LDAP user object according to its [[access-control list]]. The value configured as the profile path is typically given as a [[UNC path]] to folder on an [[Server Message Block|SMB]] file server, and the path typically contains the variable \u201c%USERNAME%\u201d to make it specific to the user. The roaming profile for [[Remote Desktop Services|Remote Desktop Server]] users is specified under the \"Remote Desktop Services Profile\" tab.\n\nIn [[Windows 2000]] and later versions, a GUI interface for setting the profilePath attribute is available in the ''[[Active Directory]] Users and Computers'' snap-in. [[Windows NT 4.0]] and earlier used the ''User Manager for Domains'' program. From many other operating systems, such LDAP attributes can be accessed e.g. with [[OpenLDAP]] command-line tools ldapsearch and ldapmodify (after [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]]/[[GSSAPI]] authentication).\n\nWhen a user logs into a computer joined to a domain, the [[Windows shell]] will check the above-mentioned LDAP attributes and group policy files to determine the roaming user profile path. It then calls the [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/userenv/nf-userenv-loaduserprofilea LoadUserProfile] function. Microsoft has not documented the precise [[file synchronization]] algorithm that this function implements, but it involves comparing for each file found in both the local and the roaming profile the timestamps, to then replace any older file found on the computer. When the user logs off, the Windows shell calls [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/userenv/nf-userenv-unloaduserprofile UnloadUserProfile], which applies a similar file synchronization algorithm in the opposite direction, to allow changes made to the roaming profile to migrate back to the location where the user's roaming profile is stored. In addition, since Windows 7, it has possible to specify a group policy \u201cBackground upload of a roaming user profile's registry file while user is logged on\u201d to apply this synchronization process to the NTuser.dat file at regular intervals (default is 12 hours). Logging into Windows via OpenSSH for Windows does not load a roaming profile.\n\n=== Windows 95, 98 or Me ===\n\nWorkstations running [[Windows 9x|Windows 95, 98 or Me]] can also have roaming profiles, however the users roaming profile files in Windows 9x are stored in the users Home directory even if a separate location for roaming is specified. In order to use roaming profiles in Windows 9x each workstation needs to be setup to have separate profile settings for each user that logs into the local workstation enabled. Enabling separate desktop settings in Windows 9x is enabled under ''Passwords'' in the Windows Control Panel.\n\nRoaming profiles on Windows 95, 98 and Me are all compatible with each other so if a network has mixture of Windows 95 and Windows 98 workstations the same user profile may be used for each workstation. This is also the case with Roaming profiles between Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP but there may be some compatibility issues due to differences in each version of Windows. Roaming profiles in Windows Vista and Windows 7 are compatible with each other but these versions are not compatible with earlier versions of Windows. A separate profile folder with the extension .V2 will be created when using Roaming profiles with Windows Vista or 7. The easiest solution is to have all workstations running the same version of Windows. (see Compatibility section)\n\n===Novell eDirectory/Netware===\nFor roaming to work with [[Novell]] servers, the Novell product \"[[ZENworks]] Desktop Management\" needs to be installed on the server, and its associated workstation management package installed on each of the client computers. Within the directory, a ''User Package'' object is created, which enables roaming, specifies where the roaming profile is stored, and also stores any associated group policies for each version of Windows where users will login. The User Package also enables ''Dynamic Local User'', which functions similar to Active Directory, allowing an account created in eDirectory to log in on any desktop computer even if no local account exists in advance, and assigns local account privileges such as User, Power User, or Administrator to the newly created local user account. For Windows NT the user profile files are stored in the users home directory under a subfolder for each version of Windows, for example in Windows NT 4.0 the folder will be called \"Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Profile\" and in Windows XP the folder will be called \"Windows NT 5.1 Workstation Profile\"\n\nThe User Package can be associated with a specific user account in the directory, or is associated with an [[Organizational unit (computing)|organizational unit]] that then applies to all user accounts within that OU. The User Package also enables additional ZENworks Desktop Management functions, such as remote view and remote control of the desktop computer, network printers that follow the user from one desktop to the next, and the scheduling of events that are to be run wherever the user is logged in.\n\n===Windows 3.x===\nWhile Windows 3.x does not contain user profiles it was possible for users to have their own personalised desktop in a business environment. Windows 3.x had an administrative setup option which network administrators could use by typing setup.exe /a Windows could then be installed to a network share. Windows setup was then run from each local machine to install a few local files making Windows 3.1 capable of being run over a network. The local files could be saved to a user's home directory on a Novell or Windows NT Domain network allowing the user to have his or her settings roam between machines, the local machine in this scenario did not require a hard drive and could have been booted from a floppy or network card.\n\n==Resetting a profile==\nOccasionally a users profile may need to be reset if the profile becomes corrupt or to resolve an issue with an application, a reset would normally be performed by a systems administrator or helpdesk staff. To perform a reset the affected user needs to log out of the system and then the folder where the users roaming profile is stored on the server is then renamed, the user profile must also be deleted from the local workstation the user logs into otherwise the user will take the locally stored profile on next login. When the profile has been cleared from the local machine when the user logs in a new profile will be generated using the default profile stored on the workstation, when the user logs out the profile will be copied back to the location where the users roaming profile was stored.\n\n==Advantages==\n* Enforcement of administrative control by using mandatory user profiles which helps to protect the user's environment from being damaged by the user himself/herself.\n* Users can access their data anywhere in the network with more reliability\n* Easier backup as most data is in one location on the server\n\n==Disadvantages==\nEach time a user logs into a workstation, all of the files and settings are transferred over the network; the result is that the login process takes longer than if the user were to use a local profile. This is particularly the case if the profile is large in size. The login time may be reduced if the profile is cached as some files can be loaded from the local workstation and by using folder redirection to redirect folders that can grow to a large size, like [[My Documents]], to a network share.\n\nHowever, this limitation has been addressed in Windows Server 2008 Active Directory by allowing [[folder redirection]] of almost all folders that were previously stored in a user's profile (including My Music, Favorites, and others) to a centralized and secured network share. This means that a user's roaming profile can easily be reduced to size smaller than 20MB, thus eliminating the long login times that were experienced with previous versions of AD. When using folder redirection and automatic caching of [[offline files]], all of a user's files and preferences are available offline and synced in a much more efficient manner than previously possible when the computer is reconnected to the network using [[Remote Differential Compression]] (RDC).\n\nAnother problem is related to different set of applications installed on machines, applications stores information into Local Settings and some into the registry, but only the registry is transferred across. It can corrupt application functionality under roaming profile.\n\n=== Redirected folder sharing ===\nRedirected network folders are able to override the separation between 2000/XP and Vista/Win7. For example, both types of profiles can be redirected to use a single Documents folder, and a single Desktop folder, so that the user's account documents are consistent between the two profiles, even if all other account settings will be different.\n\nRedirected sharing of folders such as Application Data may lead to data corruption, since Microsoft did not intend this for their application data to be shared between the different OS versions.\n\n==Alternatives==\n[[User virtualization]] programs (such as [[AppSense]]) manage [[user profile]]s, settings, and data, storing them in a [[network share]] or [[cloud computing|the cloud]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Folder redirection]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa372123.aspx Microsoft MSDN Library: Reference on User Profiles]\n* [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738803(v=ws.10) Microsoft TechNet: Windows Server 2003 Product Help: User Profiles best practices]\n* [https://technet.microsoft.com/de-de/library/cc784484(v=ws.10).aspx Microsoft TechNet: Windows Server 2003: Operations Whitepaper: Best Practices for User Profiles]\n\n{{Windows Components}}\n\n[[Category:Active Directory]]\n[[Category:Microsoft server technology]]\n[[Category:Windows NT architecture]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{One source|date=January 2008}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2013}}\n}}\n\n{| style=\"width:200px; float:right; border:1px solid #ccc; background:#f9f9f9; font-size:88%; line-height:1.5em; margin:5px;\" \n|-\n|| <!-- Table within a table, starts on next line -->\n{|  style=\"margin:auto; border:1px solid darkgrey;\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[File:Icons-mini-page url.gif]]\n| colspan=\"3\" | C:\\Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings\\{username}\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | Application Data\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | Cookies\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | Desktop\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | Favorites\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | Local Settings\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || Application Data\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || History\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || Temp\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || Temporary Internet Files\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | My Documents\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || My Music\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || My Pictures\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || My Videos\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | Recent\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | NetHood\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | PrintHood\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | SendTo\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | Start Menu\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | Templates\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-page text.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | NTUSER.DAT\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-page text.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | ntuser.dat.LOG\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-page text.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | ntuser.ini\n|}\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\"| Folder layout of typical Windows 2000/XP user profile. Normally everything except the items within \"Local Settings\" is stored on the file server as part of a roaming profile.\n|}\n\nA '''roaming user profile''' is a [[file synchronization]] concept in the [[Windows NT]] family of [[operating system]]s that allows users with a [[computer]] joined to a [[Windows domain]] to log on to any computer on the same domain and access their documents and have a consistent desktop experience, such as applications remembering toolbar positions and preferences, or the desktop appearance staying the same, while keeping all related files stored locally, to not continuously depend on a fast and reliable network connection to a [[file server]].\n\n==Method of operation==\nAll Windows operating systems since [[Windows NT 3.1]] are designed to support roaming profiles. Normally, a standalone computer stores the user's documents, desktop items, application preferences, and desktop appearance on the local computer in two divided sections, consisting of the portion that could roam plus an additional temporary portion containing items such as the web browser cache. The [[Windows Registry]] is similarly divided to support roaming; there are System and Local Machine hives that stay on the local computer, plus a separate User hive (HKEY CURRENT USER) designed to be able to roam with the user profile.\n\nWhen a roaming user is created, the user's profile information is instead stored on a centralized file server accessible from any network-joined desktop computer. The login prompt on the local computer checks to see if the user exists in the domain rather than on the local computer; no pre-existing account is required on the local computer. If the domain login is successful, the roaming profile is copied from the central file server to the desktop computer, and a local account is created for the user.\n\nWhen the user logs off from the desktop computer, the user's roaming profile is merged from the local computer back to the central file server, not including the temporary local profile items. Because this is a merge and not a move/delete, the user's profile information remains on the local computer in addition to being merged to the network.\n\nWhen the user logs in on a second desktop computer, this process repeats, merging the roaming profile from the server to the second desktop computer, and then merging back from the desktop to the server when the user logs off.\n\nWhen the user returns to the first desktop computer and logs in, the roaming profile is merged with the previous profile information, replacing it. If profile caching is enabled, the server is capable of merging only the newest files to the local computer, reusing the existing local files that have not changed since the last login, and thereby speeding up the login process. \n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== Performance ===\n[[File:15395 cookies in 4 yr old roaming profile.PNG|frame|A roaming profile that is several years old can contain tens of thousands of cookies, which make network login and logout extremely slow, and contribute to file system fragmentation.]]\nDue to the profile copying at login and logout, a roaming profile set up using the default configuration can be extremely slow and waste considerable amounts of time for users with large amounts of data in their account.\n\nWhen [[Microsoft]] designed [[Internet Explorer]], the programmers made an explicit decision to store cookies and favorites as tiny individual files less than a kilobyte each, rather than storing this data as a single large consolidated file. Microsoft also stores [[Shortcut (computing)|shortcut]] files in the ''Recent'' profile folder, linking to recently opened files and folders.\n\nFile servers tend to only transfer large files several megabytes in size at the fastest possible network speed. Hundreds of very small files only a kilobyte per file can reduce network performance by 90%. As a profile ages and accumulates hundreds to thousands of cookies, favorites, and Recent items, the login and logout times become progressively slower, even though these files occupy only a few megabytes of profile data.\n\nLocal caching of the user profile on a desktop computer hard drive can reduce and improve login and logout times, but at the penalty of cluttering up the hard drive with profile data from every cached user who logs in. Local caching is more suitable where people tend to use the same computer every day. Local profile caching is not useful where hundreds to thousands of students need to be able to use any computer across a school or university campus\u2014the cumulative cached data from so many different profiles can consume all available lab computer disk space.\n\n====WAN links====\nUsers with a roaming profile can encounter crippling logon delays when logging in over a [[Wide area network|WAN]].  If connected to the domain from a remote site, after authentication, Windows will attempt to pull the user's profile from the location specified in [[Active Directory]].  If the location happens to be across a WAN link it can potentially slow the WAN down to a crawl and cause the logon to fail (after a very lengthy delay).\n\n{{clarify|reason=Please explain why (and how)|text=Users with a roaming profile working from a remote site should login to the machine ''before'' connecting to the network, (so that the machine uses its cached local copy) and connect to the network after logon has completed.  Another option is to remove the roaming profile path from Active Directory prior to their departure. |date=December 2015}} This must be done in enough time that the change is replicated to the relevant [[Domain Controller]] at the remote site.\n\n=== Profile size ===\nWorking with large files, such as editing [[Uncompressed video|raw videos]], can cause excessive login and logout times, as Windows will copy files in the roaming profile to the computer on login and back to the server on logout.\n\nIn environments where the large files are not mission-critical and do not absolutely need to be backed up to a server on a per-login basis, the applications requiring such excessively large amounts of user data are instead usually run on a stand-alone local account that does not roam, to bypass these network storage and retrieval problems.\n\n[[File:Java roaming profile bloat.PNG|frame|right|Example of third-party software (Sun Microsystems [[Java (software platform)|Java]]) storing temporary files and software updates in the roaming profile.  The bloated roaming profile increases login and logout times. The stored updates shown are unnecessary after installation, yet they are not deleted.]]\n\n=== Network congestion ===\nIn a school environment, roaming can result in severe network congestion and slowness when an entire classroom of students log off computers at the same time, and then within minutes are attempting to log in somewhere else. Inconsistency in account data can result if the students begin to log into the second location before the profile uploading and log out from the first location has finished.\n\n=== Misbehaving programs don't exit ===\nSome programs installed on desktop computers do not properly release control of the User registry during logoff, and can result in corrupted profiles because the User registry copying never successfully completes. To deal with this, Microsoft created a utility known as the ''User Profile Hive Cleanup Service'' which will forcibly remap the [[file handles]] for these misbehaving programs so that the profile copying can finish successfully and the account logoff is successful.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=1B286E6D-8912-4E18-B570-42470E2F3582 |title=User Profile Hive Cleanup Service |access-date=2010-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308072005/http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=1B286E6D-8912-4E18-B570-42470E2F3582 |archive-date=2006-03-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the hung program may remain on the local computer still holding the local cached copy of the User registry in a busy state, until the computer is rebooted.\n\n=== Synchronization at logoff ===\nThe most recent version of a file in a roaming profile without redirection is stored only on the local computer, and stays there until the user logs off, whereupon it transfers to the server.

Documents in a roaming profile copied down to the local machine have no network awareness of each other, and it is not possible to use [[file locking]] to alert the user that the file is already open.\n\nLogging onto multiple computers with one account, and opening the same document multiple times on each computer can result in inconsistencies and loss of saved changes if the file is modified on two different computers at the same time:\n* When the first computer with the modified document logs off, the changes are written to the network copy of the profile.\n* When the second computer logs off, the different document version overwrites the previously saved changes during profile logout.\n\n=== Compatibility ===\nDifferent versions of Windows may employ different incompatible user profile layouts. As such, a user that roams between computers with different operating systems needs separate roaming profiles for each operating system. [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] add \".v2\" suffix to the user profile folder to isolate it from the user profiles of [[Windows XP]] and earlier. Even so, [[Microsoft TechNet]] advises users not roam between computers running Windows Vista/[[Windows Server 2008]] and Windows 7/[[Windows Server 2008 R2]]. User profiles in [[Windows 8]]/[[Windows Server 2012]] and [[Windows 8.1]]/[[Windows Server 2012 R2]] are also not entirely backward-compatible, although they initially used \".v2\" suffix as well. Microsoft later released [[hotfix]]<nowiki/>es and instructions to enable these operating systems to append \".v3\" and \".v4\" suffixes respectively, segregating them from cross-OS access.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deploy Roaming User Profiles|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj649079.aspx|website=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=19 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Incompatibility between Windows 8 roaming user profiles and roaming profiles in other versions of Windows|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2887239|website=Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=26 January 2014|edition=3.0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Incompatibility between Windows 8.1 roaming user profiles and those in earlier versions of Windows|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2890783|website=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=18 December 2013|edition=3.0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Roaming Profile Compatibility - The Windows 7 to Windows 8 Challenge|url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/askds/archive/2013/07/31/roaming-profile-compatibility-the-windows-7-to-windows-8-challenge.aspx|website=Ask the Directory Services Team|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=31 July 2013|first=David|last=Beach}}</ref>\n\n== Folder redirection ==\n{{Further|Folder redirection}}\n\nTo deal with these profile copying problems, it is possible to override the default operation of roaming, and set up user accounts so that certain parts of the profile are accessed by the local computer directly on a central file server rather than copying to the local computer first.<ref>Microsoft TechNet, Windows Server 2008, Group Policy Management, User Folder Redirection, Folder Redirection Overview [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732275(WS.10).aspx]</ref> If the server goes down, users can still access some files with [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd637828%28v=ws.10%29.aspx Offline Files Enhancements].\n\nTo the end-user, folder redirection generally does not appear to function any differently from using a normal standalone computer. Redirecting the user's My Documents and Desktop to be accessed directly on a file server are the first two big steps for speeding up roaming profiles. However, as 3rd party software have begun to store more and more data in the ''Application Data'' portion of the roaming profile, it has also become useful to redirect that to also be accessed directly on the server.\n\nThe question may be raised as to why the entire roaming profile can not be accessed directly on the server, and no copying needs to be done at all. The reasoning for this appears to be that certain Microsoft programs running all the time on the client computer can not tolerate the sudden loss of their data folders if the server goes down or the network is disconnected. Some portions must still be copied back and forth before the desktop appears so that these folders are available if the network-redirected folders go down.\n\n=== Caveats ===\n\nSome programs do not work properly with redirected profile folders that refer to a UNC file path on a server share: ''\\\\server\\share\\username\\Application Data''\n\n* Windows Command prompt cannot have a UNC working directory, so [[batch files]] usually fail.\n* It is not possible to install Microsoft Office [[VSTO]] add-ins on a UNC path.  (AppData can be a natural place for users to install addins without administration privileges.)\n* [[Adobe Reader]] has been incompatible with Application Data located on a UNC file path since at least version 9.0, which would crash with a runtime error.<ref>Adobe knowledge-base: Runtime error | Roaming Profile workflows | Acrobat, Reader 9 http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/404/kb404597.html{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Adobe Reader X (10.0) is partially compatible but will not run in document protection mode on a UNC path.\n* [[OpenOffice.org]] 3.3 is similarly incompatible with Application Data on a UNC path, and the software crashes on startup.<ref>bug report, Open Office 3.3 incompatible with redirected Application Data http://openoffice.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=115778</ref> A fix has been developed and will be available in an upcoming release.\n* Roaming Profiles and redirection are not supported by [[AutoCAD]]<ref>{{cite tweet|user=GuamDon|author=Alex Numann|number=375682900013772801|date=5 September 2013|title=@AutoCAD  Do I really need to pay for a subscription to get some tech support? Your product doesn't work with network users? Very surprising}}</ref> 2013.\n\nThese problems with UNC paths can usually be fixed by having the folders redirected to a drive mapping for the UNC share:\n* Drive N: (say) is mapped to \\\\server\\share\\userhomedir\n* AppDir folder redirection to user home directory:N:\\Application Data\nHowever, use of drive mappings is generally deprecated by Microsoft, and UNC-only redirection paths are the preferred implementation.\n* Application software versions on various machines used with the same profile may need to be kept in sync, with the same options installed, otherwise software configuration files may refer to dynamic libraries or extensions or other resources that are not available on another machine, causing system crash or limited features or corruption of the configuration.\n* Installing software under one account may cause software to be only partially functional for other accounts due to the resources being unavailable to other users depending on their access rights to the installer's personal folders.\n\n==Mandatory profiles==\n{{Expand section|date = September 2014}}\n===Folder redirection with mandatory profiles===\nFolder redirection may be used with mandatory profiles, and is useful in situations where it is desirable to \"lock down\" the general desktop appearance but still allow users to save documents to the network. For example, this can be used as a generic account for anyone to use without a password for temporary use.\n\nRedirecting My ''Documents'' and the ''Desktop'' in a mandatory profile will allow documents to be saved, but at logoff, any changes to the desktop appearance such as the desktop picture, Internet Explorer cookies, Favorites, and the Recent documents opened list are reverted to the original state.<ref>Microsoft MSDN, 2012-06-06, \"Mandatory User Profiles\", Quote: \"[...] a user can modify his or her desktop, but the changes are not saved when the user logs off.\", http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb776895(v=vs.85).aspx</ref>\n\nFolder redirection with mandatory profiles is accomplished by denying write access to the central copy of the profile. When users log off, they may expect to regularly receive an error that the profile could not successfully be copied back to the server. A user should also be aware that storing data in certain locations may cause their data to be lost. For example, if the desktop is reset every time a user logs on with the mandatory profile's desktop, then although it seems fine to save files on the desktop, when the user logs off, the profile does not get copied to the server, and when the user logs back on, any work saved on the desktop is permanently lost without any advance notice other than the error on logout that the profile could not be copied.\n\n==Setup methods==\n\n===Active Directory===\n\nWhen user <var>U</var> logs into a Windows computer <var>C</var> joined to a domain, then <var>C</var> will consult the following locations to determine if the user has a roaming profile path configured:\n\n# the \u201cSet path for Remote Desktop Services Roaming User Profile\u201d [[group policy]] for <var>C</var>, if the login is to a terminal server\n# the [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-mstsprofilepath msTSProfilePath] attribute of <var>U</var>'s [[LDAP]] object, if the login is to a terminal server\n# the \u201cSet roaming profile path for all users logging onto this computer\u201d group policy for <var>C</var>\n# the [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-profilepath profilePath] attribute of <var>U</var>'s [[LDAP]] object\n\nThe first of these configuration settings that has a value overrides any later ones. LDAP attributes can be set by a domain administrator, or anyone else who has write access to the respective LDAP user object according to its [[access-control list]]. The value configured as the profile path is typically given as a [[UNC path]] to folder on an [[Server Message Block|SMB]] file server, and the path typically contains the variable \u201c%USERNAME%\u201d to make it specific to the user. The roaming profile for [[Remote Desktop Services|Remote Desktop Server]] users is specified under the \"Remote Desktop Services Profile\" tab.\n\nIn [[Windows 2000]] and later versions, a GUI interface for setting the profilePath attribute is available in the ''[[Active Directory]] Users and Computers'' snap-in. [[Windows NT 4.0]] and earlier used the ''User Manager for Domains'' program. From many other operating systems, such LDAP attributes can be accessed e.g. with [[OpenLDAP]] command-line tools ldapsearch and ldapmodify (after [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]]/[[GSSAPI]] authentication).\n\nWhen a user logs into a computer joined to a domain, the [[Windows shell]] will check the above-mentioned LDAP attributes and group policy files to determine the roaming user profile path. It then calls the [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/userenv/nf-userenv-loaduserprofilea LoadUserProfile] function. Microsoft has not documented the precise [[file synchronization]] algorithm that this function implements, but it involves comparing for each file found in both the local and the roaming profile the timestamps, to then replace any older file found on the computer. When the user logs off, the Windows shell calls [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/userenv/nf-userenv-unloaduserprofile UnloadUserProfile], which applies a similar file synchronization algorithm in the opposite direction, to allow changes made to the roaming profile to migrate back to the location where the user's roaming profile is stored. In addition, since Windows 7, it has possible to specify a group policy \u201cBackground upload of a roaming user profile's registry file while user is logged on\u201d to apply this synchronization process to the NTuser.dat file at regular intervals (default is 12 hours). Logging into Windows via OpenSSH for Windows does not load a roaming profile.\n\n=== Windows 95, 98 or Me ===\n\nWorkstations running [[Windows 9x|Windows 95, 98 or Me]] can also have roaming profiles, however the users roaming profile files in Windows 9x are stored in the users Home directory even if a separate location for roaming is specified. In order to use roaming profiles in Windows 9x each workstation needs to be setup to have separate profile settings for each user that logs into the local workstation enabled. Enabling separate desktop settings in Windows 9x is enabled under ''Passwords'' in the Windows Control Panel.\n\nRoaming profiles on Windows 95, 98 and Me are all compatible with each other so if a network has mixture of Windows 95 and Windows 98 workstations the same user profile may be used for each workstation. This is also the case with Roaming profiles between Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP but there may be some compatibility issues due to differences in each version of Windows. Roaming profiles in Windows Vista and Windows 7 are compatible with each other but these versions are not compatible with earlier versions of Windows. A separate profile folder with the extension .V2 will be created when using Roaming profiles with Windows Vista or 7. The easiest solution is to have all workstations running the same version of Windows. (see Compatibility section)\n\n===Novell eDirectory/Netware===\nFor roaming to work with [[Novell]] servers, the Novell product \"[[ZENworks]] Desktop Management\" needs to be installed on the server, and its associated workstation management package installed on each of the client computers. Within the directory, a ''User Package'' object is created, which enables roaming, specifies where the roaming profile is stored, and also stores any associated group policies for each version of Windows where users will login. The User Package also enables ''Dynamic Local User'', which functions similar to Active Directory, allowing an account created in eDirectory to log in on any desktop computer even if no local account exists in advance, and assigns local account privileges such as User, Power User, or Administrator to the newly created local user account. For Windows NT the user profile files are stored in the users home directory under a subfolder for each version of Windows, for example in Windows NT 4.0 the folder will be called \"Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Profile\" and in Windows XP the folder will be called \"Windows NT 5.1 Workstation Profile\"\n\nThe User Package can be associated with a specific user account in the directory, or is associated with an [[Organizational unit (computing)|organizational unit]] that then applies to all user accounts within that OU. The User Package also enables additional ZENworks Desktop Management functions, such as remote view and remote control of the desktop computer, network printers that follow the user from one desktop to the next, and the scheduling of events that are to be run wherever the user is logged in.\n\n===Windows 3.x===\nWhile Windows 3.x does not contain user profiles it was possible for users to have their own personalised desktop in a business environment. Windows 3.x had an administrative setup option which network administrators could use by typing setup.exe /a Windows could then be installed to a network share. Windows setup was then run from each local machine to install a few local files making Windows 3.1 capable of being run over a network. The local files could be saved to a user's home directory on a Novell or Windows NT Domain network allowing the user to have his or her settings roam between machines, the local machine in this scenario did not require a hard drive and could have been booted from a floppy or network card.\n\n==Resetting a profile==\nOccasionally a users profile may need to be reset if the profile becomes corrupt or to resolve an issue with an application, a reset would normally be performed by a systems administrator or helpdesk staff. To perform a reset the affected user needs to log out of the system and then the folder where the users roaming profile is stored on the server is then renamed, the user profile must also be deleted from the local workstation the user logs into otherwise the user will take the locally stored profile on next login. When the profile has been cleared from the local machine when the user logs in a new profile will be generated using the default profile stored on the workstation, when the user logs out the profile will be copied back to the location where the users roaming profile was stored.\n\n==Advantages==\n* Enforcement of administrative control by using mandatory user profiles which helps to protect the user's environment from being damaged by the user himself/herself.\n* Users can access their data anywhere in the network with more reliability\n* Easier backup as most data is in one location on the server\n\n==Disadvantages==\nEach time a user logs into a workstation, all of the files and settings are transferred over the network; the result is that the login process takes longer than if the user were to use a local profile. This is particularly the case if the profile is large in size. The login time may be reduced if the profile is cached as some files can be loaded from the local workstation and by using folder redirection to redirect folders that can grow to a large size, like [[My Documents]], to a network share.\n\nHowever, this limitation has been addressed in Windows Server 2008 Active Directory by allowing [[folder redirection]] of almost all folders that were previously stored in a user's profile (including My Music, Favorites, and others) to a centralized and secured network share. This means that a user's roaming profile can easily be reduced to size smaller than 20MB, thus eliminating the long login times that were experienced with previous versions of AD. When using folder redirection and automatic caching of [[offline files]], all of a user's files and preferences are available offline and synced in a much more efficient manner than previously possible when the computer is reconnected to the network using [[Remote Differential Compression]] (RDC).\n\nAnother problem is related to different set of applications installed on machines, applications stores information into Local Settings and some into the registry, but only the registry is transferred across. It can corrupt application functionality under roaming profile.\n\n=== Redirected folder sharing ===\nRedirected network folders are able to override the separation between 2000/XP and Vista/Win7. For example, both types of profiles can be redirected to use a single Documents folder, and a single Desktop folder, so that the user's account documents are consistent between the two profiles, even if all other account settings will be different.\n\nRedirected sharing of folders such as Application Data may lead to data corruption, since Microsoft did not intend this for their application data to be shared between the different OS versions.\n\n==Alternatives==\n[[User virtualization]] programs (such as [[AppSense]]) manage [[user profile]]s, settings, and data, storing them in a [[network share]] or [[cloud computing|the cloud]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Folder redirection]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa372123.aspx Microsoft MSDN Library: Reference on User Profiles]\n* [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738803(v=ws.10) Microsoft TechNet: Windows Server 2003 Product Help: User Profiles best practices]\n* [https://technet.microsoft.com/de-de/library/cc784484(v=ws.10).aspx Microsoft TechNet: Windows Server 2003: Operations Whitepaper: Best Practices for User Profiles]\n\n{{Windows Components}}\n\n[[Category:Active Directory]]\n[[Category:Microsoft server technology]]\n[[Category:Windows NT architecture]]\n", "name_user": "Kumaryashaswi58", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCaveats)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming_user_profile"}
