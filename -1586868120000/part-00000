He played for three [[American League]] (AL) teams from 1990 to 2008, all but the last three years with the [[Chicago White Sox]]. A five-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], he is the only player in major league history to have seven consecutive seasons (1991\u20131997) with at least a .300 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], 100 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (RBI), 100 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]], 100 [[base on balls|walks]], and 20 [[home run]]s. Thomas also won the [[List of Major League Baseball Batting Champions|AL batting title]] in 1997 with a .347 mark.\n\nThomas was named the AL's [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] by unanimous vote in 1993. That year, he became the first White Sox player to hit 40 home runs and led the team to a division title. He repeated as MVP in the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] 1994 season, batting .353 and leading the league in [[slugging average]] and runs. Following two sub-par seasons, Thomas lost a close MVP vote in 2000 despite posting career highs of 43 home runs and 143 RBI. Still, he was named [[AL Comeback Player of the Year]], and Chicago finished with the AL's best record. Later in Thomas's career, a variety of foot injuries and minor ailments reduced his productivity and often limited him to a [[designated hitter]] role. In 2005, his final season in Chicago, he was limited to only 34 games after starting the year on the disabled list and then fracturing a bone in his foot close to where it was surgically repaired the previous off-season. He was unable to play in the post season while the White Sox won the World Series that year.\n\nBy the end of his career, Thomas was tied for eighth in AL history for home runs (521), ninth for RBI (1,704), and sixth for walks (1,667). Among players with at least 7,000 [[at bat]]s in the AL, he ranked eighth in slugging average (.555) and ninth in [[on-base percentage]] (.419). With a .301 lifetime batting average, he became the seventh player in history to retire with at least a .300 average and 500 home runs. He holds White Sox franchise records for career home runs (448), RBI (1,465), runs (1,327), [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (447), [[extra base hit]]s, walks (1,466), slugging average, (.568) and on-base percentage (.427). The White Sox [[Chicago White Sox#Retired numbers|retired]] Thomas's uniform number 35 in 2010 and unveiled a statue of him at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] in 2011. Thomas was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[2014 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2014]] in his first year of eligibility\u2014the first White Sox star to achieve that distinction.<ref>[[Tom Seaver]] and [[Steve Carlton]], both of whom joined the White Sox late in their careers after starring for other teams, were the only previous White Sox players elected in their first year of eligibility.</ref>\n\nThomas was one of the few major league stars who never fell under suspicion during the [[doping in baseball|performance-enhancing drugs]] controversies of the late 1990s. An advocate for drug testing as early as 1995, he was the only active player who agreed to be interviewed for the [[Mitchell Report]] in 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/15/sports/baseball/15talk.html|title=One Player Who Spoke With Mitchell Wonders Why So Few Others Did|last=Curry|first=Jack|date=December 15, 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and college==\nThomas was born and raised in [[Columbus, Georgia]], and attended [[Columbus High School (Columbus, Georgia)|Columbus High School]], where he was a standout in both [[high school football|football]] and baseball. As a sophomore, he hit [[cleanup hitter|cleanup]] for the baseball team, which won a state championship. As a senior, he not only hit .440, but also was named an All-State [[tight end]] in football, and played [[forward (basketball)|forward]] with the basketball team. He wanted desperately to win a contract to play professional baseball, but was not selected in the 1986 amateur draft.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web |url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2715/Thomas-Frank.html |title=Frank Thomas Biography |publisher=Biography.jrank.org |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\n\"I was shocked and sad\", Thomas recalled in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. \"I saw a lot of guys I played against get drafted, and I knew they couldn't do what I could do. But I've had people all my life saying you can't do this, you can't do that. It scars you. No matter how well I've done. People have misunderstood me for some reason. I was always one of the most competitive kids around.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nIn the autumn of 1986, Thomas accepted a scholarship to play [[college football|football]] at [[Auburn University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frankthomascollection.com/87_Auburn_Media_2.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220075204/http://www.frankthomascollection.com/87_Auburn_Media_2.jpg |archivedate=February 20, 2010 }}</ref> His love of baseball drew him to the school's baseball team, where the coach immediately recognized his potential. \"We loved him\", Auburn baseball coach [[Hal Baird]] told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. \"He was fun to be around\u2014always smiling, always bright-eyed.\" He was also a deadly hitter, posting a .359 batting average and leading the [[Auburn Tigers|Tigers]] in runs batted in as a freshman. During the summer of 1987 he played for the U.S. Pan American Team, earning a spot on the final roster that would compete in the [[1987 Pan American Games|Pan American Games]]. The Games coincided with the beginning of football practice back at Auburn, so he left the Pan Am team and returned to college\u2014only to be injured twice in early season football games.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In the summer of 1988, Thomas played for the [[Orleans Cardinals]] of the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]]. Highlights included a 3-homer game in Wareham, as well as a home run over the 434' sign in center field at [[Eldredge Park]] in Orleans. In 2000, Thomas was named a member of the inaugural class of the [[Cape Cod Baseball League#Hall of Fame and Museum|Cape Cod Baseball League Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://capecodbaseball.org/news/hofnews/?article_id=247 |title=Hall of Fame Ceremony 20 January 2001 |publisher=capecodbaseball.org |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDespite the injury that could have jeopardized his football scholarship, Auburn continued his funding, and baseball became his sole sport. He won consideration for the U.S. National Team \u2013 preparing for the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] \u2013 but was cut from the final squad. By the end of his junior baseball season he had hit 19 home runs, 19 doubles, and batted .403 with a slugging percentage of .801. He earned [[Southeastern Conference]] MVP honors his senior year.

He made his major league debut on August 2, 1990, against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] at [[Milwaukee County Stadium|County Stadium]]; he went without a [[hit (baseball)|hit]], going 0 for 4, but had an RBI on a [[fielder's choice]] which scored [[Iv\u00e1n Calder\u00f3n (baseball)|Iv\u00e1n Calder\u00f3n]] as the White Sox won the game 4\u20133.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIL/MIL199008021.shtml |title=August 2, 1990 Chicago White Sox at Milwaukee Brewers Play by Play and Box Score |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> On August 28 Thomas hit the first home run of his career in a road game against the [[Minnesota Twins]] at the [[Hubert H.

In {{Baseball year|1991}}, Thomas finished third in MVP voting with a .318 batting average, 32 home runs and 109 runs batted in, as well as walking 138 times. He won the first of four [[Silver Slugger Award]]s, and led the league in [[on-base percentage]], something he would accomplish four times during his career.\n\nIn 1993 Thomas batted .317 with a club-record 41 homers, plus 128 RBI, 106 runs scored, and 112 walks. He joined a quartet of Hall of Famers ([[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Jimmie Foxx]] and [[Ted Williams]]) as the only players in baseball history to eclipse .300 with more than 20 homers and more than 100 RBI, runs, and walks in three straight seasons. On the back of this historic offensive output, Thomas collected all 28 votes from baseball writers for a unanimous AL [[Most Valuable Player (baseball)|Most Valuable Player]] award, the first by a White Sox player since [[Dick Allen]] in 1972, while leading the White Sox to their first AL West crown in 10 years. At the time, statistical analyst [[Bill James]] projected career statistics of 480 homers and a .311 lifetime average. Then-manager [[Gene Lamont]] was laudatory of Thomas' skills: \"I've only seen him two years now, but I'm convinced that there isn't a pitch he can't hit.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} White Sox announcer Ken Harrelson echoed the praise, \"In my 30 years in the game, I've never seen anyone like Big Hurt [Thomas]. In another 30 years, we may be talking about Frank Thomas in the same way we talk about Ted Williams.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Thomas credited Harrelson with coining the \"Big Hurt\" nickname.<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Face to Face with Frank Thomas |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=84|date=July 1996 |page=104}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, playing just 113 games due to a strike-shortened season, Thomas again put up huge offensive numbers recording 38 homers and 101 RBIs, batted .353, and led the league in runs scored (106), walks (109), and slugging percentage with a whopping .729 mark. Thomas handily won his second consecutive MVP award, taking 24 of 28 first-place votes. He is one of only three first basemen in history to win consecutive MVP awards in the major leagues (Hall of Famer Jimmie Foxx, 1932\u20131933, and [[Albert Pujols]], 2008\u20132009, are the others).\n\nThe 1994 shortened season was due to a players' strike, and perhaps no one felt the sting of the strike more than Thomas, who stood poised to achieve one of baseball's most prestigious honors: the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]]. Not since 1967 had any player finished the regular season first in average, home runs, and runs batted in. Thomas had recorded 32 home runs at the All-Star break, and was contending for the honor when the strike occurred. Pressed by the media to comment on his accomplishments\u2014and his future\u2014Thomas downplayed his own significance, telling the ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'': \"I'm not into being known as the best by fans or the media. I care how I'm perceived by my peers. I can settle for the label 'one of the best' because that means you're considered an elite player.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThomas would continue putting up significant well-rounded offensive numbers, always placing in the top finishers in all major offensive categories, though rarely leading in any one stat. In 1995, he hit .308 with 40 homers and 111 RBI; in 1996 he hit .349 with 40 home runs and 134 RBI, and became an All-Star for the fourth time while finishing 8th in MVP voting.\n\n===Later years (1997\u20132005)===\n[[File:Frank Thomas 1997.jpg|thumb|Thomas on August 17, 1997]]\nFrom 1991 to 1997, Thomas finished in the top 10 of the MVP voting every year. In {{Baseball year|1997}}, Thomas won the batting title and finished third in MVP voting. However, due in part to personal strife off the field, his offensive production wavered during the next two seasons. Never a defensive standout at first base during the early part of his career, Thomas nonetheless preferred playing in the field to serving as a [[designated hitter]], saying that it kept him focused; the fact that he did generally hit better as a first baseman created a dilemma over the years for the White Sox as to whether to use him as a DH, which would reduce wear on his body but might cost some offensive production. By the late 1990s, minor injuries were tending to keep him unavailable for short periods, and 1997 was the last year in which he played more in the field than as a DH. Thomas rebounded with force in {{Baseball year|2000}} when he hit .328 with a career-high 43 homers and 143 runs batted in. Thomas finished second in MVP voting that season, behind [[Jason Giambi]] of the [[Oakland Athletics]]. Thomas also won the 2000 [[MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award|AL Comeback Player of the Year Award]]. But this would not mean an end to the rocky path he would follow later in his career.\n\nIn 2001, after his father died, Thomas also announced during the same week that he would undergo season-ending surgery after an [[MRI]] revealed a triceps tear in his right arm. He was distraught from the combined impact of both personal and professional strife. \"This is the worst week of my life\", he said during a press conference in Chicago. \"First I lose my father, then come back and find out I'm lost for the season.\" He only played in 20 games that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-75248560.html |title=Chicago's Big Hurt |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=May 28, 2001 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310091440/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-75248560.html |archivedate=March 10, 2008}}</ref><!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:thomas_frank0826.jpg|thumb|300px|Frank Thomas swinging during a game against the New York Yankees as a member of the White Sox]] -->\n\nHe rebounded from his injury and played in 148 games in 2002, but hit just .252, a career-low for a complete season, and would never again approach a .300 batting average. But his power and ability to get on base and drive in runs were still in his offensive arsenal. Always a patient hitter, Thomas led the AL in walks four times. Through the end of the 2006 season, he was second among all active players in walks and third in on-base percentage, and ranked among the top 20 lifetime in both categories.\n\nThomas had another solid season in 2003. He tied for second in the AL in home runs (42), and was in the league's top ten in walks, extra base hits, slugging average, and [[on-base plus slugging]], as he led the major leagues in fly ball percentage (54.9%). In 2005 Thomas again suffered injury, but hit 12 home runs in 105 at bats over 35 games, demonstrating his continued power at the plate. Adding together 2004 and 2005, he had fewer than 350 total at bats because of injuries, but hit 30 home runs and drew 80 walks. As a member of the White Sox, Thomas and teammate [[Magglio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]] tied a major league record for back-to-back homers, with six in one season.\n\n===2005 World Series===\n[[File:Frank Thomas 2005 ALDS first pitch.jpg|thumb|right|Frank Thomas throws out the ceremonial first pitch of the [[2005 ALDS]] between the White Sox and Red Sox.]]\nIn 2005 manager [[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]] led the White Sox to a [[2005 World Series|World Series]] victory, their first in 88 years. Thomas was not on the post-season roster of the Series-winning team due to injury, but the team honored his perennial contributions to the franchise during Game 1 of the [[2005 ALDS|Division Series]] against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Thomas was chosen to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. \"What a feeling\", Thomas said. \"Standing [ovation] all around the place. People really cheering me. I had tears in my eyes.

At the time he left the team, his 448 home runs were more than twice as many as any other individual player had hit for the White Sox in their 105-year history.\n\nDespite his perennial offensive production and established fan base in Chicago, the White Sox elected to release Thomas in 2005. Thomas later expressed disappointment with how his 16-year tenure with the White Sox was ended, saying that chairman [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] did not call him to tell him he wasn't coming back. He also said that he and [[Kenny Williams (baseball)|Kenny Williams]] did not see eye-to-eye after Williams became [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] following the 2000 season. At the time, Thomas was unhappy that his next-to-last deal with the White Sox contained a \"diminished skills\" clause.

web |url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/962-the-nickname-game-in-sports |title=Nicknames in Pro Sports |publisher=Kidzworld |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> is an American former professional baseball [[first baseman]] and [[designated hitter]] in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He played for three [[American League]] (AL) teams from 1990 to 2008, all but the last three years with the [[Chicago White Sox]]. A five-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], he is the only player in major league history to have seven consecutive seasons (1991\u20131997) with at least a .300 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], 100 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (RBI), 100 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]], 100 [[base on balls|walks]], and 20 [[home run]]s. Thomas also won the [[List of Major League Baseball Batting Champions|AL batting title]] in 1997 with a .347 mark.\n\nThomas was named the AL's [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] by unanimous vote in 1993. That year, he became the first White Sox player to hit 40 home runs and led the team to a division title. He repeated as MVP in the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] 1994 season, batting .353 and leading the league in [[slugging average]] and runs. Following two sub-par seasons, Thomas lost a close MVP vote in 2000 despite posting career highs of 43 home runs and 143 RBI. Still, he was named [[AL Comeback Player of the Year]], and Chicago finished with the AL's best record. Later in Thomas's career, a variety of foot injuries and minor ailments reduced his productivity and often limited him to a [[designated hitter]] role. In 2005, his final season in Chicago, he was limited to only 34 games after starting the year on the disabled list and then fracturing a bone in his foot close to where it was surgically repaired the previous off-season. He was unable to play in the post season while the White Sox won the World Series that year.\n\nBy the end of his career, Thomas was tied for eighth in AL history for home runs (521), ninth for RBI (1,704), and sixth for walks (1,667). Among players with at least 7,000 [[at bat]]s in the AL, he ranked eighth in slugging average (.555) and ninth in [[on-base percentage]] (.419). With a .301 lifetime batting average, he became the seventh player in history to retire with at least a .300 average and 500 home runs. He holds White Sox franchise records for career home runs (448), RBI (1,465), runs (1,327), [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (447), [[extra base hit]]s, walks (1,466), slugging average, (.568) and on-base percentage (.427). The White Sox [[Chicago White Sox#Retired numbers|retired]] Thomas's uniform number 35 in 2010 and unveiled a statue of him at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] in 2011. Thomas was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[2014 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2014]] in his first year of eligibility\u2014the first White Sox star to achieve that distinction.<ref>[[Tom Seaver]] and [[Steve Carlton]], both of whom joined the White Sox late in their careers after starring for other teams, were the only previous White Sox players elected in their first year of eligibility.</ref>\n\nThomas was one of the few major league stars who never fell under suspicion during the [[doping in baseball|performance-enhancing drugs]] controversies of the late 1990s. An advocate for drug testing as early as 1995, he was the only active player who agreed to be interviewed for the [[Mitchell Report]] in 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/15/sports/baseball/15talk.html|title=One Player Who Spoke With Mitchell Wonders Why So Few Others Did|last=Curry|first=Jack|date=December 15, 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and college==\nThomas was born and raised in [[Columbus, Georgia]], and attended [[Columbus High School (Columbus, Georgia)|Columbus High School]], where he was a standout in both [[high school football|football]] and baseball. As a sophomore, he hit [[cleanup hitter|cleanup]] for the baseball team, which won a state championship. As a senior, he not only hit .440, but also was named an All-State [[tight end]] in football, and played [[forward (basketball)|forward]] with the basketball team. He wanted desperately to win a contract to play professional baseball, but was not selected in the 1986 amateur draft.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web |url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2715/Thomas-Frank.html |title=Frank Thomas Biography |publisher=Biography.jrank.org |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\n\"I was shocked and sad\", Thomas recalled in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. \"I saw a lot of guys I played against get drafted, and I knew they couldn't do what I could do. But I've had people all my life saying you can't do this, you can't do that. It scars you. No matter how well I've done. People have misunderstood me for some reason. I was always one of the most competitive kids around.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nIn the autumn of 1986, Thomas accepted a scholarship to play [[college football|football]] at [[Auburn University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frankthomascollection.com/87_Auburn_Media_2.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220075204/http://www.frankthomascollection.com/87_Auburn_Media_2.jpg |archivedate=February 20, 2010 }}</ref> His love of baseball drew him to the school's baseball team, where the coach immediately recognized his potential. \"We loved him\", Auburn baseball coach [[Hal Baird]] told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. \"He was fun to be around\u2014always smiling, always bright-eyed.\" He was also a deadly hitter, posting a .359 batting average and leading the [[Auburn Tigers|Tigers]] in runs batted in as a freshman. During the summer of 1987 he played for the U.S. Pan American Team, earning a spot on the final roster that would compete in the [[1987 Pan American Games|Pan American Games]]. The Games coincided with the beginning of football practice back at Auburn, so he left the Pan Am team and returned to college\u2014only to be injured twice in early season football games.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In the summer of 1988, Thomas played for the [[Orleans Cardinals]] of the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]]. Highlights included a 3-homer game in Wareham, as well as a home run over the 434' sign in center field at [[Eldredge Park]] in Orleans. In 2000, Thomas was named a member of the inaugural class of the [[Cape Cod Baseball League#Hall of Fame and Museum|Cape Cod Baseball League Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://capecodbaseball.org/news/hofnews/?article_id=247 |title=Hall of Fame Ceremony 20 January 2001 |publisher=capecodbaseball.org |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDespite the injury that could have jeopardized his football scholarship, Auburn continued his funding, and baseball became his sole sport. He won consideration for the U.S. National Team \u2013 preparing for the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] \u2013 but was cut from the final squad. By the end of his junior baseball season he had hit 19 home runs, 19 doubles, and batted .403 with a slugging percentage of .801. He earned [[Southeastern Conference]] MVP honors his senior year. Thomas concluded his college career with 49 home runs, a school record.<ref name=\"library\">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Frank_Thomas_1968 |title=The Ballplayers \u2013 Frank Thomas |accessdate=January 9, 2009 |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011082614/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Frank_Thomas_1968 |archivedate=October 11, 2008 }}</ref> In May 2011, he was inducted into the [[Alabama Sports Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Chicago White Sox==\n\n===Early years (1990\u20131996)===\nThe [[Chicago White Sox]] selected Thomas with the seventh pick in the first round of the June [[1989 Major League Baseball draft]]. He made his major league debut on August 2, 1990, against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] at [[Milwaukee County Stadium|County Stadium]]; he went without a [[hit (baseball)|hit]], going 0 for 4, but had an RBI on a [[fielder's choice]] which scored [[Iv\u00e1n Calder\u00f3n (baseball)|Iv\u00e1n Calder\u00f3n]] as the White Sox won the game 4\u20133.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIL/MIL199008021.shtml |title=August 2, 1990 Chicago White Sox at Milwaukee Brewers Play by Play and Box Score |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> On August 28 Thomas hit the first home run of his career in a road game against the [[Minnesota Twins]] at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]] (which, coincidentally, would also be the site of his 500th career home run). He hit the home run off pitcher [[Gary Wayne]] in the top of the ninth inning as his team lost 12\u20136.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIN/MIN199008280.shtml |title=August 28, 1990 Chicago White Sox at Minnesota Twins Play by Play and Box Score |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThomas became known for his menacing home run power; in the on-deck circle, he routinely swung a rusted piece of [[rebar]] that he reportedly found during a renovation project in [[Comiskey Park|Old Comiskey Park]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Pinto |first=David |url=http://www.baseballmusings.com/archives/012498.php |title=Hurt Nostalgia |publisher=Baseball Musings |date=December 11, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> In his first full season, Thomas established himself as a multi-talented hitter, combining power with hitting for average, drawing walks, and driving in runs. In {{Baseball year|1991}}, Thomas finished third in MVP voting with a .318 batting average, 32 home runs and 109 runs batted in, as well as walking 138 times. He won the first of four [[Silver Slugger Award]]s, and led the league in [[on-base percentage]], something he would accomplish four times during his career.\n\nIn 1993 Thomas batted .317 with a club-record 41 homers, plus 128 RBI, 106 runs scored, and 112 walks. He joined a quartet of Hall of Famers ([[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Jimmie Foxx]] and [[Ted Williams]]) as the only players in baseball history to eclipse .300 with more than 20 homers and more than 100 RBI, runs, and walks in three straight seasons. On the back of this historic offensive output, Thomas collected all 28 votes from baseball writers for a unanimous AL [[Most Valuable Player (baseball)|Most Valuable Player]] award, the first by a White Sox player since [[Dick Allen]] in 1972, while leading the White Sox to their first AL West crown in 10 years. At the time, statistical analyst [[Bill James]] projected career statistics of 480 homers and a .311 lifetime average. Then-manager [[Gene Lamont]] was laudatory of Thomas' skills: \"I've only seen him two years now, but I'm convinced that there isn't a pitch he can't hit.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} White Sox announcer Ken Harrelson echoed the praise, \"In my 30 years in the game, I've never seen anyone like Big Hurt [Thomas]. In another 30 years, we may be talking about Frank Thomas in the same way we talk about Ted Williams.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Thomas credited Harrelson with coining the \"Big Hurt\" nickname.<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Face to Face with Frank Thomas |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=84|date=July 1996 |page=104}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, playing just 113 games due to a strike-shortened season, Thomas again put up huge offensive numbers recording 38 homers and 101 RBIs, batted .353, and led the league in runs scored (106), walks (109), and slugging percentage with a whopping .729 mark. Thomas handily won his second consecutive MVP award, taking 24 of 28 first-place votes. He is one of only three first basemen in history to win consecutive MVP awards in the major leagues (Hall of Famer Jimmie Foxx, 1932\u20131933, and [[Albert Pujols]], 2008\u20132009, are the others).\n\nThe 1994 shortened season was due to a players' strike, and perhaps no one felt the sting of the strike more than Thomas, who stood poised to achieve one of baseball's most prestigious honors: the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]]. Not since 1967 had any player finished the regular season first in average, home runs, and runs batted in. Thomas had recorded 32 home runs at the All-Star break, and was contending for the honor when the strike occurred. Pressed by the media to comment on his accomplishments\u2014and his future\u2014Thomas downplayed his own significance, telling the ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'': \"I'm not into being known as the best by fans or the media. I care how I'm perceived by my peers. I can settle for the label 'one of the best' because that means you're considered an elite player.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThomas would continue putting up significant well-rounded offensive numbers, always placing in the top finishers in all major offensive categories, though rarely leading in any one stat. In 1995, he hit .308 with 40 homers and 111 RBI; in 1996 he hit .349 with 40 home runs and 134 RBI, and became an All-Star for the fourth time while finishing 8th in MVP voting.\n\n===Later years (1997\u20132005)===\n[[File:Frank Thomas 1997.jpg|thumb|Thomas on August 17, 1997]]\nFrom 1991 to 1997, Thomas finished in the top 10 of the MVP voting every year. In {{Baseball year|1997}}, Thomas won the batting title and finished third in MVP voting. However, due in part to personal strife off the field, his offensive production wavered during the next two seasons. Never a defensive standout at first base during the early part of his career, Thomas nonetheless preferred playing in the field to serving as a [[designated hitter]], saying that it kept him focused; the fact that he did generally hit better as a first baseman created a dilemma over the years for the White Sox as to whether to use him as a DH, which would reduce wear on his body but might cost some offensive production. By the late 1990s, minor injuries were tending to keep him unavailable for short periods, and 1997 was the last year in which he played more in the field than as a DH. Thomas rebounded with force in {{Baseball year|2000}} when he hit .328 with a career-high 43 homers and 143 runs batted in. Thomas finished second in MVP voting that season, behind [[Jason Giambi]] of the [[Oakland Athletics]]. Thomas also won the 2000 [[MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award|AL Comeback Player of the Year Award]]. But this would not mean an end to the rocky path he would follow later in his career.\n\nIn 2001, after his father died, Thomas also announced during the same week that he would undergo season-ending surgery after an [[MRI]] revealed a triceps tear in his right arm. He was distraught from the combined impact of both personal and professional strife. \"This is the worst week of my life\", he said during a press conference in Chicago. \"First I lose my father, then come back and find out I'm lost for the season.\" He only played in 20 games that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-75248560.html |title=Chicago's Big Hurt |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=May 28, 2001 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310091440/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-75248560.html |archivedate=March 10, 2008}}</ref><!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:thomas_frank0826.jpg|thumb|300px|Frank Thomas swinging during a game against the New York Yankees as a member of the White Sox]] -->\n\nHe rebounded from his injury and played in 148 games in 2002, but hit just .252, a career-low for a complete season, and would never again approach a .300 batting average. But his power and ability to get on base and drive in runs were still in his offensive arsenal. Always a patient hitter, Thomas led the AL in walks four times. Through the end of the 2006 season, he was second among all active players in walks and third in on-base percentage, and ranked among the top 20 lifetime in both categories.\n\nThomas had another solid season in 2003. He tied for second in the AL in home runs (42), and was in the league's top ten in walks, extra base hits, slugging average, and [[on-base plus slugging]], as he led the major leagues in fly ball percentage (54.9%). In 2005 Thomas again suffered injury, but hit 12 home runs in 105 at bats over 35 games, demonstrating his continued power at the plate. Adding together 2004 and 2005, he had fewer than 350 total at bats because of injuries, but hit 30 home runs and drew 80 walks. As a member of the White Sox, Thomas and teammate [[Magglio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]] tied a major league record for back-to-back homers, with six in one season.\n\n===2005 World Series===\n[[File:Frank Thomas 2005 ALDS first pitch.jpg|thumb|right|Frank Thomas throws out the ceremonial first pitch of the [[2005 ALDS]] between the White Sox and Red Sox.]]\nIn 2005 manager [[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]] led the White Sox to a [[2005 World Series|World Series]] victory, their first in 88 years. Thomas was not on the post-season roster of the Series-winning team due to injury, but the team honored his perennial contributions to the franchise during Game 1 of the [[2005 ALDS|Division Series]] against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Thomas was chosen to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. \"What a feeling\", Thomas said. \"Standing [ovation] all around the place. People really cheering me. I had tears in my eyes. To really know the fans cared that much about me \u2013 it was a great feeling.

At the time he left the team, his 448 home runs were more than twice as many as any other individual player had hit for the White Sox in their 105-year history.\n\nDespite his perennial offensive production and established fan base in Chicago, the White Sox elected to release Thomas in 2005. Thomas later expressed disappointment with how his 16-year tenure with the White Sox was ended, saying that chairman [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] did not call him to tell him he wasn't coming back. He also said that he and [[Kenny Williams (baseball)|Kenny Williams]] did not see eye-to-eye after Williams became [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] following the 2000 season. At the time, Thomas was unhappy that his next-to-last deal with the White Sox contained a \"diminished skills\" clause. He said the White Sox should have traded him after the playoffs that season.\n\n\"I've got a lot of respect for Jerry Reinsdorf, I do. But I really thought, the relationship we had over the last 16 years, he would have picked up the phone to say, 'Big guy, we're moving forward. We're going somewhere different. We don't know your situation or what's going to happen.' I can live with that, I really can\", Thomas said. \"But treating me like some passing-by-player. I've got no respect for that.\" Thomas said he was not bitter or angry and had joined the A's with an open mind.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://sports.outsidethebeltway.com/2006/02/white-sox-gm-frank-thomas-an-idiot/ |title=White Sox GM: Frank Thomas an Idiot |publisher=OTB Sports |date=February 27, 2006 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n\n===Oakland Athletics===\n[[File:Frank Thomas (baseball).jpg|thumb|Frank Thomas mid-swing on April 3, 2006]]\nThomas signed with the [[Oakland Athletics]] to a one-year, $500,000 deal with incentives on January 26, 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2305916 |title=Former ChiSox slugger agrees to 1-year deal with A's |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=January 26, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}</ref> The Athletics installed Thomas as their everyday DH. He started the season slowly, but ended the season as the team leader in home runs, RBI, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage. He provided a powerful right-handed bat in the middle of the lineup for the division-leading Athletics. He had a stretch where he hit a home run in six straight games.\n\nOn May 22, 2006, Thomas homered twice in his first game against his former team. Before Thomas came up to lead off the second inning, a musical montage played on the [[Jumbotron]] at [[U.S. Cellular Field]], paying tribute to Thomas's legacy with the White Sox. He was cheered in his introduction by the White Sox fans.

During the A's first playoff game on October 3, Thomas hit two solo home runs, leading the A's to a 3\u20132 win over the Twins.

He is spotted reading \"[[Playgirl]]\" magazine in episode 12.<ref name=\"F-14\">[http://www.anft.net/f-14/f14-squadron-vx4.htm HOME OF M.A.T.S. - The most comprehensive Grumman F-14 Reference Work - by Torsten Anft!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In the manga series, Mickey dies in the final attack after trying to save Seilane from the wreck of her fighter.\n\n;Saki Vashtal (Saki Vashutarl)\n:A member of the royal family and a commissioned officer (Lt. Colonel) in the Asranian air force, he is distinguishable by his black shades (which in the manga was due to an eye injury), long hair, and an X-shaped scar on his forehead. Saki is the son of Abdael, the eldest son of the late former king of Asran. Asran was, at the time, the only middle eastern country not exporting its oil. Saki's grandfather did not wish to sell out to the West or to Communists and suspected that Abdael was dealings with both sides. For this reason, on his deathbed, he declared his younger son, Zak, the next king. Humiliated, Abdael became leader of an anti-government rebel force backed by various communist countries. Saki, remained loyal because of his late mother's love for Asran and is Area 88's commanding officer, though it is clear that Saki feels shame for betraying his own father and perceives that his late mother would be saddened by his father's actions. The scar on his forehead is self-inflicted as a symbol of this shame. (In the English-language comic, Saki scarred himself early in the war when, as a commander of Asran's regular Air Force, he allowed himself to be tricked by his father - allowing anti-government forces to successfully attack Saki's base.) Saki appears in all three versions. He is the cousin of Kitori Palvanaff. Though not incompetent, Saki is not exactly considered an outstanding leader by the pilots but they follow his orders for the most part simply because it's what they are paid to do - and if they don't he will either dock their pay or shoot them. Although shown as a capable pilot in the manga and OVA series by efficiently flying the [[Kfir]], Saki is leading the force from  the control tower in the TV series.\n\n;Ryoko Tsugumo\n:The daughter of CEO Tsugumo of Yamato Air Lines (YAL), she met Shin and Satoru when she was introduced to flying airplanes for the first time. Ryoko became infatuated with Shin before he left for Paris to conduct his pilot training. She became furious at Satoru when she found out that Shin was forced to serve in the Asranian air force against his will, refusing Satoru's wishes for them to get together. In the TV series, Ryoko agrees to marry Satoru after being shown proof that Shin died in a plane crash in Asran. However, she bolts on the day of their wedding when Makoto comes clean and give her a photo of Shin's F-5 jet. In the manga and OAV series, she consents to let Kanzaki have his way with her sexually if he will buy her YAL stocks at full price, allowing her to raise enough money to buy out Shin's contract. She is saved from doing so when police come to the hotel room to arrest Kanzaki on several accounts concerning recent scandals involving the carrier.\n\n;Satoru Kanzaki\n:Shin's closest friend from their days in an orphanage. Satoru worked alongside him at Yamato Airlines, but jealousy at seeing Shin going out with the company CEO's daughter prompts him to trick Shin while drunk into signing a contract for another flight that turns out to be a contract for the Asranian military - hoping that Shin will die in battle. CEO Tsugumo picked him to be his successor in Yamato Air Lines and arranged for him to marry Ryoko. In the manga, Tsugumo is forced to resign by shareholders when Kanzaki makes an underhanded purchasing deal with a shady [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jet]] manufacturer, assuring himself a large percentage of stock which installs him as the new YAL president. The jets turn out to be defective, causing an accidental crash which kills all aboard, thus opening Kanzaki to investigation. In the end, his wedding plans are ruined when Ryoko learns Shin's whereabouts after meeting Saki Vashtal and he is arrested for embezzlement, tax evasion, and his involvement in the plane crash. The arrest is hardly the end of Kanzaki as he returns with a number of schemes until the end of the manga series where he dies in an air duel with Shin. He is simply arrested in the OVA series. Kanzaki's backstory remains the same in the TV series, where he even fails a senior 747 captain's examination for a long-distance flight to Tokyo without autopilot after he almost collides with Shin, who was out on a test flight of his new F-20. His fate is left unresolved after Ryoko escapes on their wedding day.\n\n===Freelancers===\n\n;Kim Aba\n:A young pilot from an African nation, he was mocked by most of the base's freelance pilots and other personnel because of his age. Saki, Roundell, Mickey, Kitori and Shin regard the boy as someone that they can rely on in a matter of crisis, consider Kim as a friend and a good pilot. Kim only appears in the manga and 2004 anime; in the latter, his emblem consisted of a red swan with golden wings, and flies the [[AV-8 Harrier II]].\n\n;Morris\n: An American pilot briefly seen in the Eclipse series. Morris is a skilled ground attack pilot flying a [[T-6 Texan]], a single-engined prop-driven plane used to train pilots in [[World War II]], and the oldest warplane on the base. Strongly urged to get a jet, he prefers the familiarity of the Texan. Ironically, his preference saves the base from [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] attack by the anti-government forces. As the enemy missile approaches, the runways are suddenly covered by swarms of [[locusts]], preventing the jet-powered planes from flying. Morris's Texan is able to launch and clear the runway - allowing others to launch and intercept the missile. Unfortunately, the Texan is disabled by the swarm nonetheless, and Morris is killed.\n\n;Mario Bandini\n: A young Italian mercenary hungry for action but lacking any sense of teamwork. He arrives shortly after the onslaught of the Wolfpack, immediately making himself unwelcome. Skilled in aerobatics - a vet of the [[Frecce Tricolori]] - Bandini finds combat much more traumatic than he expected.\n\n;Greg Gates\n:A bearded Danish mercenary, he is noted by the base's mercenary force for being the only person who couldn't die, sometimes apparently oblivious or apathetic to the danger he faces. Greg serves as comedic relief and humor, as his actions lead him to trouble with his comrades and his officers, not to mention unintentionally making the civil war even worse. Pilots the [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]](OVA), and [[A-4 Skyhawk]](2004 anime), Greg appears in all versions of ''Area 88''.\n\n;Kitori Palvanaff\n:Only daughter of the King of Asran and cousin of Saki Vashtal, she was sent to Area 88 as the base's only female freelance pilot. She lived in Area 88 as one of the boys, fighting alongside them under the base's terms. She takes a liking for Kim for being the youngest freelancer to serve in the Asranian air force and loves to tease him. Later on, she also take a liking for Makoto as she finds him friendly. She was mystified with Shin's personality, finding him cold and alone, though the two are on good terms. Kitori only appears in the 2004 anime. Kitori sports an emblem consisting of three red arrows against a red bow, and flies a [[Mirage F1]]. She appears in the manga as ''Seilane Balnock'', who dies with Mickey in the final battle.\n\n;Nguyen Van Com\n:A former pilot for the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. He encountered Mickey several times during the Vietnam War, and he was known as the \"Shark of [[Gulf of Tonkin|Tonkin Bay]]\". He frequently argues with Shin, mainly because Shin shot down a friendly fighter whose pilot was blinded. Flying the [[F-105 Thunderchief]], Nguyen enjoys the killing of enemy pilots, and even shoots an enemy pilot as he ejected from an aircraft. Despite his disagreements with Shin, he comes to respect him. He suffers the fate of the pilot he shot down, being shot as he ejected from an aircraft. Nguyen appears in the OVA and manga series but not in the Eclipse comic series.\n\n;Invulnerable Charlie\n:A pilot who once flew at Area 88. He returns because he was hired by Kanzaki to kill Shin. He uses the confusion caused by battle with the Wolf Pack to kill Shin. However, he is killed by [[birdstrike]] when a seagull slams into his cockpit and causes him to lose control. Shin is able to bail out from his plane and survive. Charlie appears in the manga and the OVA. The OVA English dub calls him Phoenix Charlie. Aspects of his character, however, are merged with Rocky for the character of Makoto Shingo in the 2004 TV series. In the Elipse comic, he is known as \"Killer Charlie\" and is killed dogfighting with Shin.\n\n;Bowman\n:Bowman initially gained Shin's dislike by shamelessly trying to borrow money from his fellow pilots so that he could pay the penalty for turning down a mission he was too scared to go on. Eventually he goes and returns only to brag about his kill record for that mission, ignoring the fact that it was at the cost of his wingman who was killed watching Bowman's back. Bowman appears in the manga, the Eclipse comic and the OAV although the OAV does not explore his character.\n\n;Hoover Kippenburg\n:A former pilot in the [[Luftwaffe|West German Air Force]], a guilt-ridden Hoover joined after an accident while training rookie pilots. He flew too low and into the sun and this trainees, trying to follow, accidentally crashed into a mountain. Well liked by the other pilots, Hoover was temporarily entrusted with Saki's position as flight leader. Indeed, many of the pilots prefer Hoover over Saki in the position. Hoover only appears in the manga, including the Eclipse version.\n\n;Boris\n:A former British [[Royal Air Force]] pilot, Boris is haunted by the ghosts of his former wingmates. He is afraid to sleep with the lights off, for in his sleep, the ghosts of his dead comrades come to visit him in his dreams. In the OAV and the 2004 anime, Boris is shot down and killed by anti-aircraft fire. Boris and Shin are the only pilots in area 88 to fly the [[F-8 Crusader]]. Boris appears in all three versions.\n\n;Escape Killers\n:Three pilots of African (Black) descent, it was assumed that they came to Area 88 because the Central African conflicts pay so poorly. This trio of enigmatic pilots, seems to regard everyone at Area 88 with suspicion and keep to themselves. Shin, frustrated after a massive setback, plans to desert in the dead of morning only to encounter the three African pilots waiting for him. Mick appears, stating that he remembered stories about three Black pilots in Africa who specialize in hunting down deserters. Soon, the other Area 88 pilots defend Shin on the grounds that the Escape Killers are harassing an innocent person who could have just been taking an early morning walk. Saki and the other pilots convince the Escape Killers to leave. The Escape Killers were called Enforcers in the English translation of the manga. They also appeared in the OVA trilogy.\n\n;Jess\n:One of the Area 88 pilots in the OVA. Pilots a [[Kfir]]. Shin has to make an important choice when Jess cracks in the middle of a fight. He appears briefly but reflects Shin's change from sympathizer to hardened soldier.\n\n;Patrick Reed\n:Patrick is Mickey's wingman back in Vietnam. The Oklahoma native suffered a trauma during a dogfight when he hesitated to fire at an enemy MiG, which led to the development of a panicky dogfight style in which he will [[aileron roll]] while firing his guns (Like in a lot of media, the TV series erroneously refers to it as a [[barrel roll]]). Years after the Vietnam war, Patrick becomes a pilot for the enemy of the Kingdom of Asran. During a dogfight against Asran mercenaries, he was gunned down by Mickey. The two talked over the radio, and Patrick said (maybe not exact words), \"Finally. I can go back home to [[Oklahoma]] to farm again.\" Then, Patrick dies, going down with his [[MiG-23 Flogger]] fighter in the desert.\n\n===Base personnel===\n;Gustav\n:Head of the base's technician group. Supports the freelancers by doing field repairs to their jets before and after a sortie against the rebels. Gustav appears only in the 2004 anime.\n\n;McCoy\n:The base's scrounger and head of the Area 88's PX shop, deals with American dollars as a means of currency transaction. He provided the mercenaries with most of the items that they need such as fighter planes and weapons, with civilian items as well. McCoy's items are notorious for often being second hand and unreliable, particularly when he offers them at a discount. At one point, he admits selling spare parts scavenged from planes shot down near the base. McCoy appears in all version of ''Area 88''.\n\n;Big Sammy\n:The codename used for the radar controllers of Area 88. Responsible for sending out tactical data of planes to the pilots and Saki.\n\n===Officers===\n;Roundell\n:An old man of British descent, Major Roundell has his right eye replaced by an eyepatch. He serves as the base's executive officer and the confidant of Saki Vashtal. He is also an excellent fighter pilot, specialising in Low level assaults, flying the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] with ease, at least in the 2004 remake. Roundell appears in all three versions of ''Area 88''.\n\n===Others===\n;Goh \"Rocky\" Mutsugi (Makoto Shinjo in the TV series)\n:A SO news reporter sent to Area 88 to cover the rumor of foreign freelance pilots fighting in the Asranian civil war, he was intrigued by Shin's presence as the only lone Japanese pilot to fight for the Asranian military. One of Rocky's photos, with Shin in the background, was seen by Ryoko in a magazine article on Asran and this convinced her that Shin was alive. He dies in the OVA rendition after he joins a pilot on a patrol, and is shot down. In the 2004 TV series, he survived the series and eventually confessed that his sponsor was Satoru Kanzaki because he wanted to get a photo of Shin's corpse as proof to Ryoko that he died in action, forcing her to marry him. However, he later help thwart the marriage. In the Eclipse comic, he survives being shot down, but is severely injured in the ordeal. Rocky travels the world, apparently having no ties back in [[Japan]], telling the mercenaries that a photographer leaves nothing behind but his camera. Rocky appears (with different names, hair colors and physical builds) in all three versions of ''Area 88''.\n\n;Prince Rishaal\n:Saki's younger brother. Rishaal's mother died giving birth to the prince, but Saki does not resent his brother for this, and in one pre-war flashback, the two are apparently close. Unlike Saki, Rishaal followed their father and went over to the anti-government forces, though his true loyalties remain unclear. When Mickey Simon is captured by anti-government forces, Rishaal arranges for his immediate release. In the Eclipse Manga, Rishaal is shown plans to destroy Area-88 using a bomb attached to a large subterranean drill. While seeming to approve the plan, he secretly intends to thwart it.\n\n;Taeko Yasuda\n:Mr. Tsugumo's secretary and Ryoko's confidant, she takes an immediate dislike and distrust to Kanzaki. She is attractive and intelligent, but also lonely - and in the Eclipse version, it's suggested that she is growing insecure about her age. In the manga and OAV, by happenstance, she sees the magazine article on Asran's civil war and the photo taken by the late Rocky, a photo in which Shin appears in the background. Taeko's friend pins down the location and deduces that Shin was at Area 88. Taeko also saves Ryoko from allowing Kanzaki to use her in a compromising position in order to have him willing to buy her stock share (at full price) and use the money to buy out Shin's contract. Taeko appears in all three versions, but is never specifically identified in the 2004 anime.\n\n;Giuseppe Farina\n:A Paris-based Mafia don whom Kanzaki requests to contract a hitman on Shin's life. It is through Farina that Charlie is hired as an assassin to return to Area 88. In return, Kanzaki would purchase airline parts from companies under Farina's control. Unfortunately for Kanzaki, Farina and Maxwell Corporation (the company with which Kanzaki dealt for the defective airbus), both plan to use Kanzaki as a fall guy in a takeover of Yamato airlines. Farina appears briefly in the OAV but does not seem to have no other involvement beyond the assassination attempt. In the manga, Farina has a much larger role and is later involved in supplying weapons to the Anti-Government forces. He does not appear at all in the 2004 TV series.\n\n;The Wolfpack\n:A rival mercenary squadron that is working for the anti government forces. They fly exclusively the [[Mig-23]] and are considered a very serious threat to the Area 88 pilots. In the original manga, they cause a major setback by bombing Area 88 and destroying all of the pilot's planes and McCoy's warehouse. In the OAV, they attack Area 81 instead. In the Eclipse comic, where the Wolfpack's plane is identified as a \"MiG-27D\", both bases are attacked. Both instances, however, lead to a ferocious air battle in which the Wolfpack is ultimately defeated. There is no mention of the Wolfpack in the 2004 TV series, although a squadron of MiG-23s (led by Patrick Reed) did in fact appear to challenge the pilots of Area 88.\n\n;The Sniper\n:A lone gunman who is very effective with the use of his rifle. He singlehandedly shuts down Area 88 operations with accurate fire on aircraft, equipment, and crew, but is finally defeated when his position is located and he is strafed by Shin's aircraft. His ultimate fate is left unknown, as his body is never found. He only appears in the 2004 TV series.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Area 88}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Area 88]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Area 88'' characters}}\nThe following is a list of characters from the ''[[Area 88]]'' franchise by [[Kaoru Shintani]].\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n[[File:Area 88 characters.jpg|thumb|right|300px|From left to right: Shin Kazama and Mickey Simon as depicted in the OAV series.

Shin became the top ace at Area 88, though he gradually felt his humanity slipping as his time at the Area passed.\n:Because of this, he was cold to most of the people inside Area 88; he would make friends with Mickey Simon, Kim Aoba, Kitori Palvanaff, Roundell and his commanding officer, Saki Vashtal. All his aircraft (which include an [[F-8 Crusader]], an [[F-5E]], [[F-20A]], and a [[Saab Group|Saab]] [[J-35 Draken]]) sported a flaming [[unicorn]] head painted on the tail. Determined to survive the war without losing his humanity, Shin's principal motivation is to save enough money to buy out his contract.\n\n;Mickey Simon\n:{{Animevoices |[[Toshihiko Seki]] (TV) }}<ref>{{Cite web |author=Doi, Hitoshi |url=http://www.usagi.org/doi/seiyuu/seki-toshihiko/roles.html |title=Seki Toshihiko roles |work=Seiyuu Database |accessdate=September 1, 2016 }}</ref>\n:An Ex-US Navy American pilot and Vietnam War Veteran who signed up to fight for the Asranian government in its civil war after serving in the Vietnam War with the [[VF-33|VF-33 Starfighters]]<ref name=\"F-14\">[http://www.anft.net/f-14/f14-squadron-vx4.htm HOME OF M.A.T.S. - The most comprehensive Grumman F-14 Reference Work - by Torsten Anft!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the OVA and VF-96 Fighting Falcons aboard the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS Enterprise]] in the series.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}<!--VF-84 Jolly Rogers?--> Addicted to the life of combat pilot, Mickey is unable to adjust to life at home.

He appears briefly but reflects Shin's change from sympathizer to hardened soldier.\n\n;Patrick Reed\n:Patrick is Mickey's wingman back in Vietnam. The Oklahoma native suffered a trauma during a dogfight when he hesitated to fire at an enemy MiG, which led to the development of a panicky dogfight style in which he will [[aileron roll]] while firing his guns (Like in a lot of media, the TV series erroneously refers to it as a [[barrel roll]]). Years after the Vietnam war, Patrick becomes a pilot for the enemy of the Kingdom of Asran. During a dogfight against Asran mercenaries, he was gunned down by Mickey. The two talked over the radio, and Patrick said (maybe not exact words), \"Finally. I can go back home to [[Oklahoma]] to farm again.\" Then, Patrick dies, going down with his [[MiG-23 Flogger]] fighter in the desert.\n\n===Base personnel===\n;Gustav\n:Head of the base's technician group. Supports the freelancers by doing field repairs to their jets before and after a sortie against the rebels. Gustav appears only in the 2004 anime.\n\n;McCoy\n:The base's scrounger and head of the Area 88's PX shop, deals with American dollars as a means of currency transaction. He provided the mercenaries with most of the items that they need such as fighter planes and weapons, with civilian items as well. McCoy's items are notorious for often being second hand and unreliable, particularly when he offers them at a discount. At one point, he admits selling spare parts scavenged from planes shot down near the base. McCoy appears in all version of ''Area 88''.\n\n;Big Sammy\n:The codename used for the radar controllers of Area 88. Responsible for sending out tactical data of planes to the pilots and Saki.\n\n===Officers===\n;Roundell\n:An old man of British descent, Major Roundell has his right eye replaced by an eyepatch. He serves as the base's executive officer and the confidant of Saki Vashtal. He is also an excellent fighter pilot, specialising in Low level assaults, flying the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] with ease, at least in the 2004 remake. Roundell appears in all three versions of ''Area 88''.\n\n===Others===\n;Goh \"Rocky\" Mutsugi (Makoto Shinjo in the TV series)\n:A SO news reporter sent to Area 88 to cover the rumor of foreign freelance pilots fighting in the Asranian civil war, he was intrigued by Shin's presence as the only lone Japanese pilot to fight for the Asranian military. One of Rocky's photos, with Shin in the background, was seen by Ryoko in a magazine article on Asran and this convinced her that Shin was alive. He dies in the OVA rendition after he joins a pilot on a patrol, and is shot down. In the 2004 TV series, he survived the series and eventually confessed that his sponsor was Satoru Kanzaki because he wanted to get a photo of Shin's corpse as proof to Ryoko that he died in action, forcing her to get married to him. However, he later help thwart the marriage. In the Eclipse comic, he survives being shot down, but is severely injured in the ordeal. Rocky travels the world, apparently having no ties back in [[Japan]], telling the mercenaries that a photographer leaves nothing behind but his camera. Rocky appears (with different names, hair colors and physical builds) in all three versions of ''Area 88''.\n\n;Prince Rishaal\n:Saki's younger brother. Rishaal's mother died giving birth to the prince, but Saki does not resent his brother for this, and in one pre-war flashback, the two are apparently close. Unlike Saki, Rishaal followed their father and went over to the anti-government forces, though his true loyalties remain unclear. When Mickey Simon is captured by anti-government forces, Rishaal arranges for his immediate release. In the Eclipse Manga, Rishaal is shown plans to destroy Area-88 using a bomb attached to a large subterranean drill. While seeming to approve the plan, he secretly intends to thwart it.\n\n;Taeko Yasuda\n:Mr. Tsugumo's secretary and Ryoko's confidant, she takes an immediate dislike and distrust to Kanzaki. She is attractive and intelligent, but also lonely - and in the Eclipse version, it's suggested that she is growing insecure about her age. In the manga and OAV, by happenstance, she sees the magazine article on Asran's civil war and the photo taken by the late Rocky, a photo in which Shin appears in the background. Taeko's friend pins down the location and deduces that Shin was at Area 88. Taeko also saves Ryoko from allowing Kanzaki to use her in a compromising position in order to have him willing to buy her stock share (at full price) and use the money to buy out Shin's contract. Taeko appears in all three versions, but is never specifically identified in the 2004 anime.\n\n;Giuseppe Farina\n:A Paris-based Mafia don whom Kanzaki requests to contract a hitman on Shin's life. It is through Farina that Charlie is hired as an assassin to return to Area 88. In return, Kanzaki would purchase airline parts from companies under Farina's control. Unfortunately for Kanzaki, Farina and Maxwell Corporation (the company with which Kanzaki dealt for the defective airbus), both plan to use Kanzaki as a fall guy in a takeover of Yamato airlines. Farina appears briefly in the OAV but does not seem to have no other involvement beyond the assassination attempt. In the manga, Farina has a much larger role and is later involved in supplying weapons to the Anti-Government forces. He does not appear at all in the 2004 TV series.\n\n;The Wolfpack\n:A rival mercenary squadron that is working for the anti government forces. They fly exclusively the [[Mig-23]] and are considered a very serious threat to the Area 88 pilots. In the original manga, they cause a major setback by bombing Area 88 and destroying all of the pilot's planes and McCoy's warehouse. In the OAV, they attack Area 81 instead. In the Eclipse comic, where the Wolfpack's plane is identified as a \"MiG-27D\", both bases are attacked. Both instances, however, lead to a ferocious air battle in which the Wolfpack is ultimately defeated. There is no mention of the Wolfpack in the 2004 TV series, although a squadron of MiG-23s (led by Patrick Reed) did in fact appear to challenge the pilots of Area 88.\n\n;The Sniper\n:A lone gunman who is very effective with the use of his rifle. He singlehandedly shuts down Area 88 operations with accurate fire on aircraft, equipment, and crew, but is finally defeated when his position is located and he is strafed by Shin's aircraft. His ultimate fate is left unknown, as his body is never found. He only appears in the 2004 TV series.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Area 88}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Area 88]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Area_88_characters"}

Jupiter was the chief deity of Roman state religion throughout the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] eras, until [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christianity became the dominant religion of the Empire]]. In Roman mythology, he negotiates with [[Numa Pompilius]], the second [[king of Rome]], to establish principles of Roman religion such as offering, or sacrifice.\n\nJupiter is usually thought to have originated as an aerial god.

Many of his functions were focused on the [[Capitoline Hill]], where the [[Arx (Roman)|citadel]] was located. In the [[Capitoline Triad]], he was the central guardian of the state with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]]. His sacred tree was the oak.\n[[File:Jupiter statue, Vaticana.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of Jupiter, Vatican, Rome.]]\nThe Romans regarded Jupiter as the [[interpretatio graeca|equivalent]] of the Greek [[Zeus]],<ref name=\"Lar\">''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.</ref> and in [[Latin literature]] and [[Roman art]], the myths and iconography of Zeus are adapted under the name ''Iuppiter''.

On the interpretation of the triumphal dress and of the triumph, Larissa Bonfante has offered an interpretation based on Etruscan documents in her article : \"Roman Triumphs and Etruscan Kings: the Changing Face of the Triumph\" in  ''Journal of Roman Studies'' '''60''' 1970 pp. 49\u201366 and tables I\u2013VIII.

Originally, [[Kings of Rome|Rome was ruled by kings]]; after the monarchy was abolished and the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] established, religious prerogatives were transferred to the ''patres'', the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician ruling class]]. Nostalgia for the kingship ''(affectatio regni)'' was considered treasonous. Those suspected of harbouring monarchical ambitions were punished, regardless of their service to the state. In the 5th century BC, the ''triumphator'' [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] was sent into exile after he drove a chariot with a team of four white horses ''([[quadriga]])''\u2014an honour reserved for Jupiter himself. When [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus|Marcus Manlius]], whose defense of the Capitol against the [[Sack of Rome (387 BC)|invading Gauls]] had earned him the name ''Capitolinus'', was accused of regal pretensions, he was executed as a traitor by being cast from the [[Tarpeian Rock]]. His house on the Capitoline Hill was razed, and it was decreed that no patrician should ever be allowed to live there.<ref>Dum\u00e9zil 1977 citing Livy V 23, 6 and VI 17, 5.</ref> Capitoline Jupiter found himself in a delicate position: he represented a continuity of royal power from the [[Roman Kingdom|Regal period]], and conferred power on the [[Roman Magistrates|magistrates]] who paid their respects to him; at the same time he embodied that which was now forbidden, abhorred, and scorned.<ref>G.

The adjective ''feriatus'', related to ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]]'', \"holy days,\" pertains to keeping a holiday, and hence means \"idle, unemployed,\" not performing one's usual tasks.</ref>\n\nSome privileges of the ''flamen'' of Jupiter may reflect the regal nature of Jupiter: he had the use of the [[curule chair]],<ref>Livy I 20, 1\u20132.</ref> and was the only priest ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdos]])'' who was preceded by a [[lictor]]<ref>Plutarch ''Quaestiones Romanae'' 113.</ref> and had a seat in the [[Roman senate|senate]].<ref>Livy XXVII 8, 8.</ref> Other regulations concern his ritual purity and his separation from the military function; he was forbidden to ride a horse or see the army outside the sacred boundary of Rome ''([[pomerium]]).'' Although he served the god who embodied the sanctity of the oath, it was not religiously permissible ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fas|fas]])'' for the Dialis to swear an oath.<ref>Aulus Gellius, 10.15.5: ''item iurare Dialem fas numquam est''; [[Robert E.A.

Their creation was traditionally ascribed to [[Romulus]]. They were considered the only official interpreters of Jupiter's will, thence they were essential to the very existence of the Roman State as Romans saw in Jupiter the only source of state authority.\n\n===Fetials===\nThe [[fetials]] were a college of 20 men devoted to the religious administration of international affairs of state.<ref>G.

See also ''[[ius gentium]].''</ref> Their task was to preserve and apply the fetial law ''(ius fetiale)'', a complex set of procedures aimed at ensuring the protection of the gods in Rome's relations with foreign states. [[Iuppiter Lapis]] is the god under whose protection they act, and whom the chief fetial ''(pater patratus)'' invokes in the rite concluding a treaty.<ref>Livy I 24, 8.</ref> If a [[declaration of war]] ensues, the fetial calls upon Jupiter and [[Quirinus]], the heavenly, earthly and [[chthonic]] gods as witnesses of any potential violation of the ''ius''. He can then declare war within 33 days.<ref>Livy I 32, 10.</ref>\n\nThe action of the fetials falls under Jupiter's jurisdiction as the divine defender of good faith. Several emblems of the fetial office pertain to Jupiter. The ''silex'' was the stone used for the fetial sacrifice, housed in the Temple of [[Feretrius|Iuppiter Feretrius]], as was their sceptre. Sacred herbs ''(sagmina)'', sometimes identified as [[vervain]], had to be taken from the nearby [[Arx (Roman)|citadel ''(arx)'']] for their ritual use.<ref>G.

Sardonyx cameo ([[Louvre]])]]\nThe role of Jupiter in the [[conflict of the orders]] is a reflection of the religiosity of the Romans. On one side, the patricians were able to naturally claim the support of the supreme god as they held the [[auspices]] of the State. On the other side, the [[pleb]]s (plebeians) argued that, as Jupiter was the source of justice, they had his favor because their cause was just.\n\nThe first secession was caused by the excessive debt burden on the plebs. The legal institute of the ''[[nexum]]'' permitted a debtor to become a slave of his creditor. The plebs argued the debts had become unsustainable because of the expenses of the wars wanted by the patricians. As the senate did not accede to the proposal of a total debt remission advanced by dictator and augur [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] the plebs retired on the Mount Sacer, a hill located three Roman miles to the North-northeast of Rome, past the Nomentan bridge on river [[Anio]].<ref>Varro in his ''Lingua Latina'' V writes of \"Crustumerian secession\" (\"''a secessione Crustumerina''\"\uff09.</ref> The place is windy and was usually the site of rites of divination performed by haruspices. The senate in the end sent a delegation composed of ten members with full powers of making a deal with the plebs, of which were part [[Menenius Agrippa]] and Manius Valerius. It was Valerius, according to the inscription found at Arezzo in 1688 and written on the order of Augustus as well as other literary sources, that brought the plebs down from the Mount, after the secessionists had consecrated it to ''Jupiter Territor'' and built an altar (''ara'') on its summit. The fear of the wrath of Jupiter was an important element in the solution of the crisis. The consecration of the Mount probably referred to its summit only. The ritual requested the participation of both an augur (presumably Manius Valerius himself) and a pontifex.<ref>F. Vallocchia \"Manio Valerio Massimo dittatore ed augure\" in ''Diritto @ Storia'' '''7''' 2008 (online).</ref>\n\nThe second secession was caused by the autocratic and arrogant behaviour of the ''[[decemviri]]'', who had been charged by the Roman people with writing down the laws in use till then kept secret by the patrician magistrates and the ''sacerdotes''. All magistracies and the tribunes of the plebs had resigned in advance. The task resulted in the XII Tables, which though concerned only private law. The plebs once again retreated to the Sacer Mons: this act besides recalling the first secession was meant to seek the protection of the supreme god. The secession ended with the resignation of the ''decemviri'' and an amnesty for the rebellious soldiers who had deserted from their camp near Mount Algidus while warring against the Volscians, abandoning the commanders. The amnesty was granted by the senate and guaranteed by the ''pontifex maximus'' Quintus Furius (in Livy's version) (or Marcus Papirius) who also supervised the nomination of the new tribunes of the plebs, then gathered on the Aventine Hill. The role played by the ''pontifex maximus'' in a situation of vacation of powers is a significant element underlining the religious basis and character of the ''tribunicia potestas''.<ref>C. M. A.

The two gods (with a charm) evoked Jupiter, who was forced to come down to earth at the Aventine (hence named ''Iuppiter Elicius'', according to Ovid). After Numa skilfully avoided the requests of the god for human sacrifices, Jupiter agreed to his request to know how lightning bolts are averted, asking only for the substitutions Numa had mentioned: an onion bulb, hairs and a fish. Moreover, Jupiter promised that at the sunrise of the following day he would give to Numa and the Roman people pawns of the ''imperium''. The following day, after throwing three lightning bolts across a clear sky, Jupiter sent down from heaven a shield. Since this shield had no angles, Numa named it ''ancile''; because in it resided the fate of the ''imperium'', he had many copies made of it to disguise the real one. He asked the smith [[Mamurius Veturius]] to make the copies, and gave them to the [[Salii]]. As his only reward, Mamurius expressed the wish that his name be sung in the last of their ''carmina''.<ref>Ovid ''Fasti III'', 284\u2013392. Festus s.v. Mamuri Veturi p. 117 L as cited by Dum\u00e9zil 1977 p. 197.</ref> Plutarch gives a slightly different version of the story, writing that the cause of the miraculous drop of the shield was a plague and not linking it with the Roman ''imperium''.<ref>Plutarch Numa 18.</ref>\n\n===Tullus Hostilius===\nThroughout his reign, [[Tullus Hostilius|King Tullus]] had a scornful attitude towards religion. His temperament was warlike, and he disregarded religious rites and piety. After conquering the [[Albani people|Albans]] with the duel between the [[Horatii and Curiatii]], Tullus destroyed [[Alba Longa]] and deported its inhabitants to Rome. As [[Livy]] tells the story, omens ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#prodigium|prodigia]])'' in the form of a rain of stones occurred on the [[Alban Mount]] because the deported Albans had disregarded their ancestral rites linked to the sanctuary of Jupiter. In addition to the omens, a voice was heard requesting that the Albans perform the rites. A plague followed and at last the king himself fell ill. As a consequence, the warlike character of Tullus broke down; he resorted to religion and petty, superstitious practices. At last, he found a book by Numa recording a secret rite on how to evoke ''Iuppiter Elicius''. The king attempted to perform it, but since he executed the rite improperly the god threw a lightning bolt which burned down the king's house and killed Tullus.<ref>Dum\u00e9zil 1977 p. 175 citing Livy I 31.</ref>\n\n===Tarquin the Elder===\nWhen approaching Rome (where Tarquin was heading to try his luck in politics after unsuccessful attempts in his native [[Tarquinii]]), an eagle swooped down, removed his hat, flew screaming in circles, replaced the hat on his head and flew away.  Tarquin's wife [[Tanaquil]] interpreted this as a sign that he would become king based on the bird, the quadrant of the sky from which it came, the god who had sent it and the fact it touched his hat (an item of clothing placed on a man's most noble part, the head).<ref>R.

The \"contract\" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed.

The building was supposedly begun by king [[Tarquinius Priscus]], completed by the last king ([[Tarquinius Superbus]]) and inaugurated in the early days of the Roman Republic (September 13, 509 BC). It was topped with the statues of four horses drawing a [[quadriga]], with Jupiter as charioteer.

The god manifested his discontent through the prodigy of a rain of stones: the commission sent by the Roman senate to inquire was also greeted by a rain of stones and heard a loud voice from the grove on the summit of the mount requesting the Albans perform the religious service to the god according to the rites of their country. In consequence of this event the Romans instituted a festival of nine days (''nundinae'').   Nonetheless a plague ensued:  in the end Tullus Hostilius himself was affected and lastly killed by the god with a lightning bolt.<ref>Livy I 31 1\u20138.</ref> The festival was reestablished on its primitive site by the last Roman king Tarquin the Proud under the leadership of Rome.\n\nThe ''[[feriae Latinae]]'', or ''[[Latiar]]'' as they were known originally,<ref>Macrobius I 16. This identification has though been challenged by A.

AR IV 49, 3; Festus p. 212 L l. 30 f.; '' Scholiasta Bobiensis ad Ciceronis pro Plancio'' 23.</ref> the offers of milk and cheese and the ritual use of rocking among the games. Rocking is one of the most ancient rites mimicking ascent to Heaven and is very widespread. At the ''Latiar'' the rocking took place on a tree and the winner was of course the one who had swung the highest. This rite was said to have been instituted by the Albans to commemorate the disappearance of king [[Latinus]], in the battle against [[Mezentius]] king of [[Caere]]: the rite symbolised a search for him both on earth and in heaven. The rocking as well as the customary drinking of milk was also considered to commemorate and ritually reinstate infancy.<ref>Festus s.v. oscillantes p. 194 M; C. A.

The ''Latiar'' became an important feature of Roman political life as they were ''[[feriae conceptivae]]'', i. e. their date varied each year: the consuls and the highest magistrates were required to attend shortly after the beginning of the administration, originally on the Ides of March: the Feriae usually took place in early April. They could not start campaigning before its end and if any part of the games had been neglected or performed unritually the ''Latiar'' had to be wholly repeated.

The [[Fasti Praenestini]] marks the day as ''feriae Iovis'', as does Macrobius.<ref>Macrobius I 10, 11.</ref> It is unclear whether the rite of ''parentatio'' was itself the reason for the festival of Jupiter, or if this was another festival which happened to fall on the same day.

The study of these epithets must consider their origins (the historical context of an epithet's source).\n\nJupiter's most ancient attested forms of cult belong to the State cult: these include the mount cult (see section above note n. 22<!-- a less easily broken reference here could use an anchor -->).  In Rome this cult entailed the existence of particular sanctuaries the most important of which were located on ''Mons Capitolinus'' (earlier ''Tarpeius''). The mount had two tops that were both destined to the discharge of acts of cult related to Jupiter. The northern and higher top was the ''[[Arx (Roman)|arx]]'' and on it was located the observation place of the [[augurs]] ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auguraculum|auguraculum]])'' and to it headed the monthly procession of the ''sacra Idulia''.<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Varro LL V 47 and Festus p. 290 M. s.v. Idulia.</ref> On the southern top was to be found the most ancient sanctuary of the god: the shrine of  ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' allegedly built by Romulus, restored by Augustus. The god here had no image and was represented by the sacred flintstone (''silex'').<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Paulus p. 92 M.; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 641.</ref> The most ancient known rites, those of the ''spolia opima'' and of the [[fetials]] which connect Jupiter with Mars and Quirinus are dedicated to ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' or ''Iuppiter Lapis''.<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Festus p. 189 M. s.v. lapis; Polybius ''Historiae'' III 25, 6.</ref> The concept of the sky god was already overlapped with the ethical and political domain since this early time. According to Wissowa and Dum\u00e9zil<ref name=\"G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 169\">G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 169.</ref> ''Iuppiter Lapis'' seems to be inseparable from ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' in whose tiny templet on the Capitol the stone was lodged.\n \nAnother most ancient epithet is ''Lucetius'': although the Ancients, followed by some modern scholars such as Wissowa,{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=100}} interpreted it as referring to sunlight, the ''carmen Saliare'' shows that it refers to lightning.<ref>G. Dumezil ARR above p. 167. The ''carmen Saliare'' has: \"cume tonas Leucesie prai ted tremonti/ quot tibi etinei deis cum tonarem\".</ref> A further confirmation of this interpretation is provided by the sacred meaning of lightning which is reflected in the sensitivity of the ''flaminica Dialis'' to the phenomenon.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> To the same atmospheric complex belongs the epithet ''Elicius'': while the ancient erudites thought it was connected to lightning, it is in fact related to the opening of the rervoirs of rain, as is testified by the ceremony of the ''Nudipedalia'', meant to propitiate rainfall and devoted to Jupiter.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 168 citing [[Petronius]] ''[[Satyricon]]'' 44.</ref> and the ritual of the ''[[lapis manalis]]'', the stone which was brought into the city through the ''Porta Capena'' and carried around in times of drought, which was named ''Aquaelicium''.<ref>Paulus s. v. p. 94 L 2nd; p. 2 M; Tertullian ''Apologeticum'' 40.</ref> Other early epithets connected with the atmospheric quality of Jupiter are ''Pluvius'', ''Imbricius'', ''Tempestas'', ''Tonitrualis'', ''tempestatium divinarum potens'', ''Serenator'', ''Serenus''<ref>Apuleius ''De Mundo'' 37; cf.

''Rumach'' Etruscan for Roman). However many scholars have argued that the name of Rome, ''Ruma'', meant in fact woman's breast.<ref>Bruno Migliorini s.v. Roma in ''Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti'' vol. XXIX p. 589; A. W. Schlegel ''S\u00e4mtliche Werke'' Leipzig 1847 XII p. 488; F. Kort ''R\u00f6mische Geschichte'' Heidelberg 1843 p.32-3.</ref> [[Diva Rumina]], as Augustine testifies in the cited passage, was the goddess of suckling babies: she was venerated near the ''ficus ruminalis'' and was offered only libations of milk.<ref>N. G. L. Hammond & H. H. Scullard (Eds.) ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' Oxford 1970 s. v. p. 940.</ref> Here moreover Augustine cites the verses devoted to Jupiter by [[Quintus Valerius Soranus]], while hypothesising ''Iuno'' (more adept in his view as a breastfeeder), i.e. Rumina instead of Ruminus, might be nothing else than  ''Iuppiter'': \"''Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque Progenitor genetrixque deum...''\".\n\nIn Dum\u00e9zil's opinion ''Farreus'' should be understood as related to the rite of the ''confarreatio'' the most sacred form of marriage, the name of which is due to the spelt cake eaten by the spouses, rather than surmising an agricultural quality of the god: the epithet means the god was the guarantor of the effects of the ceremony, to which the presence of his flamen is necessary and that he can interrupt with a clap of thunder.<ref>Servius IV 339.</ref>\n\nThe epithet ''Dapalis'' is on the other hand connected to a rite described by Cato and mentioned by Festus.<ref>Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' 132; Festus s. v. daps, dapalis, dapaticum pp. 177\u2013178 L 2nd.</ref> Before the sowing of autumn or spring the peasant offered a banquet of roast beef and a cup of wine to Jupiter : it is natural that on such occasions he would entreat the god who has power over the weather, however Cato' s prayer of s one of sheer offer and no request. The language suggests another attitude: Jupiter is invited to a banquet which is supposedly abundant and magnificent. The god is honoured as ''summus''. The peasant may hope he shall receive a benefit, but he does not say it. This interpretation finds support in the analogous urban ceremony of the ''epulum Iovis'', from which the god derives the epithet of  ''Epulo''  and which was a magnificent feast accompanied by flutes.<ref>''Epulo'' CIL VI 3696.</ref>\n\nEpithets related to warring are in Wissowa's view  ''Iuppiter Feretrius'', ''Iuppiter Stator'', ''Iuppiter Victor'' and ''Iuppiter Invictus''.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|pages=105-108}} ''Feretrius'' would be connected with war by the rite of the first type of  ''[[spolia opima]]'' which is in fact a dedication to the god of the arms of the defeated king of the enemy that happens whenever he has been killed by the king of Rome or his equivalent authority. Here too Dum\u00e9zil notes the dedication has to do with regality and not with war, since the rite is in fact the offer of the arms of a king by a king:  a proof of such an assumption is provided by the fact that the arms of an enemy king captured by an officer or a common soldier were dedicated to Mars and Quirinus respectively.\n\n''Iuppiter Stator'' was first attributed by tradition to [[Romulus]], who had prayed the god for his almighty help at a difficult time the battle with the Sabines of king Titus Tatius.<ref>Livy I 12, 4\u20136.</ref> Dum\u00e9zil opines the action of Jupiter is not that of a god of war who wins through fighting: Jupiter acts by causing an inexplicable change in the morale of the fighters of the two sides. The same feature can be detected also in the certainly historical record of the battle of the third Samnite War in 294 BC, in which consul [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] vowed a temple to ''Iuppiter Stator'' if \"Jupiter will stop the rout of the Roman army and if afterwards the Samnite legions shall be victouriously massacred...It looked as if the gods themselves had taken side with Romans, so much easily did the Roman arms succeed in prevailing...\".<ref>Livy X 36, 11.</ref><ref>Dum\u00e9zil above pp. 174\u201375.</ref> In a similar manner one can explain the epithet ''Victor'', whose cult was founded in 295 BC on the battlefield of [[Sentinum]] by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]] and who received another vow again in 293 by consul [[Lucius Papirius Cursor]] before a battle against the Samnite ''legio linteata''. The religious meaning of the vow is in both cases an appeal to the supreme god by a Roman chief at a time of need for divine help from the supreme god, albeit for different reasons: Fabius had remained the only political and military responsible of the Roman State after the ''devotio'' of P. Decius Mus, Papirius had to face an enemy who had acted with impious rites and vows, i.e. was religiously reprehensible.<ref>Livy X 29, 12\u201317; ''nefando sacro, mixta hominum pecudumque caedes'', \"by an impious rite, a mixed slaughter of people and flock\" 39, 16; 42, 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nMore recently Dario Sabbatucci has given a different interpretation of the meaning of ''Stator'' within the frame of his structuralistic and dialectic vision of Roman calendar, identifying oppositions, tensions and equilibria: January is the month of [[Janus]], at the beginning of the year, in the uncertain time of winter (the most ancient calendar had only ten months, from March to December). In this month Janus deifies kingship and defies Jupiter. Moreover, January sees also the presence of [[Veiovis]] who appears as an anti-Jupiter, of [[Carmenta]] who is the goddess of birth and like Janus has two opposed faces, ''Prorsa'' and ''Postvorta'' (also named [[Antevorta]] and [[Antevorta|Porrima]]), of [[Iuturna]], who as a gushing spring evokes the process of coming into being from non-being as the god of passage and change does. In this period the preeminence of Janus needs compensating on the Ides through the action of Jupiter ''Stator'', who plays the role of anti-Janus, i.e. of moderator of the action of Janus.<ref>Dario Sabbatucci above, as summarized in the review by Robert Turcan above p. 70.</ref>\n\n====Epithets denoting functionality====\nSome epithets describe a particular aspect of the god, or one of his functions:\n*'''Jove Aegiochus''', Jove \"Holder of the Goat or Aegis\", as the father of [[Aegipan]].<ref>''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica.html Astronomica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601224218/http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica.html |date=2013-06-01 }}'', [[Hyginus]], translated by Mary Grant, pt.1, ch.2, sec.13</ref>\n*'''Jupiter Caelus''', Jupiter as the sky or heavens; see also [[Caelus]].\n*'''Jupiter Caelestis''', \"Heavenly\" or \"Celestial Jupiter\".\n*'''Jupiter Elicius''', Jupiter \"who calls forth [celestial omens]\" or \"who is called forth [by incantations]\"; \"sender of rain\".\n*'''Jupiter Feretrius''', who carries away the [[War looting|spoils of war]]\".

From the time of [[Vespasian]], he was popular among the [[Roman legions]] as god of war and victory, especially on the [[Danube]] at [[Carnuntum]]. He is depicted as standing on a bull, with a thunderbolt in his left hand, and a double ax in the right.\n*'''[[Jupiter Indiges]]''', \"Jupiter of the country,\" a title given to [[Aeneas]] after his death, according to [[Livy]]<ref>[[Livy]], [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]] Book 1.</ref>\n*'''Jupiter Ladicus''', Jupiter equated with a Celtiberian mountain-god and worshipped as the spirit of Mount Ladicus in [[Gallaecia]], northwest Iberia,<ref>''CIL'' II, 2525; Toutain. 1920. 143ff.</ref> preserved in the toponym ''Codos de Ladoco''.<ref>Smith, ''Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' \"Ladicus\")</ref>\n*'''Jupiter Laterius''' or '''Latiaris''', the god of [[Latium]]\n*'''Jupiter Parthinus''' or '''Partinus''', under this name was worshiped on the borders of northeast [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Upper Moesia]], perhaps associated with the local tribe known as the [[Partheni]].\n*'''Jupiter Poeninus''', under this name worshipped in the Alps, around the [[Great St Bernard Pass]], where he had a sanctuary.\n*'''Jupiter Solutorius''', a local version of Jupiter worshipped in [[Spain]]; he was syncretised with the local [[Iberians|Iberian]] god [[Eacus (god)|Eacus]].\n*'''Jupiter Taranis''', Jupiter equated with the Celtic god [[Taranis]].\n*'''Jupiter Uxellinus''', Jupiter as a god of high mountains.<!--isn't this a Gaulish epithet, as in Uxellodunum-->\n\nIn addition, many of the epithets of Zeus can be found applied to Jupiter, by ''[[interpretatio romana]]''. Thus, since the hero [[Trophonius]] (from [[Lebadea]] in Boeotia) is called Zeus Trophonius, this can be represented in English (as it would be in Latin) as Jupiter Trophonius. Similarly, the Greek cult of Zeus [[Meilichios]] appears in Pompeii as Jupiter Meilichius. Except in representing actual cults in Italy, this is largely 19th-century usage; modern works distinguish Jupiter from Zeus.\n\n==Theology==\n\n===Sources===\n[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] and [[Verrius Flaccus]]<ref>The work of Verrius Flaccus is preserved through the summary of [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] and his epitomist [[Paul the Deacon]].</ref> were the main sources on the theology of Jupiter and archaic Roman religion in general. Varro was acquainted with the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|libri pontificum]]'' (\"books of the [[College of Pontiffs|Pontiffs]]\") and their archaic classifications.<ref>Georges Dum\u00e9zil ''La religion romaine archa\u00efque'', Payot, Paris, 1974 2nd \"Remarques preliminaires\" X; It. tr.

Augustine's criticism of traditional Roman religion is based on Varro's lost work, ''[[Res divina|Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum]]''. Although a work of [[Christian apologetics]], ''The City of God'' provides glimpses into Varro's theological system and authentic Roman theological lore in general. According to Augustine,<ref>Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' IV 27; VI 5.</ref> Varro drew on the pontiff [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex|Mucius Scaevola]]'s tripartite theology:\n\n* The [[mythical theology|mythic theology]] of the poets (useful for the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatre]])\n* The [[Natural theology|physical theology]] of the philosophers (useful for understanding the natural world)\n* The civil theology of the priests (useful for the state)<ref>J. P\u00e9pin \"La th\u00e9ologie tripartite de Varron\" ''Revue des \u00e9tudes augustiniennes'' '''2''' 1956 pp. 265-294. Dum\u00e9zil has pointed out that even though Augustine may be correct in pointing out cases in which Varro presented under the civil theology category contents that may look to belong to mythic theology, nevertheless he preserved under this heading the lore and legends ancient Romans considered their own.</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Theology of Jupiter in early Rome}}Jovian theology===\n[[Georg Wissowa]] stressed Jupiter's uniqueness as the only case among Indo-European religions in which the original god preserved his name, his identity and his prerogatives.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=100}} In this view, Jupiter is the god of heaven and retains his identification with the sky among the Latin poets (his name is used as a synonym for \"sky\".<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912}} cites three passages from Horace, ''Carmina'': I 1, 25 ''manet sub Iove frigido venator''; I 22, 20 ''quod latus mundi nebulae malusque Iuppiter urget''; III 10, 7 ''ut glaciet nives puro numine Iuppiter''.</ref>) In this respect, he differs from his Greek equivalent Zeus (who is considered a personal god, warden and dispenser of skylight). His name reflects this idea; it is a derivative of the Indo-European word for \"bright, shining sky\". His residence is found atop the hills of Rome and of mountains in general; as a result, his cult is present in Rome and throughout Italy at upper elevations.<ref>On the Esquiline lies the ''sacellum'' of  ''Iuppiter Fagutalis'' (Varro ''De Lingua Latina'' V 152 (hereafter LL), Paulus p. 87 M., Pliny ''Naturalis historia'' XVI 37 (hereafter NH), CIL VI 452); on the Viminal is known a ''Iuppiter Viminius'' (Varro LL V 51, Festus p. 376); a ''Iuppiter Caelius'' on the Caelius (CIL VI 334); on the Quirinal the so called ''Capitolium Vetus'' (Martial V 22, 4; VII 73, 4). Outside Rome: Iuppiter Latiaris on ''Mons Albanus'', Iuppiter Appenninus (Orelli 1220, CIL VIII 7961 and XI 5803) on the Umbrian Appennines, at Scheggia, on the [[Via Flaminia]], Iuppiter Poeninus (CIL 6865 ff., cfr. Bernabei ''Rendiconti della Regia Accademia dei Lincei'' '''III''', 1887, fascicolo 2, p. 363 ff.) at the Great Saint Bernard Pass, Iuppiter Vesuvius (CIL X 3806), Iuppiter Ciminus (CIL XI 2688); the Sabine Iuppiter Cacunus (CIL IX 4876, VI 371). Outside Italy Iuppiter Culminalis in Noricum and Pannonia (CIL III 3328, 4032, 4115, 5186; Supplememtum 10303, 11673 etc.) as cited by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=102}} and Francesca Cenerini \"Scritture di santuari extraurbani tra le Alpi e gli Appennini\" in ''[[M\u00e9langes de l'\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de Rome]]'' (hereafter ''MEFRA'')  '''104''' 1992 1 pp. 94\u201395.</ref> Jupiter assumed atmospheric qualities; he is the wielder of lightning and the master of weather. However, Wissowa acknowledges that Jupiter is not merely a naturalistic, heavenly, supreme deity; he is in continual communication with man by means of thunder, lightning and the flight of birds (his [[auspices]]). Through his vigilant watch he is also the guardian of public oaths and compacts and the guarantor of good faith in the State cult.<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=100-101}}</ref> The Jovian cult was common to the [[Italic people]] under the names ''Iove'', ''Diove'' (Latin) and  ''Iuve'', ''Diuve'' (Oscan, in Umbrian only ''Iuve'', ''Iupater'' in the [[Iguvine Tables]]).\n\nWissowa considered Jupiter also a god of war and agriculture, in addition to his political role as guarantor of good faith (public and private) as ''Iuppiter Lapis'' and ''Dius Fidius'', respectively. His view is grounded in the sphere of action of the god (who intervenes in battle and influences the harvest through weather).{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=103\u2013108}}\n \nIn [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]]'s view, Jovian theology (and that of the equivalent gods in other Indo-European religions) is an evolution from a naturalistic, supreme, celestial god identified with heaven to a sovereign god, a wielder of lightning bolts, master and protector of the community (in other words, of a change from a naturalistic approach to the world of the divine to a socio-political approach).<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil above It. tr. pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n[[File:Giorgione, The tempest.jpg|thumb|One interpretation of the lightning in [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|Tempest]]'' is that it represents the presence of Jupiter.<ref>Salvatore Settis, ''Giorgione's ''Tempest'': Interpreting the Hidden Subject'', University of Chicago Press, 1990, p. 62, summarising this scholarly interpretation: \"The lightning is Jove.\" cf Peter Humfrey, ''Painting in Renaissance Venice'', Yale University Press, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ARLTK284AHAC&pg=PA118&dq=Giorgione+tempest+jupiter&hl=en&ei=cSp_TpupGYTo0QGe2tz-Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Giorgione%20tempest%20jupiter&f=false p.118f.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424065939/https://books.google.com/books?id=ARLTK284AHAC&pg=PA118&dq=Giorgione+tempest+jupiter&hl=en&ei=cSp_TpupGYTo0QGe2tz-Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Giorgione%20tempest%20jupiter&f=false |date=2016-04-24 }}</ref>|alt=Painting of a mother feeding her child, watched by a shepherd, with lightning flashing across a dark sky in the background]]\n\nIn [[Vedic mythology|Vedic religion]], [[Dyaus Pitar]] remained confined to his distant, removed, passive role and the place of sovereign god was occupied by [[Varuna]] and [[Mitra]]. In Greek and Roman religion, instead, the homonymous gods ''*Diou-'' and ''\u0394\u03b9[[digamma|\u03dd]]-'' evolved into atmospheric deities; by their mastery of thunder and lightning, they expressed themselves and made their will known to the community. In Rome, Jupiter also sent signs to the leaders of the state in the form of [[auspices]] in addition to thunder. The art of [[augury]] was considered prestigious by ancient Romans; by sending his signs, Jupiter (the sovereign of heaven) communicates his advice to his terrestrial colleague: the king (''rex'') or his successor magistrates. The encounter between the heavenly and political, legal aspects of the deity are well represented by the prerogatives, privileges, functions and taboos proper to his ''[[flamen]]'' (the ''[[flamen Dialis]]'' and his wife, the ''flaminica Dialis'').\n\nDum\u00e9zil maintains that Jupiter is not himself a god of war and agriculture, although his actions and interest may extend to these spheres of human endeavour. His view is based on the methodological assumption that the chief criterion for studying a god's nature is not to consider his field of action, but the quality, method and features of his action. Consequently, the analysis of the type of action performed by Jupiter in the domains in which he operates indicates that Jupiter is a sovereign god who may act in the field of politics (as well as agriculture and war) in his capacity as such, i.e. in a way and with the features proper to a king. Sovereignty is expressed through the two aspects of absolute, magic power (epitomised and represented by the Vedic god [[Varuna]]) and lawful right (by the Vedic god [[Mitra]]).<ref>Dum\u00e9zil above p. 239; It. Tr. p. 171.</ref> However, sovereignty permits action in every field; otherwise, it would lose its essential quality. As a further proof, Dum\u00e9zil cites the story of Tullus Hostilius (the most belligerent of the Roman kings), who was killed by Jupiter with a lightning bolt (indicating that he did not enjoy the god's favour). \nVarro's definition of Jupiter as the god who has under his jurisdiction the full expression of every being (''penes Iovem sunt summa'') reflects the sovereign nature of the god, as opposed to the jurisdiction of Janus (god of passages and change) on their beginning (''penes Ianum sunt prima'').<ref>Varro apud Augustine ''De Civitate Dei VII 9.''</ref>\n\n==Relation to other gods==\n\n===Capitoline Triad===\n{{See also|Capitoline Triad}}\n[[File:Arte romana, triade capitolina, 160-180 dc (guidonia montecelio, museo civico archeologico) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Capitoline Triad|alt=Statue of three figures, seated side by side]]\nThe Capitoline Triad was introduced to Rome by the Tarquins. Dum\u00e9zil<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 274 ff.</ref> thinks it might have been an Etruscan (or local) creation based on Vitruvius' treatise on architecture, in which the three deities are associated as the most important. It is possible that the Etruscans paid particular attention to [[Menrva]] (Minerva) as a goddess of destiny, in addition to the royal couple Uni (Juno) and Tinia (Jupiter).<ref>Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 271 citing Ovid ''Fasti'' III 815\u2013832.</ref> In Rome, Minerva later assumed a military aspect under the influence of [[Athena Pallas]] (Polias). Dum\u00e9zil argues that with the advent of the Republic, Jupiter became the only king of Rome, no longer merely the first of the great gods.\n\n====Archaic Triad====\n{{Main|Archaic Triad}}\nThe Archaic Triad is a hypothetical theological structure (or system) consisting of the gods Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus. It was first described by Wissowa,<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=23, 133\u2013134}};  Dum\u00e9zil ''Jupiter Mars Quirinus'' I-IV Paris 1941\u20131948; ARR above pp.  137\u2013165.</ref> and the concept was developed further by Dum\u00e9zil. The three-function hypothesis of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European society]] advanced by Dum\u00e9zil holds that in prehistory, society was divided into three classes (priests, warriors and craftsmen) which had as their religious counterparts the divine figures of the sovereign god, the warrior god and the civil god. The sovereign function (embodied by Jupiter) entailed omnipotence; thence, a domain extended over every aspect of nature and life. The colour relating to the sovereign function is white.\n\nThe three functions are interrelated with one another, overlapping to some extent; the sovereign function, although essentially religious in nature, is involved in many ways in areas pertaining to the other two. Therefore, Jupiter is the \"magic player\" in the founding of the Roman state and the fields of war, agricultural plenty, human fertility and wealth.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 172 and 175.</ref>\n\nThis hypothesis has not found widespread support among scholars.\n\n===Jupiter and Minerva===\nApart from being protectress of the arts and craft as Minerva Capta, who was brought from Falerii, Minerva's association to Jupiter and relevance to Roman state religion is mainly linked to the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]], a wooden statue of Athena that could move the eyes and wave the spear. It was stored in the ''penus interior'', inner penus of the ''aedes Vestae'', temple of Vesta and considered the most important among the ''[[pignora imperii]]'', pawns of dominion, empire.<ref>E. Montanari ''Mito e Storia nell' annalistica romana delle origini'' Roma 1990 pp. 73 ff.; citing Cicero ''Pro Scauro 48: \"''pignus nostrae salutis atque imperii''\"; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem II 188, 16: \"''Illic imperium fore ubi et Palladium''\"; Festus s.v. p. 152 L.</ref> In Roman traditional lore it was brought from Troy by Aeneas.  Scholars though think it was last taken to Rome in the third or second century BC.<ref>E. Montanari above citing M. Sordi \"Lavinio, Roma e il Palladio\" in ''CISA'' '''8''' 1982 p. 74 ff.; W. Vollgraf \"Le Palladium de Rome\" in ''BAB'' 1938 pp. 34 ff.</ref>\n\n===Juno and Fortuna===\n\nThe divine couple received from Greece its matrimonial implications, thence bestowing on [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] the role of tutelary goddess of marriage (''Iuno Pronuba'').\n\nThe couple itself though cannot be reduced to a Greek apport. The association of Juno and Jupiter is of the most ancient Latin theology.<ref>G. Dumezil \"D\u00e9esses latines et mythes vediques. III Fortuna Primigenia\" in ''Coll. Latomus'' '''25''' 1956 pp. 71\u201378.</ref> [[Praeneste]] offers a glimpse into original Latin mythology: the local goddess [[Fortuna]] is represented as milking two infants, one male and one female, namely Jove (Jupiter) and Juno.<ref>Cicero ''De nat. Deor.'' II 85-86: \"Is est locus saeptus religiose propter Iovis pueri, qui lactens cum Iunone in gremio sedens, mamma appetens, castissime colitur a matribus\": \"This is an enclosed place for religious reasons because of Iupiter child, who is seated on the womb with Juno suckling, directed towards the breast, very chastely worshipped by mothers\".</ref> It seems fairly safe to assume that from the earliest times they were identified by their own proper names and since they got them they were never changed through the course of history: they were called Jupiter and Juno. These gods were the most ancient deities of every Latin town. Praeneste preserved divine filiation and infancy as the sovereign god and his paredra Juno have a mother who is the primordial goddess Fortuna Primigenia.<ref>G. Dumezil ''D\u00e9esses latines et mythes vediques'' p. 96 ff.</ref> Many terracotta statuettes have been discovered which represent a woman with a child: one of them represents exactly the scene described by Cicero of a woman with two children of different sex who touch her breast. Two of the votive inscriptions to Fortuna associate her and Jupiter: \" Fortunae Iovi puero...\" and \"Fortunae Iovis puero...\"<ref>CIL XIV 2868 and 2862 (mutile).</ref>\n\nIn 1882 though R. Mowat published an inscription in which Fortuna is called ''daughter of Jupiter'', raising new questions and opening new perspectives in the theology of Latin gods.<ref>R. Mowat \"Inscription latine sur plaque de bronze acquise \u00e0 Rome par par M. A. Dutuit\"  in ''Mem. de la Soc. nat. des Antiquit\u00e9s de France'' 5me Ser. 3  '''43''' 1882 p. 200: CIL XIV 2863: ORCEVIA NUMERI/ NATIONU CRATIA/  FORTUNA DIOVO FILEA/ PRIMOCENIA/ DONOM DEDI. Cited by G. Dumezil above p. 71 ff.</ref> Dumezil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this ''aporia'' would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion.<ref>G Dumezil ''D\u00e9esses latines et mythes vediques'' Bruxelles 1956 chapt. 3.</ref> The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity [[Aditi]], the ''Not-Bound'' or ''Enemy of Bondage'', that shows that there is no question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the [[Aditya]] she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, [[Dak\u1e63a]], the minor sovereign. who represents the ''Creative Energy'', being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs.<ref>\u1e5ag-Veda X 72, 4-5; G. Dumezil above and ''Mariages indo-europ\u00e9ens'' pp. 311\u2013312: \"Of Aditi Daksa was born, and of Daksa Aditi, o Daksa, she who is your daughter\".</ref> Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with [[Savitr]]) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with her head on her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions.<ref>G. Dumezil ''D\u00e9esses latines...'' p. 91 n.3.</ref> The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.<ref>A. Brelich ''Tre variazioni romane sul tema delle origini. I. Roma e Preneste. Una polemica religiosa nell'Italia antica'' Pubbl. dell'Univ. di Roma 1955\u20131956.</ref>\n\n===Janus===\n{{Main|Janus}}\nThe relation of Jupiter to Janus is problematic. Varro defines Jupiter as the god who has ''potestas'' (power) over the forces by which anything happens in the world. Janus, however, has the privilege of being invoked first in rites, since in his power are the beginnings of things (''prima''), the appearance of Jupiter included.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 101 and 290. Discussed at length by Augustine, ''City of God'' VII 9 and 10. Also Ovid ''Fasti'' I 126.</ref>\n\n===Saturn===\n{{Main|Saturn (mythology)}}\nThe [[Latini|Latins]] considered Saturn the predecessor of Jupiter. Saturn reigned in [[Latium]] during a mythical [[Golden Age]] reenacted every year at the festival of [[Saturnalia]]. Saturn also retained primacy in matters of agriculture and money. Unlike the Greek tradition of [[Cronus]] and Zeus, the usurpation of Saturn as king of the gods by Jupiter was not viewed by the Latins as violent or hostile; Saturn continued to be revered in his temple at the foot of the Capitol Hill, which maintained the alternative name ''Saturnius'' into the time of Varro.<ref>D. Briquel \"Jupiter, Saturne et le Capitol\" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''198''' 2. 1981 pp. 131\u2013162; Varro V 42;  Vergil ''Aeneis''  VIII 357-8;  Dionysius Hal.

Pasqualini has argued that Saturn was related to ''Iuppiter Latiaris'', the old Jupiter of the Latins, as the original figure of this Jupiter was superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held at the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill in Rome which involved a human sacrifice and the aspersion of the statue of the god with the blood of the victim.<ref>A.

As guarantor of public faith, Fides had her temple on the Capitol (near that of Capitoline Jupiter).<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=100\u2013101}}; G. Dum\u00e9zil above p. 348; Cicero ''De Natura Deorum'' II 61.</ref>\n\n===Dius Fidius===\n{{Main|Dius Fidius}}\n''Dius Fidius'' is considered a [[theonym]] for Jupiter,<ref>G. Dumezil ''La religion Romaine archa\u00efque'' Paris, 1974; It. tr. Milan 1977 p.189.</ref> and sometimes a separate entity also known in Rome as [[Sancus|Semo Sancus]] Dius Fidius. Wissowa argued that while Jupiter is the god of the ''Fides Publica Populi Romani'' as ''Iuppiter Lapis'' (by whom important oaths are sworn), Dius Fidius is a deity established for everyday use and was charged with the protection of good faith in private affairs. Dius Fidius would thus correspond to ''Zeus Pistios''.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=103}} The association with Jupiter may be a matter of divine relation; some scholars see him as a form of Hercules.<ref>Roger D. Woodard ''Vedic and Indo-European Sacred Space'' Chicago Illinois Un. Press 2005 p. 189.

The offer of wine to Liber was made possible by naming the ''mustum'' (grape juice) stored in [[amphora]]s ''sacrima''.<ref>Fr. Altheim ''Terra Mater'' Giessen 1931 p. 22 and n. 4 while acknowledging the obscurity of the etymology of this word proposed the derivation from ''sacerrima'' as ''bruma'' from ''brevissima''; ''Onomata Latina et Graeca'' s.v.:  ''novum vinum''; ''Corpus Glossatorum Latinorum'' II p. 264: \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7 \u03b3\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2.</ref>\nSacred wine was obtained by the natural fermentation of juice of grapes free from flaws of any type, religious (e. g. those struck by lightning, brought into contact with corpses or wounded people or coming from an unfertilised grapeyard) or secular (by \"cutting\" it with old wine). Secular (or \"profane\") wine was obtained through several types of manipulation (e.g.  by adding honey, or ''mulsum''; using raisins, or ''passum''; by boiling, or ''defrutum''). However, the ''sacrima'' used for the offering to the two gods for the preservation of grapeyards, vessels and wine<ref>Columella ''De Re Rustica'' XII 18, 4 mentions a sacrifice to Liber and Libera immediately before.</ref> was obtained only by pouring the juice into amphors after pressing.<ref>Paulus s. v. sacrima p. 423 L; Festus p. 422 L (mutile).</ref> The ''mustum'' was considered ''spurcum'' (dirty), and thus unusable in sacrifices.<ref>Isidore ''Origines'' XX 3, 4; Enrico Monatanari \"Funzione della sovranit\u00e1 e feste del vino nella Roma repubblicana\" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' '''49''' 1983 pp. 242\u2013262.</ref> The amphor (itself not an item of sacrifice) permitted presentation of its content on a table or could be added to a sacrifice; this happened at the ''auspicatio vindamiae'' for the first grape<ref>G.

Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 331\u2013332.</ref> The ''Liberalia'' of March were, since earliest times, the occasion for the ceremony of the donning of the ''toga virilis'' or ''libera''  (which marked the passage into adult citizenship by young people). Augustine relates that these festivals had a particularly obscene character:  a ''phallus'' was taken to the fields on a cart, and then back in triumph to town. In [[Lavinium]] they lasted a month, during which the population enjoyed bawdy jokes. The most honest ''matronae'' were supposed to publicly crown the ''phallus'' with flowers, to ensure a good harvest and repeal the ''fascinatio'' (evil eye).<ref name=\"CDVII21\" /> In Rome representations of the sex organs were placed in the temple of the couple ''Liber Libera'', who presided over the male and female components of generation and the \"liberation\" of the semen.<ref>Augustine CD VII 3, 1.</ref> This complex of rites and beliefs shows that the divine couple's jurisdiction extended over fertility in general, not only that of grapes. The etymology of  ''Liber'' (archaic form ''Loifer, Loifir'') was explained by \u00c9mile Benveniste as formed on the IE theme *leudh- plus the suffix -es-; its original meaning is \"the one of germination, he who ensures the sprouting of crops\".<ref>\"Liber et liberi\" in ''Revue d'\u00e9tudes latins'' '''14''' 1936 pp. 52\u201358.</ref>\n\nThe relationship of Jupiter with freedom was a common belief among the Roman people, as demonstrated by the dedication of the ''Mons Sacer'' to the god after the first secession of the ''plebs''. Later inscriptions also show the unabated popular belief in Jupiter as bestower of freedom in the imperial era.<ref>\"''...curatores Iovi Libertati''\" CIL XI 657 and \"''Iovi Obsequenti publice''\" CIL XI 658 from [[Bagnacavallo]]; \"''Iuppiter Impetrabilis''\" from Cremella sopra [[Monza]] published by G. Zecchini in ''Rivista di studi italiani e latini'' '''110''' 1976 pp. 178\u2013182. The double presence of Jupiter and [[Feronia (goddess)|Feronia]] at Bagnacavallo has led to speculation that the servile ''[[manumissio]]'' (legal ritual action by which slaves were freed)  was practised in this sanctuary : Giancarlo Susini \"San Pietro in Sylvis, santuario pagense e villaggio plebano nel Ravennate\" in ''M\u00e9langes offertes \u00e0 G.

Warde Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London 1899 pp. 121\u2013122.</ref> Most, however, agree that Veiove is a sort of special Jupiter or anti-Iove, or even an underworld Jupiter. In other words, Veiove is indeed the Capitoline god himself, who takes up a different, diminished appearance (''iuvenis'' and ''parvus'', young and gracile), in order to be able to discharge sovereign functions over places, times and spheres that by their own nature are excluded from the direct control of Jupiter as Optimus Maximus.<ref>G. Piccaluga \"L' anti-Iupiter\" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' XXXIV 1963 p. 229-236; E. Gierstad \"Veiovis, a pre-indoeuropean God in Rome?\" in ''Opuscola Romana'' 9, 4 1973 pp. 35\u201342.</ref> This conclusion is based on information provided by Gellius,<ref>Aulus Gellius V 12.</ref> who states his name is formed by adding prefix ''ve'' (here denoting \"deprivation\" or \"negation\") to ''Iove '' (whose name Gellius posits as rooted in the verb ''iuvo'' \"I benefit\"). D. Sabbatucci has stressed the feature of bearer of instability and antithesis to cosmic order of the god, who threatens the kingly power of Jupiter as ''Stator'' and ''Centumpeda'' and whose presence occurs side by side to Janus' on January 1, but also his function of helper to the growth of the young Jupiter.<ref>D. Sabbatucci above as summarised by R. Turcan above p. 70 and pp. 72\u201373. On the aspect of making Jupiter grow up Turcan cites the denarii struck by [[Manius Fonteius]] and [[Valerian the younger]] of the type ''Iovi crescenti'' mentioned by [[A. Alf\u00f6ldi]] in ''Studien zur Geschichte der Weltkrisedes 3. Jhd. n.Chr.'' Darmstadt 1067 p. 112 f.</ref> In 1858 [[Ludwig Preller]] suggested that Veiovis may be the sinister double of Jupiter.<ref>Ludwig Preller ''R\u00f6mische Mythologie'' I p. 262 f.</ref>\n\nIn fact, the god (under the name ''Vetis'') is placed in the last case (number 16) of the outer rim of the Piacenza Liver\u2014before ''Cilens'' (Nocturnus), who ends (or begins in the Etruscan vision) the disposition of the gods. In [[Martianus Capella]]'s division of heaven, he is found in region XV with the ''dii publici''; as such, he numbers among the infernal (or antipodal) gods. The location of his two temples in Rome\u2014near those of Jupiter (one on the Capitoline Hill, in the low between the ''arx'' and the Capitolium, between the two groves where the [[asylum (antiquity)|asylum]] founded by Romulus stood, the other on the Tiber Island near that of  ''Iuppiter Iurarius'', later also known as temple of Aesculapius)<ref>Ovid ''Fasti'' I 291\u2013294.</ref>\u2014may be significant in this respect, along with the fact that he is considered the father<ref>Ferruccio Bernini ''Ovidio.

The nature of the sacrifice is debated; Gellius states ''capra'', a female goat, although some scholars posit a ram. This sacrifice occurred ''rito humano'', which may mean \"with the rite appropriate for human sacrifice\".<ref>Wissowa on the grounds of Paulus's glossa ''humanum sacrificium'' p. 91 L interprets \"with a rite proper to a ceremony in honour of the deceased\". G. Piccaluga at n. 15 and 21 pp. 231-232 though remarks that Gellius does not state ''sacrificium humanum'' but only states...''immolaturque ritu humano capra''.</ref> Gellius concludes by stating that this god is one of those who receive sacrifices so as to persuade them to refrain from causing harm.\n\nThe arrow is an ambivalent symbol; it was used in the ritual of the [[devotio]] (the general who vowed had to stand on an arrow).<ref>Livy VIII 9, 6.</ref> It is perhaps because of the arrow and of the juvenile looks that Gellius identifies Veiove with Apollo<ref>Gellius V 12, 12.</ref> and as a god who must receive worship in order to obtain his abstention from harming men, along with [[Robigus]] and [[Averruncus]].<ref>Gellius V 12. The Romans knew and offered a cult to other such deities: among them ''Febris'', ''Tussis'', ''Mefitis''.</ref> The ambivalence in the identity of Veiove is apparent in the fact that while he is present in places and times which may have a negative connotation (such as the ''asylum'' of Romulus in between the two groves on the Capitol, the Tiberine island along with Faunus and Aesculapius, the kalends of January, the nones of March, and May 21, a statue of his nonetheless stands in the ''arx''. Moreover, the initial particle ''ve-'' which the ancient supposed were part of his name is itself ambivalent as it may have both an accrescitive and diminutive value.<ref>G. Piccaluga \"L' anti-Juppiter\" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' XXXIV 1963 p. 233-234 and notes 30, 31 citing Gellius V 12 and Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia''  XVI 216: \"''Non et simulacrum Veiovis in arce?''\".</ref>\n\nMaurice Besnier has remarked that a temple to ''Iuppiter'' was dedicated by ''praetor'' Lucius Furius Purpureo before the [[Battle of Cremona (200 BC)|battle of Cremona]] against the [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Celtic Cenomani of Cisalpine Gaul]].<ref>Livy XXXI 21.</ref> An inscription found at [[Brescia]] in 1888 shows that ''Iuppiter Iurarius'' was worshipped there<ref>Ettore Pais CIL ''Supplementa Italica'' I ''addimenta al CIL V'' in ''Atti dei Lincei, Memorie'' V 1888 n. 1272: ''I O M IUR D(e) C(onscriptorum) S(ententia)''.</ref> and one found on the south tip of Tiber Island in 1854 that there was a cult to the god on the spot too.<ref>CIL I 1105: ''C. Volcaci C.  F Har. de stipe Iovi Iurario... onimentum''.</ref> Besnier speculates that Lucius Furius had evoked the chief god of the enemy and built a temple to him in Rome outside the ''pomerium''. On January 1, the ''Fasti Praenestini'' record the festivals of Aesculapius and Vediove on the Island, while in the ''Fasti'' Ovid speaks of ''Jupiter'' and his grandson.<ref>Ovid ''Fasti'' I 291\u2013295.</ref> Livy records that in 192 BC, ''duumvir'' Q. Marcus Ralla dedicated to Jupiter on the Capitol the two temples promised by L. Furius Purpureo, one of which was that promised during the war against the Gauls.<ref>Livy XXXV 41.</ref> Besnier would accept a correction to Livy's passage (proposed by Jordan) to read ''aedes Veiovi'' instead of ''aedes duae Iovi''.  Such a correction concerns the temples dedicated on the Capitol: it does not address the question of the dedication of the temple on the Island, which is puzzling, since the place is attested epigraphically as dedicated to the cult of  ''Iuppiter Iurarius'', in the ''Fasti Praenestini'' of ''Vediove''<ref>Cfr. above: \"''Aeculapio Vediovi in insula''\".</ref> and to Jupiter according to Ovid. The two gods may have been seen as equivalent: ''Iuppiter Iurarius'' is an awesome and vengeful god, parallel to the Greek ''Zeus Orkios'', the avenger of perjury.<ref>Maurice Besnier \"Jupiter Jurarius\" in ''M\u00e9langes d'arch\u00e9ologie et d' histoire'' '''18''' 1898 pp. 287\u2013289.</ref>\n\nA. Pasqualini has argued that Veiovis seems related to ''Iuppiter Latiaris'', as the original figure of this Jupiter would have been superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held on the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill, the southernmost hilltop of the [[Quirinal]] in Rome, which involved a human sacrifice. The [[gens Iulia]] had gentilician cults at [[Bovillae]] where a dedicatory inscription to Vediove has been found in 1826 on an ara.<ref>CIL XIV 2387 = ILS 2988 = ILLRP 270=CIL I 807: ''Vediovei patrei genteiles Iuliei leege Albana dicata''.</ref> According to Pasqualini it was a deity similar to Vediove, wielder of lightningbolts and chthonic, who was connected to the cult of the founders who first inhabited the Alban Mount and built the sanctuary. Such a cult once superseded on the Mount would have been taken up and preserved by the Iulii, private citizens bound to the ''sacra Albana'' by their Alban origin.<ref>A.

Jupiter, as a sovereign god, was considered as having the power to conquer anyone and anything in a supernatural way; his contribution to military victory was different from that of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (god of military valour). Victoria appears first on the reverse of coins representing Venus (driving the quadriga of Jupiter, with her head crowned and with a palm in her hand) during the first Punic War.  Sometimes, she is represented walking and carrying a trophy.<ref>G.

Livy XXVII 2, 10\u201312.</ref>\nAlthough Victoria played a significant role in the religious ideology of the late Republic and the Empire, she is undocumented in earlier times. A function similar to hers may have been played by the little-known [[Vica Pota]].\n\n===Terminus===\n{{See also|Terminus (god)}}\nJuventas and Terminus were the gods who, according to legend,<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Rom. Antiquities''  III 69, 5\u20136.</ref> refused to leave their sites on the Capitol when the construction of the temple of Jupiter was undertaken. Therefore, they had to be reserved a ''sacellum'' within the new temple. Their stubbornness was considered a good omen; it would guarantee youth, stability and safety to Rome on its site.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus above III 69; Florus I 7, 9.</ref> This legend is generally thought by scholars to indicate their strict connection with Jupiter. An inscription found near [[Ravenna]] reads ''Iuppiter Ter.'',<ref>CIL XI 351.</ref> indicating that Terminus is an aspect of Jupiter.\n\nTerminus is the god of boundaries (public and private), as he is portrayed in literature. The religious value of the [[boundary marker]] is documented by Plutarch,<ref>Plutarch ''Numa'' 16.</ref> who ascribes to king Numa the construction of temples to Fides and Terminus and the delimitation of Roman territory. Ovid gives a vivid description of the rural rite at a boundary of fields of neighbouring peasants on February 23 (the day of the [[Terminus (mythology)#Worship|Terminalia]].<ref>Ovid ''Fasti'' II 679.</ref> On that day, Roman pontiffs and magistrates held a ceremony at the sixth mile of the [[Via Laurentina]] (ancient border of the Roman ''ager'', which maintained a religious value). \nThis festival, however, marked the end of the year and was linked to time more directly than to space (as attested by Augustine's [[Apologetics|apologia]] on the role of Janus with respect to endings).<ref>Augustine CD VII 7.</ref>  Dario Sabbatucci has emphasised the temporal affiliation of Terminus, a reminder of which is found in the rite of the ''regifugium''.<ref>D. Sabbatucci above.</ref> \nG. Dum\u00e9zil, on the other hand, views the function of this god as associated with the legalistic aspect of the sovereign function of Jupiter. Terminus would be the counterpart of the minor Vedic god Bagha, who oversees the just and fair division of goods among citizens.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 186\u2013187.</ref>\n\n===Iuventas===\n{{See also|Iuventas}}\n\nAlong with ''Terminus'', '' Iuventas'' (also known as  ''Iuventus'' and ''Iuunta'') represents an aspect of Jupiter (as the legend of her refusal to leave the Capitol Hill demonstrates. Her name has the same root as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (from ''Iuu-'', \"young, youngster\"); the ceremonial litter bearing the sacred goose of Juno Moneta stopped before her ''sacellum'' on the festival of the goddess. Later, she was identified with the Greek [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]. The fact that Jupiter is related to the concept of youth is shown by his epithets ''Puer'', ''Iuuentus'' and ''Ioviste'' (interpreted as \"the youngest\" by some scholars).<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=135}}; G.

Aryaman is the god of young soldiers. The function of ''Iuventas'' is to protect the ''iuvenes'' (the ''novi togati'' of the year, who are required to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter on the Capitol)<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=135}}, citing Servius Danielis  ''Eclogae'' IV 50.</ref> and the Roman soldiers (a function later attributed to Juno). King Servius Tullius, in reforming the Roman social organisation, required that every adolescent offer a coin to the goddess of youth upon entering adulthood.<ref>Piso apud Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Rom. Antiquities'' IV 15, 5.</ref>\n\nIn Dum\u00e9zil's analysis, the function of ''Iuventas'' (the personification of youth), was to control the entrance of young men into society and protect them until they reach the age of ''iuvenes'' or ''iuniores'' (i.e. of serving the state as soldiers).<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 185\u2013186.</ref>\nA temple to ''Iuventas'' was promised in 207 BC by consul [[Marcus Livius Salinator]] and dedicated in 191 BC.<ref>Livy XXXV 36, 5.</ref>\n\n===Penates===\n{{See also|Penates}}\nThe Romans considered the Penates as the gods to whom they owed their own existence.<ref>Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4, 8\u20139 citing Varro: \"Per quos penitus spiramus\". Sabine Mac Cormack ''The Shadows of Poetry: Vergil in the Mind of Augustine'' University of California Press 1998 p. 77.</ref> As noted by Wissowa ''Penates'' is an adjective, meaning \"those of or from the ''penus''\" the innermost part, most hidden recess;<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 311\u2013312.</ref> Dum\u00e9zil though refuses Wissowa's interpretation of ''penus'' as the storeroom of a household. As a nation the Romans honoured the ''Penates publici'': Dionysius calls them ''Trojan gods'' as they were absorbed into the Trojan legend. They had a temple in Rome at the foot of the [[Velian Hill]], near the Palatine, in which they were represented as a couple of male youth. They were honoured every year by the new consuls before entering office at [[Lavinium]],<ref>Varro ''De Lingua Latina'' V 144; Plutarch ''Coriolanus'' XXIX 2; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4, 11; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' II 296: as cited by Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 313.</ref> because the Romans believed the Penates of that town were identical to their own.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 313.</ref>\n\nThe concept of ''di Penates'' is more defined in Etruria: [[Arnobius]] (citing a Caesius) states that the Etruscan Penates were named Fortuna, Ceres, Genius Iovialis and Pales; according to [[Nigidius Figulus]], they included those of Jupiter, of Neptune, of the infernal gods and of mortal men.<ref>Arnobius ''Adversus nationes'' III 40. Cf. also Lucan ''Pharsalia'' V 696; VII 705; VIII 21.</ref> According to Varro the Penates reside in the recesses of Heaven and are called ''Consentes'' and ''Complices'' by the Etruscans because they rise and set together, are twelve in number and their names are unknown, six male and six females and are the cousellors and masters of Jupiter. Martianus states they are always in agreement among themselves.<ref>Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40, 3; Martianus Capella ''De Nuptiis'' I 41: \"Senatores deorum qui Penates ferebantur Tonantis ipsius quorumque nomina, quoniam publicari secretum caeleste non pertulit, ex eo quod omnia pariter repromittunt, nomen eis consensione perficit\".</ref> While these last gods seem to be the Penates of Jupiter, Jupiter himself along with Juno and Minerva is one of the Penates of man according to some authors.<ref>Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40 4;  Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4 9.</ref>\n\nThis complex concept is reflected in Martianus Capella's division of heaven, found in Book I of his ''De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae'', which places the ''Di Consentes Penates'' in region I with the ''Favores Opertanei''; ''Ceres'' and ''Genius'' in region V; ''Pales'' in region VI; ''Favor'' and ''Genius'' (again) in region VII; ''Secundanus Pales'', ''Fortuna'' and ''Favor Pastor'' in region XI. The disposition of these divine entities and their repetition in different locations may be due to the fact that ''Penates'' belonging to different categories (of Jupiter in region I, earthly or of mortal men in region V) are intended. ''Favor(es)'' may be the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] masculine equivalent of ''Fortuna''.<ref>G\u00e9rard Capdeville \"Les dieux de Martianus Capella\" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''213''' 1996 3 p. 285 citing Carl Olof Thulin ''Die G\u00f6tter des Martianus Capella und der Bronzeleber von Piacenza'' (=RGVV 3. 1) Giessen 1906 pp. 38\u201339.

In Roman mythology, he negotiates with [[Numa Pompilius]], the second [[king of Rome]], to establish principles of Roman religion such as offering, or sacrifice.\n\nJupiter is usually thought to have originated as an aerial god.

Many of his functions were focused on the [[Capitoline Hill]], where the [[Arx (Roman)|citadel]] was located. In the [[Capitoline Triad]], he was the central guardian of the state with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]]. His sacred tree was the oak.\n[[File:Jupiter statue, Vaticana.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of Jupiter, Vatican, Rome.]]\nThe Romans regarded Jupiter as the [[interpretatio graeca|equivalent]] of the Greek [[Zeus]],<ref name=\"Lar\">''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.</ref> and in [[Latin literature]] and [[Roman art]], the myths and iconography of Zeus are adapted under the name ''Iuppiter''.

Originally, [[Kings of Rome|Rome was ruled by kings]]; after the monarchy was abolished and the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] established, religious prerogatives were transferred to the ''patres'', the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician ruling class]]. Nostalgia for the kingship ''(affectatio regni)'' was considered treasonous. Those suspected of harbouring monarchical ambitions were punished, regardless of their service to the state. In the 5th century BC, the ''triumphator'' [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] was sent into exile after he drove a chariot with a team of four white horses ''([[quadriga]])''\u2014an honour reserved for Jupiter himself. When [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus|Marcus Manlius]], whose defense of the Capitol against the [[Sack of Rome (387 BC)|invading Gauls]] had earned him the name ''Capitolinus'', was accused of regal pretensions, he was executed as a traitor by being cast from the [[Tarpeian Rock]].

[[Iuppiter Lapis]] is the god under whose protection they act, and whom the chief fetial ''(pater patratus)'' invokes in the rite concluding a treaty.<ref>Livy I 24, 8.</ref> If a [[declaration of war]] ensues, the fetial calls upon Jupiter and [[Quirinus]], the heavenly, earthly and [[chthonic]] gods as witnesses of any potential violation of the ''ius''. He can then declare war within 33 days.<ref>Livy I 32, 10.</ref>\n\nThe action of the fetials falls under Jupiter's jurisdiction as the divine defender of good faith. Several emblems of the fetial office pertain to Jupiter. The ''silex'' was the stone used for the fetial sacrifice, housed in the Temple of [[Feretrius|Iuppiter Feretrius]], as was their sceptre. Sacred herbs ''(sagmina)'', sometimes identified as [[vervain]], had to be taken from the nearby [[Arx (Roman)|citadel ''(arx)'']] for their ritual use.<ref>G.

Sardonyx cameo ([[Louvre]])]]\nThe role of Jupiter in the [[conflict of the orders]] is a reflection of the religiosity of the Romans. On one side, the patricians were able to naturally claim the support of the supreme god as they held the [[auspices]] of the State. On the other side, the [[pleb]]s (plebeians) argued that, as Jupiter was the source of justice, they had his favor because their cause was just.\n\nThe first secession was caused by the excessive debt burden on the plebs. The legal institute of the ''[[nexum]]'' permitted a debtor to become a slave of his creditor. The plebs argued the debts had become unsustainable because of the expenses of the wars wanted by the patricians. As the senate did not accede to the proposal of a total debt remission advanced by dictator and augur [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] the plebs retired on the Mount Sacer, a hill located three Roman miles to the North-northeast of Rome, past the Nomentan bridge on river [[Anio]].<ref>Varro in his ''Lingua Latina'' V writes of \"Crustumerian secession\" (\"''a secessione Crustumerina''\"\uff09.</ref> The place is windy and was usually the site of rites of divination performed by haruspices. The senate in the end sent a delegation composed of ten members with full powers of making a deal with the plebs, of which were part [[Menenius Agrippa]] and Manius Valerius. It was Valerius, according to the inscription found at Arezzo in 1688 and written on the order of Augustus as well as other literary sources, that brought the plebs down from the Mount, after the secessionists had consecrated it to ''Jupiter Territor'' and built an altar (''ara'') on its summit. The fear of the wrath of Jupiter was an important element in the solution of the crisis. The consecration of the Mount probably referred to its summit only. The ritual requested the participation of both an augur (presumably Manius Valerius himself) and a pontifex.<ref>F. Vallocchia \"Manio Valerio Massimo dittatore ed augure\" in ''Diritto @ Storia'' '''7''' 2008 (online).</ref>\n\nThe second secession was caused by the autocratic and arrogant behaviour of the ''[[decemviri]]'', who had been charged by the Roman people with writing down the laws in use till then kept secret by the patrician magistrates and the ''sacerdotes''. All magistracies and the tribunes of the plebs had resigned in advance. The task resulted in the XII Tables, which though concerned only private law. The plebs once again retreated to the Sacer Mons: this act besides recalling the first secession was meant to seek the protection of the supreme god. The secession ended with the resignation of the ''decemviri'' and an amnesty for the rebellious soldiers who had deserted from their camp near Mount Algidus while warring against the Volscians, abandoning the commanders. The amnesty was granted by the senate and guaranteed by the ''pontifex maximus'' Quintus Furius (in Livy's version) (or Marcus Papirius) who also supervised the nomination of the new tribunes of the plebs, then gathered on the Aventine Hill. The role played by the ''pontifex maximus'' in a situation of vacation of powers is a significant element underlining the religious basis and character of the ''tribunicia potestas''.<ref>C. M. A.

The two gods (with a charm) evoked Jupiter, who was forced to come down to earth at the Aventine (hence named ''Iuppiter Elicius'', according to Ovid). After Numa skilfully avoided the requests of the god for human sacrifices, Jupiter agreed to his request to know how lightning bolts are averted, asking only for the substitutions Numa had mentioned: an onion bulb, hairs and a fish. Moreover, Jupiter promised that at the sunrise of the following day he would give to Numa and the Roman people pawns of the ''imperium''. The following day, after throwing three lightning bolts across a clear sky, Jupiter sent down from heaven a shield. Since this shield had no angles, Numa named it ''ancile''; because in it resided the fate of the ''imperium'', he had many copies made of it to disguise the real one. He asked the smith [[Mamurius Veturius]] to make the copies, and gave them to the [[Salii]]. As his only reward, Mamurius expressed the wish that his name be sung in the last of their ''carmina''.<ref>Ovid ''Fasti III'', 284\u2013392. Festus s.v. Mamuri Veturi p. 117 L as cited by Dum\u00e9zil 1977 p. 197.</ref> Plutarch gives a slightly different version of the story, writing that the cause of the miraculous drop of the shield was a plague and not linking it with the Roman ''imperium''.<ref>Plutarch Numa 18.</ref>\n\n===Tullus Hostilius===\nThroughout his reign, [[Tullus Hostilius|King Tullus]] had a scornful attitude towards religion. His temperament was warlike, and he disregarded religious rites and piety. After conquering the [[Albani people|Albans]] with the duel between the [[Horatii and Curiatii]], Tullus destroyed [[Alba Longa]] and deported its inhabitants to Rome. As [[Livy]] tells the story, omens ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#prodigium|prodigia]])'' in the form of a rain of stones occurred on the [[Alban Mount]] because the deported Albans had disregarded their ancestral rites linked to the sanctuary of Jupiter. In addition to the omens, a voice was heard requesting that the Albans perform the rites. A plague followed and at last the king himself fell ill. As a consequence, the warlike character of Tullus broke down; he resorted to religion and petty, superstitious practices. At last, he found a book by Numa recording a secret rite on how to evoke ''Iuppiter Elicius''. The king attempted to perform it, but since he executed the rite improperly the god threw a lightning bolt which burned down the king's house and killed Tullus.<ref>Dum\u00e9zil 1977 p. 175 citing Livy I 31.</ref>\n\n===Tarquin the Elder===\nWhen approaching Rome (where Tarquin was heading to try his luck in politics after unsuccessful attempts in his native [[Tarquinii]]), an eagle swooped down, removed his hat, flew screaming in circles, replaced the hat on his head and flew away.  Tarquin's wife [[Tanaquil]] interpreted this as a sign that he would become king based on the bird, the quadrant of the sky from which it came, the god who had sent it and the fact it touched his hat (an item of clothing placed on a man's most noble part, the head).<ref>R.

Sacrifices to Jupiter are also broached in Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 10. The issue of the sacrificial victims proper to a god is one of the most vexed topics of Roman religion: cf. G\u00e9rard Capdeville \"Substitution de victimes dans les sacrifices d'animaux \u00e0 Rome\" in ''MEFRA'' ''' 83'''  2 1971 pp. 283\u2013323. Also G. Dum\u00e9zil \"Quaestiunculae indo-italicae: 11.

The \"contract\" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals, but any that died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice would count as if already sacrificed. Sacred animals were already assigned to the gods, who ought to protect their own property.</ref>\n\n===Temples===\n====Temple of Capitoline Jupiter====\n{{main|Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)}}\nThe temple to [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] stood on the [[Capitoline Hill]] in Rome.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 258\u2013261.</ref> Jupiter was worshiped there as an individual deity, and with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]] as part of the [[Capitoline Triad]]. The building was supposedly begun by king [[Tarquinius Priscus]], completed by the last king ([[Tarquinius Superbus]]) and inaugurated in the early days of the Roman Republic (September 13, 509 BC). It was topped with the statues of four horses drawing a [[quadriga]], with Jupiter as charioteer. A large statue of Jupiter stood within; on festival days, its face was painted red. <!-- Need section on images, probably above or below this --><ref>[[Ovid]], ''Fasti'', 1.201f.</ref> In (or near) this temple was the ''Iuppiter Lapis'': the [[Jupiter Stone]], on which oaths could be sworn.\n\nJupiter's Capitoline Temple probably served as the architectural model for his provincial temples. \nWhen Hadrian built [[Aelia Capitolina]] on the site of [[Jerusalem]], a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was erected in the place of the destroyed [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. <!-- Permanent military shrine to Jupiter known as Capitolium (one case only) -->\n\n====Other temples in Rome====\nThere were two temples in Rome dedicated to ''Iuppiter Stator''; [[Temple of Jupiter Stator (8th century BC)|the first one]] was built and dedicated in 294 BC by [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] after the third Samnite War.

The god manifested his discontent through the prodigy of a rain of stones: the commission sent by the Roman senate to inquire was also greeted by a rain of stones and heard a loud voice from the grove on the summit of the mount requesting the Albans perform the religious service to the god according to the rites of their country. In consequence of this event the Romans instituted a festival of nine days (''nundinae'').   Nonetheless a plague ensued:  in the end Tullus Hostilius himself was affected and lastly killed by the god with a lightning bolt.<ref>Livy I 31 1\u20138.</ref> The festival was reestablished on its primitive site by the last Roman king Tarquin the Proud under the leadership of Rome.\n\nThe ''[[feriae Latinae]]'', or ''[[Latiar]]'' as they were known originally,<ref>Macrobius I 16.

Rocking is one of the most ancient rites mimicking ascent to Heaven and is very widespread. At the ''Latiar'' the rocking took place on a tree and the winner was of course the one who had swung the highest. This rite was said to have been instituted by the Albans to commemorate the disappearance of king [[Latinus]], in the battle against [[Mezentius]] king of [[Caere]]: the rite symbolised a search for him both on earth and in heaven. The rocking as well as the customary drinking of milk was also considered to commemorate and ritually reinstate infancy.<ref>Festus s.v. oscillantes p. 194 M; C. A.

The [[Fasti Praenestini]] marks the day as ''feriae Iovis'', as does Macrobius.<ref>Macrobius I 10, 11.</ref> It is unclear whether the rite of ''parentatio'' was itself the reason for the festival of Jupiter, or if this was another festival which happened to fall on the same day.

The study of these epithets must consider their origins (the historical context of an epithet's source).\n\nJupiter's most ancient attested forms of cult belong to the State cult: these include the mount cult (see section above note n. 22<!-- a less easily broken reference here could use an anchor -->).  In Rome this cult entailed the existence of particular sanctuaries the most important of which were located on ''Mons Capitolinus'' (earlier ''Tarpeius''). The mount had two tops that were both destined to the discharge of acts of cult related to Jupiter. The northern and higher top was the ''[[Arx (Roman)|arx]]'' and on it was located the observation place of the [[augurs]] ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auguraculum|auguraculum]])'' and to it headed the monthly procession of the ''sacra Idulia''.<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Varro LL V 47 and Festus p. 290 M. s.v. Idulia.</ref> On the southern top was to be found the most ancient sanctuary of the god: the shrine of  ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' allegedly built by Romulus, restored by Augustus. The god here had no image and was represented by the sacred flintstone (''silex'').<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Paulus p. 92 M.; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 641.</ref> The most ancient known rites, those of the ''spolia opima'' and of the [[fetials]] which connect Jupiter with Mars and Quirinus are dedicated to ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' or ''Iuppiter Lapis''.<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Festus p. 189 M. s.v. lapis; Polybius ''Historiae'' III 25, 6.</ref> The concept of the sky god was already overlapped with the ethical and political domain since this early time. According to Wissowa and Dum\u00e9zil<ref name=\"G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 169\">G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 169.</ref> ''Iuppiter Lapis'' seems to be inseparable from ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' in whose tiny templet on the Capitol the stone was lodged.\n \nAnother most ancient epithet is ''Lucetius'': although the Ancients, followed by some modern scholars such as Wissowa,{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=100}} interpreted it as referring to sunlight, the ''carmen Saliare'' shows that it refers to lightning.<ref>G. Dumezil ARR above p. 167. The ''carmen Saliare'' has: \"cume tonas Leucesie prai ted tremonti/ quot tibi etinei deis cum tonarem\".</ref> A further confirmation of this interpretation is provided by the sacred meaning of lightning which is reflected in the sensitivity of the ''flaminica Dialis'' to the phenomenon.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> To the same atmospheric complex belongs the epithet ''Elicius'': while the ancient erudites thought it was connected to lightning, it is in fact related to the opening of the rervoirs of rain, as is testified by the ceremony of the ''Nudipedalia'', meant to propitiate rainfall and devoted to Jupiter.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 168 citing [[Petronius]] ''[[Satyricon]]'' 44.</ref> and the ritual of the ''[[lapis manalis]]'', the stone which was brought into the city through the ''Porta Capena'' and carried around in times of drought, which was named ''Aquaelicium''.<ref>Paulus s. v. p. 94 L 2nd; p. 2 M; Tertullian ''Apologeticum'' 40.</ref> Other early epithets connected with the atmospheric quality of Jupiter are ''Pluvius'', ''Imbricius'', ''Tempestas'', ''Tonitrualis'', ''tempestatium divinarum potens'', ''Serenator'', ''Serenus''<ref>Apuleius ''De Mundo'' 37; cf.

''Rumach'' Etruscan for Roman). However many scholars have argued that the name of Rome, ''Ruma'', meant in fact woman's breast.<ref>Bruno Migliorini s.v. Roma in ''Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti'' vol. XXIX p. 589; A. W. Schlegel ''S\u00e4mtliche Werke'' Leipzig 1847 XII p. 488; F. Kort ''R\u00f6mische Geschichte'' Heidelberg 1843 p.32-3.</ref> [[Diva Rumina]], as Augustine testifies in the cited passage, was the goddess of suckling babies: she was venerated near the ''ficus ruminalis'' and was offered only libations of milk.<ref>N. G. L. Hammond & H. H. Scullard (Eds.) ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' Oxford 1970 s. v. p. 940.</ref> Here moreover Augustine cites the verses devoted to Jupiter by [[Quintus Valerius Soranus]], while hypothesising ''Iuno'' (more adept in his view as a breastfeeder), i.e. Rumina instead of Ruminus, might be nothing else than  ''Iuppiter'': \"''Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque Progenitor genetrixque deum...''\".\n\nIn Dum\u00e9zil's opinion ''Farreus'' should be understood as related to the rite of the ''confarreatio'' the most sacred form of marriage, the name of which is due to the spelt cake eaten by the spouses, rather than surmising an agricultural quality of the god: the epithet means the god was the guarantor of the effects of the ceremony, to which the presence of his flamen is necessary and that he can interrupt with a clap of thunder.<ref>Servius IV 339.</ref>\n\nThe epithet ''Dapalis'' is on the other hand connected to a rite described by Cato and mentioned by Festus.<ref>Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' 132; Festus s. v. daps, dapalis, dapaticum pp. 177\u2013178 L 2nd.</ref> Before the sowing of autumn or spring the peasant offered a banquet of roast beef and a cup of wine to Jupiter : it is natural that on such occasions he would entreat the god who has power over the weather, however Cato' s prayer of s one of sheer offer and no request. The language suggests another attitude: Jupiter is invited to a banquet which is supposedly abundant and magnificent. The god is honoured as ''summus''. The peasant may hope he shall receive a benefit, but he does not say it. This interpretation finds support in the analogous urban ceremony of the ''epulum Iovis'', from which the god derives the epithet of  ''Epulo''  and which was a magnificent feast accompanied by flutes.<ref>''Epulo'' CIL VI 3696.</ref>\n\nEpithets related to warring are in Wissowa's view  ''Iuppiter Feretrius'', ''Iuppiter Stator'', ''Iuppiter Victor'' and ''Iuppiter Invictus''.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|pages=105-108}} ''Feretrius'' would be connected with war by the rite of the first type of  ''[[spolia opima]]'' which is in fact a dedication to the god of the arms of the defeated king of the enemy that happens whenever he has been killed by the king of Rome or his equivalent authority. Here too Dum\u00e9zil notes the dedication has to do with regality and not with war, since the rite is in fact the offer of the arms of a king by a king:  a proof of such an assumption is provided by the fact that the arms of an enemy king captured by an officer or a common soldier were dedicated to Mars and Quirinus respectively.\n\n''Iuppiter Stator'' was first attributed by tradition to [[Romulus]], who had prayed the god for his almighty help at a difficult time the battle with the Sabines of king Titus Tatius.<ref>Livy I 12, 4\u20136.</ref> Dum\u00e9zil opines the action of Jupiter is not that of a god of war who wins through fighting: Jupiter acts by causing an inexplicable change in the morale of the fighters of the two sides. The same feature can be detected also in the certainly historical record of the battle of the third Samnite War in 294 BC, in which consul [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] vowed a temple to ''Iuppiter Stator'' if \"Jupiter will stop the rout of the Roman army and if afterwards the Samnite legions shall be victouriously massacred...It looked as if the gods themselves had taken side with Romans, so much easily did the Roman arms succeed in prevailing...\".<ref>Livy X 36, 11.</ref><ref>Dum\u00e9zil above pp. 174\u201375.</ref> In a similar manner one can explain the epithet ''Victor'', whose cult was founded in 295 BC on the battlefield of [[Sentinum]] by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]] and who received another vow again in 293 by consul [[Lucius Papirius Cursor]] before a battle against the Samnite ''legio linteata''. The religious meaning of the vow is in both cases an appeal to the supreme god by a Roman chief at a time of need for divine help from the supreme god, albeit for different reasons: Fabius had remained the only political and military responsible of the Roman State after the ''devotio'' of P. Decius Mus, Papirius had to face an enemy who had acted with impious rites and vows, i.e. was religiously reprehensible.<ref>Livy X 29, 12\u201317; ''nefando sacro, mixta hominum pecudumque caedes'', \"by an impious rite, a mixed slaughter of people and flock\" 39, 16; 42, 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nMore recently Dario Sabbatucci has given a different interpretation of the meaning of ''Stator'' within the frame of his structuralistic and dialectic vision of Roman calendar, identifying oppositions, tensions and equilibria: January is the month of [[Janus]], at the beginning of the year, in the uncertain time of winter (the most ancient calendar had only ten months, from March to December). In this month Janus deifies kingship and defies Jupiter. Moreover, January sees also the presence of [[Veiovis]] who appears as an anti-Jupiter, of [[Carmenta]] who is the goddess of birth and like Janus has two opposed faces, ''Prorsa'' and ''Postvorta'' (also named [[Antevorta]] and [[Antevorta|Porrima]]), of [[Iuturna]], who as a gushing spring evokes the process of coming into being from non-being as the god of passage and change does. In this period the preeminence of Janus needs compensating on the Ides through the action of Jupiter ''Stator'', who plays the role of anti-Janus, i.e. of moderator of the action of Janus.<ref>Dario Sabbatucci above, as summarized in the review by Robert Turcan above p. 70.</ref>\n\n====Epithets denoting functionality====\nSome epithets describe a particular aspect of the god, or one of his functions:\n*'''Jove Aegiochus''', Jove \"Holder of the Goat or Aegis\", as the father of [[Aegipan]].<ref>''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica.html Astronomica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601224218/http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica.html |date=2013-06-01 }}'', [[Hyginus]], translated by Mary Grant, pt.1, ch.2, sec.13</ref>\n*'''Jupiter Caelus''', Jupiter as the sky or heavens; see also [[Caelus]].\n*'''Jupiter Caelestis''', \"Heavenly\" or \"Celestial Jupiter\".\n*'''Jupiter Elicius''', Jupiter \"who calls forth [celestial omens]\" or \"who is called forth [by incantations]\"; \"sender of rain\".\n*'''Jupiter Feretrius''', who carries away the [[War looting|spoils of war]]\".

From the time of [[Vespasian]], he was popular among the [[Roman legions]] as god of war and victory, especially on the [[Danube]] at [[Carnuntum]]. He is depicted as standing on a bull, with a thunderbolt in his left hand, and a double ax in the right.\n*'''[[Jupiter Indiges]]''', \"Jupiter of the country,\" a title given to [[Aeneas]] after his death, according to [[Livy]]<ref>[[Livy]], [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]] Book 1.</ref>\n*'''Jupiter Ladicus''', Jupiter equated with a Celtiberian mountain-god and worshipped as the spirit of Mount Ladicus in [[Gallaecia]], northwest Iberia,<ref>''CIL'' II, 2525; Toutain. 1920. 143ff.</ref> preserved in the toponym ''Codos de Ladoco''.<ref>Smith, ''Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' \"Ladicus\")</ref>\n*'''Jupiter Laterius''' or '''Latiaris''', the god of [[Latium]]\n*'''Jupiter Parthinus''' or '''Partinus''', under this name was worshiped on the borders of northeast [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Upper Moesia]], perhaps associated with the local tribe known as the [[Partheni]].\n*'''Jupiter Poeninus''', under this name worshipped in the Alps, around the [[Great St Bernard Pass]], where he had a sanctuary.\n*'''Jupiter Solutorius''', a local version of Jupiter worshipped in [[Spain]]; he was syncretised with the local [[Iberians|Iberian]] god [[Eacus (god)|Eacus]].\n*'''Jupiter Taranis''', Jupiter equated with the Celtic god [[Taranis]].\n*'''Jupiter Uxellinus''', Jupiter as a god of high mountains.<!--isn't this a Gaulish epithet, as in Uxellodunum-->\n\nIn addition, many of the epithets of Zeus can be found applied to Jupiter, by ''[[interpretatio romana]]''. Thus, since the hero [[Trophonius]] (from [[Lebadea]] in Boeotia) is called Zeus Trophonius, this can be represented in English (as it would be in Latin) as Jupiter Trophonius. Similarly, the Greek cult of Zeus [[Meilichios]] appears in Pompeii as Jupiter Meilichius. Except in representing actual cults in Italy, this is largely 19th-century usage; modern works distinguish Jupiter from Zeus.\n\n==Theology==\n\n===Sources===\n[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] and [[Verrius Flaccus]]<ref>The work of Verrius Flaccus is preserved through the summary of [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] and his epitomist [[Paul the Deacon]].</ref> were the main sources on the theology of Jupiter and archaic Roman religion in general. Varro was acquainted with the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|libri pontificum]]'' (\"books of the [[College of Pontiffs|Pontiffs]]\") and their archaic classifications.<ref>Georges Dum\u00e9zil ''La religion romaine archa\u00efque'', Payot, Paris, 1974 2nd \"Remarques preliminaires\" X; It. tr.

Augustine's criticism of traditional Roman religion is based on Varro's lost work, ''[[Res divina|Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum]]''. Although a work of [[Christian apologetics]], ''The City of God'' provides glimpses into Varro's theological system and authentic Roman theological lore in general. According to Augustine,<ref>Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' IV 27; VI 5.</ref> Varro drew on the pontiff [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex|Mucius Scaevola]]'s tripartite theology:\n\n* The [[mythical theology|mythic theology]] of the poets (useful for the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatre]])\n* The [[Natural theology|physical theology]] of the philosophers (useful for understanding the natural world)\n* The civil theology of the priests (useful for the state)<ref>J. P\u00e9pin \"La th\u00e9ologie tripartite de Varron\" ''Revue des \u00e9tudes augustiniennes'' '''2''' 1956 pp. 265-294. Dum\u00e9zil has pointed out that even though Augustine may be correct in pointing out cases in which Varro presented under the civil theology category contents that may look to belong to mythic theology, nevertheless he preserved under this heading the lore and legends ancient Romans considered their own.</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Theology of Jupiter in early Rome}}Jovian theology===\n[[Georg Wissowa]] stressed Jupiter's uniqueness as the only case among Indo-European religions in which the original god preserved his name, his identity and his prerogatives.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=100}} In this view, Jupiter is the god of heaven and retains his identification with the sky among the Latin poets (his name is used as a synonym for \"sky\".<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912}} cites three passages from Horace, ''Carmina'': I 1, 25 ''manet sub Iove frigido venator''; I 22, 20 ''quod latus mundi nebulae malusque Iuppiter urget''; III 10, 7 ''ut glaciet nives puro numine Iuppiter''.</ref>) In this respect, he differs from his Greek equivalent Zeus (who is considered a personal god, warden and dispenser of skylight). His name reflects this idea; it is a derivative of the Indo-European word for \"bright, shining sky\". His residence is found atop the hills of Rome and of mountains in general; as a result, his cult is present in Rome and throughout Italy at upper elevations.<ref>On the Esquiline lies the ''sacellum'' of  ''Iuppiter Fagutalis'' (Varro ''De Lingua Latina'' V 152 (hereafter LL), Paulus p. 87 M., Pliny ''Naturalis historia'' XVI 37 (hereafter NH), CIL VI 452); on the Viminal is known a ''Iuppiter Viminius'' (Varro LL V 51, Festus p. 376); a ''Iuppiter Caelius'' on the Caelius (CIL VI 334); on the Quirinal the so called ''Capitolium Vetus'' (Martial V 22, 4; VII 73, 4). Outside Rome: Iuppiter Latiaris on ''Mons Albanus'', Iuppiter Appenninus (Orelli 1220, CIL VIII 7961 and XI 5803) on the Umbrian Appennines, at Scheggia, on the [[Via Flaminia]], Iuppiter Poeninus (CIL 6865 ff., cfr. Bernabei ''Rendiconti della Regia Accademia dei Lincei'' '''III''', 1887, fascicolo 2, p. 363 ff.) at the Great Saint Bernard Pass, Iuppiter Vesuvius (CIL X 3806), Iuppiter Ciminus (CIL XI 2688); the Sabine Iuppiter Cacunus (CIL IX 4876, VI 371). Outside Italy Iuppiter Culminalis in Noricum and Pannonia (CIL III 3328, 4032, 4115, 5186; Supplememtum 10303, 11673 etc.) as cited by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=102}} and Francesca Cenerini \"Scritture di santuari extraurbani tra le Alpi e gli Appennini\" in ''[[M\u00e9langes de l'\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de Rome]]'' (hereafter ''MEFRA'')  '''104''' 1992 1 pp. 94\u201395.</ref> Jupiter assumed atmospheric qualities; he is the wielder of lightning and the master of weather. However, Wissowa acknowledges that Jupiter is not merely a naturalistic, heavenly, supreme deity; he is in continual communication with man by means of thunder, lightning and the flight of birds (his [[auspices]]). Through his vigilant watch he is also the guardian of public oaths and compacts and the guarantor of good faith in the State cult.<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=100-101}}</ref> The Jovian cult was common to the [[Italic people]] under the names ''Iove'', ''Diove'' (Latin) and  ''Iuve'', ''Diuve'' (Oscan, in Umbrian only ''Iuve'', ''Iupater'' in the [[Iguvine Tables]]).\n\nWissowa considered Jupiter also a god of war and agriculture, in addition to his political role as guarantor of good faith (public and private) as ''Iuppiter Lapis'' and ''Dius Fidius'', respectively. His view is grounded in the sphere of action of the god (who intervenes in battle and influences the harvest through weather).{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=103\u2013108}}\n \nIn [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]]'s view, Jovian theology (and that of the equivalent gods in other Indo-European religions) is an evolution from a naturalistic, supreme, celestial god identified with heaven to a sovereign god, a wielder of lightning bolts, master and protector of the community (in other words, of a change from a naturalistic approach to the world of the divine to a socio-political approach).<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil above It. tr. pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n[[File:Giorgione, The tempest.jpg|thumb|One interpretation of the lightning in [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|Tempest]]'' is that it represents the presence of Jupiter.<ref>Salvatore Settis, ''Giorgione's ''Tempest'': Interpreting the Hidden Subject'', University of Chicago Press, 1990, p. 62, summarising this scholarly interpretation: \"The lightning is Jove.\" cf Peter Humfrey, ''Painting in Renaissance Venice'', Yale University Press, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ARLTK284AHAC&pg=PA118&dq=Giorgione+tempest+jupiter&hl=en&ei=cSp_TpupGYTo0QGe2tz-Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Giorgione%20tempest%20jupiter&f=false p.118f.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424065939/https://books.google.com/books?id=ARLTK284AHAC&pg=PA118&dq=Giorgione+tempest+jupiter&hl=en&ei=cSp_TpupGYTo0QGe2tz-Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Giorgione%20tempest%20jupiter&f=false |date=2016-04-24 }}</ref>|alt=Painting of a mother feeding her child, watched by a shepherd, with lightning flashing across a dark sky in the background]]\n\nIn [[Vedic mythology|Vedic religion]], [[Dyaus Pitar]] remained confined to his distant, removed, passive role and the place of sovereign god was occupied by [[Varuna]] and [[Mitra]]. In Greek and Roman religion, instead, the homonymous gods ''*Diou-'' and ''\u0394\u03b9[[digamma|\u03dd]]-'' evolved into atmospheric deities; by their mastery of thunder and lightning, they expressed themselves and made their will known to the community. In Rome, Jupiter also sent signs to the leaders of the state in the form of [[auspices]] in addition to thunder. The art of [[augury]] was considered prestigious by ancient Romans; by sending his signs, Jupiter (the sovereign of heaven) communicates his advice to his terrestrial colleague: the king (''rex'') or his successor magistrates. The encounter between the heavenly and political, legal aspects of the deity are well represented by the prerogatives, privileges, functions and taboos proper to his ''[[flamen]]'' (the ''[[flamen Dialis]]'' and his wife, the ''flaminica Dialis'').\n\nDum\u00e9zil maintains that Jupiter is not himself a god of war and agriculture, although his actions and interest may extend to these spheres of human endeavour. His view is based on the methodological assumption that the chief criterion for studying a god's nature is not to consider his field of action, but the quality, method and features of his action. Consequently, the analysis of the type of action performed by Jupiter in the domains in which he operates indicates that Jupiter is a sovereign god who may act in the field of politics (as well as agriculture and war) in his capacity as such, i.e. in a way and with the features proper to a king. Sovereignty is expressed through the two aspects of absolute, magic power (epitomised and represented by the Vedic god [[Varuna]]) and lawful right (by the Vedic god [[Mitra]]).<ref>Dum\u00e9zil above p. 239; It. Tr. p. 171.</ref> However, sovereignty permits action in every field; otherwise, it would lose its essential quality. As a further proof, Dum\u00e9zil cites the story of Tullus Hostilius (the most belligerent of the Roman kings), who was killed by Jupiter with a lightning bolt (indicating that he did not enjoy the god's favour). \nVarro's definition of Jupiter as the god who has under his jurisdiction the full expression of every being (''penes Iovem sunt summa'') reflects the sovereign nature of the god, as opposed to the jurisdiction of Janus (god of passages and change) on their beginning (''penes Ianum sunt prima'').<ref>Varro apud Augustine ''De Civitate Dei VII 9.''</ref>\n\n==Relation to other gods==\n\n===Capitoline Triad===\n{{See also|Capitoline Triad}}\n[[File:Arte romana, triade capitolina, 160-180 dc (guidonia montecelio, museo civico archeologico) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Capitoline Triad|alt=Statue of three figures, seated side by side]]\nThe Capitoline Triad was introduced to Rome by the Tarquins. Dum\u00e9zil<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 274 ff.</ref> thinks it might have been an Etruscan (or local) creation based on Vitruvius' treatise on architecture, in which the three deities are associated as the most important. It is possible that the Etruscans paid particular attention to [[Menrva]] (Minerva) as a goddess of destiny, in addition to the royal couple Uni (Juno) and Tinia (Jupiter).<ref>Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 271 citing Ovid ''Fasti'' III 815\u2013832.</ref> In Rome, Minerva later assumed a military aspect under the influence of [[Athena Pallas]] (Polias). Dum\u00e9zil argues that with the advent of the Republic, Jupiter became the only king of Rome, no longer merely the first of the great gods.\n\n====Archaic Triad====\n{{Main|Archaic Triad}}\nThe Archaic Triad is a hypothetical theological structure (or system) consisting of the gods Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus. It was first described by Wissowa,<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=23, 133\u2013134}};  Dum\u00e9zil ''Jupiter Mars Quirinus'' I-IV Paris 1941\u20131948; ARR above pp.  137\u2013165.</ref> and the concept was developed further by Dum\u00e9zil. The three-function hypothesis of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European society]] advanced by Dum\u00e9zil holds that in prehistory, society was divided into three classes (priests, warriors and craftsmen) which had as their religious counterparts the divine figures of the sovereign god, the warrior god and the civil god. The sovereign function (embodied by Jupiter) entailed omnipotence; thence, a domain extended over every aspect of nature and life. The colour relating to the sovereign function is white.\n\nThe three functions are interrelated with one another, overlapping to some extent; the sovereign function, although essentially religious in nature, is involved in many ways in areas pertaining to the other two. Therefore, Jupiter is the \"magic player\" in the founding of the Roman state and the fields of war, agricultural plenty, human fertility and wealth.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 172 and 175.</ref>\n\nThis hypothesis has not found widespread support among scholars.\n\n===Jupiter and Minerva===\nApart from being protectress of the arts and craft as Minerva Capta, who was brought from Falerii, Minerva's association to Jupiter and relevance to Roman state religion is mainly linked to the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]], a wooden statue of Athena that could move the eyes and wave the spear. It was stored in the ''penus interior'', inner penus of the ''aedes Vestae'', temple of Vesta and considered the most important among the ''[[pignora imperii]]'', pawns of dominion, empire.<ref>E. Montanari ''Mito e Storia nell' annalistica romana delle origini'' Roma 1990 pp. 73 ff.; citing Cicero ''Pro Scauro 48: \"''pignus nostrae salutis atque imperii''\"; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem II 188, 16: \"''Illic imperium fore ubi et Palladium''\"; Festus s.v. p. 152 L.</ref> In Roman traditional lore it was brought from Troy by Aeneas.  Scholars though think it was last taken to Rome in the third or second century BC.<ref>E. Montanari above citing M. Sordi \"Lavinio, Roma e il Palladio\" in ''CISA'' '''8''' 1982 p. 74 ff.; W. Vollgraf \"Le Palladium de Rome\" in ''BAB'' 1938 pp. 34 ff.</ref>\n\n===Juno and Fortuna===\n\nThe divine couple received from Greece its matrimonial implications, thence bestowing on [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] the role of tutelary goddess of marriage (''Iuno Pronuba'').\n\nThe couple itself though cannot be reduced to a Greek apport. The association of Juno and Jupiter is of the most ancient Latin theology.<ref>G. Dumezil \"D\u00e9esses latines et mythes vediques. III Fortuna Primigenia\" in ''Coll. Latomus'' '''25''' 1956 pp. 71\u201378.</ref> [[Praeneste]] offers a glimpse into original Latin mythology: the local goddess [[Fortuna]] is represented as milking two infants, one male and one female, namely Jove (Jupiter) and Juno.<ref>Cicero ''De nat. Deor.'' II 85-86: \"Is est locus saeptus religiose propter Iovis pueri, qui lactens cum Iunone in gremio sedens, mamma appetens, castissime colitur a matribus\": \"This is an enclosed place for religious reasons because of Iupiter child, who is seated on the womb with Juno suckling, directed towards the breast, very chastely worshipped by mothers\".</ref> It seems fairly safe to assume that from the earliest times they were identified by their own proper names and since they got them they were never changed through the course of history: they were called Jupiter and Juno. These gods were the most ancient deities of every Latin town. Praeneste preserved divine filiation and infancy as the sovereign god and his paredra Juno have a mother who is the primordial goddess Fortuna Primigenia.<ref>G. Dumezil ''D\u00e9esses latines et mythes vediques'' p. 96 ff.</ref> Many terracotta statuettes have been discovered which represent a woman with a child: one of them represents exactly the scene described by Cicero of a woman with two children of different sex who touch her breast. Two of the votive inscriptions to Fortuna associate her and Jupiter: \" Fortunae Iovi puero...\" and \"Fortunae Iovis puero...\"<ref>CIL XIV 2868 and 2862 (mutile).</ref>\n\nIn 1882 though R. Mowat published an inscription in which Fortuna is called ''daughter of Jupiter'', raising new questions and opening new perspectives in the theology of Latin gods.<ref>R. Mowat \"Inscription latine sur plaque de bronze acquise \u00e0 Rome par par M. A. Dutuit\"  in ''Mem. de la Soc. nat. des Antiquit\u00e9s de France'' 5me Ser. 3  '''43''' 1882 p. 200: CIL XIV 2863: ORCEVIA NUMERI/ NATIONU CRATIA/  FORTUNA DIOVO FILEA/ PRIMOCENIA/ DONOM DEDI. Cited by G. Dumezil above p. 71 ff.</ref> Dumezil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this ''aporia'' would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion.<ref>G Dumezil ''D\u00e9esses latines et mythes vediques'' Bruxelles 1956 chapt. 3.</ref> The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity [[Aditi]], the ''Not-Bound'' or ''Enemy of Bondage'', that shows that there is no question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the [[Aditya]] she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, [[Dak\u1e63a]], the minor sovereign. who represents the ''Creative Energy'', being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs.<ref>\u1e5ag-Veda X 72, 4-5; G. Dumezil above and ''Mariages indo-europ\u00e9ens'' pp. 311\u2013312: \"Of Aditi Daksa was born, and of Daksa Aditi, o Daksa, she who is your daughter\".</ref> Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with [[Savitr]]) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with her head on her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions.<ref>G. Dumezil ''D\u00e9esses latines...'' p. 91 n.3.</ref> The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.<ref>A. Brelich ''Tre variazioni romane sul tema delle origini. I. Roma e Preneste. Una polemica religiosa nell'Italia antica'' Pubbl. dell'Univ. di Roma 1955\u20131956.</ref>\n\n===Janus===\n{{Main|Janus}}\nThe relation of Jupiter to Janus is problematic. Varro defines Jupiter as the god who has ''potestas'' (power) over the forces by which anything happens in the world. Janus, however, has the privilege of being invoked first in rites, since in his power are the beginnings of things (''prima''), the appearance of Jupiter included.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 101 and 290. Discussed at length by Augustine, ''City of God'' VII 9 and 10. Also Ovid ''Fasti'' I 126.</ref>\n\n===Saturn===\n{{Main|Saturn (mythology)}}\nThe [[Latini|Latins]] considered Saturn the predecessor of Jupiter. Saturn reigned in [[Latium]] during a mythical [[Golden Age]] reenacted every year at the festival of [[Saturnalia]]. Saturn also retained primacy in matters of agriculture and money. Unlike the Greek tradition of [[Cronus]] and Zeus, the usurpation of Saturn as king of the gods by Jupiter was not viewed by the Latins as violent or hostile; Saturn continued to be revered in his temple at the foot of the Capitol Hill, which maintained the alternative name ''Saturnius'' into the time of Varro.<ref>D. Briquel \"Jupiter, Saturne et le Capitol\" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''198''' 2. 1981 pp. 131\u2013162; Varro V 42;  Vergil ''Aeneis''  VIII 357-8;  Dionysius Hal.

Pasqualini has argued that Saturn was related to ''Iuppiter Latiaris'', the old Jupiter of the Latins, as the original figure of this Jupiter was superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held at the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill in Rome which involved a human sacrifice and the aspersion of the statue of the god with the blood of the victim.<ref>A.

Wissowa argued that while Jupiter is the god of the ''Fides Publica Populi Romani'' as ''Iuppiter Lapis'' (by whom important oaths are sworn), Dius Fidius is a deity established for everyday use and was charged with the protection of good faith in private affairs. Dius Fidius would thus correspond to ''Zeus Pistios''.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=103}} The association with Jupiter may be a matter of divine relation; some scholars see him as a form of Hercules.<ref>Roger D.

September.</ref> and sometimes ''Libertas''.<ref>Monumentum Ancyranum IV 7; CIL XI 657 Faventia; XIV 2579 Tusculum.</ref> Wissowa opines that the relationship existed in the concept of creative abundance through which the supposedly-separate Liber might have been connected{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=106}} to the Greek god [[Dionysos]], although both deities might not have been originally related to [[viticulture]].\n\nOther scholars assert that there was no Liber (other than a god of wine) within historical memory.<ref>Fr.

The offer of wine to Liber was made possible by naming the ''mustum'' (grape juice) stored in [[amphora]]s ''sacrima''.<ref>Fr. Altheim ''Terra Mater'' Giessen 1931 p. 22 and n. 4 while acknowledging the obscurity of the etymology of this word proposed the derivation from ''sacerrima'' as ''bruma'' from ''brevissima''; ''Onomata Latina et Graeca'' s.v.:  ''novum vinum''; ''Corpus Glossatorum Latinorum'' II p. 264: \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7 \u03b3\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2.</ref>\nSacred wine was obtained by the natural fermentation of juice of grapes free from flaws of any type, religious (e. g. those struck by lightning, brought into contact with corpses or wounded people or coming from an unfertilised grapeyard) or secular (by \"cutting\" it with old wine). Secular (or \"profane\") wine was obtained through several types of manipulation (e.g.  by adding honey, or ''mulsum''; using raisins, or ''passum''; by boiling, or ''defrutum''). However, the ''sacrima'' used for the offering to the two gods for the preservation of grapeyards, vessels and wine<ref>Columella ''De Re Rustica'' XII 18, 4 mentions a sacrifice to Liber and Libera immediately before.</ref> was obtained only by pouring the juice into amphors after pressing.<ref>Paulus s. v. sacrima p. 423 L; Festus p. 422 L (mutile).</ref> The ''mustum'' was considered ''spurcum'' (dirty), and thus unusable in sacrifices.<ref>Isidore ''Origines'' XX 3, 4; Enrico Monatanari \"Funzione della sovranit\u00e1 e feste del vino nella Roma repubblicana\" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' '''49''' 1983 pp. 242\u2013262.</ref> The amphor (itself not an item of sacrifice) permitted presentation of its content on a table or could be added to a sacrifice; this happened at the ''auspicatio vindamiae'' for the first grape<ref>G.

Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 331\u2013332.</ref> The ''Liberalia'' of March were, since earliest times, the occasion for the ceremony of the donning of the ''toga virilis'' or ''libera''  (which marked the passage into adult citizenship by young people). Augustine relates that these festivals had a particularly obscene character:  a ''phallus'' was taken to the fields on a cart, and then back in triumph to town. In [[Lavinium]] they lasted a month, during which the population enjoyed bawdy jokes. The most honest ''matronae'' were supposed to publicly crown the ''phallus'' with flowers, to ensure a good harvest and repeal the ''fascinatio'' (evil eye).<ref name=\"CDVII21\" /> In Rome representations of the sex organs were placed in the temple of the couple ''Liber Libera'', who presided over the male and female components of generation and the \"liberation\" of the semen.<ref>Augustine CD VII 3, 1.</ref> This complex of rites and beliefs shows that the divine couple's jurisdiction extended over fertility in general, not only that of grapes. The etymology of  ''Liber'' (archaic form ''Loifer, Loifir'') was explained by \u00c9mile Benveniste as formed on the IE theme *leudh- plus the suffix -es-; its original meaning is \"the one of germination, he who ensures the sprouting of crops\".<ref>\"Liber et liberi\" in ''Revue d'\u00e9tudes latins'' '''14''' 1936 pp. 52\u201358.</ref>\n\nThe relationship of Jupiter with freedom was a common belief among the Roman people, as demonstrated by the dedication of the ''Mons Sacer'' to the god after the first secession of the ''plebs''. Later inscriptions also show the unabated popular belief in Jupiter as bestower of freedom in the imperial era.<ref>\"''...curatores Iovi Libertati''\" CIL XI 657 and \"''Iovi Obsequenti publice''\" CIL XI 658 from [[Bagnacavallo]]; \"''Iuppiter Impetrabilis''\" from Cremella sopra [[Monza]] published by G. Zecchini in ''Rivista di studi italiani e latini'' '''110''' 1976 pp. 178\u2013182. The double presence of Jupiter and [[Feronia (goddess)|Feronia]] at Bagnacavallo has led to speculation that the servile ''[[manumissio]]'' (legal ritual action by which slaves were freed)  was practised in this sanctuary : Giancarlo Susini \"San Pietro in Sylvis, santuario pagense e villaggio plebano nel Ravennate\" in ''M\u00e9langes offertes \u00e0 G.

Cenerini above p. 103.</ref>\n\n===Veiove===\n{{Main|Vejovis}}\nScholars have been often puzzled by Ve(d)iove (or [[Veiovis]], or Vedius) and unwilling to discuss his identity, claiming our knowledge of this god is insufficient.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR It. tr. p. 188 n. 44; Kurt Latte  ''R\u00f6mische Religionsgeschichte'' Munich 1960 p. 81 and n. 3.; W. Warde Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London 1899 pp. 121\u2013122.</ref> Most, however, agree that Veiove is a sort of special Jupiter or anti-Iove, or even an underworld Jupiter. In other words, Veiove is indeed the Capitoline god himself, who takes up a different, diminished appearance (''iuvenis'' and ''parvus'', young and gracile), in order to be able to discharge sovereign functions over places, times and spheres that by their own nature are excluded from the direct control of Jupiter as Optimus Maximus.<ref>G. Piccaluga \"L' anti-Iupiter\" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' XXXIV 1963 p. 229-236; E. Gierstad \"Veiovis, a pre-indoeuropean God in Rome?\" in ''Opuscola Romana'' 9, 4 1973 pp. 35\u201342.</ref> This conclusion is based on information provided by Gellius,<ref>Aulus Gellius V 12.</ref> who states his name is formed by adding prefix ''ve'' (here denoting \"deprivation\" or \"negation\") to ''Iove '' (whose name Gellius posits as rooted in the verb ''iuvo'' \"I benefit\"). D. Sabbatucci has stressed the feature of bearer of instability and antithesis to cosmic order of the god, who threatens the kingly power of Jupiter as ''Stator'' and ''Centumpeda'' and whose presence occurs side by side to Janus' on January 1, but also his function of helper to the growth of the young Jupiter.<ref>D. Sabbatucci above as summarised by R. Turcan above p. 70 and pp. 72\u201373. On the aspect of making Jupiter grow up Turcan cites the denarii struck by [[Manius Fonteius]] and [[Valerian the younger]] of the type ''Iovi crescenti'' mentioned by [[A. Alf\u00f6ldi]] in ''Studien zur Geschichte der Weltkrisedes 3. Jhd. n.Chr.'' Darmstadt 1067 p. 112 f.</ref> In 1858 [[Ludwig Preller]] suggested that Veiovis may be the sinister double of Jupiter.<ref>Ludwig Preller ''R\u00f6mische Mythologie'' I p. 262 f.</ref>\n\nIn fact, the god (under the name ''Vetis'') is placed in the last case (number 16) of the outer rim of the Piacenza Liver\u2014before ''Cilens'' (Nocturnus), who ends (or begins in the Etruscan vision) the disposition of the gods. In [[Martianus Capella]]'s division of heaven, he is found in region XV with the ''dii publici''; as such, he numbers among the infernal (or antipodal) gods. The location of his two temples in Rome\u2014near those of Jupiter (one on the Capitoline Hill, in the low between the ''arx'' and the Capitolium, between the two groves where the [[asylum (antiquity)|asylum]] founded by Romulus stood, the other on the Tiber Island near that of  ''Iuppiter Iurarius'', later also known as temple of Aesculapius)<ref>Ovid ''Fasti'' I 291\u2013294.</ref>\u2014may be significant in this respect, along with the fact that he is considered the father<ref>Ferruccio Bernini ''Ovidio.

The nature of the sacrifice is debated; Gellius states ''capra'', a female goat, although some scholars posit a ram. This sacrifice occurred ''rito humano'', which may mean \"with the rite appropriate for human sacrifice\".<ref>Wissowa on the grounds of Paulus's glossa ''humanum sacrificium'' p. 91 L interprets \"with a rite proper to a ceremony in honour of the deceased\". G. Piccaluga at n. 15 and 21 pp. 231-232 though remarks that Gellius does not state ''sacrificium humanum'' but only states...''immolaturque ritu humano capra''.</ref> Gellius concludes by stating that this god is one of those who receive sacrifices so as to persuade them to refrain from causing harm.\n\nThe arrow is an ambivalent symbol; it was used in the ritual of the [[devotio]] (the general who vowed had to stand on an arrow).<ref>Livy VIII 9, 6.</ref> It is perhaps because of the arrow and of the juvenile looks that Gellius identifies Veiove with Apollo<ref>Gellius V 12, 12.</ref> and as a god who must receive worship in order to obtain his abstention from harming men, along with [[Robigus]] and [[Averruncus]].<ref>Gellius V 12. The Romans knew and offered a cult to other such deities: among them ''Febris'', ''Tussis'', ''Mefitis''.</ref> The ambivalence in the identity of Veiove is apparent in the fact that while he is present in places and times which may have a negative connotation (such as the ''asylum'' of Romulus in between the two groves on the Capitol, the Tiberine island along with Faunus and Aesculapius, the kalends of January, the nones of March, and May 21, a statue of his nonetheless stands in the ''arx''. Moreover, the initial particle ''ve-'' which the ancient supposed were part of his name is itself ambivalent as it may have both an accrescitive and diminutive value.<ref>G. Piccaluga \"L' anti-Juppiter\" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' XXXIV 1963 p. 233-234 and notes 30, 31 citing Gellius V 12 and Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia''  XVI 216: \"''Non et simulacrum Veiovis in arce?''\".</ref>\n\nMaurice Besnier has remarked that a temple to ''Iuppiter'' was dedicated by ''praetor'' Lucius Furius Purpureo before the [[Battle of Cremona (200 BC)|battle of Cremona]] against the [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Celtic Cenomani of Cisalpine Gaul]].<ref>Livy XXXI 21.</ref> An inscription found at [[Brescia]] in 1888 shows that ''Iuppiter Iurarius'' was worshipped there<ref>Ettore Pais CIL ''Supplementa Italica'' I ''addimenta al CIL V'' in ''Atti dei Lincei, Memorie'' V 1888 n. 1272: ''I O M IUR D(e) C(onscriptorum) S(ententia)''.</ref> and one found on the south tip of Tiber Island in 1854 that there was a cult to the god on the spot too.<ref>CIL I 1105: ''C. Volcaci C.  F Har. de stipe Iovi Iurario... onimentum''.</ref> Besnier speculates that Lucius Furius had evoked the chief god of the enemy and built a temple to him in Rome outside the ''pomerium''. On January 1, the ''Fasti Praenestini'' record the festivals of Aesculapius and Vediove on the Island, while in the ''Fasti'' Ovid speaks of ''Jupiter'' and his grandson.<ref>Ovid ''Fasti'' I 291\u2013295.</ref> Livy records that in 192 BC, ''duumvir'' Q. Marcus Ralla dedicated to Jupiter on the Capitol the two temples promised by L. Furius Purpureo, one of which was that promised during the war against the Gauls.<ref>Livy XXXV 41.</ref> Besnier would accept a correction to Livy's passage (proposed by Jordan) to read ''aedes Veiovi'' instead of ''aedes duae Iovi''.  Such a correction concerns the temples dedicated on the Capitol: it does not address the question of the dedication of the temple on the Island, which is puzzling, since the place is attested epigraphically as dedicated to the cult of  ''Iuppiter Iurarius'', in the ''Fasti Praenestini'' of ''Vediove''<ref>Cfr. above: \"''Aeculapio Vediovi in insula''\".</ref> and to Jupiter according to Ovid. The two gods may have been seen as equivalent: ''Iuppiter Iurarius'' is an awesome and vengeful god, parallel to the Greek ''Zeus Orkios'', the avenger of perjury.<ref>Maurice Besnier \"Jupiter Jurarius\" in ''M\u00e9langes d'arch\u00e9ologie et d' histoire'' '''18''' 1898 pp. 287\u2013289.</ref>\n\nA. Pasqualini has argued that Veiovis seems related to ''Iuppiter Latiaris'', as the original figure of this Jupiter would have been superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held on the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill, the southernmost hilltop of the [[Quirinal]] in Rome, which involved a human sacrifice. The [[gens Iulia]] had gentilician cults at [[Bovillae]] where a dedicatory inscription to Vediove has been found in 1826 on an ara.<ref>CIL XIV 2387 = ILS 2988 = ILLRP 270=CIL I 807: ''Vediovei patrei genteiles Iuliei leege Albana dicata''.</ref> According to Pasqualini it was a deity similar to Vediove, wielder of lightningbolts and chthonic, who was connected to the cult of the founders who first inhabited the Alban Mount and built the sanctuary. Such a cult once superseded on the Mount would have been taken up and preserved by the Iulii, private citizens bound to the ''sacra Albana'' by their Alban origin.<ref>A. Pasqualini \"Le basi documenatarie della ''leggenda'' di Alba Longa\" Universita' di Roma Torvergata 2012 online.</ref>\n\n===Victoria===\n{{See also|Victoria (mythology)}}\n[[File:RSC 0009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Coin with [[Laurel wreath|laureate]] head of Jupiter ([[Obverse and reverse|obverse]]) and (reverse) Victory, standing (\"''ROMA''\" below in [[relief]])|alt=Roman coin, with bearded head on front and standing figure on reverse]]\nVictoria was connected to ''Iuppiter Victor'' in his role as bestower of military victory. Jupiter, as a sovereign god, was considered as having the power to conquer anyone and anything in a supernatural way; his contribution to military victory was different from that of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (god of military valour). Victoria appears first on the reverse of coins representing Venus (driving the quadriga of Jupiter, with her head crowned and with a palm in her hand) during the first Punic War.  Sometimes, she is represented walking and carrying a trophy.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 408.</ref>\n\nA temple was dedicated to the goddess afterwards on the Palatine, testifying to her high station in the Roman mind. When [[Hieron of Syracuse]] presented a golden statuette of the goddess to Rome, the Senate had it placed in the temple of Capitoline Jupiter among the greatest (and most sacred) deities.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 413. Livy XXVII 2, 10\u201312.</ref>\nAlthough Victoria played a significant role in the religious ideology of the late Republic and the Empire, she is undocumented in earlier times. A function similar to hers may have been played by the little-known [[Vica Pota]].\n\n===Terminus===\n{{See also|Terminus (god)}}\nJuventas and Terminus were the gods who, according to legend,<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Rom. Antiquities''  III 69, 5\u20136.</ref> refused to leave their sites on the Capitol when the construction of the temple of Jupiter was undertaken. Therefore, they had to be reserved a ''sacellum'' within the new temple. Their stubbornness was considered a good omen; it would guarantee youth, stability and safety to Rome on its site.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus above III 69; Florus I 7, 9.</ref> This legend is generally thought by scholars to indicate their strict connection with Jupiter. An inscription found near [[Ravenna]] reads ''Iuppiter Ter.'',<ref>CIL XI 351.</ref> indicating that Terminus is an aspect of Jupiter.\n\nTerminus is the god of boundaries (public and private), as he is portrayed in literature. The religious value of the [[boundary marker]] is documented by Plutarch,<ref>Plutarch ''Numa'' 16.</ref> who ascribes to king Numa the construction of temples to Fides and Terminus and the delimitation of Roman territory. Ovid gives a vivid description of the rural rite at a boundary of fields of neighbouring peasants on February 23 (the day of the [[Terminus (mythology)#Worship|Terminalia]].<ref>Ovid ''Fasti'' II 679.</ref> On that day, Roman pontiffs and magistrates held a ceremony at the sixth mile of the [[Via Laurentina]] (ancient border of the Roman ''ager'', which maintained a religious value). \nThis festival, however, marked the end of the year and was linked to time more directly than to space (as attested by Augustine's [[Apologetics|apologia]] on the role of Janus with respect to endings).<ref>Augustine CD VII 7.</ref>  Dario Sabbatucci has emphasised the temporal affiliation of Terminus, a reminder of which is found in the rite of the ''regifugium''.<ref>D. Sabbatucci above.</ref> \nG. Dum\u00e9zil, on the other hand, views the function of this god as associated with the legalistic aspect of the sovereign function of Jupiter. Terminus would be the counterpart of the minor Vedic god Bagha, who oversees the just and fair division of goods among citizens.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 186\u2013187.</ref>\n\n===Iuventas===\n{{See also|Iuventas}}\n\nAlong with ''Terminus'', '' Iuventas'' (also known as  ''Iuventus'' and ''Iuunta'') represents an aspect of Jupiter (as the legend of her refusal to leave the Capitol Hill demonstrates. Her name has the same root as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (from ''Iuu-'', \"young, youngster\"); the ceremonial litter bearing the sacred goose of Juno Moneta stopped before her ''sacellum'' on the festival of the goddess. Later, she was identified with the Greek [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]. The fact that Jupiter is related to the concept of youth is shown by his epithets ''Puer'', ''Iuuentus'' and ''Ioviste'' (interpreted as \"the youngest\" by some scholars).<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=135}}; G. Dumezil ''La relig. rom. arch.'' Paris 1974; It. tr. Milano 1977 pp. 185\u2013186; C. W. Atkins \"Latin 'Iouiste' et le vocabulaire religieux indoeurop\u00e9en\" in ''M\u00e9langes Benveniste'' Paris, 1975, pp. 527\u2013535.</ref> Dum\u00e9zil noted the presence of the two minor sovereign deities Bagha and [[Aryaman]] beside the Vedic sovereign gods Varuna and Mitra (though more closely associated with Mitra); the couple would be reflected in Rome by ''Terminus'' and ''Iuventas''. Aryaman is the god of young soldiers. The function of ''Iuventas'' is to protect the ''iuvenes'' (the ''novi togati'' of the year, who are required to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter on the Capitol)<ref>{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=135}}, citing Servius Danielis  ''Eclogae'' IV 50.</ref> and the Roman soldiers (a function later attributed to Juno). King Servius Tullius, in reforming the Roman social organisation, required that every adolescent offer a coin to the goddess of youth upon entering adulthood.<ref>Piso apud Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Rom. Antiquities'' IV 15, 5.</ref>\n\nIn Dum\u00e9zil's analysis, the function of ''Iuventas'' (the personification of youth), was to control the entrance of young men into society and protect them until they reach the age of ''iuvenes'' or ''iuniores'' (i.e. of serving the state as soldiers).<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 185\u2013186.</ref>\nA temple to ''Iuventas'' was promised in 207 BC by consul [[Marcus Livius Salinator]] and dedicated in 191 BC.<ref>Livy XXXV 36, 5.</ref>\n\n===Penates===\n{{See also|Penates}}\nThe Romans considered the Penates as the gods to whom they owed their own existence.<ref>Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4, 8\u20139 citing Varro: \"Per quos penitus spiramus\". Sabine Mac Cormack ''The Shadows of Poetry: Vergil in the Mind of Augustine'' University of California Press 1998 p. 77.</ref> As noted by Wissowa ''Penates'' is an adjective, meaning \"those of or from the ''penus''\" the innermost part, most hidden recess;<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above pp. 311\u2013312.</ref> Dum\u00e9zil though refuses Wissowa's interpretation of ''penus'' as the storeroom of a household. As a nation the Romans honoured the ''Penates publici'': Dionysius calls them ''Trojan gods'' as they were absorbed into the Trojan legend. They had a temple in Rome at the foot of the [[Velian Hill]], near the Palatine, in which they were represented as a couple of male youth. They were honoured every year by the new consuls before entering office at [[Lavinium]],<ref>Varro ''De Lingua Latina'' V 144; Plutarch ''Coriolanus'' XXIX 2; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4, 11; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' II 296: as cited by Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 313.</ref> because the Romans believed the Penates of that town were identical to their own.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ARR above p. 313.</ref>\n\nThe concept of ''di Penates'' is more defined in Etruria: [[Arnobius]] (citing a Caesius) states that the Etruscan Penates were named Fortuna, Ceres, Genius Iovialis and Pales; according to [[Nigidius Figulus]], they included those of Jupiter, of Neptune, of the infernal gods and of mortal men.<ref>Arnobius ''Adversus nationes'' III 40. Cf. also Lucan ''Pharsalia'' V 696; VII 705; VIII 21.</ref> According to Varro the Penates reside in the recesses of Heaven and are called ''Consentes'' and ''Complices'' by the Etruscans because they rise and set together, are twelve in number and their names are unknown, six male and six females and are the cousellors and masters of Jupiter. Martianus states they are always in agreement among themselves.<ref>Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40, 3; Martianus Capella ''De Nuptiis'' I 41: \"Senatores deorum qui Penates ferebantur Tonantis ipsius quorumque nomina, quoniam publicari secretum caeleste non pertulit, ex eo quod omnia pariter repromittunt, nomen eis consensione perficit\".</ref> While these last gods seem to be the Penates of Jupiter, Jupiter himself along with Juno and Minerva is one of the Penates of man according to some authors.<ref>Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40 4;  Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4 9.</ref>\n\nThis complex concept is reflected in Martianus Capella's division of heaven, found in Book I of his ''De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae'', which places the ''Di Consentes Penates'' in region I with the ''Favores Opertanei''; ''Ceres'' and ''Genius'' in region V; ''Pales'' in region VI; ''Favor'' and ''Genius'' (again) in region VII; ''Secundanus Pales'', ''Fortuna'' and ''Favor Pastor'' in region XI. The disposition of these divine entities and their repetition in different locations may be due to the fact that ''Penates'' belonging to different categories (of Jupiter in region I, earthly or of mortal men in region V) are intended. ''Favor(es)'' may be the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] masculine equivalent of ''Fortuna''.<ref>G\u00e9rard Capdeville \"Les dieux de Martianus Capella\" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''213''' 1996 3 p. 285 citing Carl Olof Thulin ''Die G\u00f6tter des Martianus Capella und der Bronzeleber von Piacenza'' (=RGVV 3. 1) Giessen 1906 pp. 38\u201339.

She was well-educated for a woman in her era, and knew French, Spanish, and Italian. She was a member of the Sidney/Essex circle from birth, through her father, first cousin to Sir [[Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Sidney]] and [[Mary Sidney|Mary, Countess of Pembroke]]; she was a close friend of Essex's sisters [[Penelope Blount, Countess of Devonshire|Penelope Rich]] and [[Dorothy Percy, Countess of Northumberland]], and the latter named one of her daughters Lucy after her.\n\nLucy Harington married [[Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford]], on 12 December 1594, when she was thirteen years old and he was twenty-two, at [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstan's on Stepney Green]].

The Bedford fortunes revived when the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] began in 1603. Several English nobles secretly sent representatives into Scotland to try to gain favour and court appointments.<ref>''Journal of Sir Roger Wilbraham'' (London, 1902), p. 55.</ref> The Countess of Bedford audaciously skipped the late queen's funeral and rode hard to the Scottish border, ahead of a party of gentlewomen appointed by the [[Privy Council]], and got an audience in Scotland with the new king's wife [[Anne of Denmark]]. The new queen immediately made her a [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] and she became a trusted confidant.<ref>John Leeds Barroll, ''Anna of Denmark, Queen of England'' (Philadelphia, 2001), pp. 43-45.</ref>\n\n==Masquing==\nBedford performed in several of the [[masque]]s staged at Court in the early 17th century, including ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]'', ''[[Hymenaei]]'', ''[[The Masque of Beauty]]'', ''[[The Masque of Queens]]'', and ''[[The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses]]''. In at least one instance, she functioned as a theatrical producer, instigating and organising the 1617 Court performance of [[Robert White (fl. 1617)|Robert White's]] masque ''Cupid's Banishment'', acted by students from the first English girls' school, the [[Ladies Hall]] in [[Deptford]].\n\n==Patron==\n'''Jonson'''<br>\nShe was a noted patron of [[Ben Jonson]], who dedicated his play ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' (1600) to her and addressed several of his ''Epigrams'' to her, extolling her patronage. By his own admission, Jonson portrayed her as Ethra in his lost pastoral, ''The May Lord'' \u2014 though he may also have depicted her as Lady Haughty, president of the Collegiates in [[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|''Epicene'']] (1609). When Jonson was imprisoned in 1605 for his role in the ''[[Eastward Ho]]'' scandal, he wrote a letter to an unknown lady, who is thought by some scholars to have been the Countess of Bedford.<ref>Joseph, p. 98.</ref>\n\n'''Others'''<br>\nIn addition to Jonson, Bedford supported other significant poets of her era, including [[Michael Drayton]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[George Chapman]], and [[John Donne]]. She might be the \"Idea\" of Drayton's pastoral ''Idea: The Shepherd's Garland'' (1593) and of his sonnet sequence ''Idea's Mirror'' (1594). Drayton dedicated his ''Mortimeriados'' (1594) to her, as Daniel did his ''Vision of the Twelve Goddesses'' (1604). Bedford patronised a range of lesser writers of her era, including the translator [[John Florio]], who credited her help in his translation of the essays of [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]. She \"received more dedications than any other woman associated with the drama\" in her era.<ref>Bergeron, p. 82.</ref>\n\nBedford was the godmother of Donne's second daughter, also named Lucy, and the namesake of Sir Henry Goodere's daughter (later wife of Sir Francis Nethersole). Donne seems to have been deeply involved with her on a psychological level \u2014 \"Most of the poems of Donne's middle years relate, in one way or another, to this glamorous and intriguing woman.\"<ref>Carey, p. xxvii.</ref> Her contradictions could be provocative: the Countess was a dedicated [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], and supported many Calvinist authors and thinkers \u2013 yet she allegedly performed bare-breasted in Court masques. Her relationships with some of her poets, including Donne and Drayton, were sometimes uneven; poets who dedicated their works to her could also complain of the loss of her favour.\n\nShe was also receptive to women poets, such as her cousin [[Cecily Bulstrode]]. Bedford occasionally wrote poems herself, including a poem Donne claims he saw in the garden of her Twickenham estate. Only one of her poems is extant, \"Death be not proud, thy hand gave not this blow\", an epitaph on Bulstrode. This poem has been attributed to Donne, and suggestively shares an opening clause with his [[Death Be Not Proud (poem)|Holy Sonnet X]]; nevertheless, it is now considered much more likely to be Bedford's poem. Bedford certainly wrote an elegy on the death of her cousin [[Bridget Markham]] at Twickenham Park in 1609.<ref>See external links.</ref>\n\nWhile best remembered for her patronage of writers, Bedford also supported musicians, [[John Dowland]] being a noteworthy example. She is the dedicatee of Dowland's ''[[Second Booke of Songes or Ayres|Second Book of Songs]]'' (1600).\n\nA few scholars have identified the Earl and Countess of Bedford as the allegorised couple in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]],'' who left \"no posterity\" (line 59) \u2014 yet since the poem was published in 1601, when the Countess was only twenty years old, the identification has struck others as unlikely.\n\n==Career==\nShe was a significant figure in the development of English country-house and garden design, centering on her estates at [[Twickenham Park]] and [[Moor Park (house)|Moor Park]]. An Italian writer [[Giacomo Castelvetro]] dedicated a book on fruit and vegetables to her.<ref>Joan Thirsk,''Food in Early Modern England'' (London, 2007), p. 67.</ref> She described her building and improvements at Moor Park in a letter to a friend; \"my works att the More, whear I have been a patcher this sommer and I am still adding some trifles of pleasure to that place I am so much love with, as I were so fond of any man I were in hard case.\"<ref>Lord Braybrooke, ''The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis'' (London, 1842), p. 48.</ref>\n\nAs one of the most influential women at James's court, she was also involved in a range of political issues; in the later part of the reign she was among the most prominent supporters of [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]], who had been brought up in her father's household at [[Coombe Abbey]]. In 1617 she was godmother of Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of [[Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun]] and Louisa Gordon whose mother [[Genevi\u00e8ve Petau de Maulette]] is said to have taught French to Elizabeth of Bohemia.

It is located some {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-west of the [[Kilometre Zero|centre of Paris]].\n\nNanterre serves as both the capital of the Hauts-de-Seine [[Departments of France|department]] and seat of the eponymous [[Arrondissement of Nanterre|arrondissement]].\n\nThe eastern part of Nanterre, bordering the communes of [[Courbevoie]] and [[Puteaux]], contains a small part of the [[La D\u00e9fense]] business district of Paris and some of the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region|tallest buildings in the Paris region]]. Because the headquarters of many major corporations are located in La D\u00e9fense, the court of Nanterre is well known in the media for the number of high-profile lawsuits and trials that take place in it. The city of Nanterre also includes the [[Paris West University Nanterre La D\u00e9fense]], one of the largest universities in the Paris region.\n\n==Name==\nThe name of Nanterre originated before the Roman conquest of [[Gaul]]. The Romans recorded the name as ''Nemetodorum''. It is composed of the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word ''nemeto'' meaning \"shrine\" or \"sacred place\" and the Celtic word ''duron'' (neuter) \"hard, tough, enduring\". The sacred place referred to is believed to have been a famous shrine that existed in ancient times.\n\nInhabitants of Nanterre are called \u201cNanterrien(ne)s\u201d or \"Nanterrois(es)\".\n\n==History==\nThe sacred shrine of antiquity that is referred to etymologically had been placed by tradition in [[Mont-Val\u00e9rien]]. However, archeological discoveries made between 1994 and 2005 found a Gallic necropolis which has been dated to the third century BC, and also call into debate both the exact location of the pre-Roman capital of the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] and the initial site of [[Lutetia]], the Roman era Paris.<ref>[http://www.nanterre.fr/NR/rdonlyres/C5BBAC82-4EF2-4C99-9090-C5E27E3C43FE/0/Expoarch%25C3%25A9ologiqueCdeQ.pdf Nanterre et les Parisii]{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The large necropolis, as well as working people's homes from some time later in the ancient era, is near the bank of the Seine, in the northwest of Nanterre, and might be the sacred place that is being referred to etymologically.  [[Lutetia]] is mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]] in 50 BCE, reporting an assembly in Lutetia in 53 BC between himself, commander of the Roman Legions, and local Gallic leaders.<ref name=Athena/> Although this had been thought to possibly be [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]], largely since Caesar mentions an island, the river at Nanterre follows two channels around an island. In 52 BC, the Parisii took up arms with the Gallic war leader [[Vercingetorix]], and were defeated by [[Titus Labienus]], one of Caesar's legates. Caesar mentions in his ''Commentarii'' that the Parisii destroyed the bridges and set fire to Lutetia before the arrival of the Roman forces. The archeological work in Nanterre has suggested over 15 hectares of pre-Roman or Roman era construction.
