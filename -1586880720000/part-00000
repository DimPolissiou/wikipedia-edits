Controversy between the traditional Hasidim and the modernising [[Haskalah|Maskilim]] which this school caused, resulted four years later in a victory for the latter, whereupon the institution received official recognition and was placed under communal control. Starting in 1863, the school policy was gradually modified by Polish influences, and very little attention was given to instruction in German. The ''[[Tempel f\u00fcr Geregelten Gottesdienst]]'', opened by [[Perl]] in 1819, also caused dissensions within the community, and its rabbi, [[Samuel Judah L\u00f6b Rapoport]], was forced to withdraw. This dispute also was eventually settled in favour of the Maskilim. As of 1905, the Jewish community numbered 14,000 in a total population of 30,415. Jews took control of the active import/export trade with Russia conducted through the border city of [[Pidvolochysk]]. In 1939, the Jewish population was 18,500.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Tarnopol |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/tarnopol |website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref>\n\n====The Holocaust====\nIn 1941, soon after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet positions]] in eastern Poland, 2,000 Jews were killed in a pogrom.<ref name=\"sztetl.org\"/>\n\nIn September 1941, the Germans announced the creation of the [[Tarnopol Ghetto]] for Jews still remaining in the city. In the winter of 1941\u201342, mortality in the ghetto escalated to such a degree that the ''[[Judenrat]]'' was forced to bury the dead in a common grave. Between August 1942 to June 1943 there were 5 \"selections\" that depleted the Jewish population of the ghetto by sending the Jews to [[Belzec extermination camp]]. A few hundred Jews from Tarnopol and its vicinity attempted to survive by hiding within the town limits. Many were denounced to the Germans, including some 200 people shortly before the Soviets liberated the area.

For the next 19 years, the ethnically mixed Ternopol area remained in Polish control.\n\nFrom 1922 to September 1939, Tarnopol served as the capital of the [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]] that consisted of 17 [[powiat]]s.

The Red Army entered eastern Poland in furtherance of the secret [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] and contrary to the [[Soviet\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact]]. Tarnopol was captured, renamed Ternopol, and incorporated into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] under [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopol Oblast]]. The Soviets made it their first priority to decimate Polish intelligentsia and destroy Polish culture. Ukrainian nationalist leaders were imprisoned. Mass arrests, torture and executions of Ukrainians and Poles followed. The Soviets also carried out mass deportations of the \"enemies of the working class\" to [[Kazakhstan]]. In practice, this translated into members of the former state administration, police, border service and land and business owners.<ref name=\"sztetl.org\">{{cite web | url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/pl/article/tarnopol/5,historia/?action=view&page=2 | title=Tarnopol | publisher=[[Virtual Shtetl]] (Wirtualny Sztetl) | work=Historia - Spo\u0142eczno\u015b\u0107 \u017cydowska przed 1989 | date=2015 | accessdate=31 July 2015 | authors=Robert Kuwa\u0142ek, Eugeniusz Riadczenko, Adam Dylewski, Justyna Filochowska, Micha\u0142 Czajka | pages=3\u20134 of 5 | language=Polish}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 July 1941, the city was occupied by the Nazis who led the Jewish pogrom,<ref name=\"sztetl.org\"/> and continued exterminating the population by creating the [[Tarnopol Ghetto]].

Nevertheless, [[Joseph Perl]] was able to continue his efforts to improve the condition of the Jews, which he had begun under the Russian rule. In 1813 he established a Jewish school which had as its chief object the instruction of Jewish youth in [[German language|German]] as well as in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and in various other subjects. Controversy between the traditional Hasidim and the modernising [[Haskalah|Maskilim]] which this school caused, resulted four years later in a victory for the latter, whereupon the institution received official recognition and was placed under communal control. Starting in 1863, the school policy was gradually modified by Polish influences, and very little attention was given to instruction in German. The ''[[Tempel f\u00fcr Geregelten Gottesdienst]]'', opened by [[Perl]] in 1819, also caused dissensions within the community, and its rabbi, [[Samuel Judah L\u00f6b Rapoport]], was forced to withdraw. This dispute also was eventually settled in favour of the Maskilim. As of 1905, the Jewish community numbered 14,000 in a total population of 30,415. Jews took control of the active import/export trade with Russia conducted through the border city of [[Pidvolochysk]]. In 1939, the Jewish population was 18,500.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Tarnopol |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/tarnopol |website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref>\n\n====The Holocaust====\nIn 1941, soon after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet positions]] in eastern Poland, 2,000 Jews were killed in a pogrom.<ref name=\"sztetl.org\"/>\n\nIn September 1941, the Germans announced the creation of the [[Tarnopol Ghetto]] for Jews still remaining in the city. In the winter of 1941\u201342, mortality in the ghetto escalated to such a degree that the ''[[Judenrat]]'' was forced to bury the dead in a common grave. Between August 1942 to June 1943 there were 5 \"selections\" that depleted the Jewish population of the ghetto by sending the Jews to [[Belzec extermination camp]]. A few hundred Jews from Tarnopol and its vicinity attempted to survive by hiding within the town limits. Many were denounced to the Germans, including some 200 people shortly before the Soviets liberated the area.

Since 2000 he lives as a freelance artist in [[Linz]]. 2005 he launched Gallery Artpark in Linz.\n\n== Work ==\nKielnhofer's most famous work is, \"[[Guardians of Time (Art)|Guardians of Time]]\". Drawing on religious and [[supernatural]] phenomena, the Guardians of Time are stone statues that are cloaked in hooded robes and situated to seem like they are moving forth in some kind of ritual. In some cases the figures stand alone; in other instances, they are grouped together as if whispering to each other. Kielnhofer places his statues in public places like ancient castles, old mines, plazas, and parks. They are installed and moved without fanfare, heightening the eerie, mystic aura they give off. The first of these mysterious figures was created in 2006. Since then, Kielnhofer continues to create and install these statues all over the world. In 2012, the artist created the first of a new series of miniature guardians out of plastic.<ref>[http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2011/02/guardians-time-mystic-sculpture-manfred-kielnhofer/] recalled at October 29, 2013</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Kielnhofer developed a new sort of 'act photographs', which involves the construction of a waterplate in his studio, where he can take photos of models sitting or lying down, likely on a mirror.\n\nIn 2010 he developed the concept of the [[Light Art Biennale Austria 2010]] with [[Martina Schettina]].<ref>[http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/kultur/art16,456017 Ulrike Breit in: Lichtkunst-Biennale: International und heimisch, leuchtend und blinkend, O\u00d6N Kultur] recalled at September 13, 2010</ref>\n\nThe Interlux-Chair, Kielnhofers artwork shown at the biennial, was registered in the design-database of the [[Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst Wien|MAK]], the Museum for Applied Arts in Vienna.<ref>[http://dip.mak.at/detail_product.php?designer_id=1868&search=%2Fsearchresult_product.php%3Fdesigner_id%3D1868%26amp%3Bstyle%3Dimage&object_id=7226&style=image MAK-Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst Wien] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706093430/http://dip.mak.at/detail_product.php?designer_id=1868&search=%2Fsearchresult_product.php%3Fdesigner_id=1868&amp%3Bstyle=image&object_id=7226&style=image |date=July 6, 2011 }}(recalled at September 30, 2010)</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Establishment of the first miniature guardian.

Since 2000 he lives as a freelance artist in [[Linz]]. 2005 he launched Gallery Artpark in Linz.\n\n== Work ==\nKielnhofer's most famous work is, \"[[Guardians of Time (Art)|Guardians of Time]]\". Drawing on religious and [[supernatural]] phenomena, the Guardians of Time are stone statues that are cloaked in hooded robes and situated to seem like they are moving forth in some kind of ritual. In some cases the figures stand alone; in other instances, they are grouped together as if whispering to each other. Kielnhofer places his statues in public places like ancient castles, old mines, plazas, and parks. They are installed and moved without fanfare, heightening the eerie, mystic aura they give off. The first of these mysterious figures was created in 2006. Since then, Kielnhofer continues to create and install these statues all over the world. In 2012, the artist created the first of a new series of miniature guardians out of plastic.<ref>[http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2011/02/guardians-time-mystic-sculpture-manfred-kielnhofer/] recalled at October 29, 2013</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Kielnhofer developed a new sort of 'act photographs', which involves the construction of a waterplate in his studio, where he can take photos of models sitting or lying down, likely on a mirror.\n\nIn 2010 he developed the concept of the [[Light Art Biennale Austria 2010]] with [[Martina Schettina]].<ref>[http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/kultur/art16,456017 Ulrike Breit in: Lichtkunst-Biennale: International und heimisch, leuchtend und blinkend, O\u00d6N Kultur] recalled at September 13, 2010</ref>\n\nThe Interlux-Chair, Kielnhofers artwork shown at the biennial, was registered in the design-database of the [[Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst Wien|MAK]], the Museum for Applied Arts in Vienna.<ref>[http://dip.mak.at/detail_product.php?designer_id=1868&search=%2Fsearchresult_product.php%3Fdesigner_id%3D1868%26amp%3Bstyle%3Dimage&object_id=7226&style=image MAK-Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst Wien] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706093430/http://dip.mak.at/detail_product.php?designer_id=1868&search=%2Fsearchresult_product.php%3Fdesigner_id=1868&amp%3Bstyle=image&object_id=7226&style=image |date=July 6, 2011 }}(recalled at September 30, 2010)</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Establishment of the first miniature guardian.
