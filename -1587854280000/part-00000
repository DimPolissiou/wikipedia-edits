It opened on 29 July 1945, taking over the [[longwave]] frequency which had earlier been used \u2013 prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939 \u2013 by the [[BBC National Programme]].\n\nThe service was intended as a domestic replacement for the [[World War II|wartime]] [[BBC General Forces Programme]] which had proved popular with civilian audiences in Britain as well as members of the armed forces.\n\n==History==\n\nThe longwave signal on 200 kHz/1500 metres was transmitted from [[Droitwich transmitting station|Droitwich]] in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] (as it still is today for [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], although adjusted slightly to 198 kHz/1515 metres in 1988), and gave fairly good coverage of most of the [[United Kingdom]], although a number of low-power mediumwave transmitters (using 1214 kHz/247 metres) were added later to fill in local blank spots. Over the course of the 1950s and 1960s, the Light Programme (along with the BBC's two other national programmes, the [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] and the [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]]) gradually became available on what was known at the time as VHF, as the BBC developed a network of local [[Frequency modulation|FM]] transmitters.\n\nFrom its first day of broadcasting in 1945 until Monday 2 September 1957, the Light Programme would be on the air from 9&nbsp;am until midnight each day, apart from Sundays when it would come on the air at 8&nbsp;am. From Monday 2 September 1957, the Light Programme's broadcasting hours would start to increase, with a new early morning start time of 7&nbsp;am, later moving to 6:30&nbsp;a.m. from Monday 29 September 1958. In 1964 broadcasting hours were increased even more, with a new morning start time of 5:30&nbsp;am from Monday 31 August 1964. Up until September 1964, the Light Programme would always end its broadcasting day at midnight, however this changed on Sunday 27 September 1964, when a new closedown time of 2:02&nbsp;a.m. was introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/light/1964-09-26|title=Light Programme - 26 September 1964 - BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/light/1957-09-02|title=Light Programme - 2 September 1957 - BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/light/1958-09-29|title=Light Programme - 29 September 1958 - BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/light/1945-07-29|title=Light Programme - 29 July 1945 - BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe Light Programme closed down for the last time at 2:02&nbsp;am on Friday 29 September 1967.

It was the world's first channel of its kind. It launched as ''Bid-Up.tv''. The channel was owned by [[Bid Shopping]].\n{{Toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n===Bid-Up.TV (2000\u20132005)===\nThe channel was launched by its parent company, Sit-Up Shopping, in October 2000. It originally broadcast 12 hours a day, much of which was pre-recorded, with auction graphics overlaid so people could bid. Bid later aired live broadcasts almost 18 hours a day, with recorded TV Shopping Network presentations during its downtime.\n\nThe channel amassed a cult-following as it spread across digital platforms. This popularity can be partly attributed to the use of [[David Dickinson]], ex-presenter of the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Bargain Hunt]]'', in various television advertising campaigns.\n\nIn June 2003, [[Bid Shopping|Sit-Up Shopping]] launched sister channel [[Price Drop|Price-Drop TV]].\n\nIn April 2004, a new system for bidding known as ''Best Bidding'' was introduced. All bids acted as proxy bidding, so instead of the bidder choosing the amount, the computer automatically entered an ''upto'' amount that would not exceed the value specified. At the end of the auction, everyone paid the same price as indicated in the on-screen \"auction arrow\", thus amounting to a [[uniform price auction]].\n\nEach item was advertised with a specific quantity, and a ''bid-up from'' price triangle. Customers phoned in and bid up from the particular amount. The quantity was used to determine which customers 'won' the auction. For example, if 50 items were available, then the top 50 bidders would win the auction.\n\nIn August 2004, the channel had an \"Auction Choice\" month, during which they featured both rising and falling price auction hours. The falling price auctions continued after this month and are now the only common auction format on the channel.\n\nPrior to December 2004, each item also had a \"guide price\", described as the manufacturer's [[suggested retail price|recommended retail price]] or an average of prices from other retailers. However, these were removed following the collapse of shopping channel [[Auction World.tv]], which was criticised for advertising misleading guide prices.\n\n===Bid TV (2005\u20132011)===\n[[File:Bidtv.svg|thumb|Bid TV logo used from 21 January 2005 until 1 August 2011.]]\nOn 21 January 2005, the channel was rebranded Bid TV to reflect the fact that more of its auctions followed the [[Price Drop|Price-Drop TV]] format, meaning that bidders were only rarely bidding \"up\". Bid TV no longer offered rising-price auctions. A new graphic was added in October 2005 to show the start price of falling price auctions.\n\nWhen the channel originally launched, one of the most popular features was the relaxed style in which the presenters and assistants interacted with each other. For instance, the presenter whose shift was starting would come on air for the last few minutes of the previous presenter's shift. However, although still relaxed, this presenter interaction seems to have been stopped with the launch of Bid TV. Despite the fact that they no longer used an auction hall theme, the presenters exclusively refer to the products they sell as 'lots' and to their customers as 'bidders'. When referring to the next item to be sold the presenters and assistants would say \"Closing next...\"\n\nIn early 2006 the website was overhauled in an attempt to increase its user-friendliness and overall aesthetic appeal. Its new design was inspired by that of [[eBay]], the world's most popular auction website, in an attempt to capitalise on its popularity. On 10 May, the on-screen graphics were changed so that products are now sold in pounds and pence, as opposed to just pounds, a change previously incorporated into [[Price Drop|Price-Drop TV]]. In August, a new graphic was introduced, showing Bid TV's website address and a ''falling arrow''. This was shown as soon as the assistant has shown what is coming up next, and introduces the presenter.\n\nIn August 2007, they began to sell products with choices. On certain products (often bedding or clothes) the customer was able to choose the size or colour by pressing a telephone button. The graphics for these auctions are different, showing the start price, the current price, the quantity of the 'main' choice and a list of options. When the main choice item is sold out, the price is locked and is what everyone pays regardless of their bid. If another choice is selling faster, then 'limited' appears next to its name and the name vanishes when it sells out.\n\nAs a celebration for Bid TV's 7th birthday, in September and October 2007, the channel held a six weekend megadrop promotion where at least one product each hour between 8pm on Friday and 1am on Sunday was sold for \u00a31 plus postage. They have run similar promotions in the past, but this was the first time that Bid TV used the [[Price Drop|Price-Drop TV]] name Megadrop.\n\nIn January 2008 In order to promote the sister channels of Bid TV, Price-Drop TV and Speed-Auction TV, a small preview of what was on sale on each channel was displayed before each auction began. On 21 June, the channel removed the former graphic displaying the channel name, and replaced this with the web address. In September all three Sit-Up channels removed start-prices from their graphics. However, they still appeared on the websites.\n\n====10th birthday====\nOn 5 October 2010, Bid TV celebrated its 10th birthday. As part of the celebrations and further expansion of the Sit-Up Shopping channels, a \u00a35 Million Warehouse Clearance event took place from 16 August 2010 for six weeks, following the announcement that the company is relocating its warehouse in [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] to a larger one. The studios of all three channels received new looks from 6 October 2010. On 3 October host Peter Simon stated that the studio was to be demolished in a few hours time, and that live broadcast would be filmed from the [[Bid Plus|Speed Auction TV]] studio (complete with yellow/black striped construction tape and brown dust-sheets as a backdrop this was to fit in with the theme of Bid TV's studio being under construction) until the new studio was ready to broadcast in on 6 October.\n\nOn 6 October, Bid TV continued to celebrate. The broadcast carried on as usual in the temporary studio (that was normally used for Speed Auction TV), switching to the new look studio from 6pm onwards. The on-screen graphics were replaced.\n\n===Bid (2011\u20132014)===\n[[File:Bid logo.svg|thumb|right|175px|Bid logo used from 1 August 2011 until 10 March 2014.]]\nOn 1 August 2011, 'Bid TV' changed its name to 'Bid' dropping the 'TV' part of their name. Along with the new name, new buying graphics were introduced on all Bid Shopping channels and new idents compromising of 3D products flying around the new logo designs were shown. The new design was created to make buying easier for the viewer. Multi-buy was introduced on certain products where the viewer can select to buy more than one product at the same time (P&P is still applied to each item). Bid in this form ended on 10 March.\n\n===Shop at Bid and closure (2014)===\nOn 10 March 2014, Bid rebranded into 'Shop at Bid' - a new format including a fixed price dynamic that ended the falling price approach. A new premium rate number was introduced which cost 20p per minute as opposed to the previous \u00a31.53 (per call). The buying process changed to allow viewers to speak to an advisor after purchase and did not require a call back.\n\nThis change lasted just over one month. On 17 April 2014, [[Bid Shopping]], the channel's owner, went into administration; Shop at Bid and its sister channel [[Price Drop]] were closed down with immediate effect, costing 229 jobs. Websites were pulled offline, and a technical fault card appeared on the channels. On 23 April 2014, the Bid and Price Drop websites were updated and the channels were pulled from [[Virgin Media]]. The channels were removed from [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] and [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] on 25 April 2014. On Virgin Media and Sky, Shop At Bid's EPG is blank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retail-week.com/topics/marketing/tv-channel-sit-up-falls-into-administration-despite-passing-cva-last-month/5059530.article?blocktitle=Latest-news-&-analysis&contentID=13145 |title=TV channel Sit-Up falls into administration despite passing CVA last month |publisher=[[Retail Week]] |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kpmg.com/UK/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/NewsReleases/Pages/Administrators-appointed-to-sit-up-Limited.aspx |title=Administrators appointed to sit-up Limited |publisher=[[KPMG]] |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nFor much of its life Bid used a premium phone rate charge of \u00a31.53 per call for bidding. Additionally, shipping and handling cost at least \u00a37.99 for all items (as mentioned on-screen). Thus, each item cost at least \u00a39.52 more than the most prominently displayed price. Customers were also able to place bids for items on the website (providing they were registered) so as to avoid the initial \u00a31.53 charge, but not postage and packaging.\n\nThe ASA upheld complaints against Bid on two separate occasions. In the most serious case, they ruled that Bid TV had overestimated the guide price of \u00a31,700 for \"Black Agate Globes\"; \"Bid-Up could only provide proof of one supplier that may have sold the globe for \u00a31,700\". In fact, one supplier who Bid TV claimed sold the item for \u00a31,700 actually offered to sell the item for \u00a3265 with most companies offering the globe for considerably less than \u00a31,700: \"between \u00a3250 and \u00a3500\". Bid was therefore found in breach of ASA broadcasting codes for providing inaccurate pricing.\n\nIn 2009, Bid TV attracted attention in the press and on internet forums following an incident where the same host, Paul Evers, appeared on both Bid TV and Price-Drop TV at the same time, fronting two different auctions, both apparently 'live'. Sit-Up's chief executive Ian Percival explained the situation by saying \"We are experimenting by using recorded video of a sale but playing it out with a live auction. The price and the quantity are live - as shown on the graphics - but the video is pre-recorded. We've only done it a couple of times before.\" A subsequent press report stated that these recorded auctions would be scrapped following complaints and a possible ASA investigation. Sit-Up's head of presentation Andy Hodgson said \"We have done it a couple of times and have no firm plans to do it again.\" However, Sit-Up's channels have in fact routinely featured these so-called \"graphic led\" pre-recorded auctions since launch. A mix-up in one of these auctions in 2002 led to a complaint being upheld by the ITC.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nOn 21 May 2013, it was announced that the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) had referred Sit-Up Limited, who operate Bid to [[Ofcom]] for consideration of statutory sanctions following repeated breaches of the UK Code of Broadcast Advertising. Ofcom confirmed that it had accepted the referral. Since January 2012, 33 ASA cases ruled against Sit-Up Limited. The two main types of problem were misleading pricing claims and misleading product descriptions.\n\n==Past presenters==\n* Paul Becque\n* [[Kevin Duala]]\n* Elisa Foreman\n* Adam Freeman\n* Nicola George\n* [[Keith Harris (ventriloquist)|Keith Harris]] (2005\u20132006)\n* Justin Hazell\n* [[Andy Hodgson]]\n* Caroline Lyndsay\n* Mark Ryes\n* Greg Scott\n* Adele Sica\n* [[Peter Simon (presenter)|Peter Simon]]\n* Paul Ross\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bid Plus]]\n* [[Bid Shopping]]\n* [[Price Drop]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Bid Shopping}}\n{{Freeview}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shop at Bid}}\n[[Category:Bid Shopping]]\n[[Category:Shopping networks in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 2000]]\n[[Category:2000 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2014]]\n[[Category:2014 disestablishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Defunct British television channels]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2014}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox TV channel\n| name              = Shop at Bid\n| logofile          =\n| logosize          =\n| launch            = {{start date|2000|10|5|df=y}}\n| closed date       = {{end date|2014|4|17|df=y}}<br>({{age in years and days|2000|10|5|2014|4|17}})\n| picture format    = [[16:9]], [[576i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n| owner             = [[Bid Shopping]]\n| country           = [[United Kingdom]]\n| broadcast area    = United Kingdom\n| former names      = Bid-Up.TV (2000\u20132005)<br>Bid TV (2005\u20132011)<br>Bid (2011\u20132014)\n| sister names      = [[Price Drop]]\n| availability note = <br>(at time of closure)\n| terr serv 1       = [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]\n| terr chan 1       = Channel 23\n| sat serv 1        = [[Freesat]]\n| sat chan 1        = Channel 802\n| sat serv 2        = [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]]\n| sat chan 2        = Channel 645\n| sat serv 3        = [[Eutelsat 28A]]\n| sat chan 3        = 11426 V 27500 2/3\n| cable serv 1      = [[Virgin Media]]\n| cable chan 1      = Channel 745\n| cable serv 2      = [[Smallworld Cable]]\n| cable chan 2      = Channel 703\n| cable serv 3      = [[WightFibre]]\n| cable chan 3      = Channel 42\n}}\n\n'''Shop at Bid''' was a British television shopping channel that ran daily auctions and later fixed price demonstrations.

The on-screen graphics were replaced.\n\n===Bid (2011\u20132014)===\n[[File:Bid logo.svg|thumb|right|175px|Bid logo used from 1 August 2011 until 10 March 2014.]]\nOn 1 August 2011, 'Bid TV' changed its name to 'Bid' dropping the 'TV' part of their name. Along with the new name, new buying graphics were introduced on all Bid Shopping channels and new idents compromising of 3D products flying around the new logo designs were shown. The new design was created to make buying easier for the viewer. Multi-buy was introduced on certain products where the viewer can select to buy more than one product at the same time (P&P is still applied to each item). Bid in this form ended on 10 March.\n\n===Shop at Bid and closure (2014)===\nOn 10 March 2014, Bid rebranded into 'Shop at Bid' - a new format including a fixed price dynamic that ended the falling price approach. A new premium rate number was introduced which cost 20p per minute as opposed to the previous \u00a31.53 (per call). The buying process changed to allow viewers to speak to an advisor after purchase and did not require a call back.\n\nThis change lasted just over one month. On 17 April 2014, [[Bid Shopping]], the channel's owner, went into administration; Shop at Bid and its sister channel [[Price Drop]] were closed down with immediate effect, costing 229 jobs. Websites were pulled offline, and a technical fault card appeared on the channels. On 23 April 2014, the Bid and Price Drop websites were updated and the channels were pulled from [[Virgin Media]]. The channels were removed from [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] and [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] on 25 April 2014. On Virgin Media and Sky, Shop At Bid's EPG is blank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retail-week.com/topics/marketing/tv-channel-sit-up-falls-into-administration-despite-passing-cva-last-month/5059530.article?blocktitle=Latest-news-&-analysis&contentID=13145 |title=TV channel Sit-Up falls into administration despite passing CVA last month |publisher=[[Retail Week]] |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kpmg.com/UK/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/NewsReleases/Pages/Administrators-appointed-to-sit-up-Limited.aspx |title=Administrators appointed to sit-up Limited |publisher=[[KPMG]] |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nFor much of its life Bid used a premium phone rate charge of \u00a31.53 per call for bidding. Additionally, shipping and handling cost at least \u00a37.99 for all items (as mentioned on-screen). Thus, each item cost at least \u00a39.52 more than the most prominently displayed price. Customers were also able to place bids for items on the website (providing they were registered) so as to avoid the initial \u00a31.53 charge, but not postage and packaging.\n\nThe ASA upheld complaints against Bid on two separate occasions. In the most serious case, they ruled that Bid TV had overestimated the guide price of \u00a31,700 for \"Black Agate Globes\"; \"Bid-Up could only provide proof of one supplier that may have sold the globe for \u00a31,700\". In fact, one supplier who Bid TV claimed sold the item for \u00a31,700 actually offered to sell the item for \u00a3265 with most companies offering the globe for considerably less than \u00a31,700: \"between \u00a3250 and \u00a3500\". Bid was therefore found in breach of ASA broadcasting codes for providing inaccurate pricing.\n\nIn 2009, Bid TV attracted attention in the press and on internet forums following an incident where the same host, Paul Evers, appeared on both Bid TV and Price-Drop TV at the same time, fronting two different auctions, both apparently 'live'. Sit-Up's chief executive Ian Percival explained the situation by saying \"We are experimenting by using recorded video of a sale but playing it out with a live auction. The price and the quantity are live - as shown on the graphics - but the video is pre-recorded. We've only done it a couple of times before.\" A subsequent press report stated that these recorded auctions would be scrapped following complaints and a possible ASA investigation. Sit-Up's head of presentation Andy Hodgson said \"We have done it a couple of times and have no firm plans to do it again.\" However, Sit-Up's channels have in fact routinely featured these so-called \"graphic led\" pre-recorded auctions since launch. A mix-up in one of these auctions in 2002 led to a complaint being upheld by the ITC.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nOn 21 May 2013, it was announced that the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) had referred Sit-Up Limited, who operate Bid to [[Ofcom]] for consideration of statutory sanctions following repeated breaches of the UK Code of Broadcast Advertising. Ofcom confirmed that it had accepted the referral. Since January 2012, 33 ASA cases ruled against Sit-Up Limited. The two main types of problem were misleading pricing claims and misleading product descriptions.\n\n==Past presenters==\n* Paul Becque\n* [[Kevin Duala]]\n* Elisa Foreman\n* Adam Freeman\n* Nicola George\n* [[Keith Harris (ventriloquist)|Keith Harris]] (2005\u20132006)\n* Justin Hazell\n* [[Andy Hodgson]]\n* Caroline Lyndsay\n* Mark Ryes\n* Greg Scott\n* Adele Sica\n* [[Peter Simon (presenter)|Peter Simon]]\n* Paul Ross\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bid Plus]]\n* [[Bid Shopping]]\n* [[Price Drop]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Bid Shopping}}\n{{Freeview}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shop at Bid}}\n[[Category:Bid Shopping]]\n[[Category:Shopping networks in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 2000]]\n[[Category:2000 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2014]]\n[[Category:2014 disestablishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Defunct British television channels]]\n", "name_user": "86.147.0.130", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shop_at_Bid"}

He is based in [[Biel/Bienne]] ([[Switzerland]]) since the late 1990s. \n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name = \n| background = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| image = Acc jk 4.jpg\n| l\u00e9gende = Jonas Kocher 2014\n| caption = \n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1977|08|22}}\n| birth_place = [[Nyon]], Switzerland\n| genre = [[Free improvisation]], [[experimental music]]\n| occupation = Musician, composer\n| instrument = Accordion\n| website = {{url|jonaskocher.net}}\n}}\n\n== Biography ==\nComposer and [[accordionist]], Jonas Kocher followed his musical studies at the University of the Arts in [[Bern]] between 1996 and 2004 with Teodoro Anzellotti, Pierre Sublet and [[Georges Aperghis]]. He soon developed a keen interest in experimental practices in sound and performance, which led him to explore musical theater as a performer in productions by [[:de:Ruedi H\u00e4usermann|Ruedy H\u00e4usermann]] and [[:de:Daniel Ott|Daniel Ott]] and electronic music in the BlindeKinder duo. Since 2003 he has been creating his own pieces of composed theatre, various sound performances and he also dedicates himself to composition and free improvisation. Starting from 2006 and for a few years, he has worked closely with Association Rue du Nord ([[Lausanne]]).\n\nSince 2008, he has performed as accordionist with regular partners such as [[:de:Jacques Demierre|Jacques Demierre]], [[:de:Axel D\u00f6rner|Axel D\u00f6rner]], [[:de: Joke Lanz|Joke Lanz]], Christian Wolfarth, Gaudenz Badrutt, [[:fr:Michel Doneda|Michel Doneda]], Chris Heenan, [[:de: Christof Kurzmann|Christof Kurzmann]], [[:pl:Alfredo Costa Monteiro|Alfredo Costa Monteiro]] (in the accordion trio 300 basses with [[:de:Luca Venitucci|Luca Venitucci]]), [[Leonel Kaplan]], [[:de:Hans Koch (Holzbl\u00e4ser)|Hans Koch]], [[Burkhard Beins]], [[Radu Malfatti]], [[Ilan Manouach]], [[:de:Andy Guhl|Andy Guhl]] and many others. His musical activity has led him to perform throughout Europe and in Russia, Japan and the USA and to collaborate with dancers and visual artists.\n\nAs interpreter, he encourages collaborations with musicians and composers such as Christian Kesten, Stefan Thut, [[Antoine Chessex]], Chiyoko Szlavnics or [[Radu Malfatti]]. If his practice of improvisation seems to contrast with his parallel interest in composition and sound performance, it is only because the creative dimension of these areas is not taken into account in its entirety; this is an area where Jonas Kocher sees a field of privileged artistic experimentation and where listening, sound and space are constantly explored.\n\nAs a composer, he has produced works that range between composed theatre, installations and concert pieces.

He soon developed a keen interest in experimental practices in sound and performance, which led him to explore musical theater as a performer in productions by [[:de:Ruedi H\u00e4usermann|Ruedy H\u00e4usermann]] and [[:de:Daniel Ott|Daniel Ott]] and electronic music in the BlindeKinder duo. Since 2003 he has been creating his own pieces of composed theatre, various sound performances and he also dedicates himself to composition and free improvisation. Starting from 2006 and for a few years, he has worked closely with Association Rue du Nord ([[Lausanne]]).\n\nSince 2008, he has performed as accordionist with regular partners such as [[:de:Jacques Demierre|Jacques Demierre]], [[:de:Axel D\u00f6rner|Axel D\u00f6rner]], [[:de: Joke Lanz|Joke Lanz]], Christian Wolfarth, Gaudenz Badrutt, [[:fr:Michel Doneda|Michel Doneda]], Chris Heenan, [[:de: Christof Kurzmann|Christof Kurzmann]], [[:pl:Alfredo Costa Monteiro|Alfredo Costa Monteiro]] (in the accordion trio 300 basses with [[:de:Luca Venitucci|Luca Venitucci]]), [[Leonel Kaplan]], [[:de:Hans Koch (Holzbl\u00e4ser)|Hans Koch]], [[Burkhard Beins]], [[Radu Malfatti]], [[Ilan Manouach]], [[:de:Andy Guhl|Andy Guhl]] and many others. His musical activity has led him to perform throughout Europe and in Russia, Japan and the USA and to collaborate with dancers and visual artists.\n\nAs interpreter, he encourages collaborations with musicians and composers such as Christian Kesten, Stefan Thut, [[Antoine Chessex]], Chiyoko Szlavnics or [[Radu Malfatti]]. If his practice of improvisation seems to contrast with his parallel interest in composition and sound performance, it is only because the creative dimension of these areas is not taken into account in its entirety; this is an area where Jonas Kocher sees a field of privileged artistic experimentation and where listening, sound and space are constantly explored.\n\nAs a composer, he has produced works that range between composed theatre, installations and concert pieces. He has composed occasionally for [[Radio drama|audio drama]], dance and theater. Jonas Kocher is active as an organizer of concerts in Switzerland and elsewhere and he is running BRUIT, a platform dedicated to experimental sound practices.\n\nIn 2005 he received the Art award of the city of [[Nyon]] and in 2010 the prize of recognition of the music committee of the [[Canton of Bern]]e. His works have been performed at the Biennale Bern 2010, Musikfestival Bern 2017 and 2018, Umlaut festival Berlin, the Jardins Musicaux festival of Cernier, the Forge London, the Zagreb Biennale, SMC Lausanne, Thessaloniki Art Biennale, etc.\n\n== Works ==\n* 2019: ''Perspectives and echoes'', for 6 players (percussion, live electronics and four instruments)\n* 2018: ''Avec Bataille'', performance for 7 participants with headphones and one improvising musician\n* 2018: ''HOME (M\u00fcnstergasse 37)'', in situ sound performance for 4 musicians and 2 actors\n* 2017: ''Irrlicht'', for loudspeakers and four performers in a resonant space\n* 2017: ''Rough'', for 10 musicians\n* 2015: ''h\u00e1los'', for harp solo\n* 2015: ''Intervention No. 2 [pasquart]'', in situ sound performance\n* 2015: ''Intervention No. 1 [cave12]'', in situ sound performance\n* 2013: ''Hornussen'', in situ sound performance\n* 2013: ''Nichi Nichi Kore Ko Nichi'', sound performance\n* 2012: ''Commedia'', for piano, clarinet, violin, vcello and pre-recorded sounds\n* 2011: ''Agitations (Adagio)'', for small symphony orchestra (young interpreters) and pre-recorded sounds\n* 2010: ''Frictions'', musical theater\n* 2010: ''Promenade \u00e0 travers une \u0153uvre'', in situ sound performance\n* 2010: ''Grrrrr!!'', for string quartet (young interpreters)\n* 2009: ''Serge'', for ensemble\n* 2008: ''3 ombres'', for ensemble (three compositions intended to be played with Pierrot Lunaire of A.

Additionally, in the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Chronicle'' by [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]] (1454), ''Amadis'' is attributed to [[Vasco de Lobeira]], who was knighted after the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]] (1385). However, although other sources claim that the work was, in fact, a copy of one [[Jo\u00e3o de Lobeira]], not [[troubadour]] Vasco de Lobeira, and that it was a translation into Castilian Spanish of an earlier work, probably from the beginning of the 14th century, no primitive version in the original Portuguese is known. The inspiration for the \"Amadis de Gaula\" appears to be the blocked marriage of [[Constance of Aragon, Lady of Villena|Infanta Constanza of Aragon]] with [[Henry of Castile the Senator|Henry of Castile]] in 1260 (see [[Don Juan Manuel]]'s ''{{ill|Libro de las tres razones|es}}'' of 1335), as blocked was also Oriana's marriage to Amadis. A more recent opinion attributes \"Amadis\" to Henry of Castile and Le\u00f3n, due to evidence linking his biography with the events in \"Amadis\". Henry of Castile died in 1305.\n\nIn his introduction to the text, Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo explains that he has edited the first three books of a text in circulation since the 14th century. Montalvo also admits to adding a fourth as yet unpublished book as well as adding a continuation, ''[[Las sergas de Esplandi\u00e1n]]'', which he claims was found in a buried chest in [[Constantinople]] and transported to Spain by a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] merchant (the famous motif of the [[false document|found manuscript]]).\n\n''Amad\u00eds de Gaula'' was [[Don Quixote]]'s favorite book.\n\n==Characters and plot==\nThe story narrates the [[star-crossed]] love of King Peri\u00f3n of Gaula and Elisena of England, resulting in the secret birth of Amad\u00eds. The place called ''Gaula'' is a fictional kingdom within Brittany. It has in the past been identified with Wales or France, but it is best understood as a completely legendary place.<ref name=Place>{{cite article\n|first=Edwin\n|last=Place\n|title=Amadis of Gaul, Wales, or What?\n|journal=[[Hispanic Review]]\n|volume=23\n|year=1955\n|pages=99\u2013107}}</ref>\n\n[[Child abandonment|Abandoned]] at birth on a raft in England, the child is raised by the knight Gandales in Scotland and investigates his origins through fantastic adventures.\n\nHe is persecuted by the wizard Arcal\u00e1us, but protected by Urganda la Desconocida (Urganda the Unknown or Unrecognized), an ambiguous priestess with magical powers and a talent for prophecy. Knighted by his father King Peri\u00f3n, Amad\u00eds overcomes the challenges of the enchanted \u00cdnsola Firme (a sort of peninsula), including passing through the Arch of Faithful Lovers.\n\nDespite Amad\u00eds' celebrated fidelity, his childhood sweetheart, Oriana, heiress to the throne of Great Britain, becomes jealous of a rival princess and sends a letter to chastise Amad\u00eds. The knight  changes his name to Beltenebros and indulges in a long period of madness on the isolated Pe\u00f1a Pobre (Poor Peak or Mountain).\n\nHe recovers his senses only when Oriana sends her maid to retrieve him. He then helps Oriana's father, Lisuarte, repel invaders. A short time later he and Oriana scandalously consummate their love. Their son Esplandi\u00e1n is the result of this one illicit meeting.\n\nRodr\u00edguez de Montalvo asserts{{where|date=September 2019}} that in the \"original\" ''Amad\u00eds'', Esplandi\u00e1n eventually kills his father for this offense against his mother's honor; however, Montalvo amends this defect and resolves their conflict peaceably.\n\nOriana and Amad\u00eds defer their marriage for many years due to enmity between Amad\u00eds and Oriana's father Lisuarte. Amad\u00eds absents himself from Britain for at least ten years, masquerading as \"The Knight of the Green Sword\". He travels as far as Constantinople and secures the favor of the child-princess Leonorina, who will become Esplandi\u00e1n's wife. His most famous adventure during this time of exile is the battle with the giant Endriago, a monster born of incest who exhales a poisonous reek and whose body is covered in scales.\n\nAs a knight, Amad\u00eds is [[courteous]], gentle, sensitive, and a Christian, who dares to defend free love.{{dubious|date=September 2019}} Unlike most literary heroes of his time (French and German, for example), Amad\u00eds is a handsome man who would cry if refused by his lady, but is invincible in battle and usually emerges drenched in his own and his opponent's blood.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Literary significance==\nCalled also ''Amad\u00eds sin tiempo'' (Amadis without Time) by his mother (in allusion to the fact that being conceived outside marriage she would have to abandon him and he would probably die), he is the most representative [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] hero of [[chivalric romance]]. His adventures ran to four volumes, probably the most popular such tales of their time. [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Noue]], one of the Huguenot captains of the 16th century, affirmed that reading the romances of Amadis had caused a \"spirit of vertigo\"<ref>\"Un espirit de vertige\"; noted in [[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919) 1924:68.</ref> even in his more rationally-minded generation. The books show a complete idealization and simplification of knight-errantry. Even servants are hardly heard of, but there are many princesses, ladies and kings. Knights and [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]] are found everywhere. The book's style is reasonably modern, but lacks dialogue and the character's impressions, mostly describing the action.\n\nThe book's [[literary genre|style]] was praised by the usually demanding [[Juan de Vald\u00e9s]], although he considered that from time to time it was too low or too high a style. The language is characterized by a certain \"Latinizing\" influence in its [[syntax]], especially the tendency to place the [[verb]] at the end of the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]; as well as other such details, such as the use of the [[present participle]], which bring ''Amad\u00eds'' into line with the [[allegory|allegorical]] style of the 15th century.\n\nNevertheless, there is a breach of style when Garci Rodriguez de Montalvo presents the fourth book. It becomes dull and solemn, reflecting the nature of the intruding writer. The first three books are inspired in deeds and feats by knights-errant, dating back to the 13th century, while the fourth book emerges as a less brilliant attachment of the 15th century. The pristine style of \"Amad\u00eds\" can be perceived in the few original famous pages analyzed by Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Mo\u00f1ino: It is lively and straight to the facts of war and love, with brief dialogs, all quite elegant and amusing. ''Amad\u00eds of Gaula'' is frequently referenced in the humorous classic ''Don Quixote'', written by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] in the early 17th century. The character Don Quixote idolizes Amad\u00eds and tries to imitate him.\n\nHistorically, ''Amad\u00eds'' was very influential amongst the Spanish [[conquistador]]es. [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] mentioned the wonders of ''Amad\u00eds'' when he marveled at his first sight of [[Tenochtitlan]] (modern Mexico City) \u2013 and such place names as [[Origin of the name California|California]] come directly from the work.\n\n==Origins==\nAs mentioned above, the origins of the book of Amad\u00eds are disputed.\n\n===The existing texts===\n====The version of Montalvo====\nThe only known complete text of ''Amad\u00eds de Gaula'' is that of Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo, a Castilian writer. The earliest surviving text (book) is from 1508, although scholars accept that there were earlier editions.\n\nIf this text had been based on a Portuguese original, there would be linguistic evidence in the text. As there is none, the text of Montalvo must have been written in Castilian.\n\n====Manuscript fragments====\nThe only known manuscript are the 15th-century fragments found in a book binding (a discarded manuscript, in this case Amad\u00eds, was used as raw material for binding another book), and identified and published by {{ill|Antonio Rodr\u00edguez-Mo\u00f1ino|es}}.\n\nHe claimed sole ownership only of Book IV. The existence of a prior version of Books I to III has been supported by Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Mo\u00f1ino's identification of four 15th-century manuscript fragments (ca. 1420). The name \"Esplandi\u00e1n\" is clearly visible in one of these. The fragments belong to the collection of the [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. They show that contrary to the usual view that Montalvo expanded the first three books, they show that he abbreviated them.<ref name=Mo\u00f1ino>{{cite book\n|first=Antonio\n|last=Rodr\u00edguez-Mo\u00f1ino\n|title=El primer manuscrito del ''Amad\u00eds de Gaula''.

Egidio Colonna was in Rome in 1267 when Henry of Castile was elected Senator. The translation was made around 1350 under King Peter the Cruel. This is the oldest mention of ''Amad\u00eds''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Sequels in Spanish==\n''Amadis of Gaul's'' popularity was such that in the decades following its publication, dozens of [[sequel]]s of sometimes minor quality were published in Spanish, Italian, and German, together with a number of other imitative works. Montalvo himself cashed in with the continuation ''[[Las sergas de Esplandi\u00e1n]]'' (Book V), and the sequel-specialist [[Feliciano de Silva]] (also the author of ''Second Celestina'') added four more books including [[Amadis of Greece]] (Book IX). [[Miguel de Cervantes]] wrote ''[[Don Quixote]]'' as a burlesque attack on the resulting genre.

Additionally, in the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Chronicle'' by [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]] (1454), ''Amadis'' is attributed to [[Vasco de Lobeira]], who was knighted after the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]] (1385). However, although other sources claim that the work was, in fact, a copy of one [[Jo\u00e3o de Lobeira]], not [[troubadour]] Vasco de Lobeira, and that it was a translation into Castilian Spanish of an earlier work, probably from the beginning of the 14th century, no primitive version in the original Portuguese is known. The inspiration for the \"Amadis de Gaula\" appears to be the blocked marriage of [[Constance of Aragon, Lady of Villena|Infanta Constanza of Aragon]] with [[Henry of Castile the Senator|Henry of Castile]] in 1260 (see [[Don Juan Manuel]]'s ''{{ill|Libro de las tres razones|es}}'' of 1335), as blocked was also Oriana's marriage to Amadis. A more recent opinion attributes \"Amadis\" to Henry of Castile and Le\u00f3n, due to evidence linking his biography with the events in \"Amadis\". Henry of Castile died in 1305.\n\nIn his introduction to the text, Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo explains that he has edited the first three books of a text in circulation since the 14th century. Montalvo also admits to adding a fourth as yet unpublished book as well as adding a continuation, ''[[Las sergas de Esplandi\u00e1n]]'', which he claims was found in a buried chest in [[Constantinople]] and transported to Spain by a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] merchant (the famous motif of the [[false document|found manuscript]]).\n\n''Amad\u00eds de Gaula'' was [[Don Quixote]]'s favorite book.\n\n==Characters and plot==\nThe story narrates the [[star-crossed]] love of King Peri\u00f3n of Gaula and Elisena of England, resulting in the secret birth of Amad\u00eds. The place called ''Gaula'' is a fictional kingdom within Brittany. It has in the past been identified with Wales or France, but it is best understood as a completely legendary place.<ref name=Place>{{cite article\n|first=Edwin\n|last=Place\n|title=Amadis of Gaul, Wales, or What?\n|journal=[[Hispanic Review]]\n|volume=23\n|year=1955\n|pages=99\u2013107}}</ref>\n\n[[Child abandonment|Abandoned]] at birth on a raft in England, the child is raised by the knight Gandales in Scotland and investigates his origins through fantastic adventures.\n\nHe is persecuted by the wizard Arcal\u00e1us, but protected by Urganda la Desconocida (Urganda the Unknown or Unrecognized), an ambiguous priestess with magical powers and a talent for prophecy. Knighted by his father King Peri\u00f3n, Amad\u00eds overcomes the challenges of the enchanted \u00cdnsola Firme (a sort of peninsula), including passing through the Arch of Faithful Lovers.\n\nDespite Amad\u00eds' celebrated fidelity, his childhood sweetheart, Oriana, heiress to the throne of Great Britain, becomes jealous of a rival princess and sends a letter to chastise Amad\u00eds. The knight  changes his name to Beltenebros and indulges in a long period of madness on the isolated Pe\u00f1a Pobre (Poor Peak or Mountain).\n\nHe recovers his senses only when Oriana sends her maid to retrieve him. He then helps Oriana's father, Lisuarte, repel invaders. A short time later he and Oriana scandalously consummate their love. Their son Esplandi\u00e1n is the result of this one illicit meeting.\n\nRodr\u00edguez de Montalvo asserts{{where|date=September 2019}} that in the \"original\" ''Amad\u00eds'', Esplandi\u00e1n eventually kills his father for this offense against his mother's honor; however, Montalvo amends this defect and resolves their conflict peaceably.\n\nOriana and Amad\u00eds defer their marriage for many years due to enmity between Amad\u00eds and Oriana's father Lisuarte. Amad\u00eds absents himself from Britain for at least ten years, masquerading as \"The Knight of the Green Sword\". He travels as far as Constantinople and secures the favor of the child-princess Leonorina, who will become Esplandi\u00e1n's wife. His most famous adventure during this time of exile is the battle with the giant Endriago, a monster born of incest who exhales a poisonous reek and whose body is covered in scales.\n\nAs a knight, Amad\u00eds is [[courteous]], gentle, sensitive, and a Christian, who dares to defend free love.{{dubious|date=September 2019}} Unlike most literary heroes of his time (French and German, for example), Amad\u00eds is a handsome man who would cry if refused by his lady, but is invincible in battle and usually emerges drenched in his own and his opponent's blood.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Literary significance==\nCalled also ''Amad\u00eds sin tiempo'' (Amadis without Time) by his mother (in allusion to the fact that being conceived outside marriage she would have to abandon him and he would probably die), he is the most representative [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] hero of [[chivalric romance]]. His adventures ran to four volumes, probably the most popular such tales of their time. [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Noue]], one of the Huguenot captains of the 16th century, affirmed that reading the romances of Amadis had caused a \"spirit of vertigo\"<ref>\"Un espirit de vertige\"; noted in [[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919) 1924:68.</ref> even in his more rationally-minded generation. The books show a complete idealization and simplification of knight-errantry. Even servants are hardly heard of, but there are many princesses, ladies and kings. Knights and [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]] are found everywhere. The book's style is reasonably modern, but lacks dialogue and the character's impressions, mostly describing the action.\n\nThe book's [[literary genre|style]] was praised by the usually demanding [[Juan de Vald\u00e9s]], although he considered that from time to time it was too low or too high a style. The language is characterized by a certain \"Latinizing\" influence in its [[syntax]], especially the tendency to place the [[verb]] at the end of the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]; as well as other such details, such as the use of the [[present participle]], which bring ''Amad\u00eds'' into line with the [[allegory|allegorical]] style of the 15th century.\n\nNevertheless, there is a breach of style when Garci Rodriguez de Montalvo presents the fourth book. It becomes dull and solemn, reflecting the nature of the intruding writer. The first three books are inspired in deeds and feats by knights-errant, dating back to the 13th century, while the fourth book emerges as a less brilliant attachment of the 15th century. The pristine style of \"Amad\u00eds\" can be perceived in the few original famous pages analyzed by Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Mo\u00f1ino: It is lively and straight to the facts of war and love, with brief dialogs, all quite elegant and amusing. ''Amad\u00eds of Gaula'' is frequently referenced in the humorous classic ''Don Quixote'', written by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] in the early 17th century. The character Don Quixote idolizes Amad\u00eds and tries to imitate him.\n\nHistorically, ''Amad\u00eds'' was very influential amongst the Spanish [[conquistador]]es. [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] mentioned the wonders of ''Amad\u00eds'' when he marveled at his first sight of [[Tenochtitlan]] (modern Mexico City) \u2013 and such place names as [[Origin of the name California|California]] come directly from the work.\n\n==Origins==\nAs mentioned above, the origins of the book of Amad\u00eds are disputed.\n\n===The existing texts===\n====The version of Montalvo====\nThe only known complete text of ''Amad\u00eds de Gaula'' is that of Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo, a Castilian writer.

Note that the book numbers of the French translation do not always correspond to the book numbers of the Spanish originals, and in both languages, \"book\" is not the same as \"printed volume\"; physical printed books sometimes contained more than one \"book\" of the series.\n\nFrench translations, with their translators:\n* Book I: 1540 ([[Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts]])\n* Book II: 1541 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts)\n* Book III: 1542 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts)\n* Book IV: 1543 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts)\n* Book V: 1544 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts)\n* (Spanish book VI was rejected as apocryphal)\n* Book VI: 1545 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts) (actually Spanish Book VII)\n* (Spanish Book VIII was rejected because it told of the death of Amadis)\n* Book VII: 1546 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts) (actually Spanish Book IXa)\n* Book VIII: 1548 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts) (actually Spanish Book IXb)\n* Book IX: 1551 (Giles Boileau & Claude Colet) (actually Spanish Book Xa)\n* Book X: 1552 (Jacques Gohory) (actually Spanish Book Xb)\n* Book XI: 1554 (Jacques Gohory) (actually Spanish Book XIa)\n* Book XII: 1556 (Guillaume Aubert) (actually Spanish Book XIb)\n* Book XIII: 1571 (Jacques Gohory) (actually Spanish Book XIIa)\n* Book XIV: 1574 (Antoine Tyron) (actually Spanish Book XIIb)\n* Books XV\u2013XXI: 1576\u20131581\n* Books XXII\u2013XXIV: after 1594\n\nIn Portugal, and other parts of Iberia, the Amadis cycle also launched other adventure series, such as:\n* {{ill|Palmer\u00edn de Oliva|es|lt=''Palmerin de Oliva''}} \u2013 original anonymous text in Castilian: 1511\n* {{ill|Primale\u00f3n|es|lt=''Primaleon''}} (son of Palmerin de Olivia) \u2013 original anonymous text in Castilian: 1512\n* {{ill|Palmeirim de Inglaterra|pt|lt=''Palmeirim de Inglaterra''}} (''Palmeirim of England'') \u2013 original Portuguese text by [[Francisco de Moraes|Francisco de Morais Cabral]]: c.1544 (published 1567)\n* {{ill|Duardos de Bretanha|es|Duardos de Breta\u00f1a|lt=''Dom Duardos''}} \u2013 original Portuguese text by Diogo Fernandes\n* {{ill|Clarisol de Bretanha|es|Palmeirim de Inglaterra|lt=''Dom Clarisel de Bretanha''}} \u2013 original Portuguese text by Gon\u00e7alves Lobato\n* {{ill|Cr\u00f3nica do Imperador Clarimundo|pt|lt=''Cr\u00f3nica do Imperador Clarimundo''}} (''Chronicle of Emperor Clarimund'') \u2013 original Portuguese text by [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]]\n* {{ill|Triunfos de Sagramor|pt|lt=''Sagramor''}} \u2013 original Portuguese text by Gon\u00e7alo Fernandes Trancoso\n\n==Operas==\n*''[[Amadis (Lully)|Amadis]]'' (1684) by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]\n*''[[Amadis de Gr\u00e8ce]]'' (1699) by [[Andr\u00e9 Cardinal Destouches]]\n*''[[Amadigi di Gaula]]'' (1715) by [[George Frideric Handel]]\n*''[[Amadis de Gaule (La Borde and Berton)|Amadis de Gaule]]'' (1771) by [[Jean-Benjamin de La Borde]] and [[Pierre Montan Berton]]\n*''[[Amadis de Gaule (J.C.
