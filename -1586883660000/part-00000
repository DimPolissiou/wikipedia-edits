Applications running on an [[end system]] (PC, smartphone etc.) across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. [[Encryption]] is a common, though not an inherent, part of a VPN connection.<ref>{{cite book |author= Mason, Andrew G. |title=Cisco Secure Virtual Private Network |url= https://archive.org/details/ciscosecurevirtu00andr |url-access= registration |publisher= Cisco Press |date= 2002 |page= [https://archive.org/details/ciscosecurevirtu00andr/page/7 7]}}</ref>\n\nVPN technology was developed to allow remote users and branch offices to access corporate applications and resources. To ensure security, the private network connection is established using an encrypted layered [[tunneling protocol]], and VPN users use authentication methods, including passwords or certificates, to gain access to the VPN. In other applications, Internet users may secure their connections with a VPN to circumvent [[Geo-blocking|geo-restrictions]] and [[censorship]] or to connect to [[proxy server]]s to protect personal identity and location to stay anonymous on the Internet. Some websites, however, block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions, and many VPN providers have been developing strategies to get around these roadblocks.\n\nA VPN is created by establishing a virtual [[point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] connection through the use of dedicated circuits or with tunneling protocols over existing networks. A VPN available from the public Internet can provide some of the benefits of a [[wide area network]] (WAN). From a user perspective, the resources available within the private network can be accessed remotely.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[Microsoft Technet]] |title= Virtual Private Networking: An Overview |url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742566.aspx |date=September 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:VPN classification-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|VPN classification based on the topology first, then on the technology used.]]\n[[File:Site-to-site VPN-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A typical site-to-site VPN.]]\nEarly data networks allowed VPN-style connections to remote sites through [[dial-up modem]] or through [[leased line]] connections utilizing [[X.25]], [[Frame Relay]] and [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) virtual circuits provided through networks owned and operated by [[Telephone company|telecommunication carriers]]. These networks are not considered true VPNs because they passively secure the data being transmitted by the creation of logical data streams.<ref>Cisco Systems, et al.

In a corporate setting, remote-access VPNs allow employees to access the company's [[intranet]] from outside the office. Site-to-site VPNs allow collaborators in geographically disparate offices to share the same virtual network. A VPN can also be used to interconnect two similar networks over a dissimilar intermediate network, such as two [[IPv6]] networks connected over an [[IPv4]] network.<ref>{{cite web|last=Technet Lab |title=IPv6 traffic over VPN connections |url=http://lab.technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc138002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615203602/http://lab.technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc138002 |archivedate=15 June 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nVPN systems may be classified by:\n* the tunneling protocol used to [[IP tunnel|tunnel]] the traffic\n* the tunnel's termination point location, e.g., on the customer [[Edge device|edge]] or network-provider edge\n* the type of topology of connections, such as site-to-site or network-to-network\n* the levels of security provided\n* the [[OSI model|OSI layer]] they present to the connecting network, such as Layer 2 circuits or Layer 3 network connectivity\n* the number of simultaneous connections\n\n==Security mechanisms==\nVPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security.

User-created remote-access VPNs may use [[passwords]], [[biometrics]], [[two-factor authentication]] or other [[cryptographic]] methods. Network-to-network tunnels often use passwords or [[digital certificates]]. They permanently store the key to allow the tunnel to establish automatically, without intervention from the administrator.\n\n==Routing==\nTunneling protocols can operate in a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[network topology]] that would theoretically not be considered a VPN because a VPN by definition is expected to support arbitrary and changing sets of network nodes. But since most [[Router (computing)|router]] implementations support a software-defined tunnel interface, customer-provisioned VPNs often are simply defined tunnels running conventional routing protocols.\n\n===Provider-provisioned VPN building-blocks===\n[[File:Site-to-Site VPN terminology-en.svg|thumb|300px|Site-to-Site VPN terminology.]]\nDepending on whether a provider-provisioned VPN (PPVPN) operates in layer 2 or layer 3, the building blocks described below may be L2 only, L3 only, or a combination of both.

C devices are not aware of the VPN.\n\n; Customer Edge device (CE)\nA device at the edge of the customer's network which provides access to the PPVPN. Sometimes it is just a demarcation point between provider and customer responsibility. Other providers allow customers to configure it.\n\n; Provider edge device (PE)\nA device, or set of devices, at the edge of the provider network which connects to customer networks through CE devices and presents the provider's view of the customer site. PEs are aware of the VPNs that connect through them, and maintain VPN state.\n\n; Provider device (P)\nA device that operates inside the provider's core network and does not directly interface to any customer endpoint. It might, for example, provide routing for many provider-operated tunnels that belong to different customers' PPVPNs. While the P device is a key part of implementing PPVPNs, it is not itself VPN-aware and does not maintain VPN state. Its principal role is allowing the service provider to scale its PPVPN offerings, for example, by acting as an aggregation point for multiple PEs. P-to-P connections, in such a role, often are high-capacity optical links between major locations of providers.\n\n==User-visible PPVPN services==\n===OSI Layer 2 services===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n;Virtual LAN\n[[Virtual LAN]] (VLAN) is a Layer 2 technique that allow for the coexistence of multiple [[local area network]] (LAN) broadcast domains interconnected via trunks using the [[IEEE 802.1Q]] trunking protocol. Other trunking protocols have been used but have become obsolete, including Inter-Switch Link (ISL), IEEE 802.10 (originally a security protocol but a subset was introduced for trunking), and ATM LAN Emulation (LANE).\n\n;Virtual private LAN service (VPLS)\nDeveloped by [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], [[Virtual LAN]]s (VLANs) allow multiple tagged LANs to share common trunking. VLANs frequently comprise only customer-owned facilities. Whereas VPLS as described in the above section (OSI Layer 1 services) supports emulation of both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint topologies, the method discussed here extends Layer 2 technologies such as [[802.1d]] and [[802.1q]] LAN trunking to run over transports such as [[Metro Ethernet]].\n\nAs used in this context, a [[VPLS]] is a Layer 2 PPVPN, emulating the full functionality of a traditional LAN. From a user standpoint, a VPLS makes it possible to interconnect several LAN segments over a packet-switched, or optical, provider core, a core transparent to the user, making the remote LAN segments behave as one single LAN.<ref>{{citation |url=http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/howto-openvpn-as/214-how-to-setup-layer-2-ethernet-bridging.html |title=Ethernet Bridging (OpenVPN)}}</ref>\n\nIn a VPLS, the provider network emulates a learning bridge, which optionally may include VLAN service.\n\n;Pseudo wire (PW)\nPW is similar to VPLS, but it can provide different L2 protocols at both ends. Typically, its interface is a WAN protocol such as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] or [[Frame Relay]]. In contrast, when aiming to provide the appearance of a LAN contiguous between two or more locations, the Virtual Private LAN service or IPLS would be appropriate.\n\n; Ethernet over IP tunneling\nEtherIP ({{IETF RFC|3378}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3378|title=EtherIP: Tunneling Ethernet Frames in IP Datagrams|first1=Scott|last1=Hollenbeck|first2=Russell|last2=Housley|publisher=}}</ref> is an Ethernet over IP tunneling protocol specification. EtherIP has only packet encapsulation mechanism. It has no confidentiality nor message integrity protection. EtherIP was introduced in the [[FreeBSD]] network stack<ref>Glyn M Burton: [https://securethoughts.com/9-rfc-3378-etherip-with-freebsd/ RFC 3378  EtherIP with FreeBSD], 03 February 2011</ref> and the [[SoftEther VPN]]<ref name=\"net-security.org\">net-security.org news: [http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=16171 Multi-protocol SoftEther VPN becomes open source], January 2014</ref> server program.\n\n;IP-only LAN-like service (IPLS)\nA subset of VPLS, the CE devices must have Layer 3 capabilities; the IPLS presents packets rather than frames. It may support IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n===OSI Layer 3 PPVPN architectures===\nThis section discusses the main architectures for PPVPNs, one where the PE disambiguates duplicate addresses in a single routing instance, and the other, virtual router, in which the PE contains a virtual router instance per VPN. The former approach, and its variants, have gained the most attention.\n\nOne of the challenges of PPVPNs involves different customers using the same address space, especially the IPv4 private address space.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt Address Allocation for Private Internets], {{IETF RFC|1918}}, Y. Rekhter ''et al.'', February 1996</ref> The provider must be able to disambiguate overlapping addresses in the multiple customers' PPVPNs.\n\n;BGP/MPLS PPVPN\nIn the method defined by {{IETF RFC|2547}}, BGP extensions advertise routes in the IPv4 VPN address family, which are of the form of 12-byte strings, beginning with an 8-byte [[route distinguisher]] (RD) and ending with a 4-byte IPv4 address. RDs disambiguate otherwise duplicate addresses in the same PE.\n\nPEs understand the topology of each VPN, which are interconnected with MPLS tunnels either directly or via P routers. In MPLS terminology, the P routers are [[Label Switch Router]]s without awareness of VPNs.\n\n;Virtual router PPVPN\nThe virtual router architecture,<ref>{{IETF RFC|2917}}, ''A Core MPLS IP VPN Architecture''</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|2918}}, E. Chen (September 2000)</ref> as opposed to BGP/MPLS techniques, requires no modification to existing routing protocols such as BGP. By the provisioning of logically independent routing domains, the customer operating a VPN is completely responsible for the address space. In the various MPLS tunnels, the different PPVPNs are disambiguated by their label but do not need routing distinguishers.\n\n===Unencrypted tunnels===\nSome virtual networks use tunneling protocols without encryption for protecting the privacy of data. While VPNs often do provide security, an unencrypted [[overlay network]] does not neatly fit within the secure or trusted categorization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Yanyan|date=2006|title=IPsec/VPN security policy correctness and assurance|journal=Journal of High Speed Networks|volume=15|pages=275\u2013289|citeseerx=10.1.1.94.8561}}</ref> For example, a tunnel set up between two hosts with [[Generic Routing Encapsulation]] (GRE) is a virtual private network but is neither secure nor trusted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview of Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN) |url=https://securethoughts.com/overview-provider-provisioned-virtual-private-networks-ppvpn/ |publisher=Secure Thoughts |accessdate = 29 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|1702}}: Generic Routing Encapsulation over IPv4 networks.

Applications running on an [[end system]] (PC, smartphone etc.) across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. [[Encryption]] is a common, though not an inherent, part of a VPN connection.<ref>{{cite book |author= Mason, Andrew G. |title=Cisco Secure Virtual Private Network |url= https://archive.org/details/ciscosecurevirtu00andr |url-access= registration |publisher= Cisco Press |date= 2002 |page= [https://archive.org/details/ciscosecurevirtu00andr/page/7 7]}}</ref>\n\nVPN technology was developed to allow remote users and branch offices to access corporate applications and resources. To ensure security, the private network connection is established using an encrypted layered [[tunneling protocol]], and VPN users use authentication methods, including passwords or certificates, to gain access to the VPN. In other applications, Internet users may secure their connections with a VPN to circumvent [[Geo-blocking|geo-restrictions]] and [[censorship]] or to connect to [[proxy server]]s to protect personal identity and location to stay anonymous on the Internet. Some websites, however, block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions, and many VPN providers have been developing strategies to get around these roadblocks.\n\nA VPN is created by establishing a virtual [[point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] connection through the use of dedicated circuits or with tunneling protocols over existing networks. A VPN available from the public Internet can provide some of the benefits of a [[wide area network]] (WAN). From a user perspective, the resources available within the private network can be accessed remotely.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[Microsoft Technet]] |title= Virtual Private Networking: An Overview |url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742566.aspx |date=September 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:VPN classification-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|VPN classification based on the topology first, then on the technology used.]]\n[[File:Site-to-site VPN-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A typical site-to-site VPN.]]\nEarly data networks allowed VPN-style connections to remote sites through [[dial-up modem]] or through [[leased line]] connections utilizing [[X.25]], [[Frame Relay]] and [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) virtual circuits provided through networks owned and operated by [[Telephone company|telecommunication carriers]].

In a corporate setting, remote-access VPNs allow employees to access the company's [[intranet]] from outside the office. Site-to-site VPNs allow collaborators in geographically disparate offices to share the same virtual network.

User-created remote-access VPNs may use [[passwords]], [[biometrics]], [[two-factor authentication]] or other [[cryptographic]] methods.

They permanently store the key to allow the tunnel to establish automatically, without intervention from the administrator.\n\n==Routing==\nTunneling protocols can operate in a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[network topology]] that would theoretically not be considered a VPN because a VPN by definition is expected to support arbitrary and changing sets of network nodes. But since most [[Router (computing)|router]] implementations support a software-defined tunnel interface, customer-provisioned VPNs often are simply defined tunnels running conventional routing protocols.\n\n===Provider-provisioned VPN building-blocks===\n[[File:Site-to-Site VPN terminology-en.svg|thumb|300px|Site-to-Site VPN terminology.]]\nDepending on whether a provider-provisioned VPN (PPVPN) operates in layer 2 or layer 3, the building blocks described below may be L2 only, L3 only, or a combination of both.

C devices are not aware of the VPN.\n\n; Customer Edge device (CE)\nA device at the edge of the customer's network which provides access to the PPVPN. Sometimes it is just a demarcation point between provider and customer responsibility. Other providers allow customers to configure it.\n\n; Provider edge device (PE)\nA device, or set of devices, at the edge of the provider network which connects to customer networks through CE devices and presents the provider's view of the customer site. PEs are aware of the VPNs that connect through them, and maintain VPN state.\n\n; Provider device (P)\nA device that operates inside the provider's core network and does not directly interface to any customer endpoint. It might, for example, provide routing for many provider-operated tunnels that belong to different customers' PPVPNs. While the P device is a key part of implementing PPVPNs, it is not itself VPN-aware and does not maintain VPN state. Its principal role is allowing the service provider to scale its PPVPN offerings, for example, by acting as an aggregation point for multiple PEs. P-to-P connections, in such a role, often are high-capacity optical links between major locations of providers.\n\n==User-visible PPVPN services==\n===OSI Layer 2 services===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n;Virtual LAN\n[[Virtual LAN]] (VLAN) is a Layer 2 technique that allow for the coexistence of multiple [[local area network]] (LAN) broadcast domains interconnected via trunks using the [[IEEE 802.1Q]] trunking protocol. Other trunking protocols have been used but have become obsolete, including Inter-Switch Link (ISL), IEEE 802.10 (originally a security protocol but a subset was introduced for trunking), and ATM LAN Emulation (LANE).\n\n;Virtual private LAN service (VPLS)\nDeveloped by [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], [[Virtual LAN]]s (VLANs) allow multiple tagged LANs to share common trunking. VLANs frequently comprise only customer-owned facilities. Whereas VPLS as described in the above section (OSI Layer 1 services) supports emulation of both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint topologies, the method discussed here extends Layer 2 technologies such as [[802.1d]] and [[802.1q]] LAN trunking to run over transports such as [[Metro Ethernet]].\n\nAs used in this context, a [[VPLS]] is a Layer 2 PPVPN, emulating the full functionality of a traditional LAN. From a user standpoint, a VPLS makes it possible to interconnect several LAN segments over a packet-switched, or optical, provider core, a core transparent to the user, making the remote LAN segments behave as one single LAN.<ref>{{citation |url=http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/howto-openvpn-as/214-how-to-setup-layer-2-ethernet-bridging.html |title=Ethernet Bridging (OpenVPN)}}</ref>\n\nIn a VPLS, the provider network emulates a learning bridge, which optionally may include VLAN service.\n\n;Pseudo wire (PW)\nPW is similar to VPLS, but it can provide different L2 protocols at both ends. Typically, its interface is a WAN protocol such as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] or [[Frame Relay]]. In contrast, when aiming to provide the appearance of a LAN contiguous between two or more locations, the Virtual Private LAN service or IPLS would be appropriate.\n\n; Ethernet over IP tunneling\nEtherIP ({{IETF RFC|3378}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3378|title=EtherIP: Tunneling Ethernet Frames in IP Datagrams|first1=Scott|last1=Hollenbeck|first2=Russell|last2=Housley|publisher=}}</ref> is an Ethernet over IP tunneling protocol specification. EtherIP has only packet encapsulation mechanism. It has no confidentiality nor message integrity protection. EtherIP was introduced in the [[FreeBSD]] network stack<ref>Glyn M Burton: [https://securethoughts.com/9-rfc-3378-etherip-with-freebsd/ RFC 3378  EtherIP with FreeBSD], 03 February 2011</ref> and the [[SoftEther VPN]]<ref name=\"net-security.org\">net-security.org news: [http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=16171 Multi-protocol SoftEther VPN becomes open source], January 2014</ref> server program.\n\n;IP-only LAN-like service (IPLS)\nA subset of VPLS, the CE devices must have Layer 3 capabilities; the IPLS presents packets rather than frames. It may support IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n===OSI Layer 3 PPVPN architectures===\nThis section discusses the main architectures for PPVPNs, one where the PE disambiguates duplicate addresses in a single routing instance, and the other, virtual router, in which the PE contains a virtual router instance per VPN. The former approach, and its variants, have gained the most attention.\n\nOne of the challenges of PPVPNs involves different customers using the same address space, especially the IPv4 private address space.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt Address Allocation for Private Internets], {{IETF RFC|1918}}, Y. Rekhter ''et al.'', February 1996</ref> The provider must be able to disambiguate overlapping addresses in the multiple customers' PPVPNs.\n\n;BGP/MPLS PPVPN\nIn the method defined by {{IETF RFC|2547}}, BGP extensions advertise routes in the IPv4 VPN address family, which are of the form of 12-byte strings, beginning with an 8-byte [[route distinguisher]] (RD) and ending with a 4-byte IPv4 address. RDs disambiguate otherwise duplicate addresses in the same PE.\n\nPEs understand the topology of each VPN, which are interconnected with MPLS tunnels either directly or via P routers. In MPLS terminology, the P routers are [[Label Switch Router]]s without awareness of VPNs.\n\n;Virtual router PPVPN\nThe virtual router architecture,<ref>{{IETF RFC|2917}}, ''A Core MPLS IP VPN Architecture''</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|2918}}, E. Chen (September 2000)</ref> as opposed to BGP/MPLS techniques, requires no modification to existing routing protocols such as BGP. By the provisioning of logically independent routing domains, the customer operating a VPN is completely responsible for the address space. In the various MPLS tunnels, the different PPVPNs are disambiguated by their label but do not need routing distinguishers.\n\n===Unencrypted tunnels===\nSome virtual networks use tunneling protocols without encryption for protecting the privacy of data. While VPNs often do provide security, an unencrypted [[overlay network]] does not neatly fit within the secure or trusted categorization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Yanyan|date=2006|title=IPsec/VPN security policy correctness and assurance|journal=Journal of High Speed Networks|volume=15|pages=275\u2013289|citeseerx=10.1.1.94.8561}}</ref> For example, a tunnel set up between two hosts with [[Generic Routing Encapsulation]] (GRE) is a virtual private network but is neither secure nor trusted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview of Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN) |url=https://securethoughts.com/overview-provider-provisioned-virtual-private-networks-ppvpn/ |publisher=Secure Thoughts |accessdate = 29 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|1702}}: Generic Routing Encapsulation over IPv4 networks.

For example, a commercial VPN marketed for Internet access (censorship circumvention, anonymization, geo-unblocking) only needs to tunnel the user's internet traffic somewhere else securely and there is typically no way for a user's devices connected to the same \"VPN\" to see each other. These VPNs can be based on typical VPN protocols or more camouflaged VPN implementations like [[SoftEther VPN]], but proxy protocols like [[Shadowsocks]] are used as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hodge |first1=Rae |title=Proxy vs. VPN: If it's built into your browser, it might not be a true VPN |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/proxy-vs-vpn-if-its-built-into-your-browser-its-actually-not-a-true-vpn/ |website=CNET |accessdate=21 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Commercial VPNs are usually marketed as privacy protection software that offers additional encryption services.\n\nOn the client side, a commercial VPN setup, even those not using a conventional VPN protocol, typically use the operating system's VPN interfaces to capture a user's data to send through. This include virtual network adapters on computer OSes and specialized \"VPN\" interfaces on mobile operating systems. A less common alternative is to provide a [[SOCKS]] proxy interface.\n\n{{anchor|Public or private VPNs}}\nUsers must consider that when the transmitted content is not encrypted ''before'' entering a VPN, that data is visible at the receiving endpoint (usually the public VPN provider's site) regardless of whether the VPN tunnel ''wrapper'' itself is encrypted for the inter-node transport. The ''only'' secure VPN is where the participants have oversight at ''both'' ends of the entire data path, or the content is encrypted before it enters the tunnel provider.\n\n==Legality==\n{{see|VPN blocking}}\nUnapproved VPNs are reportedly illegal in China, as they can be used to circumvent the [[Great Firewall]]. (VPN refers to any protocol that tunnels traffic out elsewhere, as above.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-vpns/businesses-consumers-uncertain-ahead-of-china-vpn-ban-idUSKBN1H612F|title=Businesses, consumers uncertain ahead of China VPN ban|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anonymizer]]\n* [[Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network]]\n* [[Internet privacy]]\n* [[Mediated VPN]]\n* [[Opportunistic encryption]]\n* [[Split tunneling]]\n* [[Virtual private server]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |date=August 2001 |title=Necessity is the mother of VPN invention |journal=Communication News |pages=26\u201328 |issn=0010-3632 |url=http://www.comnews.com/cgi-bin/arttop.asp?Page=c0801necessity.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20011217153420/http://www.comnews.com/cgi-bin/arttop.asp?Page=c0801necessity.htm |archivedate=2001-12-17 |last=Kelly |first=Sean}}\n\n{{VPN}}\n{{Cryptographic software}}\n{{Internet censorship circumvention technologies}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Virtual Private Network}}\n[[Category:Network architecture]]\n[[Category:Computer network security]]\n[[Category:Internet privacy]]\n[[Category:Crypto-anarchism]]\n[[Category:Virtual private networks| ]]\n", "name_user": "103.87.59.9", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network"}
