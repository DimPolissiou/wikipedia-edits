Initially these cash coins were assumed to have the inscription \"Jixing Yuanbao\" (\u7e3e\u8208\u5143\u5bf3), as the manufacturing method of these coins was rather crude and their [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] poor as well as the reign title Jixing being unknown in Chinese historiography scholars deduced that these cashin  coins had to be produced locally.

The Qara Khitai Khanate is suspected to have produced round coins with [[Persian language]] inscriptions in Al-\u016azjand (modern day [[Uzgen]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]), however the attribution of these coins remain ambiguous and is debated among numismatists.

In November 2008 some rather unusual Chinese cash coins were unearthed at the Aq-Beshim site in Kyrgyzstan which lies near what used to be site of the ancient city of [[Suyab]]. Initially these cash coins were assumed to have the inscription \"Jixing Yuanbao\" (\u7e3e\u8208\u5143\u5bf3), as the manufacturing method of these coins was rather crude and their [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] poor as well as the reign title Jixing being unknown in Chinese historiography scholars deduced that these cashin  coins had to be produced locally. Initially it was assumed that these coins were in fact [[Chinese numismatic charm|coin-like charms]] but in October 2010 another coin with this inscription was found at the Qara-Jigach site (ancient [[Tarsakent]]), the inscription of this coin was more readable which corrected the earlier assumptions and this series was confirmed to bear the inscription \"Xuxing Yuanbao\" (\u7e8c\u8208\u5143\u5bf3), in February 2011 another Xuxing Yuanbao cash coin was unearthed in Kyrgyzstan at the site of what used to be the ancient city of Navekat (Nawikath) in modern-day [[Krasnaya Rechka, Kyrgyzstan|Krasnaya Rechka]] which confirmed that they were in fact monetary objects.<ref name=\"QaraKhitayCashCoins\">{{cite web|url= https://www.openstarts.units.it/bitstream/10077/8709/6/AssemaniStudi3_The-Coinage.pdf|title= The coinage of Qara Khitay: a new evidence (on the reign title of the Western Liao Emperor Yel\u00fc Yilie).|date=|accessdate=5 September 2018|work= By Vladimir Belyaev, Vladimir Nastich, and Sergey Sidorovich|language=en}}</ref> \n\n== Liao dynasty coin charms == \n{{Main|Chinese numismatic charm}} \n[[File:103 20100911 bt shanghai museum (4986590217).jpg|thumb|left|A Liao dynasty period charm on display at the [[Shanghai Museum]].]]\n\nLiao dynasty charms are Chinese numismatic charms produced during the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]] that are written in [[Khitan script]] and, unlike Liao dynasty coins, were read counter-clockwise.

One of the most well-known Liao dynasty charms is the \"Mother of Nine Sons\" charm, which bears no inscription. It depicts three groups of three people which are believed to be the sons of the woman riding a dragon on the other side; the three groups are believed to symbolise the three levels of the imperial examination system. A more recent hypothesis proposes that the person riding the dragon is the [[Yellow Emperor]] returning to the heavens and that the people represent the [[Names of China|Nine Provinces]] (\u4e5d\u5dde).<ref>Pei Yuan Bo (\u88f4\u5143\u535a) \u2013 3rd issue of \"Inner Mongolia Financial Research\" (\u5185\u8499\u53e4\u91d1\u878d\u7814\u7a76), 2004.
