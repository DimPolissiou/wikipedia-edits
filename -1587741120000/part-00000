In this episode, the ''Enterprise'' becomes involved in two previously unknown Earth colonies' struggle for survival.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'', under the command of Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]], receives an automated distress call from satellites orbiting a human colony on the planet Bringloid V, which is in danger from solar flares from its star. The colony turns out to have been founded by the crew of the SS ''Mariposa'', a freighter launched from Earth several hundred years earlier.\n\nAs the Enterprise approaches the planet, Worf appears to faint on the bridge and is transported to sick bay. When he regained consciousness he is embarrassed to admit suffering a Klingon equivalent of measles. Dr Pulaski agrees to protect his privacy. In gratitude, Worf later approaches her to offer a Klingon tea ceremony. He warns that the tea is deadly to humans and explains it is just a gesture which would be important in his culture. Pulaski suggests he is a romantic, and takes an antidote to allow herself to drink the tea with him safely.\n\nThe \"Bringloidi\" colony (after {{lang|ga|briongl\u00f3id\u00ed}}, the [[Irish language|Irish]] word for \"dreams\"), now led by an Irishman named Danilo O'Dell, are followers of an early 22nd century philosopher who advocated returning to a pre-industrial agrarian lifestyle, and when taken aboard the ''Enterprise'', must quickly adapt to the 24th century technology. When the transfer of the colonists is complete, O'Dell informs Picard of another colony, also planted by the ''Mariposa''. The ''Enterprise'' proceeds to the second colony\u2014which has named itself \"Mariposa\" after their ship\u2014half a [[light year]] away. The colony's Prime Minister, Walter Granger, is happy to see the ''Enterprise'' and welcomes them to visit, so [[William Riker|Commander Riker]] beams down with [[Worf|Lieutenant Worf]] and Chief Medical Officer [[Katherine Pulaski|Doctor Pulaski]].\n\nThe Mariposa colony is strikingly different from the Bringloidi colony, as the Mariposa colonists have kept their advanced technology, and appear refined and cultured in contrast to the Bringloidi's relatively primitive existence.  Pulaski quickly ascertains, however, that all of the inhabitants are clones.  Granger reveals that their ship crashed while landing, and only five survivors were left to start the colony.  As this was insufficient to establish a stable [[gene pool]], and the survivors were all scientists, they turned exclusively to [[cloning]] instead, and consequently no longer have any desire for [[biological reproduction]]. For almost three centuries, every Mariposan has been a clone derived from one of the five original colonists, and now the colony is in danger of dying out because of replicative fading: each subsequent generation introduces additional minor flaws in the genetic code, which within only a few more generations will make further clones [[Genetic viability|nonviable]].\n\nThe Mariposans ask the ''Enterprise'' crew for samples of their [[DNA]] to create new clones. Riker refuses, as he values his uniqueness, and Picard advises the Mariposans that the rest of the crew is likely to feel the same, so the Mariposans decide to kidnap Riker and Pulaski to steal their DNA instead. Upon discovering this, the away team beams directly to the colony's cloning labs, where they are repulsed to find copies of themselves being grown, which Riker destroys. Granger is furious, and appeals to Picard, but Pulaski argues that a new batch of clones will only delay the inevitable. Instead, she advises that they consider partnering with the Bringloidi to create a viable [[gene pool]]. Initially, each colony's leader treats the other society with disdain, but they eventually agree to merge their colonies and disparate cultures.\n\n==Deleted scenes==\nSeveral scenes were filmed but later cut from the episode during editing.

Von S\u00f6mmerring concluded that it belonged to an ancient bird. When further preparation uncovered teeth, Graf zu M\u00fcnster sent a cast to Professor [[Georg August Goldfuss]], who recognised it as a pterosaur. Like most pterosaurs described in the mid 19th century, ''Rhamphorhynchus'' was originally considered to be a species of ''[[Pterodactylus]]''. However, at the time, many scientists incorrectly considered ''Ornithocephalus'' to be the valid name for ''Pterodactylus''. This specimen of ''Rhamphorhynchus'' was therefore originally named ''Ornithocephalus M\u00fcnsteri''. This was first mentioned in 1830 by Graf zu M\u00fcnster himself.<ref name=\"munster1830\">M\u00fcnster, G. Graf zu.

He named it ''Ornithocephalus longicaudus'', meaning \"long tail\", to differentiate it from the specimens with short tails (the true specimens of ''Pterodactylus'').<ref name=\"munster1839\">{{Cite journal | last1 = M\u00fcnster | first1 = G.G. | year = 1839 | title = Ueber einige neue Versteinerungen in der lithographischen Schiefer von Baiern | url = | journal = Neues Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Mineralogie, Geologie, und Palaeontologie | volume = 1839 | issue = | pages = 676\u2013682 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ornithocephalus M\u00fcnsteri.jpg|thumb|left|Holotype ''R. munsteri'' skull as illustrated in 1851]]\nIn 1845, [[Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer|Hermann von Meyer]] officially emended the original species ''Ornithocephalus m\u00fcnsteri'' to ''Pterodactylus m\u00fcnsteri'', since the name ''Pterodactylus'' had been by that point recognized as having priority over ''Ornithocephalus''.<ref name=\"vonmeyer1845\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = H. von. | year = 1845 | title = System der fossilen Saurier [Taxonomy of fossil saurians] | url = | journal = Neues Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Mineralogie, Geognosie, Geologie und Petrefakten-Kunde | volume = 1845 | issue = | pages = 278\u2013285 }}</ref> In a subsequent 1846 paper describing a new species of long-tailed 'pterodactyl', von Meyer decided that the long-tailed forms of ''Pterodactylus'' were different enough from the short-tailed forms to warrant placement in a [[subgenus]], and he named his new species ''Pterodactylus (Rhamphorhynchus) gemmingi'' after a specimen owned by collector Captain [[Carl Eming von Gemming]] that was later by von Gemming sold for three hundred guilders to the [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]].<ref name=\"vonmeyer1846\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = H. von. | year = 1846 | title = ''Pterodactylus (Rhamphorhynchus) gemmingi'' aus dem Kalkschiefer von Solenhofen | url = | journal = Palaeontographica | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 1\u201320 }}</ref> It was not until 1847 that von Meyer elevated ''Rhamphorhynchus'' to a full-fledged genus, and officially included in it both long-tailed species of ''Pterodactylus'' known at the time, ''R. longicaudus'' (the original species preserving a long tail) and ''R. gemmingi''.<ref name=\"vonmeyer1847\">Meyer, H. von.

Bennett's paper did not cover the British and African species, though he suggested that these should be considered indeterminate members of the family [[Rhamphorhynchidae]] and not necessarily species of ''Rhamphorhynchus'' itself.

However, in a 1995 paper, Bennett argued that these \"species\" actually represent year-classes of a single species, ''Rhamphorhynchus muensteri'', from [[flaplings]] to adults. Following from this interpretation, Bennett found several notable changes that occurred in ''R. muensteri'' as the animal aged.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n\nJuvenile ''Rhamphorhynchus'' had relatively short skulls with large eyes, and the toothless beak-like tips of the jaws were shorter in juveniles than adults, with rounded, blunt lower jaw tips eventually becoming slender and pointed as the animals grew. Adult ''Rhamphorhynchus'' also developed a strong upward \"hook\" at the end of the lower jaw. The number of teeth remained constant from juvenile to adult, though the teeth became relatively shorter and stockier as the animals grew, possibly to accommodate larger and more powerful prey. The pelvic and pectoral girdles fused as the animals aged, with full pectoral fusion attained by one year of age.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n\nThe shape of the tail vane also changed across various age classes of ''Rhamphorhynchus''. In juveniles, the vane was shallow relative to the tail and roughly oval, or \"[[Scalpel|lancet]]-shaped\". As growth progressed, the tail vane became [[rhomboid|diamond]]-shaped, and finally [[triangle|triangular]] in the largest individuals.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n[[File:Rhamphorhynchus intermedius.jpg|thumb|''R. intermedius'', a small specimen that might be a juvenile of ''R. muensteri'']]\nThe smallest known ''Rhamphorhynchus'' specimen has a wingspan of only 290 millimeters; however, it is likely that even such a small individual was capable of flight. Bennett examined two possibilities for hatchlings: that they were [[altricial]], requiring some period of parental care before leaving the nest, or that they were [[precocial]], hatching with sufficient size and ability for flight. If precocious, Bennett suggested that clutches would be small, with only one or two eggs laid per clutch, to compensate for the relatively large size of the hatchings. Bennett did not speculate on which possibility was more likely, though the discovery of a pterosaur embryo (''[[Avgodectes]]'') with strongly ossified bones suggests that pterosaurs in general were precocial, able to fly soon after hatching with minimal parental care.<ref name=wz05>{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=X. |author2=Zhou, Z. |year=2004 |title=Pterosaur embryo from the Early Cretaceous |journal=Nature |volume=429 |pages=623 |doi=10.1038/429621a |pmid=15190343 |issue=6992}}</ref> This theory was contested by a [[Histology|histological]] study of ''Rhamphorhynchus'' that showed the initial rapid growth was followed by a prolonged period of slow growth.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Prondvai | first1 = E. | last2 = Stein | first2 = K. | last3 = \u0150si | first3 = A. | last4 = Sander | first4 = M.

He found that the average growth rate during the first year of life for ''Rhamphorhynchus'' was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate in [[alligator]]s. Growth likely slowed considerably after sexual maturity, so it would have taken more than three years to attain maximum adult size.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n\nThis growth rate is much slower than the rate seen in large [[Pterodactyloidea|pterodactyloid]] pterosaurs, such as ''[[Pteranodon]]'', which attained near-adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had ''determinate growth'', meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing. Previous assumptions of rapid growth rate in rhamphorhynchoids were based on the assumption that they needed to be [[warm-blooded]] to sustain active flight. Warm-blooded animals, like modern [[bird]]s and [[bat]]s, normally show rapid growth to adult size and determinate growth. Because there is no evidence for either in ''Rhamphorhynchus'', Bennett considered his findings consistent with an [[ectotherm]]ic metabolism, though he recommended more studies needed to be done. Cold-blooded ''Rhamphorhynchus'', Bennett suggested, may have basked in the sun or worked their muscles to accumulate enough energy for bouts of flight, and cooled to ambient temperature when not active to save energy, like modern [[reptile]]s.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n\n===Swimming===\n[[File:Rhamphorhynchus eating Plesioteuthis.jpg|thumb|''R. muensteri'' catching a ''[[Plesioteuthis]]'' squid]]\nThough ''Rhamphorhynchus'' is often depicted as an aerial piscivore, recent evidence suggests that, much like most modern aquatic birds, it probably foraged while swimming. Like several [[pteranodontia]]ns it has hatchet-shaped deltopectoral crests, a short torso and short legs, all features associated with water based launching in pterosaurs. Its feet are broad and large, being useful for propulsion, and the predicted floating position is adequate by pterosaur standards.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Witton | first1 = M.

Both researchers noted that these two groups of specimens were found in roughly a 1:1 ratio, and interpreted them as different sexes.<ref name=\"wellnhofer1975\"/><ref name=\"koh1937\"/> Bennett tested for sexual dimorphism in ''Rhamphorhynchus'' by using a statistical analysis, and found that the specimens did indeed group together into small-headed and large-headed sets. However, without any known variation in the actual form of the bones or soft tissue (morphological differences), he found the case for sexual dimorphism inconclusive.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n\n===Head orientation===\n[[File:Rhamphorynchus gemmingi jconway.jpg|thumb|Depiction by John Conway]]\nIn 2003, a team of researchers led by [[Lawrence Witmer]] studied the brain anatomy of several types of pterosaurs, including ''Rhamphorhynchus muensteri'', using endocasts of the brain they retrieved by performing [[CT scan|CAT scans]] of fossil skulls. Using comparisons to modern animals, they were able to estimate various physical attributes of pterosaurs, including relative head orientation during flight and coordination of the wing membrane muscles. Witmer and his team found that ''Rhamphorhynchus'' held its head parallel to the ground due to the orientation of the ''osseous labyrinth'' of the [[inner ear]], which helps animals detect [[Sense of balance|balance]]. In contrast, pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as ''[[Anhanguera (pterosaur)|Anhanguera]]'', appear to have normally held their heads at a downward angle, both in flight and while on the ground.<ref name=\"witmeretal2004\">Witmer, L.M., S.

In one of these specimens, the jaws of an ''Aspidorhynchus'' pass through the wings of the ''Rhamphorhynchus'' specimen. The ''Rhamphorhynchus'' also has the remains of a small fish, possibly ''[[Leptolepides]]'', in its throat. This slab, cataloged as WDC CSG 255, may represent two levels of predation; one by ''Rhamphorhynchus'' and one by ''Aspidorhynchus''. In a 2012 description of WDC CSG 255, researchers proposed that the ''Rhamphorhynchus'' individual had just caught a ''Leptolepides'' while it was swimming. As the ''Leptolepides'' was travelling down its [[pharynx]], a large ''Aspidorhynchus'' would have attacked from below the water, accidentally puncturing the left wing membrane of the ''Rhamphorhynchus'' with its sharp [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] in the process. The teeth in its snout were ensnared in the fibrous tissue of the wing membrane, and as the fish thrashed to release itself the left wing of ''Rhamphorhynchus'' was pulled backward into the distorted position seen in the fossil. The encounter resulted in the death of both individuals, most likely because the two animals sank into an [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] layer in the water body, depriving the fish of oxygen.

Von S\u00f6mmerring concluded that it belonged to an ancient bird. When further preparation uncovered teeth, Graf zu M\u00fcnster sent a cast to Professor [[Georg August Goldfuss]], who recognised it as a pterosaur. Like most pterosaurs described in the mid 19th century, ''Rhamphorhynchus'' was originally considered to be a species of ''[[Pterodactylus]]''. However, at the time, many scientists incorrectly considered ''Ornithocephalus'' to be the valid name for ''Pterodactylus''. This specimen of ''Rhamphorhynchus'' was therefore originally named ''Ornithocephalus M\u00fcnsteri''. This was first mentioned in 1830 by Graf zu M\u00fcnster himself.<ref name=\"munster1830\">M\u00fcnster, G. Graf zu.

He named it ''Ornithocephalus longicaudus'', meaning \"long tail\", to differentiate it from the specimens with short tails (the true specimens of ''Pterodactylus'').<ref name=\"munster1839\">{{Cite journal | last1 = M\u00fcnster | first1 = G.G. | year = 1839 | title = Ueber einige neue Versteinerungen in der lithographischen Schiefer von Baiern | url = | journal = Neues Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Mineralogie, Geologie, und Palaeontologie | volume = 1839 | issue = | pages = 676\u2013682 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ornithocephalus M\u00fcnsteri.jpg|thumb|left|Holotype ''R. munsteri'' skull as illustrated in 1851]]\nIn 1845, [[Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer|Hermann von Meyer]] officially emended the original species ''Ornithocephalus m\u00fcnsteri'' to ''Pterodactylus m\u00fcnsteri'', since the name ''Pterodactylus'' had been by that point recognized as having priority over ''Ornithocephalus''.<ref name=\"vonmeyer1845\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = H. von. | year = 1845 | title = System der fossilen Saurier [Taxonomy of fossil saurians] | url = | journal = Neues Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Mineralogie, Geognosie, Geologie und Petrefakten-Kunde | volume = 1845 | issue = | pages = 278\u2013285 }}</ref> In a subsequent 1846 paper describing a new species of long-tailed 'pterodactyl', von Meyer decided that the long-tailed forms of ''Pterodactylus'' were different enough from the short-tailed forms to warrant placement in a [[subgenus]], and he named his new species ''Pterodactylus (Rhamphorhynchus) gemmingi'' after a specimen owned by collector Captain [[Carl Eming von Gemming]] that was later by von Gemming sold for three hundred guilders to the [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]].<ref name=\"vonmeyer1846\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = H. von. | year = 1846 | title = ''Pterodactylus (Rhamphorhynchus) gemmingi'' aus dem Kalkschiefer von Solenhofen | url = | journal = Palaeontographica | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 1\u201320 }}</ref> It was not until 1847 that von Meyer elevated ''Rhamphorhynchus'' to a full-fledged genus, and officially included in it both long-tailed species of ''Pterodactylus'' known at the time, ''R. longicaudus'' (the original species preserving a long tail) and ''R. gemmingi''.<ref name=\"vonmeyer1847\">Meyer, H. von.

Bennett's paper did not cover the British and African species, though he suggested that these should be considered indeterminate members of the family [[Rhamphorhynchidae]] and not necessarily species of ''Rhamphorhynchus'' itself.

However, in a 1995 paper, Bennett argued that these \"species\" actually represent year-classes of a single species, ''Rhamphorhynchus muensteri'', from [[flaplings]] to adults. Following from this interpretation, Bennett found several notable changes that occurred in ''R. muensteri'' as the animal aged.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n\nJuvenile ''Rhamphorhynchus'' had relatively short skulls with large eyes, and the toothless beak-like tips of the jaws were shorter in juveniles than adults, with rounded, blunt lower jaw tips eventually becoming slender and pointed as the animals grew. Adult ''Rhamphorhynchus'' also developed a strong upward \"hook\" at the end of the lower jaw. The number of teeth remained constant from juvenile to adult, though the teeth became relatively shorter and stockier as the animals grew, possibly to accommodate larger and more powerful prey. The pelvic and pectoral girdles fused as the animals aged, with full pectoral fusion attained by one year of age.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n\nThe shape of the tail vane also changed across various age classes of ''Rhamphorhynchus''. In juveniles, the vane was shallow relative to the tail and roughly oval, or \"[[Scalpel|lancet]]-shaped\". As growth progressed, the tail vane became [[rhomboid|diamond]]-shaped, and finally [[triangle|triangular]] in the largest individuals.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n[[File:Rhamphorhynchus intermedius.jpg|thumb|''R. intermedius'', a small specimen that might be a juvenile of ''R. muensteri'']]\nThe smallest known ''Rhamphorhynchus'' specimen has a wingspan of only 290 millimeters; however, it is likely that even such a small individual was capable of flight. Bennett examined two possibilities for hatchlings: that they were [[altricial]], requiring some period of parental care before leaving the nest, or that they were [[precocial]], hatching with sufficient size and ability for flight. If precocious, Bennett suggested that clutches would be small, with only one or two eggs laid per clutch, to compensate for the relatively large size of the hatchings. Bennett did not speculate on which possibility was more likely, though the discovery of a pterosaur embryo (''[[Avgodectes]]'') with strongly ossified bones suggests that pterosaurs in general were precocial, able to fly soon after hatching with minimal parental care.<ref name=wz05>{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=X. |author2=Zhou, Z. |year=2004 |title=Pterosaur embryo from the Early Cretaceous |journal=Nature |volume=429 |pages=623 |doi=10.1038/429621a |pmid=15190343 |issue=6992}}</ref> This theory was contested by a [[Histology|histological]] study of ''Rhamphorhynchus'' that showed the initial rapid growth was followed by a prolonged period of slow growth.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Prondvai | first1 = E. | last2 = Stein | first2 = K. | last3 = \u0150si | first3 = A. | last4 = Sander | first4 = M.

He found that the average growth rate during the first year of life for ''Rhamphorhynchus'' was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate in [[alligator]]s. Growth likely slowed considerably after sexual maturity, so it would have taken more than three years to attain maximum adult size.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n\nThis growth rate is much slower than the rate seen in large [[Pterodactyloidea|pterodactyloid]] pterosaurs, such as ''[[Pteranodon]]'', which attained near-adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had ''determinate growth'', meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing. Previous assumptions of rapid growth rate in rhamphorhynchoids were based on the assumption that they needed to be [[warm-blooded]] to sustain active flight. Warm-blooded animals, like modern [[bird]]s and [[bat]]s, normally show rapid growth to adult size and determinate growth. Because there is no evidence for either in ''Rhamphorhynchus'', Bennett considered his findings consistent with an [[ectotherm]]ic metabolism, though he recommended more studies needed to be done. Cold-blooded ''Rhamphorhynchus'', Bennett suggested, may have basked in the sun or worked their muscles to accumulate enough energy for bouts of flight, and cooled to ambient temperature when not active to save energy, like modern [[reptile]]s.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n\n===Swimming===\n[[File:Rhamphorhynchus eating Plesioteuthis.jpg|thumb|''R. muensteri'' catching a ''[[Plesioteuthis]]'' squid]]\nThough ''Rhamphorhynchus'' is often depicted as an aerial piscivore, recent evidence suggests that, much like most modern aquatic birds, it probably foraged while swimming. Like several [[pteranodontia]]ns it has hatchet-shaped deltopectoral crests, a short torso and short legs, all features associated with water based launching in pterosaurs. Its feet are broad and large, being useful for propulsion, and the predicted floating position is adequate by pterosaur standards.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Witton | first1 = M.

Both researchers noted that these two groups of specimens were found in roughly a 1:1 ratio, and interpreted them as different sexes.<ref name=\"wellnhofer1975\"/><ref name=\"koh1937\"/> Bennett tested for sexual dimorphism in ''Rhamphorhynchus'' by using a statistical analysis, and found that the specimens did indeed group together into small-headed and large-headed sets. However, without any known variation in the actual form of the bones or soft tissue (morphological differences), he found the case for sexual dimorphism inconclusive.<ref name=\"bennett1995\"/>\n\n===Head orientation===\n[[File:Rhamphorynchus gemmingi jconway.jpg|thumb|Depiction by John Conway]]\nIn 2003, a team of researchers led by [[Lawrence Witmer]] studied the brain anatomy of several types of pterosaurs, including ''Rhamphorhynchus muensteri'', using endocasts of the brain they retrieved by performing [[CT scan|CAT scans]] of fossil skulls. Using comparisons to modern animals, they were able to estimate various physical attributes of pterosaurs, including relative head orientation during flight and coordination of the wing membrane muscles. Witmer and his team found that ''Rhamphorhynchus'' held its head parallel to the ground due to the orientation of the ''osseous labyrinth'' of the [[inner ear]], which helps animals detect [[Sense of balance|balance]]. In contrast, pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as ''[[Anhanguera (pterosaur)|Anhanguera]]'', appear to have normally held their heads at a downward angle, both in flight and while on the ground.<ref name=\"witmeretal2004\">Witmer, L.M., S.

In one of these specimens, the jaws of an ''Aspidorhynchus'' pass through the wings of the ''Rhamphorhynchus'' specimen. The ''Rhamphorhynchus'' also has the remains of a small fish, possibly ''[[Leptolepides]]'', in its throat. This slab, cataloged as WDC CSG 255, may represent two levels of predation; one by ''Rhamphorhynchus'' and one by ''Aspidorhynchus''. In a 2012 description of WDC CSG 255, researchers proposed that the ''Rhamphorhynchus'' individual had just caught a ''Leptolepides'' while it was swimming. As the ''Leptolepides'' was travelling down its [[pharynx]], a large ''Aspidorhynchus'' would have attacked from below the water, accidentally puncturing the left wing membrane of the ''Rhamphorhynchus'' with its sharp [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] in the process. The teeth in its snout were ensnared in the fibrous tissue of the wing membrane, and as the fish thrashed to release itself the left wing of ''Rhamphorhynchus'' was pulled backward into the distorted position seen in the fossil. The encounter resulted in the death of both individuals, most likely because the two animals sank into an [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] layer in the water body, depriving the fish of oxygen. The two may have been preserved together as the weight of the head of ''Aspidorhynchus'' held down the much lighter body of ''Rhamphorhynchus''.<ref name=FT12>{{cite journal |last=Frey |first=E. |author2=Tischlinger, H. |year=2012 |title=The Late Jurassic pterosaur ''Rhamphorhynchus'', a frequent victim of the ganoid fish ''Aspidorhynchus''? |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=e31945 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031945 |pmid=22412850 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0031945 |pmc=3296705}}</ref>\n\n==Species==\n[[File:Ramphorhynchus sp., view 1, Late Late Jurassic, Tithonian Age, Solnhofen Lithographic Limestone, Eichstatt, Bavaria, Germany - Houston Museum of Natural Science - DSC01862.JPG|thumb|''Rhamphorhynchus'' sp., Houston Museum of Natural Science]]\n[[File:Rhamphorhynchus gemmingi holotype.JPG|thumb|Holotype of ''R. gemmingi'', Teylers Museum, Haarlem]]\n[[File:Rhamphorhynchus Lauer.jpg|thumb|''R. muensteri'', Lauer Foundation for Paleontology]]\n[[File:Rhamphorhynchus gemmingi pterosaur.jpg|thumb|''Rhamphorhynchus gemmingi'' from the travelling exhibit \"Paleomania\"<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/iminytravellingexhibits/lucy-the-story-of-human-origins Paleomania] , International Museum Institute</ref>]]\nA large number of ''Rhamphorhynchus'' species have been named, but are currently considered year-classes of ''R. muensteri'' by most researchers.

He was born in the village of Ambaria in [[Madhupur Upazila]], [[Tangail]], [[Bangladesh]]. He was educated at the [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency University]] in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. He built the Hemnagar Palace, which later sheltered freedom fighters during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh War of Liberation]].\n\n==Background==\nHemchandra Chowdhury's grandfather, Padmalochon Banerjee, was a [[Zamindar]] landlord. In 1848 he bought two pieces of property from Bhairab Chandra, the Zamindar of Puthuria Pargana. Hemchandra's father, Kalichandra banerjee, bought the remaining four pieces of property from Chandra in 1855, after his death.\n\nAfter the death of his father, Hemchandra banerjee, with the [[Maharaja]] of [[Muktagachha Upazila|Muktagacha]], bought 85 thousand acres of land.\n\nHemchandra was also known as a poet and lyricist. He also wrote a few books of poetry, and built a stage for exhibition of drama within his residence.\n\n\n\n==Social Work and Freedom Struggle==\nHemchandra Chowdhury left his home village of Ambaria in 1880, and built a Rajbari or palace in the village of Subarnkhali in the [[Jhawail Union|Jawail Union]] administrative area, in [[Gopalpur Upazila]]. In 1905, Chowdhury helped to develop the railways between towns and villages across Bangladesh, such as [[Mymensingh]]. This also improved links between the rural communities and major cities like [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and [[Dhaka]]. He also built the first concrete road in Gopalpur Upazila, known as the Hemnagar-Gopalpur-Amberia road.\n\nHe was known as a benevolent king, and built roads, hospitals and bridges for the welfare of his people. He established the Shashimukhi English High School,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://deb114211.dhakaeducationboard.gov.bd/47803/staff-picture.html|title=HEMNAGAR SHASHI MUKHI HIGH SCHOOL|website=deb114211.dhakaeducationboard.gov.bd|access-date=2018-02-04}}</ref> named after his mother, in order to expand educational opportunities.

To enable access to drinking water to the public, many wells and ponds were built at road junctions. He also built iron bridges for the pilgrims of the [[Chandranath Temple]] in [[Sitakunda]].[[File:Hemnagar Rajbari 02.jpg|thumb|Exterior view of the Hemnagar Rajbari, located in [[Gopalpur Upazila]].|alt=]]During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], the Hemnagar Rajbari was used as a shelter for freedom fighters, and helped with humanitarian aid.[[File: Hemnagar Rajbari 05.jpg|thumb|Pillars outside the Hemnagar Rajbari]]\n\n==Buildings==\nChowdhury constructed the Hemnagar Rajbari in 1890, a two-storied palace in Shimlapara, located three kilometres south-east of Subarnakhali. The palace was sometimes referred to as 'Parir Dalan', which translates to \"the Building of the Fairy\". The house is made up of 100 rooms, built of expensive glass imported from [[Delhi]] and Calcutta. It was built on 60 acres of land, and the property includes zoos, [[Durga Puja|Durja Puja]] [[pandal]]s and flower gardens. In the front palace there is a two-story theatre, and out the front there is a large pond with paved [[ghat]]s. He built bungalows near the Rajbari, with a 24-hour chowkidar (night watchman), and surrounded them with high walls with flower gardens inside. Here his relatives and British officials from Calcutta stayed, as well as entertained. The area it was built in was called '[[Hemnagar Union|Hemnagar]]', named after Chowdhury. Currently the Hemnagar College<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nubd.info/college/college.php?code=5311|title=National University :: College Details|website=www.nubd.info|access-date=2018-02-04}}</ref> is located inside the house, established in 1979.\n\n==Death ==\nHemchandra Chowdhury died in [[Varanasi]] in 1925. At the time of his death, he was 92 years old. After this in 1946, his descendants crossed the country in fear of riots during the [[Partition of India|Partition of India and Pakistan]].\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter Hemchandra Chowdhury's death, his successors crossed the country in fear of communal riots during the partition of India and Pakistan in 1946. Shyamkanta Ganguly and his son Kamal Ganguly went to Hemnagar, but during the war of 1965, they also emigrated. During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh War of Liberation]], the Rajbari of Hemanagar was used as a shelter for the freedom fighters.\n\nHis descendants currently live in parts of Bangladesh and West Bengal. In West Bengal, they married into [[Kalibabur Bari|Maharaja (King) Kaliprasad Mukhopadhayay's family]] and the [[Tagore family]], of which [[Rabindranath Tagore]] became the first Asian to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\nHis great-granddaughter, Indrani Roy (1943-2016), was part of the first generation of feminist Bengali poets writing after the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal]], and one of the founding members of the Aurobindo Nari Chetana Mancha (The Aurobindo Society for Women's Empowerment), a feminist writers' society in Calcutta under the Sri Aurobindo Foundation for Indian Culture (SAFIC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://safic.aurosociety.org/|title=Sri Aurobindo Foundation for Indian Culture (SAFIC)|website=safic.aurosociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}</ref> named after [[Sri Aurobindo]], the Indian political philosopher. Roy's family lives in the Ballygunge,Naihati area of [[Kolkata|Kolkata, India] & jabalpur[Madhya pradesh, India], and visits the [[Kalibabur Bari|Janai Palace]] for festivities during [[Durga Puja]]. The festivities have continued since [[Kalibabur Bari|1234]], when Maharaja Kaliprasad Mukhopadhayay, a Dewan of the East India Company built the Janai Palace near the bank of Saraswati River. \n\n\nRoy's granddaughter, also a poet, currently works as a journalist in London. Two of Roy\u2019s granddaughters moved to the United States in the 1960\u2019s from Kolkata settling in Seattle, Washington and Chicago, Illinois. Both of Roy\u2019s great grandsons were both in the United States; one working in the Obama Administration as an aid and the other as an investment banker. As of 2020, both run technology companies in Seattle and San Francisco. \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chowdhury, Hem Chandra}}\n[[Category:Businesspeople from Kolkata]]\n[[Category:Indian real estate businesspeople]]\n[[Category:1833 births]]\n[[Category:1915 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=September 2018}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name               = Hemchandra Chowdhury\n| image              = Hemnagar Rajbari 01.jpg\n| alt                = Hem Babu\n| caption            = Hemnagar Palace, built by Hem Chandra Chowdhury\n| birth_name         = Hem Chandra\n| birth_date         = 1833\n| birth_place        = Ambaria, Madhupur, [[Tangail]], Bangladesh\n| death_date         = 1915\n| death_place        = Calcutta, India\n| resting_place      = [[Calcutta]], India\n| nationality        = [[Bangladesh|Bengali]]\n| education          = [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]]\n| alma_mater         = \n| title              = King of Hemnagar, Bangladesh\n}}\n\nHemchandra Chowdhury (1833-1915)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chowdhury,_Hemchandra|title=Chowdhury, Hemchandra - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-04}}</ref> was a [[Bangladesh]]i king, educator, builder and social worker.

In West Bengal, they married into [[Kalibabur Bari|Maharaja (King) Kaliprasad Mukhopadhayay's family]] and the [[Tagore family]], of which [[Rabindranath Tagore]] became the first Asian to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\nHis great-granddaughter, Indrani Roy (1943-2016), was part of the first generation of feminist Bengali poets writing after the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal]], and one of the founding members of the Aurobindo Nari Chetana Mancha (The Aurobindo Society for Women's Empowerment), a feminist writers' society in Calcutta under the Sri Aurobindo Foundation for Indian Culture (SAFIC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://safic.aurosociety.org/|title=Sri Aurobindo Foundation for Indian Culture (SAFIC)|website=safic.aurosociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}</ref> named after [[Sri Aurobindo]], the Indian political philosopher. Roy's family lives in the Ballygunge,Naihati area of [[Kolkata|Kolkata, India] & jabalpur[Madhya pradesh, India], and visits the [[Kalibabur Bari|Janai Palace]] for festivities during [[Durga Puja]]. The festivities have continued since [[Kalibabur Bari|1234]], when Maharaja Kaliprasad Mukhopadhayay, a Dewan of the East India Company built the Janai Palace near the bank of Saraswati River. \n\n\nRoy's granddaughter, also a poet, currently works as a journalist in London. Two of Roy\u2019s granddaughters moved to the United States in the 1960\u2019s from Kolkata settling in Seattle, Washington and Chicago, Illinois. Both of Roy\u2019s great grandsons were both in the United States; one working in the Obama Administration and the other an investment banker. As of 2020, both run technology companies in Seattle and San Francisco. \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chowdhury, Hem Chandra}}\n[[Category:Businesspeople from Kolkata]]\n[[Category:Indian real estate businesspeople]]\n[[Category:1833 births]]\n[[Category:1915 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Wikiu08372", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hem_Chandra_Chowdhury"}

It was first broadcast on 10 February 1995.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe episode opens with Richie and Eddie sitting in \"the best seats for the annual [[Hammersmith]] [[riot]]\"\u2014leaning out of their lounge window. While admiring the ongoing violence taking place during what is supposed to be a [[carnival]] parade, Richie and Eddie decide to do some [[looting]] \"when [[Currys]] blows\", with one of the planned items to loot being a TV set. They later return to the flat arguing over the fact that Eddie dropped the TV while being run over by the \"[[riot squad]]\" but, to his excitement, still made away with a [[rubber duck]] that \"came free with the telly.\" Despite missing out on the coveted electrical goods, they still manage to pick up their shopping for the year, over 60 [[Orion (company)|Orion]] [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] (43 being sequestered in the attic), as well as a BBC video camera and tape which Richie stole from a BBC van, justifying the theft by claiming he has every right to as he pays his [[television licence]] fees.\n\nRichie reveals his motivations for the theft. He plans to film a series of [[home movies]], making them both famous, thus leaving them with their \"pick of the [[Woman|birds]].\" After dismissing Eddie's screen pitches (namely a [[remake]] of ''[[9\u00bd Weeks]]'' and the original title ''Nude Birds Go Upstairs To Eddie's Bedroom'') Richie states that instead he intends to film his own [[prime time]] current affairs discussion program, inspired by the successes of \"[[Robert Kilroy-Silk|the sexiest man on TV]].\" As Eddie films Richie (sporting a white wig and a suit) descending the stairs as part of the introduction to a \"studio special report\" on whether [[Parking enforcement officer|traffic wardens]] should be armed, Richie trips and falls down the stairs, through the bathroom door and head-first into the toilet. Eddie then suggests that if he had remembered to turn the camera on they would have had a good video to send into the fictional TV show ''[[Jeremy Beadle]]'s [[You've Been Framed!|Viciously Hilarious Domestic Violent Incidents]]''. Newly inspired, Richie instead decides to return to the [[living room|drawing room]] and agrees with Eddie's idea to film an (orchestrated) accident in which \"you accidentally catch a dart in your head\".\n\nEddie is next shown (dressed in an apron) wandering into their kitchen as he works at the stove, loudly expressing his hope that \"no viciously hilarious accidents happen!\" Richie ruins the first take by inadvertently throwing a dart into Eddie's eye instead of his forehead, necessitating a second take. A more subdued Eddie (who breaks the fourth wall to protest that in spite of the ostensible ordinariness of the day he has now lost the sight in one eye) opens the next take with Richie successfully managing to hit the target in the forehead this time. Compounding the injury by \"accidentally\" pouring a frying pan of burning fat over his body Eddie, after being set alight by Richie, hurls himself through the window.\n\nAs Eddie is recovering in some pain, Richie sheepishly reveals that the filming moved him to tears. Not because of Eddie's performance but, rather, due to the realisation that he had forgotten to put the tape into the camera. Eddie flatly refuses Richie's demand for a re-shoot as Richie angrily states that a blank tape is useless to him, only for this to give him an idea\u2014they will instead send a completely blank tape to Beadle's show, claiming they had forgotten that it should have contained footage of Richie's wife \"sewing her head to the curtains.\" Richie suggests they check the tape is blank, finding a use for the VCRs Eddie had stolen. Eddie spends an entire year getting the video up and running (having wasted months simply unwrapping it) and only finishes the eve of the following year's carnival and just after Richie returns from a holiday abroad. Despite Eddie's efforts leading the VCR to explode once the power is connected, they manage to get the tape up and running with the aid of an unfortunate repair man.\n\nWhile eventually viewing the tape, they find out that, despite the recording being made in mute, it contains a film of the then [[John Major|Prime Minister]] having an [[affair]]. Richie hits upon the idea of using the tape for [[blackmail]] and phones the government stating their intentions. In the course of the conversation Richie accidentally uses his real name and hangs up in terror. He tells Eddie to phone instead and use an assumed name leading Eddie to ring and give the name \"Richard Richard\" when asked. As a result, the building is soon surrounded by the [[Special Air Service|SAS]]. Eddie suggests turning the siege into a chance to \"eat like kings\" and demand food. This does not go according to plan and merely results in a hail of bullets perforating the flat. In response to the SAS commander's demand to \"throw down the video\" Eddie complies by throwing the entire machine out of the window, landing on their besiegers in the process. As Richie and Eddie debate the meaning of the last words they heard over the phone (\"Go, A-squad!\") several masked SAS operatives burst into the flat. They open fire as the panicked flatmates utter their last words\u2014\"Oh, shit!\"\n\n==Continuity and production errors==\n* There is a scene where Richie asks Eddie if it is so good to get his feet up. Eddie responds with \"No, I'm not that pervy\", with Richie saying \"Are you not?\". In an out-take (seen on the ''Bottom Fluff'' video), Edmondson says \"No. Do you know... I've forgotten my next line...!\". In the next take, he forgets to say \"no\", and it looks as if Eddie ignored Richie's question.\n*Eddie says that he is going to write to his [[Member of Parliament|MP]], [[Tony Blair]] (who was [[Leader of the Opposition]] at the time of broadcast).

Significantly, the expanded gene families were only previously known to exhibit replicative behaviour within vertebrates.<ref name=\"Albertin 220\u2013224\"/> The first gene family was identified as the [[Protocadherin]]s which are attributed to neuron development. Protocadherins function as cell adhesion molecules, essential for [[Synaptogenesis|synaptic specificity]]. The mechanism for Protocadherin gene family replication in vertebrates is attributed to complex splicing, or cutting and pasting, from a locus. Following the sequencing of the California two-spot octopus, researchers found that the Prorocadherin gene family in Cephalopods has expanded in the genome due to [[Tandem exon duplication|tandem gene duplication]]. The different replication mechanisms for Protocadherin genes indicate an independent evolution of Protocadherin gene expansion in vertebrates and invertebrates.<ref name=\"Albertin 220\u2013224\"/>\u00a0 Analysis of individual Cephalopod Protocadherin genes indicate independent evolution between species of Cephalopod. A species of shore squid [[Longfin inshore squid|Doryteuthis pealeii]] with expanded Protocadherin gene families differ significantly from those of the California two-spot octopus suggesting gene expansion did not occur before [[speciation]] within Cephalopods. Despite different mechanisms for gene expansion, the two-spot octopus Protocadherin genes were more similar to vertebrates than squid, suggesting a [[convergent evolution]] mechanism.

Significantly, the expanded gene families were only previously known to exhibit replicative behaviour within vertebrates.<ref name=\"Albertin 220\u2013224\"/> The first gene family was identified as the [[Protocadherin]]s which are attributed to neuron development. Protocadherins function as cell adhesion molecules, essential for [[Synaptogenesis|synaptic specificity]]. The mechanism for Protocadherin gene family replication in vertebrates is attributed to complex splicing, or cutting and pasting, from a locus. Following the sequencing of the California two-spot octopus, researchers found that the Prorocadherin gene family in Cephalopods has expanded in the genome due to [[Tandem exon duplication|tandem gene duplication]]. The different replication mechanisms for Protocadherin genes indicate an independent evolution of Protocadherin gene expansion in vertebrates and invertebrates.<ref name=\"Albertin 220\u2013224\"/>\u00a0 Analysis of individual Cephalopod Protocadherin genes indicate independent evolution between species of Cephalopod. A species of shore squid [[Longfin inshore squid|Doryteuthis pealeii]] with expanded Protocadherin gene families differ significantly from those of the California two-spot octopus suggesting gene expansion did not occur before [[speciation]] within Cephalopods. Despite different mechanisms for gene expansion, the two-spot octopus Protocadherin genes were more similar to vertebrates than squid, suggesting a [[convergent evolution]] mechanism. The second gene family known as C2H2 are small proteins that function as [[Zinc finger transcription factor|zinc transcription factors]]. C2H2 are understood to moderate DNA, RNA and protein functions within the cell.<ref name=\"O\u2019Brien 700\"/>\n\nThe sequenced California two spot octopus genome also showed a significant presence of [[transposable element]]s as well as transposon expression.

The opening in the [[wall]] can be referred to as a \"portal\". A door's essential and primary purpose is to provide [[security]] by controlling access to the portal (doorway). [[Convention (norm)|Conventionally]], it is a panel that fits into the portal of a [[building]], [[room]], or [[vehicle]]. Doors are generally made of a material suited to the task of which it is to perform. Doors are commonly attached by hinges within the portal but can be moved by other means such as slides or counterbalancing.\n\nThe door may be moved in various ways (at angles away from the portal, by sliding on a plane parallel to the frame, by folding in angles on a parallel plane, or by spinning along an axis at the center of the frame) to allow or prevent ingress or egress. In most cases, a door's interior matches its exterior side. But in other cases (e.g., a [[car door|vehicle door]]) the two sides are radically different.\n\n[[File:Clevelandart 1964.91.jpg|thumb|False door of [[Nykara]], c. 2408 BC, painted limestone, 168 x 111.5 x 6 cm, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]\n\nDoors often incorporate [[lock (security device)|locking]] mechanisms to ensure that only some people can open them. Doors can have devices such as knockers or [[doorbell]]s by which people outside can announce their presence and summon someone either to open the door for them or give permission to open and enter. Apart from providing access into and out of a space, doors can have the secondary functions of ensuring privacy by preventing unwanted attention from outsiders, of separating areas with different functions, of allowing [[light]] to pass into and out of a space, of controlling [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] or [[air draft]]s so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled, of dampening [[noise]], and of blocking the spread of [[fire]].\n\nDoors may have [[aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[symbol]]ic, [[ritual]]istic purposes. To be given the [[key (lock)|key]] to a door can signify a change in status from outsider to insider.<ref>See, for example the doorkeeping duties of the [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]].</ref> Doors and doorways frequently appear in [[literature]] and [[the arts]] with [[metaphor]]ical or [[allegory|allegorical]] import as a portent of change.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section contains verbatim text from the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' (1911) article on doors. See References.-->\n\nThe earliest in records are those represented in the paintings of some [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs, in which they are shown as single or double doors, each in a single piece of wood. Doors were once believed to be the literal doorway to the afterlife, and some doors leading to important places included designs of the afterlife. In Egypt, where the climate is intensely dry, there was no fear of their warping, but in other countries it was necessary to frame them, which according to [[Vitruvius]] (iv. 6.) was done with stiles (sea/si) and rails ''(see: [[Frame and panel]])'': the spaces enclosed being filled with panels (tympana) let into grooves made in the stiles and rails. The stiles were the vertical boards, one of which, [[Mortise and tenon|tenoned]] or [[hinge]]d, is known as the hanging stile, the other as the middle or meeting stile. The horizontal cross pieces are the top rail, bottom rail, and middle or intermediate rails.\n\nThe most ancient doors were made of timber, such as those referred to in the Biblical depiction of [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon's temple]] being in [[olive wood]] (I Kings vi. 31-35), which were carved and overlaid with gold. The doors dwelt upon in [[Homer]] appear to have been cased in silver or brass. Besides olive wood, [[elm (wood)|elm]], [[cedar (wood)|cedar]], [[oak (wood)|oak]] and [[cypress (wood)|cypress]] were used. A 5,000-year-old door has been found by archaeologists in [[Switzerland]].<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ Swiss archaeologists find 5000-year-old door] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108222716/http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ |date=2010-11-08 }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 550\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = stone door.jpg\n| width1 =\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Stone door in [[Hampi]] ([[India]])\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Door-Post Socket (4690606141).jpg\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = A massive door socket from [[Persepolis]] (modern-day [[Iran]])\n}}\n\nAll ancient doors were hung by pivots at the top and bottom of the hanging stile which worked in sockets in the [[lintel]] and [[sill plate|sill]], the latter being always in some hard stone such as [[basalt]] or [[granite]]. Those found at [[Nippur]] by Dr. Hilprecht dating from 2000 BC were in [[dolerite]]. The tenons of the [[gate]]s at [[Balawat]] were sheathed with bronze (now in the [[British Museum]]). These doors or gates were hung in two leaves, each about {{convert|2.54|m|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high; they were encased with bronze bands or strips, {{convert|25.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, covered with [[repouss\u00e9]] decoration of figures. The wood doors would seem to have been about {{convert|7.62|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, but the hanging stile was over {{convert|360|mm|in}} diameter. Other sheathings of various sizes in bronze have been found, which proves this to have been the universal method adopted to protect the wood pivots. In the [[Hauran]] in Syria, where timber is scarce the doors were made in stone, and one measuring {{convert|1.63|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|0.79|m|in|abbr=on}} is in the British Museum; the band on the meeting stile shows that it was one of the leaves of a double door. At Kuffeir near Bostra in Syria, Burckhardt found stone doors, {{convert|2.74|to|3.048|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, being the entrance doors of the town. In [[Etruria]] many stone doors are referred to by Dennis.\n\n[[File:Plaster cast of folding doors, Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] folding doors at [[Pompeii]], from the 1st century AD, similar with Neoclassical doors from the 19th century]]\n\nAncient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] doors were either single doors, double doors, triple doors, [[sliding door]]s or [[folding door]]s, in the last case the leaves were hinged and folded back. In [[Eumachia]], is a painting of a door with three leaves. In the tomb of Theron at [[Agrigentum]] there is a single four-panel door carved in stone. In the Blundell collection is a [[bas-relief]] of a temple with double doors, each leaf with five panels. Among existing examples, the bronze doors in the [[Santi Cosma e Damiano|church of SS. Cosmas and Damiano]], in Rome, are important examples of Roman metal work of the best period; they are in two leaves, each with two panels, and are framed in bronze. Those of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] are similar in design, with narrow horizontal panels in addition, at the top, bottom and middle. Two other bronze doors of the Roman period are in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Lateran Basilica]].\n\nThe Greek scholar [[Heron of Alexandria]] created the earliest known automatic door in the 1st century AD during the era of [[Roman Egypt]].<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 162\">Needham, Joseph.

The doors of the [[church of the Nativity]] at [[Bethlehem]] (6th century) are covered with plates of bronze, cut out in patterns. Those of [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]], of the 8th and 9th century, are wrought in bronze, and the west doors of the cathedral of [[Aachen|Aix-la-Chapelle]] (9th century), of similar manufacture, were probably brought from Constantinople, as also some of those in [[St Mark's Basilica|St. Marks, Venice]]. The bronze doors on the Aachen Cathedral in Germany date back to about 800 AD. Bronze baptistery doors at the Cathedral of Florence were completed in 1423 by Ghiberti.<ref>Architecture, European Copper Institute; {{cite web |url=http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009005711/http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |archivedate=2012-10-09 }}</ref> ''(For more information, see: [[Copper in architecture]]).''\n\n[[File:T\u00fcr, Villa Boscoreale.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] wall painting of an ornate door, in the [[Villa Boscoreale]] ([[Italy]]), from the 1st century AD]]\n\nOf the 11th and 12th centuries there are numerous examples of bronze doors, the earliest being one at [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]] (1015). The Hildesheim design affected the concept of [[Gniezno Doors|Gniezno door]] in Poland. Of others in South Italy and Sicily, the following are the finest: in Sant Andrea, [[Amalfi]] (1060); [[Salerno]] (1099); [[Canosa]] (1111); [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], two doors (1119 and 1124); [[Ravello]] (1179), by Barisano of Trani, who also made doors for [[Trani]] cathedral; and in [[Monreale]] and [[Duomo di Pisa|Pisa]] cathedrals, by Bonano of Pisa. In all these cases the hanging stile had pivots at the top and bottom. The exact period when the hinge was substituted is not quite known, but the change apparently brought about another method of strengthening and decorating doors, viz, with wrought-iron bands of infinite varieties of design. As a rule three bands from which the ornamental work springs constitute the hinges, which have rings outside the hanging stiles fitting on to vertical tenons run into the masonry or wooden frame. There is an early example of the 12th century in [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]]; in France the metal work of the doors of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] at Paris is perhaps the most beautiful in execution, but examples are endless throughout France and England.\n\nReturning to Italy, the most celebrated doors are those of the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)]], which together with the door frames are all in bronze, the borders of the latter being perhaps the most remarkable: the modeling of the figures, birds and foliage of the south doorway, by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330), and of the east doorway by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]] (1425\u20131452), are of great beauty; in the north door (1402\u20131424) Ghiberti adopted the same scheme of design for the paneling and figure subjects in them as Andrea Pisano, but in the east door the rectangular panels are all filled, with bas-reliefs, in which Scripture subjects are illustrated with innumerable figures, these being probably the gates of Paradise of which [[Michelangelo]] speaks.\n\nThe doors of the mosques in [[Cairo]] were of two kinds; those which, externally, were cased with sheets of bronze or iron, cut out in decorative patterns, and incised or inlaid, with bosses in relief; and those in wood, which were framed with interlaced designs of the square and diamond, this latter description of work being [[Copt]]ic in its origin. The doors of the palace at [[Palermo]], which were made by Saracenic workmen for the [[Normans]], are fine examples and in good preservation. A somewhat similar decorative class of door to these latter is found in [[Verona]], where the edges of the stiles and rails are beveled and notched.\n\n[[File:\u0414\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f, \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433.JPG|thumb|Glass door decorated with [[Art Nouveau]] elements, from the [[Singer House]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)]]\n\nIn the Renaissance period the Italian doors are quite simple, their architects trusting more to the doorways for effect; but in France and Germany the contrary is the case, the doors being elaborately carved, especially in the [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] periods, and sometimes with architectural features such as columns and entablatures with pediment and niches, the doorway being in plain masonry. While in Italy the tendency was to give scale by increasing the number of panels, in France the contrary seems to have been the rule; and one of the great doors at [[Fontainebleau]], which is in two leaves, is entirely carried out as if consisting of one great panel only.\n\nThe earliest [[Renaissance]] doors in France are those of the [[Aix Cathedral|cathedral of St. Sauveur]] at [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]] (1503). In the lower panels there are figures {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[niche (architecture)|niches]], and in the upper panels a double range of niches with figures about {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high with canopies over them, all carved in [[cedrus|cedar]]. The south door of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] is in some respects the finest in France; the upper panels are carved in high relief with figure subjects and canopies over them. The doors of the church at [[Gisors]] (1575) are carved with figures in niches subdivided by classic pilasters superimposed. In St. Maclou at [[Rouen]] are three magnificently carved doors; those by Jean Goujon have figures in niches on each side, and others in a group of great beauty in the center. The other doors, probably about forty to fifty years later, are enriched with [[bas-reliefs]], landscapes, figures and elaborate interlaced borders.\n\n[[NASA]]'s [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at the Kennedy Space Center contains the four largest doors. The Vehicle Assembly Building was originally built for the assembly of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions' [[Saturn V|Saturn]] vehicles and was then used to support Space Shuttle operations. Each of the four doors are 139 meters (456 feet) high.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/718659main_VAB.pdf|title=Vehicle Assembly Building Fact Sheet|website=NASA|publisher=NASA|access-date=2016-06-03|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011224909/https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/718659main_VAB.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-11}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest door in England can be found in [[Westminster Abbey]] and dates from 1050.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4743899.stm | work=BBC News | title=Abbey oak door 'Britain's oldest' | date=2005-08-03 | accessdate=2010-05-01 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620190404/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4743899.stm | archivedate=2006-06-20 }}</ref> In England in the 17th century the door panels were raised with [[bolection]] or projecting moldings, sometimes richly carved, round them; in the 18th century the [[molding (decorative)|moldings]] worked on the [[stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] were carved with the egg and tongue [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]].\n\n== Design and styles ==\n[[File:Floren\u00e7a - Port\u00f5es do Para\u00edso (146).jpg|thumb|250px|Door of the [[Florence Baptistery]] called ''The Gates of Paradise'', 1425\u20131452, gilded bronze, height: 5.2 m]]\n[[File:Kunsthistorisches Museum entrance.jpg|thumb|250px|Entrance of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] ([[Vienna]], [[Austria]])]]\nThere are many kinds of doors, with different purposes. The most common type is the '''single-leaf door''', which consists of a single rigid panel that fills the doorway. There are many variations on this basic design, such as the '''double-leaf door''' or '''double door and French windows''', which have two adjacent independent panels hinged on each side of the doorway.\n* A '''half door''' or '''[[Dutch door]]'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesnews.co.uk/door-design-ideas |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103193405/http://www.timesnews.co.uk/door-design-ideas/ |archivedate=2018-01-03 }} Door design ideas</ref> or '''stable door''' is divided in half horizontally. Traditionally the top half can be opened to allow a [[horse]] or other animal to be fed, while the bottom half remains closed to keep the animal inside. This style of door has been adapted for homes.\n* '''[[Western saloon|Saloon]] doors''' are a pair of lightweight swing doors often found in public bars, and especially associated with the American west. Saloon doors, also known as '''[[wikt:cafe|cafe]] doors''', often use bidirectional [[hinge]]s that close the door regardless of which direction it is opened by incorporating [[spring (device)|springs]]. Saloon doors that only extend from knee-level to chest-level are known as '''batwing doors'''.\n* A '''blind door''', '''Gibb door''', or '''jib door''' has no visible trim or operable components. It is designed to blend with the adjacent wall in all finishes, and visually to be a part of the wall, a disguised door.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Peter |title=The New and Improved Practical Builder |location=London |publisher=Thomas Kelly|date=1841 |pages=97\u201398}}</ref>\n* A '''French door''' consists of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a '''French window''', as it resembles a door-height [[casement window]]. When a pair of French doors is used as a French window, the application does not generally include a central [[mullion]] (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An [[espagnolette]] bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.\n* A '''[[louvred door]]''' has fixed or movable wooden fins (often called slats or [[louver]]s) which permit open ventilation while preserving privacy and preventing the passage of light to the interior. Being relatively weak structures, they are most commonly used for [[wardrobe]]s and drying rooms, where security is of less importance than good ventilation, although a very similar structure is commonly used to form [[window shutter]]s. Double louvred doors were introduced into ''[[Powel Crosley, Jr.#Seagate in Florida|Seagate]]'', built in Florida in 1929 by Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley, that provided the desired circulation of air with an added degree of privacy in that it is impossible to see through the fins in any direction.\n* A '''composite door''' is a single leaf door that can be solid or with glass, and is usually filled with high density foam. In the United Kingdom, it is common for composite doors to be certified to BS PAS 23/24<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean/|title=What does 'certificated' to PAS 24 actually mean?|work=thecrimepreventionwebsite.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125223650/http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean|archivedate=2014-01-25}}</ref> and be compliant with Secured by Design, an official UK police initiative.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doors and Locks |url=https://www.securedbydesign.com/guidance/standards-explained#doors-and-locks |website=Secured by Design |publisher=Police Crime Prevention Initiative |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>\n* A '''steel security door''' is one which is made from strong steel, often for use on [[Bank vault|vaults]] and [[safe room]]s to withstand attack. These may also be fitted with wooden outer panels to resemble standard internal and external doors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|title=Henleys Security Doors|website=Henleys Security Doors|access-date=25 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530035319/http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|archivedate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n* A '''flush door''' is a completely smooth door, having [[plywood]] or [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] fixed over a light timber frame, the hollow parts of which are often filled with a cardboard core material. Skins can also be made out of hardboards, the first of which was invented by William H Mason in 1924. Called [[Masonite]], its construction involved pressing and steaming wood chips into boards. Flush doors are most commonly employed in the interior of a dwelling, although slightly more substantial versions are occasionally used as exterior doors, especially within hotels and other buildings containing many independent dwellings.\n* A '''moulded door''' has the same structure as that of flush door. The only difference is that the surface material is a moulded skin made of MDF. Skins can also be made out of [[Masonite|hardboards]].\n* A '''ledge and brace door''' often called board and batten doors are made from multiple vertical boards fixed together by two or more horizontal timbers called ledges (or battens)and sometimes kept square by additional diagonal timbers called braces.\n* A '''[[wicket gate|wicket door]]''' is a pedestrian door built into a much larger door allowing access without requiring the opening of the larger door. Examples might be found on the ceremonial door of a cathedral or in a large vehicle door in a garage or hangar.\n* A '''bifold door'''<span id=\"bifold\"></span><!-- The preceding tag is a target for links on other pages, probably including the Dab [[Folding]]. --> is a unit that has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood is the most common material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most commonly made for [[closet]]s, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|title=Front Doors, Garage Doors Insights from The Door Zone|website=The Door Zone|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507074631/http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|archivedate=2017-05-07}}</ref>\n* A '''[[sliding glass door]]''', sometimes called an Arcadia door or patio door, is a door made of [[glass]] that slides open and sometimes has a screen (a removable metal mesh that covers the door).\n* '''Australian doors''' are a pair of plywood swinging doors often found in Australian public houses. These doors are generally red or brown in color and bear a resemblance to the more formal doors found in other British Colonies' public houses.\n* A '''false door''' is a wall decoration that looks like a window. In ancient [[Egyptian architecture]], this was a common element in a tomb, the false door representing a gate to the afterlife. They can also be found in the funerary architecture of the desert tribes (e.g., [[Libya]]n Ghirza).\n* A '''[[Mat|doormat]]''' (also called door mat) is a mat placed typically in front of or behind a door of a home. This practice originated so that mud and dirt would be less prevalent on floors inside a building.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170\" heights=\"170\">\nBronze door, Basilica di San Giovanni, 2013.jpg|[[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] bronze doors of the [[Curia Julia]], now in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] (Rome)\n\nDoorway detail, St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney.jpg|[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] door of the [[St Magnus Cathedral]] ([[Kirkwall]], [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom|UK]])\n\nFile:Door in Morocco, 2010.jpg|An Islamic door decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], in [[Morocco]]\n\nFile:Brooklyn Museum 1994.92 Door with Lock (2).jpg|Door with lock, late 19th or early 20th century, wood with iron, from [[Burkina Faso]], in the [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City)\n\nFile:Amsterdam (NL), Kloveniersburgwal -- 2015 -- 7252.jpg|Door of the Laboratorium voor Artsenijbereidkunde, an example of Dutch [[Renaissance architecture]], in [[Amsterdam]] (the [[Netherlands]])\n\nFile:Bohemian court chancellery door - Vienna.jpg|[[Baroque]] entrance in [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]])\n\nLe portail du Palais Rohan (14456681043).jpg|Detail of a [[Rococo]] of the [[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg|Palais Rohan]] from [[Strasbourg]] (France)\n\nFile:Porte d'entr\u00e9e du palais de Justice de Bruxelles (HDR) - 2043-0077-0.jpg|[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] door of the main entrance of the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] ([[Brussels]], Belgium)\n\nSimple door inside the BCR Headquarters Building, in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|Neoclassical door without ornaments, in the BCR Headquarters Building from Bucharest\n\nFile:Tsentralny District, St Petersburg, Russia - panoramio (259).jpg|[[Egyptian Revival architecture|Egyptian Revival]] door from [[Saint Petersburg]] (Russia)\n\n9, Strada Sp\u0103tarului, Bucharest (Romania) 1.jpg|Double door of a city-house from [[Bucharest]] (Romania)\n\nAn entrance of the National Museum of Romanian History, in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|A door of the [[National Museum of Romanian History]] (Bucharest)\n\nPorte et marquise CCI Nancy.jpg|[[Art Nouveau]] metal and glass door in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (France), with a big transparent [[awning]] above it\n\nFile:Maison Huot de style art nouveau (Nancy) (7965996816).jpg|[[Art Nouveau]] door from Nancy\n\nFile:Tenghua Jiuguan 21 2015-04.JPG|Traditional folding doors in [[The Old Museum of Wisteria]] ([[Changzhou]], China)\n\nFile:Zesp\u00f3\u0142 klasztoru Gandan (39).jpg|A decorated door from the [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery]] (Mongolia)\n</gallery>\n\n== Different types of door mechanism ==\n[[File:Types of doors.png|thumb|The main types of door mechanisms]]\n\n=== Hinged doors ===\nMost doors are [[hinge]]d along one side to allow the door to pivot away from the doorway in one direction, but not the other. The axis of rotation is usually vertical. In some cases, such as hinged [[garage door]]s, the axis may be horizontal, above the door opening.\n\nDoors can be hinged so that the axis of rotation is not in the plane of the door to reduce the space required on the side to which the door opens. This requires a mechanism so that the axis of rotation is on the side other than that in which the door opens. This is sometimes the case in trains or airplanes, such as for the door to the toilet, which opens inward.\n\nA '''swing door''' has special single-action hinges that allow it to open either outwards or inwards, and is usually sprung to keep it closed.\n\n'''French doors''' are derived from an original French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels would be in a casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel at the bottom of the door. It is called a French window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf, and in which the doors may swing out (typically) as well as in.\n\nA '''Mead door''', developed by S Mead of Leicester, swings both ways. It is susceptible to forced entry due to its design.\n\nA '''Dutch door''' or stable door consists of two halves. The top half operates independently from the bottom half. A variant exists in which opening the top part separately is possible, but because the lower part has a lip on the inside, closing the top part, while leaving the lower part open, is not.\n\nA '''garden door''' resembles a French window (with lites), but is more secure because only one door is operable. The hinge of the operating door is next to the adjacent fixed door and the latch is located at the wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an [[espagnolette]] bolt.\n\n=== Sliding doors ===\nIt is often useful to have doors which slide along tracks, often for space or aesthetic considerations.\n\nA '''bypass door''' is a door unit that has two or more sections. The doors can slide in either direction along one axis on parallel overhead tracks, sliding past each other. They are most commonly used in closets, in order to access one side of the closet at a time. The doors in a bypass unit will overlap slightly when viewed from the front, in order not to have a visible gap between them.\n\nDoors which slide inside a wall cavity are called '''[[pocket door]]s'''. This type of door is used in tight spaces where privacy is also required. The door slab is mounted to roller and a track at the top of the door and slides inside a wall.\n\nSliding glass doors are common in many houses, particularly as an entrance to the backyard. Such doors are also popular for use for the entrances to commercial structures, although they are not counted as fire exit doors. The door that moves is called the \"active leaf\", while the door that remains fixed is called the \"inactive leaf\".\n\n=== Rotating doors ===\nA '''[[revolving door]]''' has several wings or leaves, generally four, radiating from a central shaft, forming compartments that rotate about a vertical axis. A revolving door allows people to pass in both directions without colliding, and forms an airlock maintaining a seal between inside and out.\n\nA '''pivot door''', instead of hinges, is supported on a bearing some distance away from the edge, so that there is more or less of a gap on the pivot side as well as the opening side. In some cases the pivot is central, creating two equal openings.\n\n=== High-speed door ===\nA '''[[high-speed door]]''' is a very fast door some with opening speeds of up to 4&nbsp;m/s, mainly used in the industrial sector where the speed of a door has an effect on production logistics, temperature and pressure control. high-speed clean room doors are used in pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames. They guarantee the tightness of all accesses. The powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges. Therefore, they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded.\n\nHigh-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings, generally more than 200,000 a year. They need to be built with heavy-duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function. The door curtain was originally made of PVC, but was later also developed in aluminium and acrylic glass sections. High Speed refrigeration and cold room doors with excellent insulation values was also introduced with the [[Green energy|Green]] and [[Energy saving]] requirements.\n\nIn North America, the Door and Access Systems Manufacturing Association (DASMA) defines high-performance doors as non-residential, powered doors, characterized by rolling, folding, sliding or swinging action, that are either high-cycle (minimum 100 cycles/day) or high-speed (minimum 20 inches(508&nbsp;mm)/second), and two out of three of the following: made-to-order for exact size and custom features, designed to be able to withstand equipment impact (break-away if accidentally hit by vehicle) or designed to sustain heavy usage with minimal maintenance.\n\n=== Automatic ===\n'''[[Automatic door|Automatically opening doors]]''' are powered open and closed either by electricity, spring, or both. There are several methods by which an automatically opening door is activated:\n\n# A [[sensor]] detects traffic is approaching. Sensors for automatic doors are generally:\n#* A [[pressure sensor]] \u2013 e.g., a floor mat which reacts to the pressure of someone standing on it.\n#* An [[infrared]] [[curtain]] or beam which shines invisible light onto sensors; if someone or something blocks the beam the door is triggered open.\n#* A [[motion sensor]] which uses low-power microwave [[radar]] for the same effect.\n#* A remote sensor (e.g. based on infrared or radio waves) can be triggered by a portable [[remote control]], or is installed inside a vehicle. These are popular for garage doors.\n# A [[switch]] is operated manually, perhaps after security checks. This can be a push button switch or a swipe card.\n# The act of pushing or pulling the door triggers the open and close cycle. These are also known as power-assisted doors.\n\nIn addition to activation sensors automatically opening doors are generally fitted with safety sensors. These are usually an infrared curtain or beam, but can be a pressure mat fitted on the swing side of the door. The purpose of the safety sensor is to prevent the door from colliding with an object in its path by stopping or slowing its motion.A mechanism is set in modern automatic doors to ensure that door will be in open state in case of power failure.\n\n=== Others ===\n[[Image:Puertas seccionales.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Sectional doors for industry.]]\n[[File:Torggler evolutiondoor.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|''Evolution Door'', 2013]]\n'''Up-and-over''' or '''overhead''' doors are often used in garages. Instead of hinges it has a mechanism, often [[counterbalance]]d or [[torsion spring|sprung]], that allows it to be lifted so that it rests horizontally above the opening. A [[roller shutter]] or '''sectional overhead door''' is one variant of this type.\n\nA '''[[tambour door]]''' or roller door is an up-and-over door made of narrow horizontal slats and \"rolls\" up and down by sliding along vertical tracks and is typically found in entertainment centres and cabinets.\n\n'''Inward opening doors''' are doors that can only be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a substantial fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards in the event of an emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a switch mechanism, disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the closed position, power is restored.\n\n'''Rebated doors''', a term chiefly used in Britain, are double doors having a lip or overlap (i.e. a [[Rabbet]]) on the vertical edge(s) where they meet. Fire-rating can be achieved with an applied edge-guard or astragal molding on the meeting stile, in accordance with the American [[Fire door]].\n\n'''Evolution Door''' is a trackless door that moves in the same closure level as a sliding door. The system is an invention of the Austrian artist Klemens Torggler. It is a further development of the '''{{ill|Drehplattent\u00fcr|de|Drehplattent\u00fcr|vertical-align=sup}}''' that normally consists of two rotatable, connected panels which move to each other when opening.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|title=Kinematics with MicroStation Ch01C-I Grueblers Criteria for 3D 5 Bar|date=20 February 2014|work=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409090618/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|archivedate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Miersch, 17 rue Nicolas Welter-001.jpg|thumb|250px|Transparent awning in [[Luxembourg]]]]\nArchitectural doors have numerous general and specialized uses. Doors are generally used to separate interior spaces (closets, rooms, etc.) for [[convenience]], [[privacy]], [[safety]], and [[security]] reasons. Doors are also used to secure passages into a building from the exterior, for reasons of [[climate]] control and safety.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nDoors also are applied in more specialized cases:\n* A '''[[blast door|Blast-proof door]]''' is constructed to allow access to a structure as well as to provide protection from the force of explosions.\n* A '''garden door''' is any door that opens to a backyard or [[garden]]. This term is often used specifically for French windows, double French doors (with lites instead of panels), in place of a [[sliding glass door]]. The term also may refer to what is known as ''patio doors''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* A jib door is a concealed door, whose surface reflects the moldings and finishes of the wall. These were used in historic English houses, mainly as servants' doors.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* A '''[[pet door]]''' (also known as a [[cat flap]] or dog door) is an opening in a door to allow pets to enter and exit without the main door's being opened. It may be simply covered by a [[rubber]] flap, or it may be an actual door hinged on the top that the pet can push through. Pet doors may be mounted in a sliding glass door as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only allowing pets to exit. Additionally, pet doors may be electronic, only allowing animals with a special electronic tag to enter.\n* A '''[[trapdoor]]''' is a door that is oriented horizontally in a [[ceiling]] or [[floor]], often accessed via a [[ladder]].\n* A '''water door''' or '''water entrance''', such as those used in [[Venice, Italy]], is a door leading from a building built on the water, such as a canal, to the water itself where, for example, one may enter or exit a private boat or [[water taxi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|website=See Venice, Italy|title=Doors in Venice: among water, art and architecture|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103074300/http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|archivedate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>Water doors make frequent appearances in [[Donna Leon]]'s books, and in some are important plot devices, as in [[Donna Leon#Commissario Guido Brunetti novels|''Acqua Alta'' aka ''Death in High Water'' (1996) and ''Beastly Things'' (2012)]].</ref>\n\n== Construction and components ==\n[[File:Door-glossary.png|thumb|Parts of a panel or glazed door]]\n[[File:Door-midrail-detail.png|thumb|Joint between midrail, lockrail and a gunstock stile]]\n[[File:Frame-filled-door.gif|thumb|A frame and filled door]]\n[[File:hollow door.jpg|thumb|A hollow door with one face removed]]\n\n=== Panel doors ===\nPanel doors, also called stile and rail doors, are built with [[frame and panel]] construction. EN 12519 is describing the terms which are officially used in European Member States. The main parts are listed below:\n* [[Stile]]s \u2013 Vertical boards that run the full height of a door and compose its right and left edges. The hinges are mounted to the fixed side (known as the \"hanging stile\"), and the handle, lock, bolt or latch are mounted on the swinging side (known as the \"latch stile\").\n* [[Frame and panel|Rails]] \u2013 Horizontal boards at the top, bottom, and optionally in the middle of a door that join the two stiles and split the door into two or more rows of panels. The \"top rail\" and \"bottom rail\" are named for their positions. The bottom rail is also known as \"kick rail\". A middle rail at the height of the bolt is known as the \"lock rail\", other middle rails are commonly known as \"cross rails\".\n* [[Mullion]]s \u2013 Smaller optional vertical boards that run between two rails, and split the door into two or more columns of panels, the term is used sometimes for verticals in doors, but more often (UK and Australia) it refers to verticals in windows.\n* Muntin \u2013 Optional vertical members that divide the door into smaller panels.\n* Panels \u2013 Large, wider boards used to fill the space between the stiles, rails, and mullions. The panels typically fit into grooves in the other pieces, and help to keep the door rigid. Panels may be flat, or in raised panel designs. Can be glued in or stay as a floating panel.\n* Light \u2013 a piece of glass used in place of a panel, essentially giving the door a window.\n\n=== Board batten doors ===\nAlso known as ledges and braced,\nBoard and batten doors are an older design consisting primarily of vertical slats:\n* Planks \u2013 Boards wider than 9\" that extend the full height of the door, and are placed side by side filling the door's width.\n* Ledges and braces \u2013 Ledges extend horizontally across the door which the boards are affixed to. The ledges hold the planks together. When diagonally they are called braces which prevent the door from skewing. On some doors, especially antique ones, the ledges are replaced with iron bars that are often built into the hinges as extensions of the door-side plates.\n\n=== Ledged and braced doors ===\nAs board and Batten doors\n\n=== Impact-resistant doors ===\nImpact-resistant doors have rounded stile edges to dissipate energy and minimize edge chipping, scratching and denting. The formed edges are often made of an engineered material. Impact-resistant doors excel in high traffic areas such as hospitals, schools, hotels and coastal areas.\n\n=== Frame and filled doors ===\nThis type consists of a solid timber frame, filled on one face, face with Tongue and Grooved boards. Quite often used externally with the boards on the weather face.\n\n=== Flush doors ===\nMany modern doors, including most interior doors, are flush doors:\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* Core material: Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce drumminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core flush doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board and batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are then covered with [[wood veneer]], thin [[plywood]], [[sheet metal]], [[fiberglass]], or [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]]. The wooden materials are usually layered with the grain alternating direction between layers to prevent warping. Fiberglass and metal-faced doors are sometimes given a layer of cellulose so that they may be stained to look like wood.\n\n=== Moulded doors ===\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* '''Core material''': Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce druminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], extruded polystyrene foam, or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core molded doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board & batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are covered with HDF / [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] skins.\n\n=== Swing direction ===\n'''Door swings'''\n[[File:Art Nouveau entrance in Pia\u021ba Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu (Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Square), from Bucharest (Romania).jpg|thumb|225px|[[Art Nouveau]] door in [[Bucharest]] (Romania), with a [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]] above it]]\nFor most of the world {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}, door swings, or handing, are determined while standing on the outside or less secure side of the door while facing the door (i.e., standing on the side requiring a key to open, going from outside to inside, or from public to private).\n\nIt is especially important to get the hand and swing correct on exterior doors, as the transom is usually sloped and sealed to resist water entry, and to properly drain. In some custom [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] (or with some master carpenters), the manufacture or installer will bevel the leading edge (the first edge to meet the jamb as the door is closing) so that the door fits tight without binding. Specifying an incorrect hand or swing will cause the door to bind, not close properly or leak (for exterior doors). Fixing this specification error will be expensive or time-consuming. In North America, many doors now come with factory-installed hinges, pre-hung on the jamb and sills.\n\nWhile facing the door from the outside or less secure side, if the hinge is on the right side of the door, the door is \"right handed\"; or if the hinge is on the left, it is \"left handed\". If the door swings toward you, it is \"reverse swing\"; or if the door swings away from you, it is \"Normal swing\".\n\nIn other words,\n*In the United States:\n** '''Left hand hinge (LHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side, or on the public side of the door), the hinges are on the left and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Right hand hinge (RHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Left hand reverse (LHR):''' Standing outside the house (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the left, knob on right, on opening the door it swings towards you (i.e. the door swings open towards the outside, or \"outswing\")\n** '''Right hand reverse (RHR):''' Standing outside the house (i.e. on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right, knob on left, opening the door by pulling the door towards you (i.e. open swings to the outside, or \"outswing\")\n*In Europe:\nOne of the oldest [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]] standard applies: DIN 107 \"Building construction; identification of right and left side\" (first 1922\u201305, current 1974-04) defines that '''doors are categorized from the side where the door hinges can be seen'''. If the hinges are on the left, it is a DIN Left door (DIN links, DIN gauche), if the hinges are on the right, it is a DIN Right door (DIN rechts, DIN droite). The DIN Right and DIN Left marking are also used to categorize matching installation material such as [[mortise lock]]s (referenced in DIN 107). The European Standard DIN EN 12519 \"Windows and pedestrian doors. Terminology\" includes these definitions of orientation.\n*In Australia:\nThe \"refrigerator rule\" applies, and a refrigerator door is not opened from the inside.

Many wood doors are custom-made, but they have several downsides: their price, their maintenance requirements (regular painting and staining) and their limited insulating value<ref>Exterior Doors; Energy.gov; {{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304181502/http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |archivedate=2015-03-04 }}</ref> (R-5 to R-6, not including the effects of the glass elements of the doors). Wood doors often have an overhang requirement to maintain a warranty. An overhang is a roof, porch area or awning that helps to protect the door and its finish from [[Ultraviolet|UV]] rays.\n\n'''Steel doors''' are another major type of residential front doors; most of them come with a [[polyurethane]] or other type of [[foam]] insulation core \u2013 a critical factor in a building's overall comfort and efficiency. Steel doors mostly in default comes along with frame and lock system, which is a high cost efficiency factor compared to ''Wooden doors''\n\nMost modern exterior walls are designed to provide [[thermal insulation]] and [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]], which can be indicated by the [[Energy Star]] label or the [[Passive House]] standards. Premium '''composite''' (including steel doors with a thick core of polyurethane or other foam), '''fiberglass''' and '''vinyl doors''' benefit from the materials they are made from, from a thermal perspective.\n\n=== Insulation and weatherstrips ===\n{{Context|section|date=November 2015}}\nBut there are very few door models with an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] close to 10 (which is far less than the R-40 walls or the R-50 ceilings of super-insulated buildings \u2013 [[Passive Solar]] and [[Zero-energy building|Zero Energy Buildings]]). Typical doors are not thick enough to provide very high levels of energy efficiency.\n\nMany doors may have good R-values at their center, but their overall energy efficiency is reduced because of the presence of glass and reinforcing elements, or because of poor [[weatherstripping]] and the way the door is manufactured.\n\nDoor weatherstripping is particularly important for energy efficiency. German-made Passive House doors use multiple weatherstrips, including magnetic strips, to meet higher standards. These weatherstrips are critical to reduce to a minimum energy losses due to air leakage.\n\n=== Dimensions ===\n{{Globalize|date=September 2010}}\n\n==== United States ====\nThe standard door sizes in the US run along 2\" increments. Customary sizes have a height of 78\" (1981&nbsp;mm) or 80\" (2032&nbsp;mm) and a width of 18\" (472&nbsp;mm), 24\" (610&nbsp;mm), 26\" (660&nbsp;mm), 28\" (711&nbsp;mm), 30\" (762&nbsp;mm) or 36\" (914&nbsp;mm).<ref>options at homedepot.com</ref> Most residential passage (room to room) doors are 30\" x 80\" (762&nbsp;mm x 2032&nbsp;mm).\n\nA standard US residential (exterior) door size is 36\" x 80\" (91 x 203&nbsp;cm). Interior doors for wheelchair access must also have a minimum width of 3'-0\" (91&nbsp;cm). Residential interior doors are often somewhat smaller being 6'-8\" high, as are many small stores, offices, and other light commercial buildings. Larger commercial, public buildings and grand homes often use doors of greater height. Older buildings often have smaller doors.\n\nThickness: Most pre-fabricated doors are 1 3/8\" thick (for interior doors) or 1 3/4\" (exterior).\n\n'''Closets:''' small spaces such as closets, dressing rooms, half-baths, storage rooms, cellars, etc. often are accessed through doors smaller than passage doors in one or both dimensions but similar in design.\n\n'''Garages:''' Garage doors are generally 7'-0\" or 8'-0\" wide for a single-car opening. Two car garage doors (sometimes called double car doors) are a single door 16'-0\". Because of size and weight these doors are usually sectional. That is split into four or five horizontal sections so that they can be raised more easily and don't require a lot of additional space above the door when opening and closing. There are single piece double garage doors found in some older homes. circa 1950's\n\n==== Europe ====\nThe standard DIN doors are defined in DIN 18101 (published 1955\u201307, 1985\u201301, 2014-08). The door sizes are also given in the construction standard for wooden door panels (DIN 68706-1). The DIN commission was also responsible for the harmonized European standard DIN EN 14351-1 for exterior doors and DIN EN 14351-2 for interior doors (published 2006\u201307, 2010-08), which defines the requirements for the [[CE marking]] giving standard sizes by examples in the appendix.\n\nThe DIN 18101 standard has a normative size (Nennma\u00df) slightly larger than the panel size (T\u00fcrblatt) as the standard derives the panel sizes from the normative size being different single door vs double door and molded vs unmolded doors. The DIN 18101/1985 defines interior single molded doors to have a common panel height of 1985&nbsp;mm (normativ height 2010&nbsp;mm) at panel widths of 610&nbsp;mm, 735&nbsp;mm, 860&nbsp;mm, 985&nbsp;mm, 1110&nbsp;mm, plus a larger door panel size of 1110&nbsp;mm x 2110&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|title=T\u00fcrblattgr\u00f6\u00dfen nach DIN 18101|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219203924/http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|archivedate=2015-02-19}}</ref> The newer DIN 18101/2014 drops the definition of just five standard door sizes in favor of a basic raster running along 125&nbsp;mm increments where the height and width are independent.

When a door has more than one movable section, one of the sections may be called a ''leaf''. See [[door furniture]] for a discussion of attachments to doors such as [[door handle]]s, [[doorknob]]s, and [[door knocker]]s.\n* [[Lintel]] \u2013 A horizontal beam above a door that supports the wall above it. (Also known as a ''header'')\n* [[Jamb]]s or legs \u2013 The vertical posts that form the sides of a door frame, where the hinges are mounted, and with which the bolt interacts.\n* Sill (for exterior doors) \u2013 A horizontal [[sill plate]] below the door that supports the door frame. Similar to a [[Window Sill]] but for a door\n* [[Threshold (door)|Threshold]] (for exterior doors) \u2013 A horizontal plate below the door that bridges the crack between the interior floor and the sill.\n* [[Doorstop]] \u2013 a thin slat built inside the frame to prevent a door from swinging through when closed, an act which might break the hinges.\n* [[Architrave]] \u2013 The decorative [[molding (decorative)|molding]] that outlines a door frame. (called an [[Archivolt]] if the door is arched). Called ''door casing'' or ''brickmold'' in North America.\n\n=== Related hardware ===\n{{Main|Door furniture}}\n[[File:Door lock.jpg|thumb|Front door of a house with typical [[door furniture]]: a [[letter box]], [[door knocker]], a [[Latch (hardware)|latch]] and two [[Lock (security device)|locks]]]]\n[[File:Paris Rue de Douai5134.JPG|thumb|A door knocker with [[putti]]s holding a [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]], in Paris]]\n\nDoor furniture or hardware refers to any of the items that are attached to a door or a drawer to enhance its functionality or appearance. This includes items such as hinges, handles, door stops, etc.\n\n== Related accidents ==\n'''Door safety''' relates to prevention of door-related [[accident]]s. Such accidents take place in various forms, and in a number of locations; ranging from car doors to garage doors. Accidents vary in severity and frequency. According to the [[National Safety Council]] in the [[United States]], 300,000 injuries are caused by doors every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|title=Protecting Children\u2019s Fingers from Door Injuries|work=The Redwoods Group|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324033919/http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-24}}</ref>\n\nThe types of accidents vary from relatively minor cases where doors cause damage to other objects, such as walls, to serious cases resulting in human injury, particularly to fingers, hands, and feet. A closing door can exert up to 40 [[ton]]s per square inch of [[pressure]] between the [[hinge]]s. Because of the number of accidents taking place, there has been a surge in the number of [[lawsuit]]s. Thus organisations may be at risk when car doors or doors within buildings are unprotected.\n\nAccording to the US [[General Services Administration]], discussing child care centres:\n{{quote|...It is essential that children's fingers be protected from being crushed or otherwise injured in the hinge space of a swinging door or gate. There are simple devices available to attach to the hinge side, ensuring that this type of injury does not occur. As the door closes, the hand is pushed out of the opening, away from harm. In addition, young children are vulnerable to injury when they fall against the other (hinged) side of doors and gates, striking projected hinges. Piano hinges are not recommended to alleviate this problem as they tend to sag over time with heavy use. Instead, an inexpensive device fitting over hinges is available on the market and should be used to ensure safety...<ref>USA General Services Administration Child Care Center Design Guide, June 1998</ref>}}\n\n=== Outward and inward opening ===\nWhenever a door is opened outwards there is a risk that it could strike another person. In many cases this can be avoided by [[architectural design]] which favors doors which open inwards into rooms (from the perspective of a common area such as a corridor, the door opens outwards). In cases where this is infeasible, it may be possible to avoid an accident by placing [[vision panel]]s in the door.<ref>Home Safety Guidelines for Architects & Builders, NBS GCR 78-156, BOSTI, December 1978</ref>\n\nHowever, inward-hinged doors can also escalate an accident by preventing people from escaping the building: people inside the building may press against the doors, and thus prevent the doors from opening. Related accidents include:\n* [[Grue Church fire]] - Grue, Norway in 1822\n* [[Victoria Hall Disaster]] - Sunderland, UK in 1883\n* [[Glen Cinema disaster]] - Paisley, UK in 1929\n* [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] - Boston, USA in 1942\n\nToday, the exterior doors of most large (especially public) buildings open outward, while interior doors such as doors to individual rooms, offices, suites, etc. open inward, as do many exterior doors of houses, particularly in North America.\n\n=== Doorstops ===\n[[Doorstop]]s are simple devices used to prevent a door from coming into contact with another object (typically a wall). Without the door stop damage might be done to the wall. They may either absorb the force of a moving door, or hold the door in place to prevent unintended motion.\n\n=== Door guards ===\nThe purpose of door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger trapping devices, or finger guards) is to reduce the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.\n\nThere are various levels of door protection. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear hinge pin side of the door unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.\nWhich level of protection is appropriate should be determined by a [[risk assessment]] of the door.\n\nThere is also handle-side door protection, which prevents the door from slamming shut on the frame, which can cause injury to fingers/hands.\n\n=== Safety doors ===\nA safety door prevents finger injuries near the hinges without the use of door guards. Rather than cover the danger area, the approach is to change the shape of the door so that an accessible gap does not form in the first place. This is achieved by adding a perfectly circular (\"bull-nose\" shaped) extension to the door, which moves in and out of a cavity as the door opens and closes. This prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges \u2013 either inside or outside. These doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees, so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open (or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a [[doorstop]]).\n\n=== Glass doors ===\n[[Arcadia door|Glass doors]] pose the risk of unintentional collision if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding glass doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from glass doors, [[sticker]]s or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface to make it more visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated, tempered or toughened glass.\n\n=== Fire ===\n{{Main|Fire door}}\n\nSpecial purpose fire doors are often employed in buildings to reduce the overall risk of fire, particularly by preventing the spread of fire and smoke. In cases where they are improperly installed, employed, or tampered with, the risk of fire can be increased. [[Door closer]]s are sometimes used to ensure fire doors remain closed.\n\nAn additional risk in a fire is that doors may prevent access to [[emergency service]]s personnel in order to fight the fire, rescue occupants, etc. [[Door breaching]] techniques may be required in these situations to gain access.\n\n[[Panic bar]]s are often used in buildings so that a door locked from the exterior can quickly and easily be opened from the inside in the event of a fire or other emergency.\n\n=== Vehicle doors ===\n{{Main|Vehicle door}}\nThere may be an increased risk of trapping hands or fingers in car doors compared to other types of doors, due to the proximity in which the occupant sits. In some car accidents, injury to occupants from the movement of car doors may occur.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nBicyclists cycling on public roads fear [[dooring]]: collision with an abruptly opened vehicle door. Because cyclists often ride near parked cars along the side of the road they are particularly vulnerable.\n\n=== Aircraft doors ===\nDoors which lead from interior, pressurized, sections of an aircraft to exterior or unpressurized areas can pose extreme risk if they are inadvertently opened during flight. This can be mitigated by having doors that open inwardly and are designed to be forced into their door frames by the internal cabin pressure \u2013 most cabin doors are of this type. However, an outward opening door is often advantageous for cargo doors to maximise available space, and these need to be secured by hefty locking mechanisms to overcome internal pressure.\n\nA number of accidents have occurred where outward-opening aircraft doors were opened in flight, often accidentally:\n* [[American Airlines Flight 96]] (1972)\n* [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] (1974)\n* [[United Airlines Flight 811]] (1989)\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Hinge bender]], a tool for adjusting door hinges\n* [[Biometrics]]\n* [[Closed-circuit television]]\n* [[Coal hole]]\n* [[Door security]]\n* [[Double margin doors]]\n* [[Electronic lock]]\n* [[Identity document]]\n* [[IP camera]]\n* [[Janus]], Roman god of doors\n* [[Keycard]]s\n* [[Locksmithing]]\n* [[Lock picking]]\n* [[Logical security]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{EB1911 |last=Spiers |first=Richard Phen\u00e9 |wstitle=Door |volume=8 |pages=419\u2013420}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Doors}}\n{{Room}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Doors| ]]\n[[Category:Types of gates]]\n[[https://www.thecivilengineeringtopicshindi4u.com/2020/04/types-of-door-in-civil-engineering.html]Types of door]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Doors|the band|The Doors|other uses|Door (disambiguation)}}\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=600\n| image1 = 57 Rue du Faubourg de Pierre (27353042388).jpg\n| image2 = 1 bis place de l'Alma (Paris).jpg\n| image3 = P1250574 Paris V rue Malebranche n3 porte gothique bis encours.jpg\n| image4 = Qila-i-Kuhna mosque side door.jpg\n| image5 = 16, Stationsstraat, Maastricht.jpg|width5=300|height5=\n| image6 = The Marble Temple-Door (Bangkok).jpg\n| footer = Various examples of doors throughout history\n}}\n\nA '''door''' is a [[hinge]]d or otherwise movable barrier that allows ingress and egress into an \"enclosure\". The opening in the [[wall]] can be referred to as a \"portal\". A door's essential and primary purpose is to provide [[security]] by controlling access to the portal (doorway). [[Convention (norm)|Conventionally]], it is a panel that fits into the portal of a [[building]], [[room]], or [[vehicle]]. Doors are generally made of a material suited to the task of which it is to perform. Doors are commonly attached by hinges within the portal but can be moved by other means such as slides or counterbalancing.\n\nThe door may be moved in various ways (at angles away from the portal, by sliding on a plane parallel to the frame, by folding in angles on a parallel plane, or by spinning along an axis at the center of the frame) to allow or prevent ingress or egress. In most cases, a door's interior matches its exterior side. But in other cases (e.g., a [[car door|vehicle door]]) the two sides are radically different.\n\n[[File:Clevelandart 1964.91.jpg|thumb|False door of [[Nykara]], c. 2408 BC, painted limestone, 168 x 111.5 x 6 cm, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]\n\nDoors often incorporate [[lock (security device)|locking]] mechanisms to ensure that only some people can open them. Doors can have devices such as knockers or [[doorbell]]s by which people outside can announce their presence and summon someone either to open the door for them or give permission to open and enter. Apart from providing access into and out of a space, doors can have the secondary functions of ensuring privacy by preventing unwanted attention from outsiders, of separating areas with different functions, of allowing [[light]] to pass into and out of a space, of controlling [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] or [[air draft]]s so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled, of dampening [[noise]], and of blocking the spread of [[fire]].\n\nDoors may have [[aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[symbol]]ic, [[ritual]]istic purposes. To be given the [[key (lock)|key]] to a door can signify a change in status from outsider to insider.<ref>See, for example the doorkeeping duties of the [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]].</ref> Doors and doorways frequently appear in [[literature]] and [[the arts]] with [[metaphor]]ical or [[allegory|allegorical]] import as a portent of change.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section contains verbatim text from the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' (1911) article on doors. See References.-->\n\nThe earliest in records are those represented in the paintings of some [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs, in which they are shown as single or double doors, each in a single piece of wood. Doors were once believed to be the literal doorway to the afterlife, and some doors leading to important places included designs of the afterlife. In Egypt, where the climate is intensely dry, there was no fear of their warping, but in other countries it was necessary to frame them, which according to [[Vitruvius]] (iv. 6.) was done with stiles (sea/si) and rails ''(see: [[Frame and panel]])'': the spaces enclosed being filled with panels (tympana) let into grooves made in the stiles and rails. The stiles were the vertical boards, one of which, [[Mortise and tenon|tenoned]] or [[hinge]]d, is known as the hanging stile, the other as the middle or meeting stile. The horizontal cross pieces are the top rail, bottom rail, and middle or intermediate rails.\n\nThe most ancient doors were made of timber, such as those referred to in the Biblical depiction of [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon's temple]] being in [[olive wood]] (I Kings vi. 31-35), which were carved and overlaid with gold. The doors dwelt upon in [[Homer]] appear to have been cased in silver or brass. Besides olive wood, [[elm (wood)|elm]], [[cedar (wood)|cedar]], [[oak (wood)|oak]] and [[cypress (wood)|cypress]] were used. A 5,000-year-old door has been found by archaeologists in [[Switzerland]].<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ Swiss archaeologists find 5000-year-old door] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108222716/http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ |date=2010-11-08 }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 550\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = stone door.jpg\n| width1 =\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Stone door in [[Hampi]] ([[India]])\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Door-Post Socket (4690606141).jpg\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = A massive door socket from [[Persepolis]] (modern-day [[Iran]])\n}}\n\nAll ancient doors were hung by pivots at the top and bottom of the hanging stile which worked in sockets in the [[lintel]] and [[sill plate|sill]], the latter being always in some hard stone such as [[basalt]] or [[granite]]. Those found at [[Nippur]] by Dr. Hilprecht dating from 2000 BC were in [[dolerite]]. The tenons of the [[gate]]s at [[Balawat]] were sheathed with bronze (now in the [[British Museum]]). These doors or gates were hung in two leaves, each about {{convert|2.54|m|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high; they were encased with bronze bands or strips, {{convert|25.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, covered with [[repouss\u00e9]] decoration of figures. The wood doors would seem to have been about {{convert|7.62|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, but the hanging stile was over {{convert|360|mm|in}} diameter. Other sheathings of various sizes in bronze have been found, which proves this to have been the universal method adopted to protect the wood pivots. In the [[Hauran]] in Syria, where timber is scarce the doors were made in stone, and one measuring {{convert|1.63|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|0.79|m|in|abbr=on}} is in the British Museum; the band on the meeting stile shows that it was one of the leaves of a double door. At Kuffeir near Bostra in Syria, Burckhardt found stone doors, {{convert|2.74|to|3.048|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, being the entrance doors of the town. In [[Etruria]] many stone doors are referred to by Dennis.\n\n[[File:Plaster cast of folding doors, Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] folding doors at [[Pompeii]], from the 1st century AD, similar with Neoclassical doors from the 19th century]]\n\nAncient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] doors were either single doors, double doors, triple doors, [[sliding door]]s or [[folding door]]s, in the last case the leaves were hinged and folded back. In [[Eumachia]], is a painting of a door with three leaves. In the tomb of Theron at [[Agrigentum]] there is a single four-panel door carved in stone. In the Blundell collection is a [[bas-relief]] of a temple with double doors, each leaf with five panels. Among existing examples, the bronze doors in the [[Santi Cosma e Damiano|church of SS. Cosmas and Damiano]], in Rome, are important examples of Roman metal work of the best period; they are in two leaves, each with two panels, and are framed in bronze. Those of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] are similar in design, with narrow horizontal panels in addition, at the top, bottom and middle.

The doors of the [[church of the Nativity]] at [[Bethlehem]] (6th century) are covered with plates of bronze, cut out in patterns. Those of [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]], of the 8th and 9th century, are wrought in bronze, and the west doors of the cathedral of [[Aachen|Aix-la-Chapelle]] (9th century), of similar manufacture, were probably brought from Constantinople, as also some of those in [[St Mark's Basilica|St. Marks, Venice]]. The bronze doors on the Aachen Cathedral in Germany date back to about 800 AD. Bronze baptistery doors at the Cathedral of Florence were completed in 1423 by Ghiberti.<ref>Architecture, European Copper Institute; {{cite web |url=http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009005711/http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |archivedate=2012-10-09 }}</ref> ''(For more information, see: [[Copper in architecture]]).''\n\n[[File:T\u00fcr, Villa Boscoreale.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] wall painting of an ornate door, in the [[Villa Boscoreale]] ([[Italy]]), from the 1st century AD]]\n\nOf the 11th and 12th centuries there are numerous examples of bronze doors, the earliest being one at [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]] (1015). The Hildesheim design affected the concept of [[Gniezno Doors|Gniezno door]] in Poland. Of others in South Italy and Sicily, the following are the finest: in Sant Andrea, [[Amalfi]] (1060); [[Salerno]] (1099); [[Canosa]] (1111); [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], two doors (1119 and 1124); [[Ravello]] (1179), by Barisano of Trani, who also made doors for [[Trani]] cathedral; and in [[Monreale]] and [[Duomo di Pisa|Pisa]] cathedrals, by Bonano of Pisa. In all these cases the hanging stile had pivots at the top and bottom. The exact period when the hinge was substituted is not quite known, but the change apparently brought about another method of strengthening and decorating doors, viz, with wrought-iron bands of infinite varieties of design. As a rule three bands from which the ornamental work springs constitute the hinges, which have rings outside the hanging stiles fitting on to vertical tenons run into the masonry or wooden frame. There is an early example of the 12th century in [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]]; in France the metal work of the doors of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] at Paris is perhaps the most beautiful in execution, but examples are endless throughout France and England.\n\nReturning to Italy, the most celebrated doors are those of the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)]], which together with the door frames are all in bronze, the borders of the latter being perhaps the most remarkable: the modeling of the figures, birds and foliage of the south doorway, by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330), and of the east doorway by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]] (1425\u20131452), are of great beauty; in the north door (1402\u20131424) Ghiberti adopted the same scheme of design for the paneling and figure subjects in them as Andrea Pisano, but in the east door the rectangular panels are all filled, with bas-reliefs, in which Scripture subjects are illustrated with innumerable figures, these being probably the gates of Paradise of which [[Michelangelo]] speaks.\n\nThe doors of the mosques in [[Cairo]] were of two kinds; those which, externally, were cased with sheets of bronze or iron, cut out in decorative patterns, and incised or inlaid, with bosses in relief; and those in wood, which were framed with interlaced designs of the square and diamond, this latter description of work being [[Copt]]ic in its origin. The doors of the palace at [[Palermo]], which were made by Saracenic workmen for the [[Normans]], are fine examples and in good preservation. A somewhat similar decorative class of door to these latter is found in [[Verona]], where the edges of the stiles and rails are beveled and notched.\n\n[[File:\u0414\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f, \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433.JPG|thumb|Glass door decorated with [[Art Nouveau]] elements, from the [[Singer House]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)]]\n\nIn the Renaissance period the Italian doors are quite simple, their architects trusting more to the doorways for effect; but in France and Germany the contrary is the case, the doors being elaborately carved, especially in the [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] periods, and sometimes with architectural features such as columns and entablatures with pediment and niches, the doorway being in plain masonry. While in Italy the tendency was to give scale by increasing the number of panels, in France the contrary seems to have been the rule; and one of the great doors at [[Fontainebleau]], which is in two leaves, is entirely carried out as if consisting of one great panel only.\n\nThe earliest [[Renaissance]] doors in France are those of the [[Aix Cathedral|cathedral of St. Sauveur]] at [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]] (1503). In the lower panels there are figures {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[niche (architecture)|niches]], and in the upper panels a double range of niches with figures about {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high with canopies over them, all carved in [[cedrus|cedar]]. The south door of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] is in some respects the finest in France; the upper panels are carved in high relief with figure subjects and canopies over them. The doors of the church at [[Gisors]] (1575) are carved with figures in niches subdivided by classic pilasters superimposed. In St. Maclou at [[Rouen]] are three magnificently carved doors; those by Jean Goujon have figures in niches on each side, and others in a group of great beauty in the center. The other doors, probably about forty to fifty years later, are enriched with [[bas-reliefs]], landscapes, figures and elaborate interlaced borders.\n\n[[NASA]]'s [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at the Kennedy Space Center contains the four largest doors. The Vehicle Assembly Building was originally built for the assembly of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions' [[Saturn V|Saturn]] vehicles and was then used to support Space Shuttle operations.

The most common type is the '''single-leaf door''', which consists of a single rigid panel that fills the doorway. There are many variations on this basic design, such as the '''double-leaf door''' or '''double door and French windows''', which have two adjacent independent panels hinged on each side of the doorway.\n* A '''half door''' or '''[[Dutch door]]'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesnews.co.uk/door-design-ideas |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103193405/http://www.timesnews.co.uk/door-design-ideas/ |archivedate=2018-01-03 }} Door design ideas</ref> or '''stable door''' is divided in half horizontally. Traditionally the top half can be opened to allow a [[horse]] or other animal to be fed, while the bottom half remains closed to keep the animal inside. This style of door has been adapted for homes.\n* '''[[Western saloon|Saloon]] doors''' are a pair of lightweight swing doors often found in public bars, and especially associated with the American west. Saloon doors, also known as '''[[wikt:cafe|cafe]] doors''', often use bidirectional [[hinge]]s that close the door regardless of which direction it is opened by incorporating [[spring (device)|springs]]. Saloon doors that only extend from knee-level to chest-level are known as '''batwing doors'''.\n* A '''blind door''', '''Gibb door''', or '''jib door''' has no visible trim or operable components. It is designed to blend with the adjacent wall in all finishes, and visually to be a part of the wall, a disguised door.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Peter |title=The New and Improved Practical Builder |location=London |publisher=Thomas Kelly|date=1841 |pages=97\u201398}}</ref>\n* A '''French door''' consists of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a '''French window''', as it resembles a door-height [[casement window]]. When a pair of French doors is used as a French window, the application does not generally include a central [[mullion]] (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An [[espagnolette]] bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.\n* A '''[[louvred door]]''' has fixed or movable wooden fins (often called slats or [[louver]]s) which permit open ventilation while preserving privacy and preventing the passage of light to the interior. Being relatively weak structures, they are most commonly used for [[wardrobe]]s and drying rooms, where security is of less importance than good ventilation, although a very similar structure is commonly used to form [[window shutter]]s. Double louvred doors were introduced into ''[[Powel Crosley, Jr.#Seagate in Florida|Seagate]]'', built in Florida in 1929 by Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley, that provided the desired circulation of air with an added degree of privacy in that it is impossible to see through the fins in any direction.\n* A '''composite door''' is a single leaf door that can be solid or with glass, and is usually filled with high density foam. In the United Kingdom, it is common for composite doors to be certified to BS PAS 23/24<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean/|title=What does 'certificated' to PAS 24 actually mean?|work=thecrimepreventionwebsite.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125223650/http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean|archivedate=2014-01-25}}</ref> and be compliant with Secured by Design, an official UK police initiative.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doors and Locks |url=https://www.securedbydesign.com/guidance/standards-explained#doors-and-locks |website=Secured by Design |publisher=Police Crime Prevention Initiative |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>\n* A '''steel security door''' is one which is made from strong steel, often for use on [[Bank vault|vaults]] and [[safe room]]s to withstand attack. These may also be fitted with wooden outer panels to resemble standard internal and external doors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|title=Henleys Security Doors|website=Henleys Security Doors|access-date=25 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530035319/http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|archivedate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n* A '''flush door''' is a completely smooth door, having [[plywood]] or [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] fixed over a light timber frame, the hollow parts of which are often filled with a cardboard core material. Skins can also be made out of hardboards, the first of which was invented by William H Mason in 1924. Called [[Masonite]], its construction involved pressing and steaming wood chips into boards. Flush doors are most commonly employed in the interior of a dwelling, although slightly more substantial versions are occasionally used as exterior doors, especially within hotels and other buildings containing many independent dwellings.\n* A '''moulded door''' has the same structure as that of flush door. The only difference is that the surface material is a moulded skin made of MDF. Skins can also be made out of [[Masonite|hardboards]].\n* A '''ledge and brace door''' often called board and batten doors are made from multiple vertical boards fixed together by two or more horizontal timbers called ledges (or battens)and sometimes kept square by additional diagonal timbers called braces.\n* A '''[[wicket gate|wicket door]]''' is a pedestrian door built into a much larger door allowing access without requiring the opening of the larger door. Examples might be found on the ceremonial door of a cathedral or in a large vehicle door in a garage or hangar.\n* A '''bifold door'''<span id=\"bifold\"></span><!-- The preceding tag is a target for links on other pages, probably including the Dab [[Folding]]. --> is a unit that has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood is the most common material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most commonly made for [[closet]]s, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|title=Front Doors, Garage Doors Insights from The Door Zone|website=The Door Zone|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507074631/http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|archivedate=2017-05-07}}</ref>\n* A '''[[sliding glass door]]''', sometimes called an Arcadia door or patio door, is a door made of [[glass]] that slides open and sometimes has a screen (a removable metal mesh that covers the door).\n* '''Australian doors''' are a pair of plywood swinging doors often found in Australian public houses. These doors are generally red or brown in color and bear a resemblance to the more formal doors found in other British Colonies' public houses.\n* A '''false door''' is a wall decoration that looks like a window. In ancient [[Egyptian architecture]], this was a common element in a tomb, the false door representing a gate to the afterlife. They can also be found in the funerary architecture of the desert tribes (e.g., [[Libya]]n Ghirza).\n* A '''[[Mat|doormat]]''' (also called door mat) is a mat placed typically in front of or behind a door of a home. This practice originated so that mud and dirt would be less prevalent on floors inside a building.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170\" heights=\"170\">\nBronze door, Basilica di San Giovanni, 2013.jpg|[[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] bronze doors of the [[Curia Julia]], now in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] (Rome)\n\nDoorway detail, St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney.jpg|[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] door of the [[St Magnus Cathedral]] ([[Kirkwall]], [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom|UK]])\n\nFile:Door in Morocco, 2010.jpg|An Islamic door decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], in [[Morocco]]\n\nFile:Brooklyn Museum 1994.92 Door with Lock (2).jpg|Door with lock, late 19th or early 20th century, wood with iron, from [[Burkina Faso]], in the [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City)\n\nFile:Amsterdam (NL), Kloveniersburgwal -- 2015 -- 7252.jpg|Door of the Laboratorium voor Artsenijbereidkunde, an example of Dutch [[Renaissance architecture]], in [[Amsterdam]] (the [[Netherlands]])\n\nFile:Bohemian court chancellery door - Vienna.jpg|[[Baroque]] entrance in [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]])\n\nLe portail du Palais Rohan (14456681043).jpg|Detail of a [[Rococo]] of the [[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg|Palais Rohan]] from [[Strasbourg]] (France)\n\nFile:Porte d'entr\u00e9e du palais de Justice de Bruxelles (HDR) - 2043-0077-0.jpg|[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] door of the main entrance of the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] ([[Brussels]], Belgium)\n\nSimple door inside the BCR Headquarters Building, in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|Neoclassical door without ornaments, in the BCR Headquarters Building from Bucharest\n\nFile:Tsentralny District, St Petersburg, Russia - panoramio (259).jpg|[[Egyptian Revival architecture|Egyptian Revival]] door from [[Saint Petersburg]] (Russia)\n\n9, Strada Sp\u0103tarului, Bucharest (Romania) 1.jpg|Double door of a city-house from [[Bucharest]] (Romania)\n\nAn entrance of the National Museum of Romanian History, in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|A door of the [[National Museum of Romanian History]] (Bucharest)\n\nPorte et marquise CCI Nancy.jpg|[[Art Nouveau]] metal and glass door in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (France), with a big transparent [[awning]] above it\n\nFile:Maison Huot de style art nouveau (Nancy) (7965996816).jpg|[[Art Nouveau]] door from Nancy\n\nFile:Tenghua Jiuguan 21 2015-04.JPG|Traditional folding doors in [[The Old Museum of Wisteria]] ([[Changzhou]], China)\n\nFile:Zesp\u00f3\u0142 klasztoru Gandan (39).jpg|A decorated door from the [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery]] (Mongolia)\n</gallery>\n\n== Different types of door mechanism ==\n[[File:Types of doors.png|thumb|The main types of door mechanisms]]\n\n=== Hinged doors ===\nMost doors are [[hinge]]d along one side to allow the door to pivot away from the doorway in one direction, but not the other. The axis of rotation is usually vertical. In some cases, such as hinged [[garage door]]s, the axis may be horizontal, above the door opening.\n\nDoors can be hinged so that the axis of rotation is not in the plane of the door to reduce the space required on the side to which the door opens. This requires a mechanism so that the axis of rotation is on the side other than that in which the door opens. This is sometimes the case in trains or airplanes, such as for the door to the toilet, which opens inward.\n\nA '''swing door''' has special single-action hinges that allow it to open either outwards or inwards, and is usually sprung to keep it closed.\n\n'''French doors''' are derived from an original French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels would be in a casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel at the bottom of the door. It is called a French window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf, and in which the doors may swing out (typically) as well as in.\n\nA '''Mead door''', developed by S Mead of Leicester, swings both ways. It is susceptible to forced entry due to its design.\n\nA '''Dutch door''' or stable door consists of two halves. The top half operates independently from the bottom half. A variant exists in which opening the top part separately is possible, but because the lower part has a lip on the inside, closing the top part, while leaving the lower part open, is not.\n\nA '''garden door''' resembles a French window (with lites), but is more secure because only one door is operable. The hinge of the operating door is next to the adjacent fixed door and the latch is located at the wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an [[espagnolette]] bolt.\n\n=== Sliding doors ===\nIt is often useful to have doors which slide along tracks, often for space or aesthetic considerations.\n\nA '''bypass door''' is a door unit that has two or more sections. The doors can slide in either direction along one axis on parallel overhead tracks, sliding past each other. They are most commonly used in closets, in order to access one side of the closet at a time. The doors in a bypass unit will overlap slightly when viewed from the front, in order not to have a visible gap between them.\n\nDoors which slide inside a wall cavity are called '''[[pocket door]]s'''. This type of door is used in tight spaces where privacy is also required. The door slab is mounted to roller and a track at the top of the door and slides inside a wall.\n\nSliding glass doors are common in many houses, particularly as an entrance to the backyard. Such doors are also popular for use for the entrances to commercial structures, although they are not counted as fire exit doors. The door that moves is called the \"active leaf\", while the door that remains fixed is called the \"inactive leaf\".\n\n=== Rotating doors ===\nA '''[[revolving door]]''' has several wings or leaves, generally four, radiating from a central shaft, forming compartments that rotate about a vertical axis. A revolving door allows people to pass in both directions without colliding, and forms an airlock maintaining a seal between inside and out.\n\nA '''pivot door''', instead of hinges, is supported on a bearing some distance away from the edge, so that there is more or less of a gap on the pivot side as well as the opening side. In some cases the pivot is central, creating two equal openings.\n\n=== High-speed door ===\nA '''[[high-speed door]]''' is a very fast door some with opening speeds of up to 4&nbsp;m/s, mainly used in the industrial sector where the speed of a door has an effect on production logistics, temperature and pressure control. high-speed clean room doors are used in pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames. They guarantee the tightness of all accesses. The powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges. Therefore, they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded.\n\nHigh-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings, generally more than 200,000 a year. They need to be built with heavy-duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function. The door curtain was originally made of PVC, but was later also developed in aluminium and acrylic glass sections. High Speed refrigeration and cold room doors with excellent insulation values was also introduced with the [[Green energy|Green]] and [[Energy saving]] requirements.\n\nIn North America, the Door and Access Systems Manufacturing Association (DASMA) defines high-performance doors as non-residential, powered doors, characterized by rolling, folding, sliding or swinging action, that are either high-cycle (minimum 100 cycles/day) or high-speed (minimum 20 inches(508&nbsp;mm)/second), and two out of three of the following: made-to-order for exact size and custom features, designed to be able to withstand equipment impact (break-away if accidentally hit by vehicle) or designed to sustain heavy usage with minimal maintenance.\n\n=== Automatic ===\n'''[[Automatic door|Automatically opening doors]]''' are powered open and closed either by electricity, spring, or both. There are several methods by which an automatically opening door is activated:\n\n# A [[sensor]] detects traffic is approaching. Sensors for automatic doors are generally:\n#* A [[pressure sensor]] \u2013 e.g., a floor mat which reacts to the pressure of someone standing on it.\n#* An [[infrared]] [[curtain]] or beam which shines invisible light onto sensors; if someone or something blocks the beam the door is triggered open.\n#* A [[motion sensor]] which uses low-power microwave [[radar]] for the same effect.\n#* A remote sensor (e.g. based on infrared or radio waves) can be triggered by a portable [[remote control]], or is installed inside a vehicle. These are popular for garage doors.\n# A [[switch]] is operated manually, perhaps after security checks. This can be a push button switch or a swipe card.\n# The act of pushing or pulling the door triggers the open and close cycle. These are also known as power-assisted doors.\n\nIn addition to activation sensors automatically opening doors are generally fitted with safety sensors. These are usually an infrared curtain or beam, but can be a pressure mat fitted on the swing side of the door. The purpose of the safety sensor is to prevent the door from colliding with an object in its path by stopping or slowing its motion.A mechanism is set in modern automatic doors to ensure that door will be in open state in case of power failure.\n\n=== Others ===\n[[Image:Puertas seccionales.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Sectional doors for industry.]]\n[[File:Torggler evolutiondoor.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|''Evolution Door'', 2013]]\n'''Up-and-over''' or '''overhead''' doors are often used in garages. Instead of hinges it has a mechanism, often [[counterbalance]]d or [[torsion spring|sprung]], that allows it to be lifted so that it rests horizontally above the opening. A [[roller shutter]] or '''sectional overhead door''' is one variant of this type.\n\nA '''[[tambour door]]''' or roller door is an up-and-over door made of narrow horizontal slats and \"rolls\" up and down by sliding along vertical tracks and is typically found in entertainment centres and cabinets.\n\n'''Inward opening doors''' are doors that can only be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a substantial fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards in the event of an emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a switch mechanism, disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the closed position, power is restored.\n\n'''Rebated doors''', a term chiefly used in Britain, are double doors having a lip or overlap (i.e. a [[Rabbet]]) on the vertical edge(s) where they meet. Fire-rating can be achieved with an applied edge-guard or astragal molding on the meeting stile, in accordance with the American [[Fire door]].\n\n'''Evolution Door''' is a trackless door that moves in the same closure level as a sliding door. The system is an invention of the Austrian artist Klemens Torggler. It is a further development of the '''{{ill|Drehplattent\u00fcr|de|Drehplattent\u00fcr|vertical-align=sup}}''' that normally consists of two rotatable, connected panels which move to each other when opening.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|title=Kinematics with MicroStation Ch01C-I Grueblers Criteria for 3D 5 Bar|date=20 February 2014|work=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409090618/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|archivedate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Miersch, 17 rue Nicolas Welter-001.jpg|thumb|250px|Transparent awning in [[Luxembourg]]]]\nArchitectural doors have numerous general and specialized uses. Doors are generally used to separate interior spaces (closets, rooms, etc.) for [[convenience]], [[privacy]], [[safety]], and [[security]] reasons. Doors are also used to secure passages into a building from the exterior, for reasons of [[climate]] control and safety.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nDoors also are applied in more specialized cases:\n* A '''[[blast door|Blast-proof door]]''' is constructed to allow access to a structure as well as to provide protection from the force of explosions.\n* A '''garden door''' is any door that opens to a backyard or [[garden]]. This term is often used specifically for French windows, double French doors (with lites instead of panels), in place of a [[sliding glass door]]. The term also may refer to what is known as ''patio doors''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* A jib door is a concealed door, whose surface reflects the moldings and finishes of the wall. These were used in historic English houses, mainly as servants' doors.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* A '''[[pet door]]''' (also known as a [[cat flap]] or dog door) is an opening in a door to allow pets to enter and exit without the main door's being opened. It may be simply covered by a [[rubber]] flap, or it may be an actual door hinged on the top that the pet can push through. Pet doors may be mounted in a sliding glass door as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only allowing pets to exit. Additionally, pet doors may be electronic, only allowing animals with a special electronic tag to enter.\n* A '''[[trapdoor]]''' is a door that is oriented horizontally in a [[ceiling]] or [[floor]], often accessed via a [[ladder]].\n* A '''water door''' or '''water entrance''', such as those used in [[Venice, Italy]], is a door leading from a building built on the water, such as a canal, to the water itself where, for example, one may enter or exit a private boat or [[water taxi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|website=See Venice, Italy|title=Doors in Venice: among water, art and architecture|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103074300/http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|archivedate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>Water doors make frequent appearances in [[Donna Leon]]'s books, and in some are important plot devices, as in [[Donna Leon#Commissario Guido Brunetti novels|''Acqua Alta'' aka ''Death in High Water'' (1996) and ''Beastly Things'' (2012)]].</ref>\n\n== Construction and components ==\n[[File:Door-glossary.png|thumb|Parts of a panel or glazed door]]\n[[File:Door-midrail-detail.png|thumb|Joint between midrail, lockrail and a gunstock stile]]\n[[File:Frame-filled-door.gif|thumb|A frame and filled door]]\n[[File:hollow door.jpg|thumb|A hollow door with one face removed]]\n\n=== Panel doors ===\nPanel doors, also called stile and rail doors, are built with [[frame and panel]] construction. EN 12519 is describing the terms which are officially used in European Member States. The main parts are listed below:\n* [[Stile]]s \u2013 Vertical boards that run the full height of a door and compose its right and left edges. The hinges are mounted to the fixed side (known as the \"hanging stile\"), and the handle, lock, bolt or latch are mounted on the swinging side (known as the \"latch stile\").\n* [[Frame and panel|Rails]] \u2013 Horizontal boards at the top, bottom, and optionally in the middle of a door that join the two stiles and split the door into two or more rows of panels. The \"top rail\" and \"bottom rail\" are named for their positions. The bottom rail is also known as \"kick rail\". A middle rail at the height of the bolt is known as the \"lock rail\", other middle rails are commonly known as \"cross rails\".\n* [[Mullion]]s \u2013 Smaller optional vertical boards that run between two rails, and split the door into two or more columns of panels, the term is used sometimes for verticals in doors, but more often (UK and Australia) it refers to verticals in windows.\n* Muntin \u2013 Optional vertical members that divide the door into smaller panels.\n* Panels \u2013 Large, wider boards used to fill the space between the stiles, rails, and mullions. The panels typically fit into grooves in the other pieces, and help to keep the door rigid. Panels may be flat, or in raised panel designs. Can be glued in or stay as a floating panel.\n* Light \u2013 a piece of glass used in place of a panel, essentially giving the door a window.\n\n=== Board batten doors ===\nAlso known as ledges and braced,\nBoard and batten doors are an older design consisting primarily of vertical slats:\n* Planks \u2013 Boards wider than 9\" that extend the full height of the door, and are placed side by side filling the door's width.\n* Ledges and braces \u2013 Ledges extend horizontally across the door which the boards are affixed to. The ledges hold the planks together. When diagonally they are called braces which prevent the door from skewing. On some doors, especially antique ones, the ledges are replaced with iron bars that are often built into the hinges as extensions of the door-side plates.\n\n=== Ledged and braced doors ===\nAs board and Batten doors\n\n=== Impact-resistant doors ===\nImpact-resistant doors have rounded stile edges to dissipate energy and minimize edge chipping, scratching and denting. The formed edges are often made of an engineered material. Impact-resistant doors excel in high traffic areas such as hospitals, schools, hotels and coastal areas.\n\n=== Frame and filled doors ===\nThis type consists of a solid timber frame, filled on one face, face with Tongue and Grooved boards. Quite often used externally with the boards on the weather face.\n\n=== Flush doors ===\nMany modern doors, including most interior doors, are flush doors:\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* Core material: Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce drumminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core flush doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board and batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are then covered with [[wood veneer]], thin [[plywood]], [[sheet metal]], [[fiberglass]], or [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]]. The wooden materials are usually layered with the grain alternating direction between layers to prevent warping. Fiberglass and metal-faced doors are sometimes given a layer of cellulose so that they may be stained to look like wood.\n\n=== Moulded doors ===\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* '''Core material''': Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce druminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], extruded polystyrene foam, or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core molded doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board & batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are covered with HDF / [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] skins.\n\n=== Swing direction ===\n'''Door swings'''\n[[File:Art Nouveau entrance in Pia\u021ba Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu (Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Square), from Bucharest (Romania).jpg|thumb|225px|[[Art Nouveau]] door in [[Bucharest]] (Romania), with a [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]] above it]]\nFor most of the world {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}, door swings, or handing, are determined while standing on the outside or less secure side of the door while facing the door (i.e., standing on the side requiring a key to open, going from outside to inside, or from public to private).\n\nIt is especially important to get the hand and swing correct on exterior doors, as the transom is usually sloped and sealed to resist water entry, and to properly drain. In some custom [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] (or with some master carpenters), the manufacture or installer will bevel the leading edge (the first edge to meet the jamb as the door is closing) so that the door fits tight without binding. Specifying an incorrect hand or swing will cause the door to bind, not close properly or leak (for exterior doors). Fixing this specification error will be expensive or time-consuming. In North America, many doors now come with factory-installed hinges, pre-hung on the jamb and sills.\n\nWhile facing the door from the outside or less secure side, if the hinge is on the right side of the door, the door is \"right handed\"; or if the hinge is on the left, it is \"left handed\". If the door swings toward you, it is \"reverse swing\"; or if the door swings away from you, it is \"Normal swing\".\n\nIn other words,\n*In the United States:\n** '''Left hand hinge (LHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side, or on the public side of the door), the hinges are on the left and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Right hand hinge (RHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Left hand reverse (LHR):''' Standing outside the house (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the left, knob on right, on opening the door it swings towards you (i.e. the door swings open towards the outside, or \"outswing\")\n** '''Right hand reverse (RHR):''' Standing outside the house (i.e. on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right, knob on left, opening the door by pulling the door towards you (i.e. open swings to the outside, or \"outswing\")\n*In Europe:\nOne of the oldest [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]] standard applies: DIN 107 \"Building construction; identification of right and left side\" (first 1922\u201305, current 1974-04) defines that '''doors are categorized from the side where the door hinges can be seen'''. If the hinges are on the left, it is a DIN Left door (DIN links, DIN gauche), if the hinges are on the right, it is a DIN Right door (DIN rechts, DIN droite). The DIN Right and DIN Left marking are also used to categorize matching installation material such as [[mortise lock]]s (referenced in DIN 107). The European Standard DIN EN 12519 \"Windows and pedestrian doors. Terminology\" includes these definitions of orientation.\n*In Australia:\nThe \"refrigerator rule\" applies, and a refrigerator door is not opened from the inside. If the hinges are on the right then it is a right hand (or right hung) door. (Australian Standards for Installation of Timber Doorsets, AS 1909\u20131984 pg 6.)\n\nIn public buildings, exterior doors should open to the outside in order to comply with any fire codes that may be in force in that jurisdiction. If the door opens inward and there is a fire, there can be a crush of people who run for the door and they will not be able to open it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question584.htm|title=Why do the entry doors to most homes open inward, while in most public buildings, the entry doors open outward?|date=2001-03-02|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920044229/http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question584.htm|archivedate=2017-09-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Types ===\nNew exterior doors are largely defined by the type of materials they are made from: [[wood]], [[steel]], [[fiberglass]], [[UPVC]]/vinyl, [[aluminum]], composite, [[Glass|glass (patio doors)]]...\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 350\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 =Strasbourg 1 rue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Castelnau (2).jpg \n| width1 = 140\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Wooden door of a building from [[Strasbourg]] (France), decorated with [[pediment]]s on it\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Pierre Rousseau - Double-Leaf Doors - 1942.2.12.a - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] double-leaf doors by [[Pierre Rousseau]], 1790s\n}}\n[[File:Glass and metal door on Calea Victoriei (Victory's Avenue) in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|200px|right|thumb|Glass and metal door, decoarted with Neoclassical ornaments, in [[Bucharest]] (Romania)]]\n'''Wooden doors''' \u2013 including solid wood doors \u2013 are a top choice for many homeowners, largely because of the aesthetic qualities of wood. Many wood doors are custom-made, but they have several downsides: their price, their maintenance requirements (regular painting and staining) and their limited insulating value<ref>Exterior Doors; Energy.gov; {{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304181502/http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |archivedate=2015-03-04 }}</ref> (R-5 to R-6, not including the effects of the glass elements of the doors). Wood doors often have an overhang requirement to maintain a warranty. An overhang is a roof, porch area or awning that helps to protect the door and its finish from [[Ultraviolet|UV]] rays.\n\n'''Steel doors''' are another major type of residential front doors; most of them come with a [[polyurethane]] or other type of [[foam]] insulation core \u2013 a critical factor in a building's overall comfort and efficiency. Steel doors mostly in default comes along with frame and lock system, which is a high cost efficiency factor compared to ''Wooden doors''\n\nMost modern exterior walls are designed to provide [[thermal insulation]] and [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]], which can be indicated by the [[Energy Star]] label or the [[Passive House]] standards. Premium '''composite''' (including steel doors with a thick core of polyurethane or other foam), '''fiberglass''' and '''vinyl doors''' benefit from the materials they are made from, from a thermal perspective.\n\n=== Insulation and weatherstrips ===\n{{Context|section|date=November 2015}}\nBut there are very few door models with an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] close to 10 (which is far less than the R-40 walls or the R-50 ceilings of super-insulated buildings \u2013 [[Passive Solar]] and [[Zero-energy building|Zero Energy Buildings]]). Typical doors are not thick enough to provide very high levels of energy efficiency.\n\nMany doors may have good R-values at their center, but their overall energy efficiency is reduced because of the presence of glass and reinforcing elements, or because of poor [[weatherstripping]] and the way the door is manufactured.\n\nDoor weatherstripping is particularly important for energy efficiency. German-made Passive House doors use multiple weatherstrips, including magnetic strips, to meet higher standards. These weatherstrips are critical to reduce to a minimum energy losses due to air leakage.\n\n=== Dimensions ===\n{{Globalize|date=September 2010}}\n\n==== United States ====\nThe standard door sizes in the US run along 2\" increments. Customary sizes have a height of 78\" (1981&nbsp;mm) or 80\" (2032&nbsp;mm) and a width of 18\" (472&nbsp;mm), 24\" (610&nbsp;mm), 26\" (660&nbsp;mm), 28\" (711&nbsp;mm), 30\" (762&nbsp;mm) or 36\" (914&nbsp;mm).<ref>options at homedepot.com</ref> Most residential passage (room to room) doors are 30\" x 80\" (762&nbsp;mm x 2032&nbsp;mm).\n\nA standard US residential (exterior) door size is 36\" x 80\" (91 x 203&nbsp;cm). Interior doors for wheelchair access must also have a minimum width of 3'-0\" (91&nbsp;cm). Residential interior doors are often somewhat smaller being 6'-8\" high, as are many small stores, offices, and other light commercial buildings. Larger commercial, public buildings and grand homes often use doors of greater height. Older buildings often have smaller doors.\n\nThickness: Most pre-fabricated doors are 1 3/8\" thick (for interior doors) or 1 3/4\" (exterior).\n\n'''Closets:''' small spaces such as closets, dressing rooms, half-baths, storage rooms, cellars, etc. often are accessed through doors smaller than passage doors in one or both dimensions but similar in design.\n\n'''Garages:''' Garage doors are generally 7'-0\" or 8'-0\" wide for a single-car opening. Two car garage doors (sometimes called double car doors) are a single door 16'-0\". Because of size and weight these doors are usually sectional. That is split into four or five horizontal sections so that they can be raised more easily and don't require a lot of additional space above the door when opening and closing. There are single piece double garage doors found in some older homes. circa 1950's\n\n==== Europe ====\nThe standard DIN doors are defined in DIN 18101 (published 1955\u201307, 1985\u201301, 2014-08). The door sizes are also given in the construction standard for wooden door panels (DIN 68706-1). The DIN commission was also responsible for the harmonized European standard DIN EN 14351-1 for exterior doors and DIN EN 14351-2 for interior doors (published 2006\u201307, 2010-08), which defines the requirements for the [[CE marking]] giving standard sizes by examples in the appendix.\n\nThe DIN 18101 standard has a normative size (Nennma\u00df) slightly larger than the panel size (T\u00fcrblatt) as the standard derives the panel sizes from the normative size being different single door vs double door and molded vs unmolded doors. The DIN 18101/1985 defines interior single molded doors to have a common panel height of 1985&nbsp;mm (normativ height 2010&nbsp;mm) at panel widths of 610&nbsp;mm, 735&nbsp;mm, 860&nbsp;mm, 985&nbsp;mm, 1110&nbsp;mm, plus a larger door panel size of 1110&nbsp;mm x 2110&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|title=T\u00fcrblattgr\u00f6\u00dfen nach DIN 18101|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219203924/http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|archivedate=2015-02-19}}</ref> The newer DIN 18101/2014 drops the definition of just five standard door sizes in favor of a basic raster running along 125&nbsp;mm increments where the height and width are independent.

When a door has more than one movable section, one of the sections may be called a ''leaf''. See [[door furniture]] for a discussion of attachments to doors such as [[door handle]]s, [[doorknob]]s, and [[door knocker]]s.\n* [[Lintel]] \u2013 A horizontal beam above a door that supports the wall above it. (Also known as a ''header'')\n* [[Jamb]]s or legs \u2013 The vertical posts that form the sides of a door frame, where the hinges are mounted, and with which the bolt interacts.\n* Sill (for exterior doors) \u2013 A horizontal [[sill plate]] below the door that supports the door frame. Similar to a [[Window Sill]] but for a door\n* [[Threshold (door)|Threshold]] (for exterior doors) \u2013 A horizontal plate below the door that bridges the crack between the interior floor and the sill.\n* [[Doorstop]] \u2013 a thin slat built inside the frame to prevent a door from swinging through when closed, an act which might break the hinges.\n* [[Architrave]] \u2013 The decorative [[molding (decorative)|molding]] that outlines a door frame. (called an [[Archivolt]] if the door is arched). Called ''door casing'' or ''brickmold'' in North America.\n\n=== Related hardware ===\n{{Main|Door furniture}}\n[[File:Door lock.jpg|thumb|Front door of a house with typical [[door furniture]]: a [[letter box]], [[door knocker]], a [[Latch (hardware)|latch]] and two [[Lock (security device)|locks]]]]\n[[File:Paris Rue de Douai5134.JPG|thumb|A door knocker with [[putti]]s holding a [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]], in Paris]]\n\nDoor furniture or hardware refers to any of the items that are attached to a door or a drawer to enhance its functionality or appearance. This includes items such as hinges, handles, door stops, etc.\n\n== Related accidents ==\n'''Door safety''' relates to prevention of door-related [[accident]]s. Such accidents take place in various forms, and in a number of locations; ranging from car doors to garage doors. Accidents vary in severity and frequency. According to the [[National Safety Council]] in the [[United States]], 300,000 injuries are caused by doors every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|title=Protecting Children\u2019s Fingers from Door Injuries|work=The Redwoods Group|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324033919/http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-24}}</ref>\n\nThe types of accidents vary from relatively minor cases where doors cause damage to other objects, such as walls, to serious cases resulting in human injury, particularly to fingers, hands, and feet. A closing door can exert up to 40 [[ton]]s per square inch of [[pressure]] between the [[hinge]]s. Because of the number of accidents taking place, there has been a surge in the number of [[lawsuit]]s. Thus organisations may be at risk when car doors or doors within buildings are unprotected.\n\nAccording to the US [[General Services Administration]], discussing child care centres:\n{{quote|...It is essential that children's fingers be protected from being crushed or otherwise injured in the hinge space of a swinging door or gate. There are simple devices available to attach to the hinge side, ensuring that this type of injury does not occur. As the door closes, the hand is pushed out of the opening, away from harm. In addition, young children are vulnerable to injury when they fall against the other (hinged) side of doors and gates, striking projected hinges. Piano hinges are not recommended to alleviate this problem as they tend to sag over time with heavy use. Instead, an inexpensive device fitting over hinges is available on the market and should be used to ensure safety...<ref>USA General Services Administration Child Care Center Design Guide, June 1998</ref>}}\n\n=== Outward and inward opening ===\nWhenever a door is opened outwards there is a risk that it could strike another person. In many cases this can be avoided by [[architectural design]] which favors doors which open inwards into rooms (from the perspective of a common area such as a corridor, the door opens outwards). In cases where this is infeasible, it may be possible to avoid an accident by placing [[vision panel]]s in the door.<ref>Home Safety Guidelines for Architects & Builders, NBS GCR 78-156, BOSTI, December 1978</ref>\n\nHowever, inward-hinged doors can also escalate an accident by preventing people from escaping the building: people inside the building may press against the doors, and thus prevent the doors from opening. Related accidents include:\n* [[Grue Church fire]] - Grue, Norway in 1822\n* [[Victoria Hall Disaster]] - Sunderland, UK in 1883\n* [[Glen Cinema disaster]] - Paisley, UK in 1929\n* [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] - Boston, USA in 1942\n\nToday, the exterior doors of most large (especially public) buildings open outward, while interior doors such as doors to individual rooms, offices, suites, etc. open inward, as do many exterior doors of houses, particularly in North America.\n\n=== Doorstops ===\n[[Doorstop]]s are simple devices used to prevent a door from coming into contact with another object (typically a wall). Without the door stop damage might be done to the wall. They may either absorb the force of a moving door, or hold the door in place to prevent unintended motion.\n\n=== Door guards ===\nThe purpose of door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger trapping devices, or finger guards) is to reduce the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.\n\nThere are various levels of door protection. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear hinge pin side of the door unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.\nWhich level of protection is appropriate should be determined by a [[risk assessment]] of the door.\n\nThere is also handle-side door protection, which prevents the door from slamming shut on the frame, which can cause injury to fingers/hands.\n\n=== Safety doors ===\nA safety door prevents finger injuries near the hinges without the use of door guards. Rather than cover the danger area, the approach is to change the shape of the door so that an accessible gap does not form in the first place. This is achieved by adding a perfectly circular (\"bull-nose\" shaped) extension to the door, which moves in and out of a cavity as the door opens and closes. This prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges \u2013 either inside or outside. These doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees, so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open (or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a [[doorstop]]).\n\n=== Glass doors ===\n[[Arcadia door|Glass doors]] pose the risk of unintentional collision if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding glass doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from glass doors, [[sticker]]s or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface to make it more visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated, tempered or toughened glass.\n\n=== Fire ===\n{{Main|Fire door}}\n\nSpecial purpose fire doors are often employed in buildings to reduce the overall risk of fire, particularly by preventing the spread of fire and smoke. In cases where they are improperly installed, employed, or tampered with, the risk of fire can be increased. [[Door closer]]s are sometimes used to ensure fire doors remain closed.\n\nAn additional risk in a fire is that doors may prevent access to [[emergency service]]s personnel in order to fight the fire, rescue occupants, etc. [[Door breaching]] techniques may be required in these situations to gain access.\n\n[[Panic bar]]s are often used in buildings so that a door locked from the exterior can quickly and easily be opened from the inside in the event of a fire or other emergency.\n\n=== Vehicle doors ===\n{{Main|Vehicle door}}\nThere may be an increased risk of trapping hands or fingers in car doors compared to other types of doors, due to the proximity in which the occupant sits. In some car accidents, injury to occupants from the movement of car doors may occur.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nBicyclists cycling on public roads fear [[dooring]]: collision with an abruptly opened vehicle door. Because cyclists often ride near parked cars along the side of the road they are particularly vulnerable.\n\n=== Aircraft doors ===\nDoors which lead from interior, pressurized, sections of an aircraft to exterior or unpressurized areas can pose extreme risk if they are inadvertently opened during flight. This can be mitigated by having doors that open inwardly and are designed to be forced into their door frames by the internal cabin pressure \u2013 most cabin doors are of this type. However, an outward opening door is often advantageous for cargo doors to maximise available space, and these need to be secured by hefty locking mechanisms to overcome internal pressure.\n\nA number of accidents have occurred where outward-opening aircraft doors were opened in flight, often accidentally:\n* [[American Airlines Flight 96]] (1972)\n* [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] (1974)\n* [[United Airlines Flight 811]] (1989)\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Hinge bender]], a tool for adjusting door hinges\n* [[Biometrics]]\n* [[Closed-circuit television]]\n* [[Coal hole]]\n* [[Door security]]\n* [[Double margin doors]]\n* [[Electronic lock]]\n* [[Identity document]]\n* [[IP camera]]\n* [[Janus]], Roman god of doors\n* [[Keycard]]s\n* [[Locksmithing]]\n* [[Lock picking]]\n* [[Logical security]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{EB1911 |last=Spiers |first=Richard Phen\u00e9 |wstitle=Door |volume=8 |pages=419\u2013420}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Doors}}\n{{Room}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Doors| ]]\n[[Category:Types of gates]]\n", "name_user": "2402:3a80:6d7:66c3:f170:851c:4aa5:fe41", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door"}

It was born through fiery eruptions and has solidified lava streams as well as extravagant rock formations. The island emerged about 15 million years ago as product of the [[Canary hotspot]]. The island, along with others, emerged after the breakup of the African and the American continental plates. The greatest recorded eruptions occurred between 1730 and 1736 in the area now designated [[Timanfaya National Park]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Timanfaya|url=https://www.lanzaroteguide.com/timanfaya/|website=Lanzarote Guide|accessdate=1 August 2017|ref=20}}</ref>\n\n==Biodiversity==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:La Geria vines.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Malvasia]] grape vines growing in topsoil covered in [[lapilli]], in [[La Geria]].

These plants have adapted to the relative scarcity of water in the same way as [[succulent]]s. They include the [[Canary Island date palm]] (''Phoenix canariensis''), which is found in damper areas of the north, the [[Canary Island pine]] (''Pinus canariensis''), [[fern]]s, and [[Olea europaea|wild olive trees]] (''Olea europaea''). ''[[Laurisilva]]'' trees, which once covered the highest parts of Risco de Famara, are rarely found today. After winter rainfall, the vegetation comes to a colourful bloom between February and March.\n\nThe [[vineyard]]s of La Ger\u00eda, [[Lanzarote (DO)|Lanzarote]] ''[[Denominaci\u00f3n de origen|DO]]'' wine region, are a protected area. Single vines are planted in pits {{convert|4|-|5|m|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|2|-|3|m|abbr=off}} deep, with small stone walls around each pit. This agricultural technique is designed to harvest rainfall and overnight dew and to protect the plants from the winds.<!-- NO World Heritage Site on Lanzarote ! see [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain]]: The vineyards, with their traditional methods of cultivation, are part of the [[World Heritage Site]], as well as other sites on the island. -->\n\nPoo\nEar \nPop\n\n===Animals===\nApart from the native bats and the mammals which accompanied humans to the island (including the [[dromedary]], which was used for agriculture and is now a tourist attraction), there are few vertebrate species on Lanzarote. These include birds (such as [[falcon]]s) and reptiles. Some interesting endemic animals are the ''[[Gallotia]]'' lizards and the blind ''[[Munidopsis polymorpha]]'' crabs found in the Jameos del Agua lagoon, which was formed by a volcanic eruption.

The island lacked mountains and gorges to serve as hideouts for the remaining Guanche population, and so many Guanches were taken away as slaves that only 300 Guanche men were said to have remained.\n\nAt the southern end of the [[Yaiza]] municipality, the first European settlement in the Canary Islands appeared in 1402 in the area known as ''El Rubic\u00f3n'', where the conquest of the Archipelago began.<ref name=\"juliosanchezrodriguez.com\">[http://www.juliosanchezrodriguez.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/san_marcial.pdf San Marcial del Rubic\u00f3n y los Obispados de Canarias]</ref> In this place, the Cathedral of [[Saint Martial|Saint Martial of Limoges]] was built.

The islands of Fuerteventura and El Hierro were later similarly conquered. In 1477, a decision by the royal council of Castile confirmed a grant of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, with the smaller islands of Ferro and Gomera to the Castilian nobles Herrera, who held their fief until the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Kamen2004\">{{cite book|last=Kamen|first=Henry |title=Empire: How Spain Became a World Power, 1492-1763|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c07Tj2bqIE4C|year=2004|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-093264-0|p=11}}</ref> In 1585, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] admiral [[Murat Reis the Elder|Murat Reis]] temporarily seized Lanzarote.

The priest of Yaiza, Don Andr\u00e9s Lorenzo Curbelo, documented the eruption in detail until 1731. Lava covered a quarter of the island's surface, including the most fertile soil and 11 villages. 100 smaller volcanoes were located in the area called ''Monta\u00f1as del Fuego'', the \"Mountains of Fire\". In 1768, drought affected the deforested island, and winter rains did not fall. Much of the population was forced to emigrate to [[Cuba]] and the [[Americas]], including a group which formed a significant addition to the Spanish settlers in [[Texas]] at [[San Antonio de Bexar]] in 1731. Another volcanic eruption occurred within the range of Tiagua in 1824, which was less violent than the major eruption between 1730 and 1736.\n\nIn 1927, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura became part of the province of [[Las Palmas]].

It was born through fiery eruptions and has solidified lava streams as well as extravagant rock formations. The island emerged about 15 million years ago as product of the [[Canary hotspot]]. The island, along with others, emerged after the breakup of the African and the American continental plates. The greatest recorded eruptions occurred between 1730 and 1736 in the area now designated [[Timanfaya National Park]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Timanfaya|url=https://www.lanzaroteguide.com/timanfaya/|website=Lanzarote Guide|accessdate=1 August 2017|ref=20}}</ref>\n\n==Biodiversity==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:La Geria vines.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Malvasia]] grape vines growing in topsoil covered in [[lapilli]], in [[La Geria]]. The low, curved walls protect the vines from the constant, drying wind.]]\n\n===Plants===\nThere are five hundred different kinds of plants on the island, of which 17 species are [[endemism|endemic]]. These plants have adapted to the relative scarcity of water in the same way as [[succulent]]s. They include the [[Canary Island date palm]] (''Phoenix canariensis''), which is found in damper areas of the north, the [[Canary Island pine]] (''Pinus canariensis''), [[fern]]s, and [[Olea europaea|wild olive trees]] (''Olea europaea''). ''[[Laurisilva]]'' trees, which once covered the highest parts of Risco de Famara, are rarely found today. After winter rainfall, the vegetation comes to a colourful bloom between February and March.\n\nThe [[vineyard]]s of La Ger\u00eda, [[Lanzarote (DO)|Lanzarote]] ''[[Denominaci\u00f3n de origen|DO]]'' wine region, are a protected area. Single vines are planted in pits {{convert|4|-|5|m|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|2|-|3|m|abbr=off}} deep, with small stone walls around each pit. This agricultural technique is designed to harvest rainfall and overnight dew and to protect the plants from the winds.<!-- NO World Heritage Site on Lanzarote ! see [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain]]: The vineyards, with their traditional methods of cultivation, are part of the [[World Heritage Site]], as well as other sites on the island. -->\n\n===Fungi===\nThere are 180 different species of [[lichen|lichen-forming fungi]]. These survive in the suitable areas like rock surfaces, and promote weathering.\n\n===Animals===\nApart from the native bats and the mammals which accompanied humans to the island (including the [[dromedary]], which was used for agriculture and is now a tourist attraction), there are few vertebrate species on Lanzarote. These include birds (such as [[falcon]]s) and reptiles. Some interesting endemic animals are the ''[[Gallotia]]'' lizards and the blind ''[[Munidopsis polymorpha]]'' crabs found in the Jameos del Agua lagoon, which was formed by a volcanic eruption. The island is also home to one of two surviving populations of the threatened [[Canarian Egyptian vulture]].\n\n== Natural symbols ==\n{{Main|List of animal and plant symbols of the Canary Islands}}\nThe official natural symbols associated with Lanzarote are ''[[Munidopsis polymorpha]]'' (Blind crab) and ''[[Euphorbia balsamifera]]'' (Tabaiba dulce).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gobcan.es/boc/1991/061/001.html|title=BOC \u2013 1991/061.

The island lacked mountains and gorges to serve as hideouts for the remaining Guanche population, and so many Guanches were taken away as slaves that only 300 Guanche men were said to have remained.\n\nAt the southern end of the [[Yaiza]] municipality, the first European settlement in the Canary Islands appeared in 1402 in the area known as ''El Rubic\u00f3n'', where the conquest of the Archipelago began.<ref name=\"juliosanchezrodriguez.com\">[http://www.juliosanchezrodriguez.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/san_marcial.pdf San Marcial del Rubic\u00f3n y los Obispados de Canarias]</ref> In this place, the Cathedral of [[Saint Martial|Saint Martial of Limoges]] was built.

The islands of Fuerteventura and El Hierro were later similarly conquered. In 1477, a decision by the royal council of Castile confirmed a grant of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, with the smaller islands of Ferro and Gomera to the Castilian nobles Herrera, who held their fief until the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Kamen2004\">{{cite book|last=Kamen|first=Henry |title=Empire: How Spain Became a World Power, 1492-1763|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c07Tj2bqIE4C|year=2004|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-093264-0|p=11}}</ref> In 1585, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] admiral [[Murat Reis the Elder|Murat Reis]] temporarily seized Lanzarote.

The priest of Yaiza, Don Andr\u00e9s Lorenzo Curbelo, documented the eruption in detail until 1731. Lava covered a quarter of the island's surface, including the most fertile soil and 11 villages. 100 smaller volcanoes were located in the area called ''Monta\u00f1as del Fuego'', the \"Mountains of Fire\". In 1768, drought affected the deforested island, and winter rains did not fall. Much of the population was forced to emigrate to [[Cuba]] and the [[Americas]], including a group which formed a significant addition to the Spanish settlers in [[Texas]] at [[San Antonio de Bexar]] in 1731. Another volcanic eruption occurred within the range of Tiagua in 1824, which was less violent than the major eruption between 1730 and 1736.\n\nIn 1927, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura became part of the province of [[Las Palmas]].

However, he is waitlisted. He lives with his wealthy adopted family, led by the matriarch Georgina. His opponent in the race is River Barclay, a popular student and friend of Payton's with whom he'd previously had a relationship. Though he knows he can pay the right price to be able to force the majority of his classmates to vote for him. He is also homosexual, a fact he is desperately trying to hide in the fear that he won't be accepted by his classmates and family. Payton is advised by his friends McAfee, James, and his girlfriend Alice. When Payton learns that River has Skye Leighton, a gender-nonconforming black classmate, to be his running mate, Payton confronts him, who informs him that he only did so on his girlfriend Astrid Sloan's direction, apologises to Payton, telling him that he loves him, and commits suicide in front of Payton. Following River's death, Astrid takes his spot on the ticket, retaining Skye as her running-mate. In order to combat the sympathy Astrid gains, Alice and Payton agree to a public breakup to gain sympathy for him. Payton later chooses Infinity Jackson, a student suffering from cancer, as his running-mate, but is told by a student named Andrew that she is faking it. \n |LineColor       = E97D9F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = The Harrington Commode\n |DirectedBy      = Brad Falchuk\n |WrittenBy       = Ryan Murphy & Brad Falchuk & Ian Brennan\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|27}}\n |ProdCode        = 1BAC02\n |ShortSummary    = Georgina tells Keaton, Payton's adopted father, that she's in love with a woman and wants a divorce, leading Keaton to attempt suicide; he survives, and is put into a medically-induced coma.

James, however, shows loyalty by tricking Astrid and Skye, making themselves look bad at a campaign event. Meanwhile, Infinity's boyfriend Ricardo gives Astrid a tape to make Payton look bad.

Meanwhile, McAfee, having graduated with a political science degree from Columbia, begins interning for state senate leader Dede Standish. Due to Standish not having an opponent for years, the campaign is not up with the times. McAfee contacts James, and the pair pitch a possible run to Payton, since he can capitalize off of the poor state of the MTA. Payton is initially reluctant. He visits Alice before her wedding to another man, and later speaks to River's ghost, who convinces him to run. Payton returns to his dorm, where he is met by James, McAfee, and Skye, as well as Alice, who ran away from the altar, and Astrid, who has been working as a server. Astrid reveals that, while catering an event, she discovered that Standish is in a three-way-marriage, a scandal that Payton can use to his advantage.

His opponent in the race is River Barclay, a popular student and friend of Payton's with whom he'd previously had a relationship. Though he knows he can pay the right price to be able to force the majority of his classmates to vote for him. He is also homosexual, a fact he is desperately trying to hide in the fear that he won't be accepted by his classmates and family. Payton is advised by his friends McAfee, James, and his girlfriend Alice. When Payton learns that River has Skye Leighton, a gender-nonconforming black classmate, to be his running mate, Payton confronts him, who informs him that he only did so on his girlfriend Astrid Sloan's direction, apologises to Payton, telling him that he loves him, and commits suicide in front of Payton. Following River's death, Astrid takes his spot on the ticket, retaining Skye as her running-mate. In order to combat the sympathy Astrid gains, Alice and Payton agree to a public breakup to gain sympathy for him.

McAfee contacts James, and the pair pitch a possible run to Payton, since he can capitalize off of the poor state of the MTA. Payton is initially reluctant. He visits Alice before her wedding to another man, and later speaks to River's ghost, who convinces him to run. Payton returns to his dorm, where he is met by James, McAfee, and Skye, as well as Alice, who ran away from the altar, and Astrid, who has been working as a server. Astrid reveals that, while catering an event, she discovered that Standish is in a three-way-marriage, a scandal that Payton can use to his advantage. With his team by his side, Payton declares his run for state senate, though all are unaware that Standish is secretly planning on running for Vice President of the United States.\n |LineColor       = E97D9F\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn February 5, 2018, it was announced that [[Netflix]] had given the production a two-season straight-to-series order.
