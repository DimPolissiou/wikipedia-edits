ITS has five faculties containing 27 academic departments which occupy an area of 180 hectares.\n\nITS was founded on November 10, 1957, as its establishment charter was signed by [[Sukarno]], the first President of Republic of Indonesia. Initially, '''Sepuluh Nopember Technical College''' had only two departments, [[Civil Engineering]] and [[Mechanical Engineering]]. In his speech, President Sukarno himself gave the strong emphasis on the Spirit of Sepuluh Nopember, remembering the famous Battle of Surabaya which reached its heat on November 10, 1945 and annually being commemorated as Heroes Day in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2001, in response to the vision of [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], the fourth President of Republic of Indonesia, ITS introduced a faculty of information technology consisting of two departments: Informatics Engineering and Information Systems. Today, ITS's educational disciplines have expanded beyond sciences and engineering into fields such as arts and business management.\n\nITS is known as one of the best [[Engineering education|engineering schools]] in Indonesia among [[Bandung Institute of Technology|ITB]], [[Gadjah Mada University|UGM]] and [[University of Indonesia|UI]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/institute-technology-sepuluh-nopember|title=Institute of Technology Sepuluh Nopember|date=2015-07-16|website=Top Universities|language=en|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, other two polytechnics; [[Electronic Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya|Electronic State Polytechnic (PENS)]] and [[Surabaya Shipbuilding State Polytechnic|Shipbuilding State Polytechnic (PPNS)]] operate independently on the same area at ITS's main campus in Sukolilo, an area in the vicinity of Eastern Surabaya.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nIn 1957, ITS only had two departments, [[Civil Engineering]] and [[Mechanical Engineering]]. Three years later, ITS expanded by opening [[Electronic Engineering]], [[Naval Architecture and Shipbuilding Engineering]] and [[Chemical Engineering]] departments. These departments then changed their status into faculties.\n\nIn 1965, ITS opened two more faculties, [[Architectural Engineering]] and the [[Faculty (division)|Faculty]] of [[Natural Sciences]]. In 1965, ITS had seven faculties: Faculty of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Naval Architecture and Shipbuilding Engineering, and Faculty of Natural Science.\n\nIn 1972, the campus of the Faculty of Civil Engineering was moved into Jl. Manyar 8 Surabaya; the ITS campuses was separated. In the late of 1975, the Faculty of Architectural Engineering and Faculty of Natural Science were moved into Jl. Cokroaminoto 12A, Surabaya.\n\nToday, ITS has three campus areas: Cokroaminoto, Manyar, and Sukolilo. The Sukolilo campus is the biggest area. The development of the campus area geared up in 1977, two decades since the conversation between Dr. Angka Nitisastro and Ir. Soedjasmono that defined the fighting spirit of ITS character to become Indonesia's best university.<ref>[[:id:Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nIn 1977, with financial aid from [[Asian Development Bank|ADB]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Prospektus ITS|url=http://prospektus.its.ac.id/sejarah.html|website=Sejarah ITS|accessdate=19 October 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107132503/http://prospektus.its.ac.id/sejarah.html|archivedate=7 November 2015}}</ref> ITS started to build a campus complex in the Sukolilo district in eastern Surabaya. Since then, all departments and faculties have moved to the new campus.\n\nIn the early 1980s, reorganization took place in ITS, and the former faculties were downgraded into departments and merged into common discipline faculties. Hence the new ITS organization comprises four faculties: the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Faculty of Industrial Technology, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Planning, and the Faculty of Marine Technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.its.ac.id/about-its-2/about-its/|title=About ITS|website=Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, ITS opened its first polytechnic branch, Shipbuilding Polytechnic of Surabaya. This was followed by the second, Electronic Engineering Polytechnic of Surabaya.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.its.ac.id/about-its-2/about-its/|title=About ITS|website=Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, at the suggestion of the fourth Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, a Faculty of Information Technology was created. It consists of a department of Computer Science and the newly created department of Information Systems.\n\nOn December 14, 2010, President Dr. [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] officially signed the establishment of the Robotics Center Building (''Gedung Pusat Robotika'') in ITS campus, Sukolilo, Surabaya city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.its.ac.id/research/research-facilities/its-robotics-center/|title=ITS Robotics Center|website=Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, ITS, as an institute of technology founded by a medical doctor by the name of Dr. Angka Nitisastro, had its first doctoral graduate on medical engineering, Ingrid Nurtanio, lecturer at University of Hassanuddin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ingrid, Doktor Medical Engineering Pertama Teknik Elektro|url=http://old.its.ac.id/berita.php?nomer=12295|accessdate=19 October 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102803/http://old.its.ac.id/berita.php?nomer=12295|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Campuses ==\n[[File:ITS Library.jpg|alt=|thumb|286x286px|ITS Main Library]]{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Research Center ITS.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Research Tower\n| image2 = MIPA Tower ITS.jpg\n| caption2 = Sciences Tower\n}}\nITS has three campuses in Surabaya. Its major campus is located at Sukolilo, where all [[undergraduate]] programs are located, along with the postgraduate buildings, administrative building, main library, faculties housing, student community center, football stadium, jogging track, and student dormitory that can accommodate 1200 freshmen.\n\nA smaller campus is located in Manyar district, providing a Civil Engineering diploma course.\n\nThe third campus is located at Cokroaminoto Street, providing a [[postgraduate]] Technology Management Magister course.\n\n==Academic facilities and campus life==\nOverall, the campus is spread over a land area of 187 hectares. Graduations are conducted at a general functional hall with a capacity of 4,000 occupants. Sport facilities can be found on the campus: a stadium and football ground, [[futsal]] courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, wall climbing, gymnasium and indoor badminton courts, rafting canal and jogging tracks.\n\n== Faculties and departments ==\nThere are 10 faculties, some departments offer diploma programmes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.its.ac.id/study-at-its/|title=Study at ITS|website=Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\n{{Columns\n| col1 = *'''Faculty of Natural Science'''\n**Department of [[Physics]]\n**Department of [[Chemistry]]\n**Department of [[Biology]]\n*'''Faculty of Mathematics, Computation, and Data Science'''\n**Department of [[Mathematics]]\n**Department of [[Statistics]]\n**Department of [[Actuarial Science]]\n*'''Faculty of Industrial Technology'''\n**Department of [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Chemical Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Industrial Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Material Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Physics Engineering]]\n| col2 = *'''Faculty of Civil Engineering, Environment, and Geoscience'''\n**Department of [[Civil Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Environmental Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Geomatics Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Geophysics Engineering]]\n*'''Faculty of Architecture, Design, and Planning'''\n**Department of [[Architecture]]\n**Department of [[Industrial Design]]\n**Department of Regional and [[Urban Planning]]\n**Department of [[Interior Design]]\n**Department of [[Graphic Design|Visual Communication Design]]\n| col3 = *'''Faculty of Marine Technology'''\n**Department of [[Naval Architecture]] and [[Shipbuilding Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Marine propulsion|Marine Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Ocean Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Sea Transportation]] Engineering \n*'''Faculty of Information and Communication Technology'''\n**Department of [[Informatics]]\n**Department of [[Information Systems]]\n**Department of [[Information Technology]]\n*'''Faculty of Electrical Technology'''\n**Department of [[Electrical Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Computer Engineering]]\n**Department of [[Biomedical engineering|Biomedical Engineering]]\n| col4 = *'''Faculty of Business and Technology Management'''\n**Department of [[Business Management]]\n*'''Faculty of Vocational Studies'''\n**Department of Civil Infrastructure Engineering\n**Department of Industrial Mechanical Engineering\n**Department of Electrical Automation Engineering\n**Department of Industrial Chemical Engineering\n**Department of Instrumentation Engineering\n**Department of Business Statistics\n}}\n\nIn early 2016 the Department of [[Industrial engineering|Industrial Engineering]] achieved [[ABET]] accreditation.

ITS has five faculties containing 27 academic departments which occupy an area of 180 hectares.\n\nITS was founded on November 10, 1957, as its establishment charter was signed by [[Sukarno]], the first President of Republic of Indonesia. Initially, '''Sepuluh Nopember Technical College''' had only two departments, [[Civil Engineering]] and [[Mechanical Engineering]]. In his speech, President Sukarno himself gave the strong emphasis on the Spirit of Sepuluh Nopember, remembering the famous Battle of Surabaya which reached its heat on November 10, 1945 and annually being commemorated as Heroes Day in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2001, in response to the vision of [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], the fourth President of Republic of Indonesia, ITS introduced a faculty of information technology consisting of two departments: Informatics Engineering and Information Systems. Today, ITS's educational disciplines have expanded beyond sciences and engineering into fields such as arts and business management.\n\nITS is known as one of the best [[Engineering education|engineering schools]] in Indonesia among [[Bandung Institute of Technology|ITB]], [[Gadjah Mada University|UGM]] and [[University of Indonesia|UI]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/institute-technology-sepuluh-nopember|title=Institute of Technology Sepuluh Nopember|date=2015-07-16|website=Top Universities|language=en|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, other two polytechnics; [[Electronic Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya|Electronic State Polytechnic (PENS)]] and [[Surabaya Shipbuilding State Polytechnic|Shipbuilding State Polytechnic (PPNS)]] operate independently on the same area at ITS's main campus in Sukolilo, an area in the vicinity of Eastern Surabaya.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nIn 1957, ITS only had two departments, [[Civil Engineering]] and [[Mechanical Engineering]]. Three years later, ITS expanded by opening [[Electronic Engineering]], [[Naval Architecture and Shipbuilding Engineering]] and [[Chemical Engineering]] departments. These departments then changed their status into faculties.\n\nIn 1965, ITS opened two more faculties, [[Architectural Engineering]] and the [[Faculty (division)|Faculty]] of [[Natural Sciences]]. In 1965, ITS had seven faculties: Faculty of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Naval Architecture and Shipbuilding Engineering, and Faculty of Natural Science.\n\nIn 1972, the campus of the Faculty of Civil Engineering was moved into Jl. Manyar 8 Surabaya; the ITS campuses was separated. In the late of 1975, the Faculty of Architectural Engineering and Faculty of Natural Science were moved into Jl. Cokroaminoto 12A, Surabaya.\n\nToday, ITS has three campus areas: Cokroaminoto, Manyar, and Sukolilo. The Sukolilo campus is the biggest area. The development of the campus area geared up in 1977, two decades since the conversation between Dr. Angka Nitisastro and Ir. Soedjasmono that defined the fighting spirit of ITS character to become Indonesia's best university.<ref>[[:id:Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nIn 1977, with financial aid from [[Asian Development Bank|ADB]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Prospektus ITS|url=http://prospektus.its.ac.id/sejarah.html|website=Sejarah ITS|accessdate=19 October 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107132503/http://prospektus.its.ac.id/sejarah.html|archivedate=7 November 2015}}</ref> ITS started to build a campus complex in the Sukolilo district in eastern Surabaya. Since then, all departments and faculties have moved to the new campus.\n\nIn the early 1980s, reorganization took place in ITS, and the former faculties were downgraded into departments and merged into common discipline faculties. Hence the new ITS organization comprises four faculties: the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Faculty of Industrial Technology, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Planning, and the Faculty of Marine Technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.its.ac.id/about-its-2/about-its/|title=About ITS|website=Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, ITS opened its first polytechnic branch, Shipbuilding Polytechnic of Surabaya. This was followed by the second, Electronic Engineering Polytechnic of Surabaya.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.its.ac.id/about-its-2/about-its/|title=About ITS|website=Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, at the suggestion of the fourth Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, a Faculty of Information Technology was created. It consists of a department of Computer Science and the newly created department of Information Systems.\n\nOn December 14, 2010, President Dr. [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] officially signed the establishment of the Robotics Center Building (''Gedung Pusat Robotika'') in ITS campus, Sukolilo, Surabaya city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.its.ac.id/research/research-facilities/its-robotics-center/|title=ITS Robotics Center|website=Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, ITS, as an institute of technology founded by a medical doctor by the name of Dr. Angka Nitisastro, had its first doctoral graduate on medical engineering, Ingrid Nurtanio, lecturer at University of Hassanuddin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ingrid, Doktor Medical Engineering Pertama Teknik Elektro|url=http://old.its.ac.id/berita.php?nomer=12295|accessdate=19 October 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102803/http://old.its.ac.id/berita.php?nomer=12295|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Campuses ==\n[[File:ITS Library.jpg|alt=|thumb|286x286px|ITS Main Library]]{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Research Center ITS.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Research Tower\n| image2 = MIPA Tower ITS.jpg\n| caption2 = Sciences Tower\n}}\nITS has three campuses in Surabaya.

In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to [[Kemosabe Records]]. Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper [[Flo Rida]]'s number-one single \"[[Right Round]]\".\n\nKesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010) and ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017), and the number-six record ''[[Warrior (Kesha album)|Warrior]]'' (2012). She has attained ten top-ten singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including \"[[Blah Blah Blah (Kesha song)|Blah Blah Blah]]\", \"[[Your Love Is My Drug]]\", \"[[Take It Off (Kesha song)|Take It Off]]\", \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]\", \"[[Die Young (Kesha song)|Die Young]]\", \"[[My First Kiss]]\" with [[3OH!3]], and the chart-topping \"[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]\", \"[[We R Who We R]]\", \"Right Round\" with Flo Rida, and \"[[Timber (Pitbull song)|Timber]]\" with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. \"Tik Tok\", at one point, was the [[List of best-selling singles#Best-selling digital singles|best-selling digital single in history]], selling over 16.5 million units internationally. As of November 2019, the song has sold over 25 million copies. In 2020, Kesha released her fourth studio album [[High Road (Kesha album)|''High Road'']]. She has also written songs for other artists, including \"[[Till the World Ends]]\" for [[Britney Spears]] (2011).\n\nKesha's career was halted between ''Warrior'' and ''Rainbow'' due to a legal dispute with her former producer [[Dr. Luke]], which has been ongoing since 2014. A series of lawsuits, known collectively as ''[[Kesha v.

In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to [[Kemosabe Records]]. Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper [[Flo Rida]]'s number-one single \"[[Right Round]]\".\n\nKesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010) and ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017), and the number-six record ''[[Warrior (Kesha album)|Warrior]]'' (2012).

The picture also stars [[Richard Widmark]] as [[Jim Bowie]] and [[Laurence Harvey]] as [[William B. Travis]], and the supporting cast features [[Frankie Avalon]], [[Patrick Wayne]], [[Linda Cristal]], [[Joan O'Brien]], [[Chill Wills]], [[Joseph Calleia]], [[Ken Curtis]], Ruben Padilla as [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]], and guest star [[Richard Boone]] as [[Sam Houston]]. The motion picture was photographed in 70&nbsp;mm [[Todd-AO]] by [[William H. Clothier]] and released by [[United Artists]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film depicts the Battle of the Alamo and the events leading up to it. Sam Houston leads the forces fighting for Texas independence and needs time to build an army. The opposing Mexican forces, led by General Santa Anna, numerically are stronger as well as better armed and trained. Nevertheless, the Texans have spirit and morale remains generally high.\n\nLieutenant Colonel William Travis is tasked with defending the Alamo, a former mission in San Antonio. Jim Bowie comes with reinforcements and the defenders prepare. Meanwhile, Davy Crockett arrives with a group of Tennesseans.\n\nSanta Anna's armies arrive and surround the fort. The siege begins. An embassy from the Mexican Army approached the Alamo, and as they listed the terms of surrender, Travis fired a cannon by lighting it with his cigar.\n\nIn a nighttime raid, the Texans sabotage the Mexicans' biggest cannon. The Texans maintain high hopes as they are told a strong force led by Colonel [[James Fannin]] is on its way to break the siege. Crockett, however, sensing an imminent attack, sends one of his younger men, Smitty, to ask Houston for help. Crockett knows this will perhaps save Smitty's life.\n\nThe Mexicans frontally attack the Alamo. The defenders hold out and inflict heavy losses on the Mexicans, although the Texans' own losses are not insignificant. Bowie sustains a leg wound. Morale drops when Travis informs his men that Fannin's reinforcements have been ambushed, and slaughtered by the Mexicans.\n\nTravis chooses to stay with his command and defend the Alamo, but he gives the other defenders the option of leaving. Crockett, Bowie and their men prepare to leave, but an inspired tribute by Travis convinces them to stay and fight to the end. The noncombatants, including most of the women and children, leave the Alamo.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the siege, Santa Anna's artillery bombards the Alamo and kills or wounds several Texans. The entire Mexican army sweeps forward, attacking on all sides. The defenders kill dozens of charging Mexicans, but the attack is overwhelming. The Mexicans blast a hole in the Alamo wall and soldiers swarm through. Travis tries to rally the men but is shot and killed. Crockett leads the Texans in the final defense of the fort. The Mexicans swarm through and overwhelm the Texans. The Texans retreat to their final defensive positions. Crockett is killed in the chaos when he is run through by a lance and then blown up as he ignites the powder magazine. Bowie, in bed with his wound, kills several Mexicans but is bayoneted and dies. As the last Texan is killed, the Mexican soldiers discover the hiding place of the wife and child of Texan defender [[Almaron Dickinson|Captain Dickinson]]. The battle is over, and the Mexicans have won.\n\nSanta Anna observes the carnage and provides safe passage for Mrs. Dickinson and her child. Smitty returns too late, watching from a distance. He takes off his hat in respect and then escorts Mrs. Dickinson away from the battlefield.\n\nThe subplot follows the conflict existing among the strong-willed personalities of Travis, Bowie, and Crockett. Travis stubbornly defends his decisions as commander of the garrison against the suggestions of the other two - particularly Bowie with whom the most bitter conflict develops - as well as trying to maintain discipline among a force made up primarily of independently minded frontiersmen and settlers. Crockett, well liked by both Bowie and Travis, eventually becomes a mediator between the other two as Bowie constantly threatens to withdraw his men rather than deal with Travis. Despite their personal conflicts, all three learn to subordinate their differences, and in the end, bind themselves together in an act of bravery to defend the fort against inevitable defeat.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Wayne]] as Col.

They hired Pat Ford, son of [[John Ford]], as a research assistant. As the script neared completion, however, Wayne and [[Herbert Yates]], the president of [[Republic Pictures]], clashed over the proposed $3 million budget.<ref name=roberts261>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 261.</ref> Wayne left Republic over the feud but was unable to take his script with him. That script later was rewritten and made into the movie ''[[The Last Command (1955 film)|The Last Command]]'' with Jim Bowie the character of focus.<ref name=roberts262>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 262.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWayne and producer Robert Fellows formed [[Batjac Productions|Batjac]], their own production company.<ref name=roberts262/> As Wayne developed his vision of what a movie about the Alamo should be, he concluded he did not want to risk seeing that vision changed; he would produce and direct the movie himself, though not act in it. However, he was unable to enlist financial support for the project without the presumptive box-office guarantee his on-screen appearance would provide. In 1956, he signed with [[United Artists]]; UA would contribute $2.5 million to the movie's development and serve as distributor. In exchange, Batjac was to contribute an additional $1.5 to $2.5 million, and Wayne would star in the movie. Wayne secured the remainder of the financing from wealthy Texans who insisted the movie be shot in Texas.<ref name=roberts263>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 263.</ref> In an interview in the UK with [[Robert Robinson (broadcaster)|Robert Robinson]] after the movie was finished, Wayne admitted he invested $1.5 million of his own money in ''The Alamo'' and believed it was a good investment.\n\n===Set===\n[[File:Alamo replica.jpg|thumb|Replica Alamo mission used for production]]\nThe movie set, later known as [[Alamo Village]], was constructed near [[Brackettville, Texas]], on the ranch of James T. Shahan. Chatto Rodriquez, the general contractor of the set, built {{convert|14|mi|km}} of tarred roads for access to the set from Brackettville. His men sank six wells to provide 12,000 gallons of water each day, and laid miles of sewage and water lines. They also built {{convert|5000|acre|ha}} of horse corrals.<ref name=roberts264>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 264.</ref>\n\nRodriquez worked with art designer Alfred Ybarra to create the set. Historians Randy Roberts and James Olson describe it as \"the most authentic set in the history of the movies\".<ref name=roberts264/> Over a million and a quarter adobe bricks were formed by hand to create the walls of the former [[Alamo Mission]].<ref name=roberts264/> The set was an extensive three quarter-scale replica of the mission, and has been used in 100 other [[western movie|westerns]], including other depictions of the battle. It took more than two years to construct.\n\n===Casting===\nWayne was to have portrayed [[Sam Houston]], a bit part that would have let him focus on his first major directing effort, but investors insisted he play a leading character. He took on the role of [[Davy Crockett]], handing the part of Houston to [[Richard Boone]].<ref>Clark, Donald, & Christopher P. Andersen. ''John Wayne's The Alamo: The Making of the Epic Film'' (New York: Carol Publishing Group, 1995) {{ISBN|0-8065-1625-9}}</ref> Wayne cast [[Richard Widmark]] as [[James Bowie|Jim Bowie]] and [[Laurence Harvey]] as [[William Barrett Travis]].<ref name=roberts264/> Harvey was chosen because Wayne admired British stage actors and he wanted \"British class\". When production became tense, Harvey spoke lines from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in a Texan accent.<ref name=\"JohnWayneTheManBehindTheMyth\">''John Wayne &mdash; The Man Behind The Myth'' by Michael Munn, published by Robson Books, 2004</ref> Other roles went to family and close friends of Wayne, including his son [[Patrick Wayne]] and daughter [[Aissa Wayne|Aissa]].<ref name=roberts265>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 265.</ref> The future western songwriter and stuntman [[Rudy Robbins]] had a bit role in the film as one of the Tennessee Volunteers.\n\nJohn Wayne had made ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959) with singer [[Ricky Nelson]] in a supporting role to attract teen audiences. It had worked, so he hired [[Frankie Avalon]] to perform a similar function. According to Avalon, \"Wayne had seen some of the rushes from ''[[Guns of the Timberland|Timberland]]'' and thought I would be right.\"<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/07/entertainment/et-king7|title=The reluctant Angel|date=7 January 2003|first=Susan|last=King}}</ref> After making the film, Wayne told the press \"We're not cutting one bit of any scene in which Frankie appears. I believe he is the finest young talent I've seen in a long time.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=As Actor, Avalon Tops with Wayne: Frankie Signed for Repeats; 'West Side' Demands Unique|last=Scheuer|first= Philip K. |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=6 Apr 1960|page= C9}}</ref> \"Mr. Wayne said I was natural as far as acting goes,\" said Avalon.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Fledglings Goal: Frankie Avalon Aims High Frankie Avalon Grabs for Handful of Stars|last=Alpert|first= Don|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=15 May 1960|page=H11}}</ref>\n\nSeveral days after filming began, Widmark complained he had been miscast and tried to leave. Among other things, it seemed ridiculous that the relatively diminutive (5'9\") Widmark would be playing the \"larger than life\" Bowie, who was a reported 6'6\". After threats of legal action, he agreed to finish the picture.<ref name=roberts266>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 266.</ref> During the filming he had [[Burt Kennedy]] rewrite his lines.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">pp. 146-147 Joyner, C. Courtney ''Burt Kennedy Interview'' in ''The Westerners: Interviews with Actors, Directors, Writers and Producers'' McFarland, 14/10/2009</ref>\n\nAvalon says \"There may have been some conflict with Widmark in portraying the role that he did, but I didn't see any of that. All I know is he was tough to work for without a doubt because he [Wayne] wanted it his way and he wanted professionalism. He wanted everybody to know their lines and be on their mark and do what he wanted them to do.\"<ref>Beach movies were all about pretty girls: [Final Edition] TIANEN, DAVE. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; Milwaukee, Wis. [Milwaukee, Wis] 03 Nov 2002: 2A.</ref>\n\n[[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] asked Wayne for the part of a slave as he wanted to break out of song and dance. Some producers blocked the move, apparently because Davis was dating white actress [[May Britt]].<ref name=\"JohnWayneTheManBehindTheMyth\"/>\n\n===Direction===\nWayne's mentor [[John Ford]] showed up uninvited and attempted to exert undue influence on the film. Wayne sent him off to shoot unnecessary second-unit footage in order to maintain his own authority. Virtually nothing of Ford's footage was used, but Ford erroneously is described as an uncredited co-director.<ref name=\"making\">Clark, Donald, & Christopher P. Andersen.  ''John Wayne's The Alamo:  The Making of the Epic Film'', Carol:  1995</ref>\n\nAccording to many people involved in the film, Wayne was an intelligent and gifted director despite a weakness for the long-winded dialogue of James Edward Grant, his favorite screenwriter.<ref name=\"making\"/> Roberts and Olson describe his direction as \"competent, but not outstanding.\"<ref name=roberts268>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 268.</ref> Widmark complained that Wayne would try to tell him and other actors how to play their parts which sometimes went against their own interpretation of characters.<ref name=\"JohnWayneTheManBehindTheMyth\"/><ref name=\"roberts266\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on September 9, 1959. Some actors, notably [[Frankie Avalon]], were intimidated by rattlesnakes. Crickets were everywhere, often ruining shots by jumping on actors' shoulders or chirping loudly.<ref name=\"roberts266\"/>\n\nA bit player, LeJean Ethridge, died in a domestic dispute during filming, and Wayne was called to testify at an inquest.\n\nHarvey forgot that a firing cannon has a recoil; during the scene in which, as Travis, he fires in response to a surrender demand, the cannon came down on his foot, breaking it &mdash; he didn't scream in pain until after Wayne had called \"Cut!\". Wayne praised his professionalism.<ref name=\"JohnWayneTheManBehindTheMyth\"/>\n\nFilming ended on December 15. A total of 560,000 feet of film was produced for 566 scenes. Despite the scope of the filming, it lasted only three weeks longer than scheduled. By the end of development, the film had been edited to three hours and 13 minutes.<ref name=roberts269>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 269.</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe score was composed by [[Dimitri Tiomkin]], and most famously featured the song \"[[The Green Leaves of Summer]]\", with music by Tiomkin and lyrics by [[Paul Francis Webster]]. The song was performed on the soundtrack by [[The Brothers Four]] whose rendition reached #65 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart; it has been covered by many artists.\n\nAnother well known song from this film is \"Ballad of the Alamo\" (with [[Paul Francis Webster]]), which was performed on the soundtrack by [[Marty Robbins]].<ref>William R. Chemerka, Allen J. Wiener: ''Music of the Alamo''. Bright Sky Press, 2009. p. 118, 151</ref> [[Frankie Avalon]] released a cover version as did the folk duo [[Bud & Travis]] whose rendition (with \"The Green Leaves of Summer\" on the flip side) reached #64 on the Billboard chart. Members of the [[Western Writers of America]] chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.<ref name=\"Top100\">{{Cite web|title=The Top 100 Western Songs|author=Western Writers of America|year=2010|authorlink=Western Writers of America|publisher=American Cowboy|url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RjFQXqGy?url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs|archivedate=10 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe original soundtrack album has been issued on [[Columbia Records]], [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]], and [[Ryko Records]]. In 2010, a complete score containing recorded versions of Tiomkin's music was issued on [[Tadlow Music]]/Prometheus Records, as conducted by Nic Raine and played by the [[City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]]. This release contains previously unreleased material.\n\n==Release==\nWayne hired publicist Russell Birdwell to coordinate the media campaign.<ref name=roberts271/> Birdwell convinced seven states to declare an Alamo Day and sent information to elementary schools around the United States to assist in teaching about the Alamo.<ref name=roberts272>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 272.</ref>\n\nIn 1960, the world premiere was held at the [[Woodlawn Theatre]] in San Antonio, Texas.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Paula |title=Woodlawn theater made big changes to show 'The Alamo' |url=https://www.expressnews.com/life/life_columnists/paula_allen/article/Woodlawn-theater-made-big-changes-to-show-The-12259861.php |website=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |accessdate=January 30, 2019 |date=October 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Historical accuracy===\nThe film does little to explain the causes of the [[Texas Revolution]] or why the battle took place.<ref name=roberts270>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 270.</ref> Alamo historian Timothy Todish said \"there is not a single scene in ''The Alamo'' which corresponds to a historically verifiable incident.\" Historians [[James Frank Dobie]] and [[Lon Tinkle]] demanded their names be removed as historical advisors.<ref name=todish188>Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 188.</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nWayne's daughter Aissa wrote \"I think making ''The Alamo'' became my father's own form of combat. More than an obsession, it was the most intensely personal project in his career.\"<ref name=roberts271>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 271.</ref> Many of Wayne's associates agreed that the film was a political platform for Wayne. Many of the statements that his character made reflected Wayne's anti-communist views. To be sure, there is an overwhelming theme of freedom and the right of individuals to make their own decisions. One may point to a scene in which Wayne, as Crockett, remarks: \"Republic. I like the sound of the word. Means that people can live free, talk free, go or come, buy or sell, be drunk or sober, however they choose. Some words give you a feeling. Republic is one of those words that makes me tight in the throat.\"<ref name=\"roberts271\"/>\n\nThe film draws elements from the [[Cold War]] environment in which it was produced. According to Roberts and Olson, \"the script evokes parallels between Santa Anna's Mexico and Khruschchev's Soviet Union as well as Hitler's Germany. All three demanded lines in the sand and resistance to death.\"<ref name=roberts271/>\n\nMany of the minor characters, at some point during the film, speak about freedom and/or death, and their sentiments may have reflected Wayne's own viewpoint.\n\n==Response==\nThough the film had a large box-office take, its cost kept it from being a success, and Wayne lost his personal investment. He sold his rights to [[United Artists]], which had released it, and it made back its money.\n\nCritical response was mixed, from the ''New York Herald Tribune'''s four-star \"A magnificent job...Visually and dramatically, ''The Alamo'' is top-flight,\" to ''Time'' magazine's \"flat as Texas.\"<ref>quoted in Ashford, Gerald. ''On the Aisle'', San Antonio Express and News, November 5, 1960, p. 16-A</ref>\n\nThe film has a score of 52% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 21 reviews.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000560-alamo/ The Alamo - Rotten Tomatoes]</ref>\n\nThe film is thought to have been denied awards because Academy voters were alienated by an overblown publicity campaign, particularly one ''Variety'' ad claiming that the film's cast was praying harder for [[Chill Wills]] to win his award than the defenders of the Alamo prayed for their lives before the battle. The ad, placed by Wills, reportedly angered Wayne, who took out an ad of his own deploring Wills's tastelessness. In response to Wills's ad, claiming that all the voters were his \"Alamo Cousins,\" [[Groucho Marx]] took out a small ad which simply said \"Dear Mr. Wills, I am delighted to be your cousin, but I voted for [[Sal Mineo]]\u201d (Wills's rival nominee for ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'').<ref>Levy, Emanuel. ''Oscar Scandals: Chill Wills''  http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=822</ref>\n\nWayne provided a clip of the film for use in ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Alamo Movies |last=Thompson |first=Frank |publisher=Woodware Publishing |date=1991 |ISBN=1-55622-375-7 |p=173}}</ref> Despite being anachronistic (''How the West Was Won'' begins in 1839 and the Alamo fell in 1836), the clip occurs near the beginning of the second half of the film, as [[Spencer Tracy]] narrates the events that led up to the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Awards and honors===\n''The Alamo'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Academy Award for Best Sound]] ([[Gordon E. Sawyer]] and [[Fred Hynes]]) and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] (Chill Wills), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography (Color)]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] ([[Stuart Gilmore]]), [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music (Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture)]] ([[Dimitri Tiomkin]]), [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Music (Song)]] ([[Dimitri Tiomkin]] and [[Paul Francis Webster]] for ''The Green Leaves of Summer''), and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] ([[John Wayne]], producer).<ref name=\"Oscars1961\">{{Citation|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1961 |title=The 33rd Academy Awards (1961) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-08-22|work=oscars.org|postscript= }}</ref> Its successful bid for several Oscar nominations over such films as ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (which reviewed four nominations) and ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (which received six) was largely due to intense lobbying by producer John Wayne.<ref>Dirks, Tim. http://www.filmsite.org/aa60.html</ref>\n\nDimitri Tiomkin won the best original score [[Golden Globe]] award. The movie was selected by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the year's 10 best films. The picture won the Bronze Wrangler award as the best theatrical motion picture of the year from the [[National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum|Western Heritage Awards]].\n\n==Different versions==\n''The Alamo'' premiered at its 70&nbsp;mm roadshow length of 202 minutes, including overture, intermission, and exit music, but was cut severely for wide release. UA re-edited it to 167 minutes. The 202-minute version was believed lost until Bob Bryden, a Canadian fan, realized he had seen the full version in the 1970s. He and Alamo collector Ashley Ward discovered the last known surviving print of the 70&nbsp;mm premiere version in Toronto.<ref>{{citation|last=Bryden|first=Bob|title=The Finding of the 'Lost' Alamo Footage'|url=http://www.bobbryden.com/}}</ref> It was pristine. MGM (UA's sister studio) used this print to make a digital video transfer of the roadshow version for VHS and [[LaserDisc]] release.\n\nThe print was taken apart and deteriorated in storage. By 2007, it was unavailable in any useful form. MGM used the shorter, general release version for subsequent DVD releases. At present, the only existing version of the original uncut roadshow release is on standard definition 480i digital video. It is the source for broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies. The best available actual film elements are of the 35&nbsp;mm negatives of the general release version.\n\nA restoration of the deteriorating print found in Toronto, supervised by [[Robert A. Harris]], was envisaged but to date is not underway.<ref>{{citation|last=Harris|first=Robert A.|title=The Reconstruction and Restoration of John Wayne's THE ALAMO|url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/columns/my-two-cents/052814_1330}}</ref> The endangered version is the 70&nbsp;mm uncut roadshow version (202 min). The cut 167-minute version still exists in decent condition in 35&nbsp;mm.\n\nIn 2014, an Internet campaign was formed urging MGM to restore ''The Alamo'' from the deteriorating 70mm elements. This garnered some publicity from [[KENS-TV]] in San Antonio, and attention from filmmakers such as [[J.J. Abrams]], [[Matt Reeves]], [[Rian Johnson]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]], and [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]].<ref>[http://www.hollywood-elsewhere.com/2014/06/alamo-restoration-pallies/]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kens5.com/news/local/Strong-push-to-save-1960-film-The-Alamo-with-John-Wayne-264801061.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140627181051/http://www.kens5.com/news/local/Strong-push-to-save-1960-film-The-Alamo-with-John-Wayne-264801061.html |archivedate=2014-06-27 }}</ref> In his 2014 biography of Wayne, ''John Wayne: The Life and Legend'' author [[Scott Eyman]] states that the full-length Toronto print has deteriorated to the point where it is now unusable.<ref>Eyman, Scott.

Clothier]] and released by [[United Artists]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film depicts the Battle of the Alamo and the events leading up to it. Sam Houston leads the forces fighting for Texas independence and needs time to build an army. The opposing Mexican forces, led by General Santa Anna, numerically are stronger as well as better armed and trained. Nevertheless, the Texans have spirit and morale remains generally high.\n\nLieutenant Colonel William Travis is tasked with defending the Alamo, a former mission in San Antonio. Jim Bowie comes with reinforcements and the defenders prepare. Meanwhile, Davy Crockett arrives with a group of Tennesseans.\n\nSanta Anna's armies arrive and surround the fort. The siege begins. An embassy from the Mexican Army approached the Alamo, and as they listed the terms of surrender, Travis fired a cannon by lighting it with his cigar.\n\nIn a nighttime raid, the Texans sabotage the Mexicans' biggest cannon. The Texans maintain high hopes as they are told a strong force led by Colonel [[James Fannin]] is on its way to break the siege. Crockett, however, sensing an imminent attack, sends one of his younger men, Smitty, to ask Houston for help. Crockett knows this will perhaps save Smitty's life.\n\nThe Mexicans frontally attack the Alamo. The defenders hold out and inflict heavy losses on the Mexicans, although the Texans' own losses are not insignificant. Bowie sustains a leg wound. Morale drops when Travis informs his men that Fannin's reinforcements have been ambushed, and slaughtered by the Mexicans.\n\nTravis chooses to stay with his command and defend the Alamo, but he gives the other defenders the option of leaving. Crockett, Bowie and their men prepare to leave, but an inspired tribute by Travis convinces them to stay and fight to the end. The noncombatants, including most of the women and children, leave the Alamo.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the siege, Santa Anna's artillery bombards the Alamo and kills or wounds several Texans. The entire Mexican army sweeps forward, attacking on all sides. The defenders kill dozens of charging Mexicans, but the attack is overwhelming. The Mexicans blast a hole in the Alamo wall and soldiers swarm through. Travis tries to rally the men but is shot and killed. Crockett leads the Texans in the final defense of the fort. The Mexicans swarm through and overwhelm the Texans. The Texans retreat to their final defensive positions. Crockett is killed in the chaos when he is run through by a lance and then blown up as he ignites the powder magazine. Bowie, in bed with his wound, kills several Mexicans but is bayoneted and dies. As the last Texan is killed, the Mexican soldiers discover the hiding place of the wife and child of Texan defender [[Almaron Dickinson|Captain Dickinson]]. The battle is over, and the Mexicans have won.\n\nSanta Anna observes the carnage and provides safe passage for Mrs. Dickinson and her child. Smitty returns too late, watching from a distance. He takes off his hat in respect and then escorts Mrs. Dickinson away from the battlefield.\n\nThe subplot follows the conflict existing among the strong-willed personalities of Travis, Bowie, and Crockett. Travis stubbornly defends his decisions as commander of the garrison against the suggestions of the other two - particularly Bowie with whom the most bitter conflict develops - as well as trying to maintain discipline among a force made up primarily of independently minded frontiersmen and settlers. Crockett, well liked by both Bowie and Travis, eventually becomes a mediator between the other two as Bowie constantly threatens to withdraw his men rather than deal with Travis. Despite their personal conflicts, all three learn to subordinate their differences, and in the end, bind themselves together in an act of bravery to defend the fort against inevitable defeat.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Wayne]] as Col. [[Davy Crockett]], a larger-than-life legend from Tennessee who arrives at the Alamo bringing a band of fellow adventurers to the fight.\n* [[Richard Widmark]] as Col. [[James Bowie|Jim Bowie]], a legendary figure like Crockett, who shares command of the Alamo with William Travis, but bears ultimate authority only over his volunteer group.\n* [[Laurence Harvey]] as [[William B.

They hired Pat Ford, son of [[John Ford]], as a research assistant. As the script neared completion, however, Wayne and [[Herbert Yates]], the president of [[Republic Pictures]], clashed over the proposed $3 million budget.<ref name=roberts261>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 261.</ref> Wayne left Republic over the feud but was unable to take his script with him. That script later was rewritten and made into the movie ''[[The Last Command (1955 film)|The Last Command]]'' with Jim Bowie the character of focus.<ref name=roberts262>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 262.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWayne and producer Robert Fellows formed [[Batjac Productions|Batjac]], their own production company.<ref name=roberts262/> As Wayne developed his vision of what a movie about the Alamo should be, he concluded he did not want to risk seeing that vision changed; he would produce and direct the movie himself, though not act in it. However, he was unable to enlist financial support for the project without the presumptive box-office guarantee his on-screen appearance would provide. In 1956, he signed with [[United Artists]]; UA would contribute $2.5 million to the movie's development and serve as distributor. In exchange, Batjac was to contribute an additional $1.5 to $2.5 million, and Wayne would star in the movie. Wayne secured the remainder of the financing from wealthy Texans who insisted the movie be shot in Texas.<ref name=roberts263>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 263.</ref> In an interview in the UK with [[Robert Robinson (broadcaster)|Robert Robinson]] after the movie was finished, Wayne admitted he invested $1.5 million of his own money in ''The Alamo'' and believed it was a good investment.\n\n===Set===\n[[File:Alamo replica.jpg|thumb|Replica Alamo mission used for production]]\nThe movie set, later known as [[Alamo Village]], was constructed near [[Brackettville, Texas]], on the ranch of James T. Shahan. Chatto Rodriquez, the general contractor of the set, built {{convert|14|mi|km}} of tarred roads for access to the set from Brackettville. His men sank six wells to provide 12,000 gallons of water each day, and laid miles of sewage and water lines. They also built {{convert|5000|acre|ha}} of horse corrals.<ref name=roberts264>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 264.</ref>\n\nRodriquez worked with art designer Alfred Ybarra to create the set. Historians Randy Roberts and James Olson describe it as \"the most authentic set in the history of the movies\".<ref name=roberts264/> Over a million and a quarter adobe bricks were formed by hand to create the walls of the former [[Alamo Mission]].<ref name=roberts264/> The set was an extensive three quarter-scale replica of the mission, and has been used in 100 other [[western movie|westerns]], including other depictions of the battle. It took more than two years to construct.\n\n===Casting===\nWayne was to have portrayed [[Sam Houston]], a bit part that would have let him focus on his first major directing effort, but investors insisted he play a leading character. He took on the role of [[Davy Crockett]], handing the part of Houston to [[Richard Boone]].<ref>Clark, Donald, & Christopher P. Andersen. ''John Wayne's The Alamo: The Making of the Epic Film'' (New York: Carol Publishing Group, 1995) {{ISBN|0-8065-1625-9}}</ref> Wayne cast [[Richard Widmark]] as [[James Bowie|Jim Bowie]] and [[Laurence Harvey]] as [[William Barrett Travis]].<ref name=roberts264/> Harvey was chosen because Wayne admired British stage actors and he wanted \"British class\". When production became tense, Harvey spoke lines from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in a Texan accent.<ref name=\"JohnWayneTheManBehindTheMyth\">''John Wayne &mdash; The Man Behind The Myth'' by Michael Munn, published by Robson Books, 2004</ref> Other roles went to family and close friends of Wayne, including his son [[Patrick Wayne]] and daughter [[Aissa Wayne|Aissa]].<ref name=roberts265>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 265.</ref> The future western songwriter and stuntman [[Rudy Robbins]] had a bit role in the film as one of the Tennessee Volunteers.\n\nJohn Wayne had made ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959) with singer [[Ricky Nelson]] in a supporting role to attract teen audiences. It had worked, so he hired [[Frankie Avalon]] to perform a similar function. According to Avalon, \"Wayne had seen some of the rushes from ''[[Guns of the Timberland|Timberland]]'' and thought I would be right.\"<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/07/entertainment/et-king7|title=The reluctant Angel|date=7 January 2003|first=Susan|last=King}}</ref> After making the film, Wayne told the press \"We're not cutting one bit of any scene in which Frankie appears. I believe he is the finest young talent I've seen in a long time.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=As Actor, Avalon Tops with Wayne: Frankie Signed for Repeats; 'West Side' Demands Unique|last=Scheuer|first= Philip K. |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=6 Apr 1960|page= C9}}</ref> \"Mr. Wayne said I was natural as far as acting goes,\" said Avalon.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Fledglings Goal: Frankie Avalon Aims High Frankie Avalon Grabs for Handful of Stars|last=Alpert|first= Don|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=15 May 1960|page=H11}}</ref>\n\nSeveral days after filming began, Widmark complained he had been miscast and tried to leave. Among other things, it seemed ridiculous that the relatively diminutive (5'9\") Widmark would be playing the \"larger than life\" Bowie, who was a reported 6'6\". After threats of legal action, he agreed to finish the picture.<ref name=roberts266>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 266.</ref> During the filming he had [[Burt Kennedy]] rewrite his lines.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">pp. 146-147 Joyner, C. Courtney ''Burt Kennedy Interview'' in ''The Westerners: Interviews with Actors, Directors, Writers and Producers'' McFarland, 14/10/2009</ref>\n\nAvalon says \"There may have been some conflict with Widmark in portraying the role that he did, but I didn't see any of that. All I know is he was tough to work for without a doubt because he [Wayne] wanted it his way and he wanted professionalism. He wanted everybody to know their lines and be on their mark and do what he wanted them to do.\"<ref>Beach movies were all about pretty girls: [Final Edition] TIANEN, DAVE. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; Milwaukee, Wis. [Milwaukee, Wis] 03 Nov 2002: 2A.</ref>\n\n[[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] asked Wayne for the part of a slave as he wanted to break out of song and dance. Some producers blocked the move, apparently because Davis was dating white actress [[May Britt]].<ref name=\"JohnWayneTheManBehindTheMyth\"/>\n\n===Direction===\nWayne's mentor [[John Ford]] showed up uninvited and attempted to exert undue influence on the film. Wayne sent him off to shoot unnecessary second-unit footage in order to maintain his own authority. Virtually nothing of Ford's footage was used, but Ford erroneously is described as an uncredited co-director.<ref name=\"making\">Clark, Donald, & Christopher P. Andersen.  ''John Wayne's The Alamo:  The Making of the Epic Film'', Carol:  1995</ref>\n\nAccording to many people involved in the film, Wayne was an intelligent and gifted director despite a weakness for the long-winded dialogue of James Edward Grant, his favorite screenwriter.<ref name=\"making\"/> Roberts and Olson describe his direction as \"competent, but not outstanding.\"<ref name=roberts268>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 268.</ref> Widmark complained that Wayne would try to tell him and other actors how to play their parts which sometimes went against their own interpretation of characters.<ref name=\"JohnWayneTheManBehindTheMyth\"/><ref name=\"roberts266\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on September 9, 1959. Some actors, notably [[Frankie Avalon]], were intimidated by rattlesnakes. Crickets were everywhere, often ruining shots by jumping on actors' shoulders or chirping loudly.<ref name=\"roberts266\"/>\n\nA bit player, LeJean Ethridge, died in a domestic dispute during filming, and Wayne was called to testify at an inquest.\n\nHarvey forgot that a firing cannon has a recoil; during the scene in which, as Travis, he fires in response to a surrender demand, the cannon came down on his foot, breaking it &mdash; he didn't scream in pain until after Wayne had called \"Cut!\". Wayne praised his professionalism.<ref name=\"JohnWayneTheManBehindTheMyth\"/>\n\nFilming ended on December 15. A total of 560,000 feet of film was produced for 566 scenes. Despite the scope of the filming, it lasted only three weeks longer than scheduled. By the end of development, the film had been edited to three hours and 13 minutes.<ref name=roberts269>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 269.</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe score was composed by [[Dimitri Tiomkin]], and most famously featured the song \"[[The Green Leaves of Summer]]\", with music by Tiomkin and lyrics by [[Paul Francis Webster]]. The song was performed on the soundtrack by [[The Brothers Four]] whose rendition reached #65 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart; it has been covered by many artists.\n\nAnother well known song from this film is \"Ballad of the Alamo\" (with [[Paul Francis Webster]]), which was performed on the soundtrack by [[Marty Robbins]].<ref>William R. Chemerka, Allen J. Wiener: ''Music of the Alamo''. Bright Sky Press, 2009. p. 118, 151</ref> [[Frankie Avalon]] released a cover version as did the folk duo [[Bud & Travis]] whose rendition (with \"The Green Leaves of Summer\" on the flip side) reached #64 on the Billboard chart. Members of the [[Western Writers of America]] chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.<ref name=\"Top100\">{{Cite web|title=The Top 100 Western Songs|author=Western Writers of America|year=2010|authorlink=Western Writers of America|publisher=American Cowboy|url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RjFQXqGy?url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs|archivedate=10 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe original soundtrack album has been issued on [[Columbia Records]], [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]], and [[Ryko Records]]. In 2010, a complete score containing recorded versions of Tiomkin's music was issued on [[Tadlow Music]]/Prometheus Records, as conducted by Nic Raine and played by the [[City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]]. This release contains previously unreleased material.\n\n==Release==\nWayne hired publicist Russell Birdwell to coordinate the media campaign.<ref name=roberts271/> Birdwell convinced seven states to declare an Alamo Day and sent information to elementary schools around the United States to assist in teaching about the Alamo.<ref name=roberts272>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 272.</ref>\n\nIn 1960, the world premiere was held at the [[Woodlawn Theatre]] in San Antonio, Texas.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Paula |title=Woodlawn theater made big changes to show 'The Alamo' |url=https://www.expressnews.com/life/life_columnists/paula_allen/article/Woodlawn-theater-made-big-changes-to-show-The-12259861.php |website=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |accessdate=January 30, 2019 |date=October 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Historical accuracy===\nThe film does little to explain the causes of the [[Texas Revolution]] or why the battle took place.<ref name=roberts270>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 270.</ref> Alamo historian Timothy Todish said \"there is not a single scene in ''The Alamo'' which corresponds to a historically verifiable incident.\" Historians [[James Frank Dobie]] and [[Lon Tinkle]] demanded their names be removed as historical advisors.<ref name=todish188>Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 188.</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nWayne's daughter Aissa wrote \"I think making ''The Alamo'' became my father's own form of combat. More than an obsession, it was the most intensely personal project in his career.\"<ref name=roberts271>Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 271.</ref> Many of Wayne's associates agreed that the film was a political platform for Wayne. Many of the statements that his character made reflected Wayne's anti-communist views. To be sure, there is an overwhelming theme of freedom and the right of individuals to make their own decisions. One may point to a scene in which Wayne, as Crockett, remarks: \"Republic. I like the sound of the word. Means that people can live free, talk free, go or come, buy or sell, be drunk or sober, however they choose. Some words give you a feeling. Republic is one of those words that makes me tight in the throat.\"<ref name=\"roberts271\"/>\n\nThe film draws elements from the [[Cold War]] environment in which it was produced. According to Roberts and Olson, \"the script evokes parallels between Santa Anna's Mexico and Khruschchev's Soviet Union as well as Hitler's Germany. All three demanded lines in the sand and resistance to death.\"<ref name=roberts271/>\n\nMany of the minor characters, at some point during the film, speak about freedom and/or death, and their sentiments may have reflected Wayne's own viewpoint.\n\n==Response==\nThough the film had a large box-office take, its cost kept it from being a success, and Wayne lost his personal investment. He sold his rights to [[United Artists]], which had released it, and it made back its money.\n\nCritical response was mixed, from the ''New York Herald Tribune'''s four-star \"A magnificent job...Visually and dramatically, ''The Alamo'' is top-flight,\" to ''Time'' magazine's \"flat as Texas.\"<ref>quoted in Ashford, Gerald. ''On the Aisle'', San Antonio Express and News, November 5, 1960, p. 16-A</ref>\n\nThe film has a score of 52% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 21 reviews.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000560-alamo/ The Alamo - Rotten Tomatoes]</ref>\n\nThe film is thought to have been denied awards because Academy voters were alienated by an overblown publicity campaign, particularly one ''Variety'' ad claiming that the film's cast was praying harder for [[Chill Wills]] to win his award than the defenders of the Alamo prayed for their lives before the battle. The ad, placed by Wills, reportedly angered Wayne, who took out an ad of his own deploring Wills's tastelessness. In response to Wills's ad, claiming that all the voters were his \"Alamo Cousins,\" [[Groucho Marx]] took out a small ad which simply said \"Dear Mr. Wills, I am delighted to be your cousin, but I voted for [[Sal Mineo]]\u201d (Wills's rival nominee for ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'').<ref>Levy, Emanuel. ''Oscar Scandals: Chill Wills''  http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=822</ref>\n\nWayne provided a clip of the film for use in ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Alamo Movies |last=Thompson |first=Frank |publisher=Woodware Publishing |date=1991 |ISBN=1-55622-375-7 |p=173}}</ref> Despite being anachronistic (''How the West Was Won'' begins in 1839 and the Alamo fell in 1836), the clip occurs near the beginning of the second half of the film, as [[Spencer Tracy]] narrates the events that led up to the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Awards and honors===\n''The Alamo'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Academy Award for Best Sound]] ([[Gordon E. Sawyer]] and [[Fred Hynes]]) and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] (Chill Wills), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography (Color)]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] ([[Stuart Gilmore]]), [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music (Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture)]] ([[Dimitri Tiomkin]]), [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Music (Song)]] ([[Dimitri Tiomkin]] and [[Paul Francis Webster]] for ''The Green Leaves of Summer''), and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] ([[John Wayne]], producer).<ref name=\"Oscars1961\">{{Citation|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1961 |title=The 33rd Academy Awards (1961) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-08-22|work=oscars.org|postscript= }}</ref> Its successful bid for several Oscar nominations over such films as ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (which reviewed four nominations) and ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (which received six) was largely due to intense lobbying by producer John Wayne.<ref>Dirks, Tim. http://www.filmsite.org/aa60.html</ref>\n\nDimitri Tiomkin won the best original score [[Golden Globe]] award. The movie was selected by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the year's 10 best films. The picture won the Bronze Wrangler award as the best theatrical motion picture of the year from the [[National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum|Western Heritage Awards]].\n\n==Different versions==\n''The Alamo'' premiered at its 70&nbsp;mm roadshow length of 202 minutes, including overture, intermission, and exit music, but was cut severely for wide release. UA re-edited it to 167 minutes. The 202-minute version was believed lost until Bob Bryden, a Canadian fan, realized he had seen the full version in the 1970s. He and Alamo collector Ashley Ward discovered the last known surviving print of the 70&nbsp;mm premiere version in Toronto.<ref>{{citation|last=Bryden|first=Bob|title=The Finding of the 'Lost' Alamo Footage'|url=http://www.bobbryden.com/}}</ref> It was pristine. MGM (UA's sister studio) used this print to make a digital video transfer of the roadshow version for VHS and [[LaserDisc]] release.\n\nThe print was taken apart and deteriorated in storage. By 2007, it was unavailable in any useful form. MGM used the shorter, general release version for subsequent DVD releases. At present, the only existing version of the original uncut roadshow release is on standard definition 480i digital video. It is the source for broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies. The best available actual film elements are of the 35&nbsp;mm negatives of the general release version.\n\nA restoration of the deteriorating print found in Toronto, supervised by [[Robert A. Harris]], was envisaged but to date is not underway.<ref>{{citation|last=Harris|first=Robert A.|title=The Reconstruction and Restoration of John Wayne's THE ALAMO|url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/columns/my-two-cents/052814_1330}}</ref> The endangered version is the 70&nbsp;mm uncut roadshow version (202 min). The cut 167-minute version still exists in decent condition in 35&nbsp;mm.\n\nIn 2014, an Internet campaign was formed urging MGM to restore ''The Alamo'' from the deteriorating 70mm elements. This garnered some publicity from [[KENS-TV]] in San Antonio, and attention from filmmakers such as [[J.J. Abrams]], [[Matt Reeves]], [[Rian Johnson]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]], and [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]].<ref>[http://www.hollywood-elsewhere.com/2014/06/alamo-restoration-pallies/]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kens5.com/news/local/Strong-push-to-save-1960-film-The-Alamo-with-John-Wayne-264801061.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140627181051/http://www.kens5.com/news/local/Strong-push-to-save-1960-film-The-Alamo-with-John-Wayne-264801061.html |archivedate=2014-06-27 }}</ref> In his 2014 biography of Wayne, ''John Wayne: The Life and Legend'' author [[Scott Eyman]] states that the full-length Toronto print has deteriorated to the point where it is now unusable.<ref>Eyman, Scott.
