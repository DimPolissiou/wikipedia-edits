Agriculture accounted for 90 percent of [[GDP]] in 1985 and employed approximately 80 percent of the work force. [[Rice]] is the principal product.\n\n== Agricultural history ==\nRice production, a vital economic indicator in Cambodia's agrarian society, frequently fell far short of targets, causing severe [[Famine|food shortages]] in 1979, 1981, 1984, and 1987.\n\nThe plan's 1987 target for the total area to be devoted to rice cultivation was 1.77 million hectares, but the actual area under cultivation in 1987 amounted to only 1.15 million hectares. After 1979 and through the late 1980s, the agricultural sector performed poorly. Adverse [[weather]] conditions, insufficient numbers of farm implements and of draft animals, inexperienced and incompetent personnel, [[security]] problems, and government collectivization policies all contributed to low productivity.\n\n===Collectivization and solidarity groups===\n[[File:TonleSap3.jpg|thumb|Fishing hut on the [[Tonle Sap]]]]\n[[File:CambodianAgriculture.jpg|thumb|Agricultural fields in the Kampong Cham province, aerial]]\n[[Collectivization]] of the agricultural sector under the [[Heng Samrin]] regime included the formation of solidarity groups. As small aggregates of people living in the same locality, known to one another, and able to a certain extent to profit collectively from their work, they were an improvement over the dehumanized, forced-[[labor camp]]s and communal life of the [[Pol Pot]] era. The organization of individuals and families into solidarity groups also made sense in the environment of resource-poor, post-war Cambodia. People working together in this way were able to offset somewhat the shortages of manpower, draft animals, and farm implements.\n\nIn 1986, more than 97 percent of the rural population belonged to the country's more than 100,000 solidarity groups. Unlike the large communes of the [[Khmer Rouge]], the solidarity groups were relatively small. They consisted initially of between twenty and fifty families and were later reduced to between seven and fifteen families. The groups were a form of \"[[peasant]]s' labor association,\" the members of which continued to be owners of the land and of the fruits of their labor. According to a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] analyst, the solidarity groups \"organically united\" three forms of property\u2014the land, which remained state property; the collectively owned farm implements and the harvest; and the individual peasant's holding, each the private property of a peasant families.\n\nIn theory, each solidarity group received between ten and fifteen [[hectare]]s of common land, depending upon the region and land availability. This land had to be cultivated collectively, and the [[harvest]] had to be divided among member families according to the amount of work each family had contributed as determined by a work point system. In dividing the harvest, allowance was made first for those who were unable to contribute their labor, like the elderly and the sick, as well as [[nurse]]s, [[teacher]]s, and administrators. Some of the harvest was set aside as seed for the following season, and the rest was distributed to the workers. Those who performed heavy tasks and who consequently earned more work points received a greater share of the harvest than those who worked on light tasks. Women without husbands, however, received enough to live on even if they did little work and earned few work points. Work points also were awarded, beyond personal labor, to individuals or to families who tended group-owned livestock or who lent their own animals or tools for solidarity group use.\n\nEach member family of a solidarity group was entitled to a private plot of between 1,500 and 2,000 square meters (depending upon the availability of land) in addition to land it held in common with other members. Individual shares of the group harvest and of the produce from private plots were the exclusive property of the producers, who were free to consume store, barter, or sell them.\n\nThe solidarity groups evolved into three categories, each distinct in its level of collectivization and in its provisions for land tenure. The first category represented the highest level of collective labor. Member families of each solidarity group in this category undertook all tasks from [[plowing]] to [[harvesting]]. Privately owned farm implements and draft animals continued to be individual personal property, and the owners received remuneration for making them available to the solidarity group during the planting and the harvesting seasons. Each group also had collectively owned farm implements, acquired through state [[subsidy]].\n\nThe second category was described as \"a transitional form from individual to collective form\" at the KPRP National Conference in November 1984. This category of group was different from the first because it distributed land to member families at the beginning of the season according to family size. In this second category, group members worked collectively only on heavy tasks, such as plowing paddy fields and transplanting rice seedlings. Otherwise, each family was responsible for the cultivation of its own land allotment and continued to be owner of its farm implements and animals, which could be traded by private agreement among members. Some groups owned a common pool of rice seeds, contributed by member families, and of farm implements, contributed by the state. The size of the pool indicated the level of the group's collectivization. The larger the pool, the greater the collective work. In groups that did not have a common pool of rice and tools, productive labor was directed primarily to meeting the family's needs, and the relationship between the agricultural producers and the market or state organizations was very weak.\n\nThe third category was classified as the family economy. As in the second category, the group allocated land to families at the beginning of the season, and farm implements continued to be their private property. In this third category, however, the family [[Agriculture|cultivate]]d its own assigned lot, owned the entire harvest, and sold its surplus directly to state purchasing organizations. In the solidarity groups of this category, there was no collective effort, except in administrative and sociocultural matters.\n\nThe government credited the solidarity group system with rehabilitating the agricultural sector and increasing food production. The system's contribution to socialism, however, was less visible and significant. According to [[Chhea Song]], deputy minister of agriculture, a mere 10 percent of the solidarity groups really worked collectively in the mid-1980s (seven years after solidarity groups had come into operation). Seventy percent of the solidarity groups performed only some tasks in common, such as preparing the fields and planting seeds. Finally, 20 percent of the agricultural workers farmed their land as individuals and participated in the category of the family economy.\n\n==Rice production==\n[[File:Cambodiaricefarming1.jpg|thumb|Rice farming in Cambodia]]\n\nIn 1987 statistics on rice production were sparse, and they varied depending upon sources. Cambodian government figures were generally lower than those provided by the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) for the period from 1979 to 1985.\n\nPolitical and technical factors account for the discrepancies. Data collection in the war-torn nation is difficult because of the lack of trained personnel. Moreover, representatives of international and of foreign relief organizations are not permitted to travel beyond [[Phnom Penh]], except with special permission, because of [[security]] and [[logistics]] problems. In addition, international and Cambodian sources use different benchmarks in calculating rice production.\n\nThe FAO computes the harvest by calendar year; Cambodian officials and private observers base their calculations on the harvest season, which runs from November to February and thus extends over two calendar years. Last of all, a substantial statistical difference exists between milled rice and paddy (unmilled rice) production, compounding problems in compiling accurate estimates. In terms of weight, milled rice averages only 62 percent of the original unmilled paddy. Estimates sometimes refer to these two kinds of rice interchangeably.\n\nDespite statistical discrepancies, there is consensus that annual unmilled rice production during the 1979 to 1987 period did not reach the 1966 level of 2.5 million tons. Nevertheless, since 1979, Cambodian rice production has increased gradually (except during the disastrous 1984 to 1985 season), and the nation in the late 1980s had just begun to achieve a precarious self-sufficiency, if estimates were borne out.\n\nCambodia's cultivated rice land can be divided into three areas. The first and richest (producing more than one ton of rice per hectare) covers the area of the [[Tonle Sap]] Basin and the provinces of [[Batdambang]], [[Kampong Thom City|Kampong Thum]], [[Kampong Cham Province|Kampong Cham]], [[Kandal Province|Kandal]], [[Prey Veng Province|Prey Veng]], and [[Svay Rieng Province|Svay Rieng]]. The second area, which yields an average of four-fifths of a ton of rice per hectare, consists of [[Kampot Province|Kampot]] and [[Koh Kong Province|Koh Kong]] provinces along the [[Gulf of Thailand]], and some less fertile areas of the central provinces. The third area, with rice yields of less than three-fifths of a ton per hectare, comprises the highlands and the mountainous provinces of Preah Vihear, Stoeng Treng, Rotanokiri (Ratanakiri), and Mondol kiri (MondolKiri).\n\nCambodia has two rice crops each year, a [[monsoon]]-season crop (long-cycle) and a [[Dry season|dry-season]] crop. The major monsoon crop is planted in late May through July, when the first rains of the monsoon season begin to inundate and soften the land. Rice shoots are transplanted from late June through September. The main harvest is usually gathered six months later, in December. The dry-season crop is smaller, and it takes less time to grow (three months from planting to harvest). It is planted in November in areas that have trapped or retained part of the monsoon rains, and it is harvested in January or February. The dry-season crop seldom exceeds 15 percent of the total annual production.\n\n[[File:Ricefields in Takeo.jpg|thumb|Rice fields in Takeo Province]]\nIn addition to these two regular crops, peasants plant [[floating rice]] in April and in May in the areas around the [[Tonle Sap]] (Great Lake), which [[flood]]s and expands its banks in September or early October. Before the flooding occurs, the seed is spread on the ground without any preparation of the soil, and the floating rice is harvested nine months later, when the stems have grown to three or four meters in response to the peak of the flood (the floating rice has the property of adjusting its rate of growth to the rise of the flood waters so that its grain heads remain above water). It has a low yield, probably less than half that of most other rice types, but it can be grown inexpensively on land for which there is no other use.\n\nThe per-hectare rice yield in Cambodia is among the lowest in Asia. The average yield for the wet crop is about 0.95 [[ton]] of unmilled rice per hectare. The dry-season crop yield is traditionally higher\u20141.8 tons of unmilled rice per hectare. New rice varieties (IR36 and IR42) have much higher yields\u2014between five and six tons of unmilled rice per hectare under good conditions. Unlike local strains, however, these varieties require a fair amount of urea and phosphate fertilizer (25,000 tons for 5,000 tons of seed), which the government could not afford to import in the late 1980s.\n\n===Effect of changing climate===\nUnseasonable droughts and unpredictable rainfall are increasingly disrupting rice cultivation and forcing Cambodian farmers to search for jobs in cities. Traditional rice farming relied on rain falling predictably two times a year, which used to occur with regularity. {{Asof|2018}} rains tend to fall in one short downfall.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Robertson |first1=Holly |title='Blood bricks': How climate change is trapping Cambodians in modern slavery |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-16/how-climate-change-is-trapping-cambodians-into-modern-slavery/10377982 |accessdate=16 October 2018 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=16 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Other crops==\n{{update section|date=November 2016}}\nThe main secondary crops in the late 1980s were [[maize]], [[cassava]], [[sweet potatoes]], [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], [[soybean]]s, [[sesame seed]]s, [[dry bean]]s, and [[rubber]]. According to Phnom Penh, the country produced 92,000 tons of corn (maize), as well as 100,000 tons of cassava, about 34,000 tons of sweet potatoes, and 37,000 tons of dry beans in 1986. In 1987 local officials urged residents of the different agricultural regions of the country to step up the cultivation of subsidiary food crops, particularly of starchy crops, to make up for the rice deficit caused by a severe [[drought]].\n\nThe principal commercial crop is rubber. In the 1980s it was an important primary commodity, second only to rice, and one of the country's few sources of foreign exchange. Rubber plantations were damaged extensively during the war (as much as 20,000 hectares was destroyed), and recovery was very slow. In 1986 rubber production totaled about 24,500 tons (from an area of 36,000 hectares, mostly in Kampong Cham Province), far below the 1969 prewar output of 50,000 tons (produced from an area of 50,000 hectares).\n\nThe government began exporting rubber and rubber products in 1985. A major customer was the Soviet Union, which imported slightly more than 10,000 tons of Cambodian natural rubber annually in 1985 and in 1986. In the late 1980s, Vietnam helped Cambodia restore rubber-processing plants. The First Plan made rubber the second economic priority, with production targeted at 50,000 tons\u2014from an expanded cultivated area of 50,000 hectares\u2014by 1990.\n\nOther commercial crops included [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], and [[tobacco]]. Among these secondary crops, the First Plan emphasized the production of [[jute]], which was to reach the target of 15,000 tons in 1990.\n\n===Livestock===\n[[File:Cambodia buffaloes in paddy fields.jpg|thumb|Water buffalo in the paddy fields]]\n[[Animal husbandry]] has been an essential part of Cambodian economic life, but a part that farmers have carried on mostly as a sideline. Traditionally, draft animals--[[water buffalo]] and [[oxen]]\u2014have played a crucial role in the preparation of rice fields for cultivation. In 1979 the decreasing number of draft animals hampered [[agricultural expansion]]. In 1967 there were 1.2 million head of draft animals; in 1979 there were only 768,000.\n\nIn 1987 Quan Doi Nhan Dan (People's Armed Forces, the Vietnamese army [[newspaper]]) reported a considerable growth in the raising of draft animals in Cambodia. Between 1979 and 1987, the number of [[cattle]] and water buffalo tripled, raising the total to 2.2 million head in 1987. In the same year, there were 1.3 million hogs and 10 million domestic [[fowl]].\n\n===Fisheries===\nCambodia's traditional source of [[protein]] is [[freshwater fish]], caught mainly from the [[Tonle Sap]] and from the [[Tonle Sab]], the [[Mekong]], and the [[Bassac River|Basak]] Rivers. Cambodians eat fish fresh, salted, smoked, or made into fish sauce and paste. A fishing program, developed with Western assistance, was very successful in that it more than quadrupled the output of inland freshwater fish in three years, from 15,000 tons in 1979 to 68,700 tons in 1982, a peak year.\n\n==Labor practices==\n{{main|Child labour in Cambodia}}\nThe [[U.S. Department of Labor]] reported in its 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor<ref>[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/cambodia.htm#ENREF_2 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]</ref> that the Cambodian agricultural sector employed underage children who engaged in hazardous activities, from deep sea and night sea fishing to logging for the production of timber. In 2014, the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]] issued a ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' where 11 goods were attributed to Cambodia, all of them being produced by [[child labor]].<ref>[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/ List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]</ref>\n\n== Agricultural education and livelihood in rural Cambodia ==\n{{Main|Agricultural education and livelihood in rural Cambodia}}\n\nAgricultural education and livelihood in rural Cambodia are interlinked, agriculture plays a prominent role in the lives of over 56% of the working-age population of the country. Promoting [[agriculture]] and agro-industry has been identified as the best strategic response to macroeconomic crises in the country also improving food security, [[Rural area|rural]] livelihoods and reducing [[Rural poverty|poverty]]. The Royal Government of Cambodia's Rectangular Strategy \u2013 Phase II (2008\u20132013) in the Fourth Legislature of the National Assembly defined a long-term vision for growth, employment, equity and efficiency. The strategy seeks to improve (i) agricultural productivity and diversification, including [[animal husbandry]], food security and nutrition, [[rural development]]); (ii) [[land reform]] and [[Demining|de-mining]]; (iii)  fisheries reform; and (iv) forestry reform (including conservation and [[environmental protection]]).<ref>Hem, S. 2012.

Agriculture accounted for 90 percent of [[GDP]] in 1985 and employed approximately 80 percent of the work force. [[Rice]] is the principal product.\n\n== Agricultural history ==\nRice production, a vital economic indicator in Cambodia's agrarian society, frequently fell far short of targets, causing severe [[Famine|food shortages]] in 1979, 1981, 1984, and 1987.\n\nThe plan's 1987 target for the total area to be devoted to rice cultivation was 1.77 million hectares, but the actual area under cultivation in 1987 amounted to only 1.15 million hectares. After 1979 and through the late 1980s, the agricultural sector performed poorly. Adverse [[weather]] conditions, insufficient numbers of farm implements and of draft animals, inexperienced and incompetent personnel, [[security]] problems, and government collectivization policies all contributed to low productivity.\n\n===Collectivization and solidarity groups===\n[[File:TonleSap3.jpg|thumb|Fishing hut on the [[Tonle Sap]]]]\n[[File:CambodianAgriculture.jpg|thumb|Agricultural fields in the Kampong Cham province, aerial]]\n[[Collectivization]] of the agricultural sector under the [[Heng Samrin]] regime included the formation of solidarity groups.

Individual shares of the group harvest and of the produce from private plots were the exclusive property of the producers, who were free to consume store, barter, or sell them.\n\nThe solidarity groups evolved into three categories, each distinct in its level of collectivization and in its provisions for land tenure.

Nevertheless, since 1979, Cambodian rice production has increased gradually (except during the disastrous 1984 to 1985 season), and the nation in the late 1980s had just begun to achieve a precarious self-sufficiency, if estimates were borne out.\n\nCambodia's cultivated rice land can be divided into three areas. The first and richest (producing more than one ton of rice per hectare) covers the area of the [[Tonle Sap]] Basin and the provinces of [[Batdambang]], [[Kampong Thom City|Kampong Thum]], [[Kampong Cham Province|Kampong Cham]], [[Kandal Province|Kandal]], [[Prey Veng Province|Prey Veng]], and [[Svay Rieng Province|Svay Rieng]]. The second area, which yields an average of four-fifths of a ton of rice per hectare, consists of [[Kampot Province|Kampot]] and [[Koh Kong Province|Koh Kong]] provinces along the [[Gulf of Thailand]], and some less fertile areas of the central provinces. The third area, with rice yields of less than three-fifths of a ton per hectare, comprises the highlands and the mountainous provinces of Preah Vihear, Stoeng Treng, Rotanokiri (Ratanakiri), and Mondol kiri (MondolKiri).\n\nCambodia has two rice crops each year, a [[monsoon]]-season crop (long-cycle) and a [[Dry season|dry-season]] crop. The major monsoon crop is planted in late May through July, when the first rains of the monsoon season begin to inundate and soften the land. Rice shoots are transplanted from late June through September. The main harvest is usually gathered six months later, in December. The dry-season crop is smaller, and it takes less time to grow (three months from planting to harvest). It is planted in November in areas that have trapped or retained part of the monsoon rains, and it is harvested in January or February. The dry-season crop seldom exceeds 15 percent of the total annual production.\n\n[[File:Ricefields in Takeo.jpg|thumb|Rice fields in Takeo Province]]\nIn addition to these two regular crops, peasants plant [[floating rice]] in April and in May in the areas around the [[Tonle Sap]] (Great Lake), which [[flood]]s and expands its banks in September or early October.

It has a low yield, probably less than half that of most other rice types, but it can be grown inexpensively on land for which there is no other use.\n\nThe per-hectare rice yield in Cambodia is among the lowest in Asia. The average yield for the wet crop is about 0.95 [[ton]] of unmilled rice per hectare. The dry-season crop yield is traditionally higher\u20141.8 tons of unmilled rice per hectare. New rice varieties (IR36 and IR42) have much higher yields\u2014between five and six tons of unmilled rice per hectare under good conditions. Unlike local strains, however, these varieties require a fair amount of urea and phosphate fertilizer (25,000 tons for 5,000 tons of seed), which the government could not afford to import in the late 1980s.\n\n===Effect of changing climate===\nUnseasonable droughts and unpredictable rainfall are increasingly disrupting rice cultivation and forcing Cambodian farmers to search for jobs in cities.

According to Phnom Penh, the country produced 92,000 tons of corn (maize), as well as 100,000 tons of cassava, about 34,000 tons of sweet potatoes, and 37,000 tons of dry beans in 1986. In 1987 local officials urged residents of the different agricultural regions of the country to step up the cultivation of subsidiary food crops, particularly of starchy crops, to make up for the rice deficit caused by a severe [[drought]].\n\nThe principal commercial crop is rubber. In the 1980s it was an important primary commodity, second only to rice, and one of the country's few sources of foreign exchange. Rubber plantations were damaged extensively during the war (as much as 20,000 hectares was destroyed), and recovery was very slow. In 1986 rubber production totaled about 24,500 tons (from an area of 36,000 hectares, mostly in Kampong Cham Province), far below the 1969 prewar output of 50,000 tons (produced from an area of 50,000 hectares).\n\nThe government began exporting rubber and rubber products in 1985. A major customer was the Soviet Union, which imported slightly more than 10,000 tons of Cambodian natural rubber annually in 1985 and in 1986. In the late 1980s, Vietnam helped Cambodia restore rubber-processing plants. The First Plan made rubber the second economic priority, with production targeted at 50,000 tons\u2014from an expanded cultivated area of 50,000 hectares\u2014by 1990.\n\nOther commercial crops included [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], and [[tobacco]]. Among these secondary crops, the First Plan emphasized the production of [[jute]], which was to reach the target of 15,000 tons in 1990.\n\n===Livestock===\n[[File:Cambodia buffaloes in paddy fields.jpg|thumb|Water buffalo in the paddy fields]]\n[[Animal husbandry]] has been an essential part of Cambodian economic life, but a part that farmers have carried on mostly as a sideline. Traditionally, draft animals--[[water buffalo]] and [[oxen]]\u2014have played a crucial role in the preparation of rice fields for cultivation. In 1979 the decreasing number of draft animals hampered [[agricultural expansion]]. In 1967 there were 1.2 million head of draft animals; in 1979 there were only 768,000.\n\nIn 1987 Quan Doi Nhan Dan (People's Armed Forces, the Vietnamese army [[newspaper]]) reported a considerable growth in the raising of draft animals in Cambodia. Between 1979 and 1987, the number of [[cattle]] and water buffalo tripled, raising the total to 2.2 million head in 1987. In the same year, there were 1.3 million hogs and 10 million domestic [[fowl]].\n\n===Fisheries===\nCambodia's traditional source of [[protein]] is [[freshwater fish]], caught mainly from the [[Tonle Sap]] and from the [[Tonle Sab]], the [[Mekong]], and the [[Bassac River|Basak]] Rivers. Cambodians eat fish fresh, salted, smoked, or made into fish sauce and paste. A fishing program, developed with Western assistance, was very successful in that it more than quadrupled the output of inland freshwater fish in three years, from 15,000 tons in 1979 to 68,700 tons in 1982, a peak year.\n\n==Labor practices==\n{{main|Child labour in Cambodia}}\nThe [[U.S. Department of Labor]] reported in its 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor<ref>[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/cambodia.htm#ENREF_2 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]</ref> that the Cambodian agricultural sector employed underage children who engaged in hazardous activities, from deep sea and night sea fishing to logging for the production of timber. In 2014, the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]] issued a ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' where 11 goods were attributed to Cambodia, all of them being produced by [[child labor]].<ref>[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/ List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]</ref>\n\n== Agricultural education and livelihood in rural Cambodia ==\n{{Main|Agricultural education and livelihood in rural Cambodia}}\n\nAgricultural education and livelihood in rural Cambodia are interlinked, agriculture plays a prominent role in the lives of over 56% of the working-age population of the country. Promoting [[agriculture]] and agro-industry has been identified as the best strategic response to macroeconomic crises in the country also improving food security, [[Rural area|rural]] livelihoods and reducing [[Rural poverty|poverty]]. The Royal Government of Cambodia\u2019s Rectangular Strategy \u2013 Phase II (2008\u20132013) in the Fourth Legislature of the National Assembly defined a long-term vision for growth, employment, equity and efficiency. The strategy seeks to improve (i) agricultural productivity and diversification, including [[animal husbandry]], food security and nutrition, [[rural development]]); (ii) [[land reform]] and [[Demining|de-mining]]; (iii)  fisheries reform; and (iv) forestry reform (including conservation and [[environmental protection]]).<ref>Hem, S. 2012.

In 1849 the [[Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway]] (later [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] mainline) reached Mansfield, and in 1863 the [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]] (later [[Erie Railroad]] mainline) reached Mansfield.\n\nPassenger services operating into the opening of the 1970s were the [[Erie Lackawanna]]'s Chicago-Hoboken, New Jersey ''[[Lake Cities (train)|Lake Cities]]'' (discontinued, 1970); and the [[Penn Central]]'s ''[[Manhattan Limited]]'' and ''Pennsylvania Limited'' (both discontinued, 1971, at the transfer over to Amtrak).\n\nAfter the B&O branch line was abandoned, the {{convert|18.3|mi|km|adj=on}} section from [[Butler, Ohio|Butler]] to North Lake Park in Mansfield was opened in 1995 as the recreational Richland B&O Trail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/oh5/railstotrails/richland_trail.html |title=Richland B&O Trail |accessdate=2008-05-18 |publisher=Angelfire }}</ref> The former B&O track from Mansfield to [[Willard, Ohio|Willard]] combined with a piece of the abandoned Erie Railroad east of Mansfield to [[West Salem, Ohio|West Salem]] to form the L-shaped {{convert|56.5|mi|km|adj=on}} Ashland Railway (1986).

This route was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic [[Lincoln Highway]] which was the first road across [[United States|America]], connecting [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco]]. The arrival of the Lincoln Highway to Mansfield was a major influence on the development of the city. Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1928, the Lincoln Highway through Mansfield on Park Avenue East and Park Avenue West became [[U.S. Route 30]].\n\nOn September 1, 1928, the Lincoln Highway was marked coast-to-coast with approximately 3000 concrete posts set by the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. Each post featured a medallion of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s profile. One of these concrete markers was erected at curbside in front of Central Methodist Episcopal Church, 378 Park Avenue West. It now stands in downtown's Central Park, on Park Avenue's center divider. The Lincoln Highway Association observed the highway's centennial in June 2013. The celebration's eastern transcontinental tour group visited Mansfield for an overnight stay on June 25 at the Holiday Inn on Park Avenue West, the highway's route through the city.\n\nMansfield is well connected to the [[Interstate Highway System]].

This route was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic [[Lincoln Highway]] which was the first road across [[United States|America]], connecting [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco]]. The arrival of the Lincoln Highway to Mansfield was a major influence on the development of the city. Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1928, the Lincoln Highway through Mansfield on Park Avenue East and Park Avenue West became [[U.S. Route 30]].\n\nOn September 1, 1928, the Lincoln Highway was marked coast-to-coast with approximately 3000 concrete posts set by the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. Each post featured a medallion of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s profile. One of these concrete markers was erected at curbside in front of Central Methodist Episcopal Church, 378 Park Avenue West. It now stands in downtown's Central Park, on Park Avenue's center divider. The Lincoln Highway Association observed the highway's centennial in June 2013. The celebration's eastern transcontinental tour group visited Mansfield for an overnight stay on June 25 at the Holiday Inn on Park Avenue West, the highway's route through the city.\n\nMansfield is well connected to the [[Interstate Highway System]].

They farmed [[cassava]], peanuts, tobacco, [[sweet potato]]es and maize, in addition to extracting the essence from other local plants such as the [[Caryocar brasiliense|pequi]] and the [[Attalea speciosa|babassu]]. Production was for food, [[straw]] or [[madeira]].  They cultivated local fruits such as [[jabuticaba]], [[cashew]]s, [[Spondias mombin]] and [[Goiaba]]s.\n\nThe Indians both influenced and were influenced by the Europeans who arrived in the fifteenth century. The Portuguese \"nourished themselves with wood-flour, slaughtered the big game to eat, packed their nets and imitated the rough, free life\" in the words of Pedro Calmon.<ref>CALMON, Pedro: ''Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil'', S\u00e3o Paulo, 1939, vol. 1</ref>\n\nUntil other crops began to be exported, [[brazilwood]] was the main reason Portugal wanted control in Brazil.<ref>{{cite book | last = ARRUDA | first = Jos\u00e9 Jobson  | title = Hist\u00f3ria Integrada: da Idade M\u00e9dia ao nascimento do mundo moderno  | edition = 2\u00aa | year = 1996 | publisher = [[editora \u00c1tica|\u00c1tica]] | place = S\u00e3o Paulo | isbn = 85-08-05399-1 | pages = 126, 129  | chapter = Cap. 21 \u2013 ''Os primeiros tempos: a explora\u00e7\u00e3o do pau-brasil'' | quote = Foi com o objetivo de explorar o com\u00e9rcio dessa madeira que os portugueses fundaram uma s\u00e9rie de benfeitorias(...)

This provided arable land and ashes for use as fertilizer and soil cover.\n\nScholars such as [[Monteiro Lobato]] considered this practice to be harmful. However, burning only became a problem when the Europeans adopted the practice aggressively around 1500, divided land into farms, began monocropping, etc. The combination of burning with these new farming methods decimated native flora.<ref name=aa>{{cite journal |title=O uso do fogo: o manejo ind\u00edgena e a piromania da monocultura |volume=14 |issue=40 |pages=231\u2013250 |language=pt |author=Leonel, Mauro |journal=Estudos Avan\u00e7ados |date=Sep\u2013Dec 2000 |df=dmy-all |doi=10.1590/S0103-40142000000300019 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIndian land management included garden areas in locations selected to allow interaction with their surroundings.

Brazilian sugar was thirty percent less expensive than sugar from elsewhere, creating major export opportunities.\n\nA decline in the second half of the 17th century led many producer regions to diversify production, expanding cotton or, in [[Ba\u00eda de Todos os Santos|Reconcavo Baiano]], tobacco or cocoa. The archaic social structure and obsolete technology outlasted cane production in those regions.<ref name=bb/>\n\n==== Slave labor ====\n{{Main|Slavery in Brazil}}[[File:Jos\u00e9 Mariano da Conceicao Velloso - O fazendeiro do Brazil - cultivador.jpg|thumb|In the illustration of \"O Fazendeiro do Brasil\" (The Farmer in Brazil), 1806, [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Veloso]] describes the steps and tools used in the cultivation of indigo in Brazil.]]\n\nInitially, plantation owners attempted to use local labor in their fields. While laws prohibited their enslavement, in many areas the law was not respected. Locals responded by rebelling, flight or simply dying. European diseases took a heavy toll on indigenous peoples.\n\nThe settlers then switched to enslaving and importing Africans to do the work.<ref name=\"hh\">SILVA, Joaquim, PENNA, J. B. Damasco: ''Hist\u00f3ria Geral'', Cia. Editora Nacional, S\u00e3o Paulo, 1972</ref> The Portuguese and others imported 4 million Africans to carry out cultivation, using what came to be called the [[plantation economy|plantation system]].\n\nIn the first century, after European arrival the slave population had already surpassed that of the locals, decimated by disease. Antonil stated: \"the slaves are the hands and feet of the mill, because without them in Brazil, it is not possible to make, maintain or expand the farm or have a running mill.\"<ref name=\"hh\" />\n\nThe slaves cleared the agricultural frontiers, such as in the west for coffee [[plantation]]s. By the end of the Second Reign, Brazil accounted for more than half the world's coffee production.<ref name=\"hh\" />\n\nOn 13 May 1888 Brazil adopted the [[Lei \u00c1urea]] ('Golden Law'), which abolished slavery in Brazil. In the preceding years, 75% of the Africans and mulattoes had been freed by [[manumission]].<ref name=\"Bergad\">Bergad, Laird W. 2007.

Many of the farmers turned to the Republican party or became indifferent to the attack of the institutions...\"\n\nThe law did not provide an accompanying land distribution to the ex-captives. It led to a [[rural exodus]], both from the workers and from the now-bankrupt landlords.

They farmed [[cassava]], peanuts, tobacco, [[sweet potato]]es and maize, in addition to extracting the essence from other local plants such as the [[Caryocar brasiliense|pequi]] and the [[Attalea speciosa|babassu]]. Production was for food, [[straw]] or [[madeira]].  They cultivated local fruits such as [[jabuticaba]], [[cashew]]s, [[Spondias mombin]] and [[Goiaba]]s.\n\nThe Indians both influenced and were influenced by the Europeans who arrived in the fifteenth century. The Portuguese \"nourished themselves with wood-flour, slaughtered the big game to eat, packed their nets and imitated the rough, free life\" in the words of Pedro Calmon.<ref>CALMON, Pedro: ''Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil'', S\u00e3o Paulo, 1939, vol. 1</ref>\n\nUntil other crops began to be exported, [[brazilwood]] was the main reason Portugal wanted control in Brazil.<ref>{{cite book | last = ARRUDA | first = Jos\u00e9 Jobson  | title = Hist\u00f3ria Integrada: da Idade M\u00e9dia ao nascimento do mundo moderno  | edition = 2\u00aa | year = 1996 | publisher = [[editora \u00c1tica|\u00c1tica]] | place = S\u00e3o Paulo | isbn = 85-08-05399-1 | pages = 126, 129  | chapter = Cap. 21 \u2013 ''Os primeiros tempos: a explora\u00e7\u00e3o do pau-brasil'' | quote = Foi com o objetivo de explorar o com\u00e9rcio dessa madeira que os portugueses fundaram uma s\u00e9rie de benfeitorias(...)

This provided arable land and ashes for use as fertilizer and soil cover.\n\nScholars such as [[Monteiro Lobato]] considered this practice to be harmful. However, burning only became a problem when the Europeans adopted the practice aggressively around 1500, divided land into farms, began monocropping, etc. The combination of burning with these new farming methods decimated native flora.<ref name=aa>{{cite journal |title=O uso do fogo: o manejo ind\u00edgena e a piromania da monocultura |volume=14 |issue=40 |pages=231\u2013250 |language=pt |author=Leonel, Mauro |journal=Estudos Avan\u00e7ados |date=Sep\u2013Dec 2000 |df=dmy-all |doi=10.1590/S0103-40142000000300019 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIndian land management included garden areas in locations selected to allow interaction with their surroundings.

While laws prohibited their enslavement, in many areas the law was not respected. Locals responded by rebelling, flight or simply dying. European diseases took a heavy toll on indigenous peoples.\n\nThe settlers then switched to enslaving and importing Africans to do the work.<ref name=\"hh\">SILVA, Joaquim, PENNA, J. B.

Antonil stated: \"the slaves are the hands and feet of the mill, because without them in Brazil, it is not possible to make, maintain or expand the farm or have a running mill.\"<ref name=\"hh\" />\n\nThe slaves cleared the agricultural frontiers, such as in the west for coffee [[plantation]]s. By the end of the Second Reign, Brazil accounted for more than half the world's coffee production.<ref name=\"hh\" />\n\nOn 13 May 1888 Brazil adopted the [[Lei \u00c1urea]] ('Golden Law'), which abolished slavery in Brazil.

Many of the farmers turned to the Republican party or became indifferent to the attack of the institutions...\"\n\nThe law did not provide an accompanying land distribution to the ex-captives. It led to a [[rural exodus]], both from the workers and from the now-bankrupt landlords.
