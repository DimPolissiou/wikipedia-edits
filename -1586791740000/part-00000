{"title_page": "General Roman Calendar of 1960", "text_new": "{{about|the calendar currently used in the 1962 Tridentine Latin Mass|the liturgical calendar promulgated by decree of the Council of Trent|Tridentine Calendar}}\nThis article lists the feast days of the General Roman Calendar as approved on 25 July 1960 by [[Pope John XXIII]]'s ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''[[Rubricarum instructum]]'' and promulgated by the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]] the following day, 26 July 1960, by the decree ''Novum rubricarum''. This 1960 calendar was incorporated into the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]], continued use of which [[Pope Benedict XVI]] authorized in the circumstances indicated in his 7 July 2007 motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.\n\n''Novum rubricarum'' replaced the former classifications of Doubles, Semidoubles, and Simples with I, II, and III class feasts and commemorations. It removed a few feasts, in particular duplications such as the [[Feast of the Cross]] (3 May and 14 September), the [[Chair of Peter]] (18 January and 22 February), [[Saint Peter]] (1 August and 29 June), Saint [[John the Evangelist]] (6 May and 27 December), [[Saint Michael]] (8 May and 29 September), and [[Saint Stephen]] (3 August and 26 December).\n\nThis calendar is distinct from the [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]] in that it also incorporates the changes made by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1955, which included the reduction of [[octave (liturgy)|octaves]] to three only, those of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost.<ref>General decree ''Cum nostra'' of the Sacred Congregation of Rites</ref> See [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]].\n\n==Changes to the Calendar==\n''Novum rubricarum'' abolished the traditional ranking of Sundays and feast days as doubles (of varying degrees) and simples\u2014the rank of semidouble having already been suppressed by Pope Pius XII in 1955\u2014and introduced a new system of ranking the various liturgical days of the Roman rite. Feasts previously ranked as doubles of the I class were reclassified as ''feasts of the I class.'' Feasts previously ranked as doubles of the II class were reclassified as ''feasts of the II class.'' Feasts previously ranked as greater doubles, doubles, and simples were reclassified as ''feasts of the III class.'' Feasts that had formerly been ranked as simples and had been reduced to commemorations in Pius XII's 1955 revision of the calendar remained ''commemorations.''\n\nThe Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Passiontide, and Low Sunday were classified as ''Sundays of the I class.'' All other Sundays of the year\u2014excluding those perpetually impeded by feasts of the I class\u2014became ''Sundays of the II class.''\n\nAsh Wednesday, the ferias of Holy Week, the Paschal Triduum, and the days within the octaves of Easter and Pentecost (including the Ember Days of Pentecost) were classified as ''ferias of the I class.'' The ferias of Advent from 17\u201323 December inclusive, the days within the octave of Christmas not impeded by the feasts of saints (29\u201331 December inclusive), as well as the Ember Days of Advent, Lent, and September were ranked as ''ferias of the II class.'' The ferias of Advent, excluding 17\u201323 December, were ranked as ''ferias of the III class,'' as were the ferias of Lent and Passiontide. In addition, the ferias of Lent and Passiontide were given precedence over all feasts of the III class, with III-class feasts reduced to commemorations in years in which they fell during Lent or Passiontide. The remaining ferias of the year were classified ''ferias of the IV class.''\n\nThe following feasts were reduced to commemorations:\n* the previous greater doubles of\n** Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel (16 July)\n** Our Lady of Ransom (24 September)\n** The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Friday after the I Sunday in Passiontide)\n* the previous doubles of\n** The Impression of the Sacred Stigmata of St. Francis Confessor (17 September)\n** Ss. Eustace and Companions Martyrs (20 September)\n** St. Thomas [of Canterbury] Bishop and Martyr (29 December)\n** St. Sylvester I Pope and Confessor (31 December)\n* the previous simples (up to 1955, semidoubles) of\n** St. George Martyr (23 April)\n** St. Alexis Confessor (17 July)\n** Ss. Cyriacus, Largus, and Smaragdus Martyrs (8 August)\n\nThe following days of the II class became liturgical days of the I class:\n* Octave Day of the Nativity of the Lord (1 January)\n* The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (2 November or 3 November if 2 November falls on Sunday)\n\nThe following greater doubles became liturgical days of the II class:\n* The Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph (I Sunday after Epiphany)\n* The Chair of Saint Peter (22 February)\n* The Exaltation of the Holy Cross (14 September)\n\nThe following feasts were deleted from the calendar:\n* doubles of the II class\n** The Finding of the Holy Cross (3 May; considered a duplication of the 14 September feast of the Cross)\n* greater doubles\n** The Chair of Saint Peter Apostle at Rome (18 January; merged with the 22 February feast of St. Peter's Chair at Antioch)\n** St. John Apostle and Evangelist Before the Latin Gate (6 May; considered a duplication of the 27 December feast of St. John)\n** The Apparition of St. Michael Archangel (8 May; considered a duplication of the 29 September feast of the Dedication of St. Michael)\n** St. Peter Apostle in Chains (1 August; considered a duplication of the 29 June feast of Ss. Peter and Paul)\n* simples (up to 1955, semidoubles)\n** St. Leo II Pope and Confessor (3 July; removed as a result of the transfer of St. Irenaeus to 3 July)\n** St. Anacletus Pope and Martyr (13 July; merged with the 26 April feast of St. Cletus)\n** On the Finding of the Body of St. Stephen Protomartyr (3 August; considered a duplication of the 26 December feast of St. Stephen)\nThe commemoration of St. Vitalis Martyr (28 April) was likewise deleted, due to doubts about the historicity of his martyrdom.\n\nThe following feasts were inscribed in the calendar:\n* St. Gregory Barbarigo Bishop and Confessor (17 June, III cl.)\n* St. Anthony Mary Claret Bishop and Confessor (23 October, III cl.)\n\nThe following feasts were transferred:\n* St. Irenaeus Bishop and Martyr (28 June to 3 July; to make room for celebration of the Vigil of Ss. Peter and Paul)\n* St. John Mary Vianney Confessor (9 to 8 August; to be nearer to his ''natalis'')\nThe commemoration of Ss. Sergius, Bacchus, Marcellus, and Apuleius Martyrs was transferred from 7 to 8 October, due to rubrical changes that restricted the number of commemorations allowed on a II-class feast (in this case, the 7 October feast of the Rosary) to only one.\n\nThe following titles were changed:\n* The Circumcision of the Lord became the Octave Day of the Nativity (1 January)\n* The Octave Day of the Epiphany became the Commemoration of the Baptism of the Lord (13 January, II cl.)\n* The Chair of St. Peter Apostle at Antioch became The Chair of St. Peter Apostle (22 February)\n* The Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary became Blessed Virgin Mary of the Rosary (7 October)\n\nThe new rubrics also restricted the transferal of impeded feast days that occur in a given year on the same day as a liturgical day of higher rank solely to feasts of the I class (formerly doubles of the I class). Under the older rubrics, both doubles of the I class and doubles of the II class (feasts of the II class under the 1960 rubrics) were transferred when impeded.\n\n==January==\n*1: Octave of the [[Christmas|Nativity]] of the Lord, I class.\n*2: Feria.\n*3: Feria.\n*4: Feria.\n*5: Commemoration of St. [[Pope Telesphorus|Telesphorus]] Pope and Martyr, Comm.\n*6: On the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany of the Lord]], I class.\n*7: Feria.\n*8: Feria.\n*9: Feria.\n*10: Feria.\n*11: Commemoration of St. [[Pope Hyginus|Hyginus]] Pope and Martyr, Comm.\n*12: Feria.\n*13: On the Commemoration of the Baptism of our Lord Jesus Christ, II class.\n*14: St. [[Hilary of Poitiers|Hilary]] Bishop, Confessor, and [[Doctor of the Church]], III class, Com. of St. [[Felix of Nola|Felix]] Priest and Martyr.\n*15: St. [[Paul of Thebes|Paul]] the First Hermit, Confessor, III class, Com. of St. [[Saint Maurus|Maurus]] Abbot.\n*16: St. [[Pope Marcellus I|Marcellus I]] Pope and Martyr, III class.\n*17: St. [[Anthony of Egypt|Anthony]] Abbot, III class.\n*18: Commemoration of St. [[Saint Prisca|Prisca]] Virgin and Martyr, Comm.\n*19: Commemoration of Ss.

This 1960 calendar was incorporated into the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]], continued use of which [[Pope Benedict XVI]] authorized in the circumstances indicated in his 7 July 2007 motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.\n\n''Novum rubricarum'' replaced the former classifications of Doubles, Semidoubles, and Simples with I, II, and III class feasts and commemorations. It removed a few feasts, in particular duplications such as the [[Feast of the Cross]] (3 May and 14 September), the [[Chair of Peter]] (18 January and 22 February), [[Saint Peter]] (1 August and 29 June), Saint [[John the Evangelist]] (6 May and 27 December), [[Saint Michael]] (8 May and 29 September), and [[Saint Stephen]] (3 August and 26 December).\n\nThis calendar is distinct from the [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]] in that it also incorporates the changes made by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1955, which included the reduction of [[octave (liturgy)|octaves]] to three only, those of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost.<ref>General decree ''Cum nostra'' of the Sacred Congregation of Rites</ref> See [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]].\n\n==Changes to the Calendar==\n''Novum rubricarum'' abolished the traditional ranking of Sundays and feast days as doubles (of varying degrees) and simples\u2014the rank of semidouble having already been suppressed by Pope Pius XII in 1955\u2014and introduced a new system of ranking the various liturgical days of the Roman rite. Feasts previously ranked as doubles of the I class were reclassified as ''feasts of the I class.'' Feasts previously ranked as doubles of the II class were reclassified as ''feasts of the II class.'' Feasts previously ranked as greater doubles, doubles, and simples were reclassified as ''feasts of the III class.'' Feasts that had formerly been ranked as simples and had been reduced to commemorations in Pius XII's 1955 revision of the calendar remained ''commemorations.''\n\nThe Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Passiontide, and Low Sunday were classified as ''Sundays of the I class.'' All other Sundays of the year\u2014excluding those perpetually impeded by feasts of the I class\u2014became ''Sundays of the II class.''\n\nAsh Wednesday, the ferias of Holy Week, the Paschal Triduum, and the days within the octaves of Easter and Pentecost (including the Ember Days of Pentecost) were classified as ''ferias of the I class.'' The ferias of Advent from 17\u201323 December inclusive, the days within the octave of Christmas not impeded by the feasts of saints (29\u201331 December inclusive), as well as the Ember Days of Advent, Lent, and September were ranked as ''ferias of the II class.'' The ferias of Advent, excluding 17\u201323 December, were ranked as ''ferias of the III class,'' as were the ferias of Lent and Passiontide. In addition, the ferias of Lent and Passiontide were given precedence over all feasts of the III class, with III-class feasts reduced to commemorations in years in which they fell during Lent or Passiontide. The remaining ferias of the year were classified ''ferias of the IV class.''\n\nThe following feasts were reduced to commemorations:\n* the previous greater doubles of\n** Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel (16 July)\n** Our Lady of Ransom (24 September)\n** The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Friday after the I Sunday in Passiontide)\n* the previous doubles of\n** The Impression of the Sacred Stigmata of St. Francis Confessor (17 September)\n** Ss. Eustace and Companions Martyrs (20 September)\n** St. Thomas [of Canterbury] Bishop and Martyr (29 December)\n** St. Sylvester I Pope and Confessor (31 December)\n* the previous simples (up to 1955, semidoubles) of\n** St. George Martyr (23 April)\n** St. Alexis Confessor (17 July)\n** Ss. Cyriacus, Largus, and Smaragdus Martyrs (8 August)\n\nThe following days of the II class became liturgical days of the I class:\n* Octave Day of the Nativity of the Lord (1 January)\n* The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (2 November or 3 November if 2 November falls on Sunday)\n\nThe following greater doubles became liturgical days of the II class:\n* The Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph (I Sunday after Epiphany)\n* The Chair of Saint Peter (22 February)\n* The Exaltation of the Holy Cross (14 September)\n\nThe following feasts were deleted from the calendar:\n* doubles of the II class\n** The Finding of the Holy Cross (3 May; considered a duplication of the 14 September feast of the Cross)\n* greater doubles\n** The Chair of Saint Peter Apostle at Rome (18 January; merged with the 22 February feast of St. Peter's Chair at Antioch)\n** St. John Apostle and Evangelist Before the Latin Gate (6 May; considered a duplication of the 27 December feast of St. John)\n** The Apparition of St. Michael Archangel (8 May; considered a duplication of the 29 September feast of the Dedication of St. Michael)\n** St. Peter Apostle in Chains (1 August; considered a duplication of the 29 June feast of Ss. Peter and Paul)\n* simples (up to 1955, semidoubles)\n** St. Leo II Pope and Confessor (3 July; removed as a result of the transfer of St. Irenaeus to 3 July)\n** St. Anacletus Pope and Martyr (13 July; merged with the 26 April feast of St. Cletus)\n** On the Finding of the Body of St. Stephen Protomartyr (3 August; considered a duplication of the 26 December feast of St. Stephen)\nThe commemoration of St. Vitalis Martyr (28 April) was likewise deleted, due to doubts about the historicity of his martyrdom.\n\nThe following feasts were inscribed in the calendar:\n* St. Gregory Barbarigo Bishop and Confessor (17 June, III cl.)\n* St. Anthony Mary Claret Bishop and Confessor (23 October, III cl.)\n\nThe following feasts were transferred:\n* St. Irenaeus Bishop and Martyr (28 June to 3 July; to make room for celebration of the Vigil of Ss. Peter and Paul)\n* St. John Mary Vianney Confessor (9 to 8 August; to be nearer to his ''natalis'')\nThe commemoration of Ss. Sergius, Bacchus, Marcellus, and Apuleius Martyrs was transferred from 7 to 8 October, due to rubrical changes that restricted the number of commemorations allowed on a II-class feast (in this case, the 7 October feast of the Rosary) to only one.\n\nThe following titles were changed:\n* The Circumcision of the Lord became the Octave Day of the Nativity (1 January)\n* The Octave Day of the Epiphany became the Commemoration of the Baptism of the Lord (13 January, II cl.)\n* The Chair of St. Peter Apostle at Antioch became The Chair of St. Peter Apostle (22 February)\n* The Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary became Blessed Virgin Mary of the Rosary (7 October)\n\nThe new rubrics also restricted the transferal of impeded feast days that occur in a given year on the same day as a liturgical day of higher rank solely to feasts of the I class (formerly doubles of the I class). Under the older rubrics, both doubles of the I class and doubles of the II class (feasts of the II class under the 1960 rubrics) were transferred when impeded.\n\n==January==\n*1: Octave of the [[Christmas|Nativity]] of the Lord, I class.\n*2: Feria.\n*3: Feria.\n*4: Feria.\n*5: Commemoration of St. [[Pope Telesphorus|Telesphorus]] Pope and Martyr, Comm.\n*6: On the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany of the Lord]], I class.\n*7: Feria.\n*8: Feria.\n*9: Feria.\n*10: Feria.\n*11: Commemoration of St. [[Pope Hyginus|Hyginus]] Pope and Martyr, Comm.\n*12: Feria.\n*13: On the Commemoration of the Baptism of our Lord Jesus Christ, II class.\n*14: St. [[Hilary of Poitiers|Hilary]] Bishop, Confessor, and [[Doctor of the Church]], III class, Com. of St. [[Felix of Nola|Felix]] Priest and Martyr.\n*15: St. [[Paul of Thebes|Paul]] the First Hermit, Confessor, III class, Com. of St. [[Saint Maurus|Maurus]] Abbot.\n*16: St. [[Pope Marcellus I|Marcellus I]] Pope and Martyr, III class.\n*17: St. [[Anthony of Egypt|Anthony]] Abbot, III class.\n*18: Commemoration of St. [[Saint Prisca|Prisca]] Virgin and Martyr, Comm.\n*19: Commemoration of Ss.

Three different types of punch cards were used: one for arithmetical operations, one for numerical constants, and one for load and store operations, transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back. There were three separate readers for the three types of cards. Babbage developed some two dozen programs for the Analytical Engine between 1837 and 1840, and one program later.{{sfn|Bromley|1982|p=215}}{{sfn|Bromley|1990|p=89}} These programs treat polynomials, iterative formulas, [[Gaussian elimination]], and [[Bernoulli numbers]].{{sfn|Bromley|1982|p=215}}{{sfn|Bromley|2000|p=11}}\n\nIn 1842, the Italian mathematician [[Luigi Federico Menabrea]] published a description of the engine based on a lecture by Babbage in French. In 1843, the description was translated into English and extensively annotated by [[Ada Lovelace]], who had become interested in the engine eight years earlier.

Instead he showed his programs as lists of states during their execution, showing what operator was run at each step with little indication of how the control flow would be guided.\n\n[[Allan G. Bromley]] has assumed that the card deck could be read in forwards and backwards directions as a function of conditional branching after testing for conditions, which would make the engine Turing-complete:\n\n<blockquote>...the cards could be ordered to move forward and reverse (and hence to loop)...{{sfn|Bromley|1982|p=215}}</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The introduction for the first time, in 1845, of user operations for a variety of service functions including, most importantly, an effective system for user control of looping in user programs.\n\nThere is no indication how the direction of turning of the operation and variable cards is specified. In the absence of other evidence I have had to adopt the minimal default assumption that both the operation and variable cards can only be turned backward as is necessary to implement the loops used in Babbage's sample programs. There would be no mechanical or microprogramming difficulty in placing the direction of motion under the control of the user.{{sfn|Bromley|2000}}</blockquote>\n\nIn their emulator of the engine, [[Fourmilab]] say:\n\n<blockquote>The Engine's Card Reader is not constrained to simply process the cards in a chain one after another from start to finish. It can, in addition, directed by the very cards it reads and advised by whether the Mill's run-up lever is activated, either advance the card chain forward, skipping the intervening cards, or backward, causing previously-read cards to be processed once again.</blockquote>\n\nThis emulator does provide a written symbolic instruction set, though this has been constructed by its authors rather than based on Babbage's original works.  For example, a factorial program would be written as:\n\n N0 6\n N1 1\n N2 1\n \u00d7\n L1\n L0\n S1\n \u2013\n L0\n L2\n S0\n L2\n L0\n CB?11\n\nwhere the CB is the conditional branch instruction or \"combination card\" used to make the control flow jump, in this case backwards by 11 cards.\n\n== Influence ==\n\n=== Predicted influence ===\n\nBabbage understood that the existence of an automatic computer would kindle interest in the field now known as [[algorithmic efficiency]], writing in his ''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'', \"As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of the science. Whenever any result is sought by its aid, the question will then arise\u2014By what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the ''shortest time''?\"{{sfn|Babbage|1864|p=137}}\n\n=== Computer science ===\nFrom 1872 Henry continued diligently with his father's work and then intermittently in retirement in 1875.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Babbage Engine \u2013 Key People \u2013 Henry Provost Babbage | publisher=Computer History Museum | url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/henrybabbage/ | accessdate=8 February 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110220215219/http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/henrybabbage/| archivedate= 20 February 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Percy Ludgate]] wrote about the engine in 1914<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/moderninstrument00horsuoft#page/127/mode/1up/search/1906|title=Modern instruments and methods of calculation : a handbook of the Napier Tercentenary Exhibition|last=Horsburg|first=E.

The novel explores the consequences and implications of the early introduction of computational technology.\n* There is also mention of the Analytical Engine (or the Clockwork Ouroboros as it is also known there) in ''[[The Book of the War]]'', a [[Faction Paradox]] anthology edited by [[Lawrence Miles]]. This machine was used to calculate a way into the \"Eleven Day Empire\". Its use resulted in the destruction of the original [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]].\n* In the novel ''[[Perdido Street Station]]'', by British author [[China Mi\u00e9ville]], engines similar to Babbage's serve as \"brains\" for the robotic constructs of the city of New Crobuzon. One such engine even develops sentient thought due to a recursive algorithmic loop.\n* The [[British Empire]] of ''[[The Peshawar Lancers]]'' by [[S. M. Stirling]] features a massive water-powered analytical engine at [[Srinagar|Oxford]], used by two of the main characters. It is noted that most of the engines run on steam, and that an even larger one is under construction at the British Capital in Delhi.\n* In the [[Michael Flynn (author)|Michael Flynn]] novel ''[[In the Country of the Blind]]'', a secret society calling itself the Babbage Society secretly financed the building of Babbage Engines in the mid-19th century. In the novel, the Society uses the Babbage engines along with a statistical science called Cliology to predict and manipulate future history. In the process, they predict the rise of the Nazis and accidentally start the US Civil War.\n* In the [[Neal Stephenson]] novel ''[[The Diamond Age]]'', ubiquitous molecular nanotechnology is described to make use of \"rod logic\" similar to that imagined by Babbage's design for the Analytical Engine.\n* ''Moriarty by Modem'', a short story by Jack Nimersheim, describes an alternate history where Babbage's Analytical Engine was indeed completed and had been deemed highly classified by the British government. The characters of [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]] had in reality been a set of prototype programs written for the Analytical Engine. This short story follows Holmes as his program is implemented on modern computers and he is forced to compete against his nemesis yet again in the modern counterparts of Babbage's Analytical Engine.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jack |last=Nimersheim |title=Moriarty by Modem |url=http://www.cheznims.com/moriarty.htm |publisher=cheznims.com |year=1995 |accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref>\n* A similar setting is used by [[Sydney Padua]] in the webcomic ''[[The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2dgoggles.com/ |title=Dangerous experiments in comics |publisher=2D Goggles |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=58111 |title=Experiments in Comics with Sydney Padua |publisher=Tor.com |date=26 October 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> It features an [[alternate history]] where Ada Lovelace and Babbage have built the Analytical Engine and use it to fight crime at [[Queen Victoria]]'s request.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/category/the-client/ |title=The Client &#124; 2D Goggles |publisher=Sydneypadua.com |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> The comic is based on thorough research on the biographies of and correspondence between Babbage and Lovelace, which is then twisted for humorous effect.\n* ''[[Georgia on My Mind (novelette)|Georgia on My Mind]]'' is a [[Novella|novelette]] by [[Charles Sheffield]] which involves two major themes: being widowed and the quest for a legendary Babbage computer.\n* [[Hugh Cook (science fiction author)|Hugh Cook]]'s fantasy novels ''[[The Wishstone and the Wonderworkers]]'' and ''[[The Wazir and the Witch]]'' feature an Analytical Engine created by the scientist Ivan Petrov. It is used to calculate income tax.\n* The [[Orion's Arm]] online project features the ''Machina Babbagenseii'', fully sentient Babbage inspired mechanical computers. Each is the size of a large asteroid, only capable surviving in microgravity conditions, and processes data at 0.5% the speed of a human brain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Machina Babbagenseii |url=http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/47f1ab093f416 |publisher=[[Orion's Arm]] |year=2014 |accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref>\n* The flying ships in the anime ''[[Last Exile]]'' are seen to have analytical engines inside of them.

There were three separate readers for the three types of cards.

Bromley]] has assumed that the card deck could be read in forwards and backwards directions as a function of conditional branching after testing for conditions, which would make the engine Turing-complete:\n\n<blockquote>...the cards could be ordered to move forward and reverse (and hence to loop)...{{sfn|Bromley|1982|p=215}}</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The introduction for the first time, in 1845, of user operations for a variety of service functions including, most importantly, an effective system for user control of looping in user programs.\n\nThere is no indication how the direction of turning of the operation and variable cards is specified. In the absence of other evidence I have had to adopt the minimal default assumption that both the operation and variable cards can only be turned backward as is necessary to implement the loops used in Babbage's sample programs. There would be no mechanical or microprogramming difficulty in placing the direction of motion under the control of the user.{{sfn|Bromley|2000}}</blockquote>\n\nIn their emulator of the engine, [[Fourmilab]] say:\n\n<blockquote>The Engine's Card Reader is not constrained to simply process the cards in a chain one after another from start to finish. It can, in addition, directed by the very cards it reads and advised by whether the Mill's run-up lever is activated, either advance the card chain forward, skipping the intervening cards, or backward, causing previously-read cards to be processed once again.</blockquote>\n\nThis emulator does provide a written symbolic instruction set, though this has been constructed by its authors rather than based on Babbage's original works.  For example, a factorial program would be written as:\n\n N0 6\n N1 1\n N2 1\n \u00d7\n L1\n L0\n S1\n \u2013\n L0\n L2\n S0\n L2\n L0\n CB?11\n\nwhere the CB is the conditional branch instruction or \"combination card\" used to make the control flow jump, in this case backwards by 11 cards.\n\n== Influence ==\n\n=== Predicted influence ===\n\nBabbage understood that the existence of an automatic computer would kindle interest in the field now known as [[algorithmic efficiency]], writing in his ''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'', \"As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of the science. Whenever any result is sought by its aid, the question will then arise\u2014By what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the ''shortest time''?\"{{sfn|Babbage|1864|p=137}}\n\n=== Computer science ===\nFrom 1872 Henry continued diligently with his father's work and then intermittently in retirement in 1875.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Babbage Engine \u2013 Key People \u2013 Henry Provost Babbage | publisher=Computer History Museum | url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/henrybabbage/ | accessdate=8 February 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110220215219/http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/henrybabbage/| archivedate= 20 February 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Percy Ludgate]] wrote about the engine in 1914<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/moderninstrument00horsuoft#page/127/mode/1up/search/1906|title=Modern instruments and methods of calculation : a handbook of the Napier Tercentenary Exhibition|last=Horsburg|first=E.

[[Howard Aiken]], who built the quickly-obsoleted electromechanical calculator, the [[Harvard Mark I]], between 1937 and 1945, praised Babbage's work likely as a way of enhancing his own stature, but knew nothing of the Analytical Engine's architecture during the construction of the Mark I, and considered his visit to the constructed portion of the Analytical Engine \"the greatest disappointment of my life\".{{sfn|Cohen|2000}} The Mark I showed no influence from the Analytical Engine and lacked the Analytical Engine's most prescient architectural feature, [[conditional branching]].{{sfn|Cohen|2000}} [[J.

The bridge was strategically important during the [[English Civil War]], and [[Oliver Cromwell]] went there to take it. Since then, it has been widened twice and refurbished in 1991.\n\nWadebridge was served by a railway station between 1834 and 1967; part of the line now forms the [[Camel Trail]], a recreational route for walkers, cyclists and horse riders. The town used to be a road traffic bottleneck on the [[A39 road]] until it was bypassed in 1991, and the main shopping street, Molesworth Street, is now pedestrianised.\n\nThe town has a [[Wadebridge School|secondary school]] where several notable sports-people were educated. The [[Royal Cornwall Show]] is a three-day [[agricultural show]] held at the nearby Royal Cornwall Showground every June, and the 5-day Cornwall Folk Festival takes place around the August Bank Holiday.\n\n== History ==\n===Early history===\nThe initial settlement of Wade (the name of Wadebridge before the bridge was built)<ref>{{cite book|last=Mills|first=A.

D.|title=The Popular Dictionary of English Place-Names|publisher=Parragon Book Service Ltd and Magpie Books|year=1996|isbn=0-7525-1851-8|page=65}}</ref>). The early crossing had a chapel on each side of the river, \"King's\" chapel on the north side and \"St Michael's\" on the south side. People would pray for a safe crossing at one of the chapels before wading across at low tide, once they had made it the other side they would give thanks to God in the other chapel. In 1312 a licence was granted for a market at Wade. Wade was part of the parish of St Breock and the river separated it from the neighbouring parish of Egloshayle.\n\nAt some time the ford was supplemented by a ferry<ref name=bridges>{{cite book | last =Kentley | first =Eric | title =Cornwall's Bridge & Viaduct Heritage | publisher =Twelveheads Press | series =Twelveheads Heritage | date = | location =Truro | isbn =090629458-4}}</ref> until the Reverend Thomas Lovibond (the vicar of [[Egloshayle]]) became distressed at the number of humans and animals that died during the crossing of the River Camel so he planned the building of a bridge which was completed in 1468. Wade was now known as Wadebridge. When [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] travelled through Cornwall in the early 16th century he wrote that the piers were resting on packs of wool.<ref>Pevsner, N. (1970) ''Cornwall''; 2nd ed., revised by Enid Radcliffe. Harmondsworth: Penguinl p. 238</ref> Begun in 1468 and completed in 1485, the bridge was traditionally known as the \"Bridge on Wool\" because it was reputedly built on wool sacks. In fact, however, it has been proven to be founded directly on the underlying bedrock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornishlight.co.uk/wadebridge.htm|title=Wadebridge cycle the Camel Trail to Padstow|website=www.cornishlight.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815025950/http://www.cornishlight.co.uk/wadebridge.htm|archivedate=15 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge was a strategic position in the [[English Civil War]] as in 1646 [[Oliver Cromwell]] came with 500 [[Dragoons]] and 1,000 horsemen to take the bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisnorthcornwall.com/wadebridge.html|title=Wadebridge North Cornwall|last=Kestrel|website=www.thisisnorthcornwall.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028193158/http://www.thisisnorthcornwall.com/wadebridge.html|archivedate=28 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> When the bridge was first completed tolls were charged for its maintenance.

The line was intended to carry sand from the [[Camel Estuary]] to inland farms for use as [[fertiliser]]. It was opened on 30 September 1834 with the locomotive ''Camel'' pulling a train load of 400 passengers (one of the first railways in Britain to carry passengers). When the company ordered its second locomotive it came with a name plate already affixed. It had been named the ''Elephant'' as the makers had failed to realise that the first engine had been named after the river and not an animal.<ref name=bandw>{{cite book | last1 = Fairclough | first1 = Tony | first2 = Wills | last2 = Alan | title = Southern Branch Line special No. 1: Bodmin and Wadebridge 1834\u20131978 | publisher =D Bradford Barton | date =1979 | location =Truro | isbn =0 85153 343 4 }}</ref>\n\nThe last passenger train left [[Wadebridge railway station]] in 1967 following railway cutbacks. The railway has been transformed into the [[Camel Trail]], and the [[Bodmin and Wenford Railway]] heritage railway runs on part of the route.\n\n=== Quays ===\nWadebridge was the highest navigable point on the [[River Camel]] providing the main trade route before the building of the railway, and coasters would bring goods from [[Bristol]] and coal from [[South Wales]]. Timber was also imported from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]],<ref name=ncr /> while stone from inland was sent to destination throughout England. The first locomotives used on the railway were also imported through the quay, being manufactured by Neath Abbey Ironworks,<ref name=bandw /> and the railway initially linked with river traffic well, having been designed to distribute sand from the river to the local farms. This commodity, brought up from [[Padstow]] in barges, had previously been taken as far as [[Michaelstow]] and [[Blisland]].<ref name=camel>{{cite book | last1 =Duxbury | first1 =Brenda | last2 =Williams | first2 =Michael | title =The River Camel | publisher =Bossiney Books | date =1987 | location =St Teath | pages = | isbn =0 948158 26 3 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/rivercamel0000duxb }}</ref>\n\nIn 1880 there were quays on both sides of the river below the bridge, that on the west bank being served by the railway.<ref>{{cite book | last1 =Mitchell | first1 =Vic | last2 =Smith | first2 =Keith | title =Branch Lines Around Bodmin | publisher =Middleton Press | date =1996 | location =Midhurst | isbn =1 873793 83 9}}</ref> There was also a \"sand dock\" constructed upstream of the bridge at the point where the Treguddick Brook (Polmorla Brook) flows into the River Camel, although this had been filled in by 1895<ref name=ncr />\n\nIn the 1900s vessels such as the M.V. Florence brought cargos such as slag (for fertiliser), grain and coal. Flour was also a regular cargo brought from Ranks at Avonmouth. However, in the 1950s the river silted badly so that the ketch ''Agnes'' was possibly the last vessel to bring cargo to Wadebridge in 1955.<ref name=ncr />\n\n=== Eddystone Road ===\nIn 1877, after cracks appeared in the rock on which the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] was positioned, a new lighthouse was commissioned from [[James Nicholas Douglass]]. Granite quarried from [[De Lank quarry]] was brought down to Wadebridge where stonemasons [[dovetail joint|dovetailed]] each segment of stone not only to each other but also to the courses above and below. As each layer was completed and checked to fit with the layer above, it was sent out to the Eddystone rocks by sea. The lighthouse was completed in 1882. This resulted in the road where the masons worked being called Eddystone Road.\n\n===World War 1===\nDuring [[World War 1]] Wadebridge was home to refugees from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. In order to support them, a property in Park Street was converted into a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] chapel.<ref>{{cite book |last = Hambly |first = Hilda |title = North Cornwall Reflections |publisher = Bossiney Books | year =  1992 | page = 82 |isbn = 0 948158 79 4 }}></ref>\n\n===World War 2===\nDespite the rural nature of the area and the lack of military installations, during [[World War 2]] there was a single recorded [[Airstrike|air raid]] when three bombs were dropped on the hill above Fernleigh Road.

There were no casualties and only minor damage.<ref>{{cite book |last = Hambly |first = Hilda\n|title = North Cornwall Reflections |publisher = Bossiney Books | year =  1992 | page = 87 |isbn = 0 948158 79 4 }}></ref>\n\n==Government==\nWadebridge is in the [[North Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of North Cornwall]] which is currently held by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Scott Mann (politician)|Scott Mann]].

The main shopping street in Wadebridge (Molesworth Street) has subsequently been pedestrianized through construction of an inner link road, allowing traffic-free shopping.\n\nOn St Swithin's day 1965 there was a flood in Wadebridge town after five and a half inches of rain fell in four and a half hours around high tide. The Swan Hotel on The Platt was flooded to a depth of one and a half feet.<ref name=camel />\n\n==Culture and community==\n[[File:The Challenge Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Challenge Bridge]]\nThe '''Molesworth Arms''' is one of the oldest Inns in Wadebridge. Previously known as The Fox, The King's Arms and The Fountain, this coaching Inn got its current name in 1817.\n\nSince 2014 the first of the annual events in and around Wadebridge has been the '''MayPlay''' festival, a weekend of free children's activities.\n\nThe '''[[Royal Cornwall Agricultural Show]]''' is held at the Royal Cornwall Showground, {{convert|1.5|mi}} west of Wadebridge over three days in early June each year. The show began in 1793 at Bodmin and was then held every year in East and West Cornwall alternately until 1960 when it came to its present site. The showground, run by the Royal Cornwall Agricultural Association, is used for many different functions from [[The Scout Association|Scout]] [[Jamboree (Scouting)|Jamborees]] to point-to-point horse racing.\n\n'''The Big Lunch''', organised by the local chamber of commerce, is a free street party in the pedestrianised part of Molesworth St in the centre of Wadebridge, where around 500\u2013750 people get together to share food, chat, and enjoy music and other entertainment. The idea grew out of a project by the Eden Project, and was started by a former local councillor, Harriet Wild. In 2012 it also served as a celebration of the Queen's Jubilee.\n\nLater in June, the Wadebridge Lions organise a '''Beer Festival''', with brews from across Cornwall, and plenty of live music.\n\nJuly sees the '''Rock Oyster Festival''' on fields just outside the town on the Camel River. Oysters are, of course, on the menu, along with bands from the local area, the South West and further afield.\n\n'''Wadebridge Carnival''' is held annually in August, with a Carnival Queen. In August there is the '''Eglos Craft Fayre''' at Egloshayle Church, and the '''Cornwall Folk Festival''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.CornwallFolkFestival.com|title=Cornwall Folk Festival, Wadebridge, August 2018|website=www.cornwallfolkfestival.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514151106/http://www.cornwallfolkfestival.com/|archivedate=14 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> one of the UK's longest-running folk festivals started in 1973, now runs for five days around the August Bank Holiday. The focus is on [[contemporary folk music]], [[bluegrass music]], [[Americana (music)]], [[celtic music]] and acoustic music, with the likes of [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Gretchen Peters]], Scotland's [[Eddi Reader]] MBE and [[Dougie Maclean]] OBE, [[The Unthanks]], [[Martyn Carthy]] MBE and Irish singer [[Cara Dillon]] rubbing shoulders with Cornish bands. The \"musician's musician\" [[Wizz Jones|Wiz Jones]] and father of the Lakeman clan Geoff Lakeman are the festival's patrons.\n\nDepending on the tides, the '''Camel River Festival''' is held around August or September.

The bridge was strategically important during the [[English Civil War]], and [[Oliver Cromwell]] went there to take it. Since then, it has been widened twice and refurbished in 1991.\n\nWadebridge was served by a railway station between 1834 and 1967; part of the line now forms the [[Camel Trail]], a recreational route for walkers, cyclists and horse riders. The town used to be a road traffic bottleneck on the [[A39 road]] until it was bypassed in 1991, and the main shopping street, Molesworth Street, is now pedestrianised.\n\nThe town has a [[Wadebridge School|secondary school]] where several notable sports-people were educated. The [[Royal Cornwall Show]] is a three-day [[agricultural show]] held at the nearby Royal Cornwall Showground every June, and the 5-day Cornwall Folk Festival takes place around the August Bank Holiday.\n\n== History ==\n===Early history===\nThe initial settlement of Wade (the name of Wadebridge before the bridge was built)<ref>{{cite book|last=Mills|first=A.

The early crossing had a chapel on each side of the river, \"King's\" chapel on the north side and \"St Michael's\" on the south side. People would pray for a safe crossing at one of the chapels before wading across at low tide, once they had made it the other side they would give thanks to God in the other chapel. In 1312 a licence was granted for a market at Wade. Wade was part of the parish of St Breock and the river separated it from the neighbouring parish of Egloshayle.\n\nAt some time the ford was supplemented by a ferry<ref name=bridges>{{cite book | last =Kentley | first =Eric | title =Cornwall's Bridge & Viaduct Heritage | publisher =Twelveheads Press | series =Twelveheads Heritage | date = | location =Truro | isbn =090629458-4}}</ref> until the Reverend Thomas Lovibond (the vicar of [[Egloshayle]]) became distressed at the number of humans and animals that died during the crossing of the River Camel so he planned the building of a bridge which was completed in 1468. Wade was now known as Wadebridge. When [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] travelled through Cornwall in the early 16th century he wrote that the piers were resting on packs of wool.<ref>Pevsner, N. (1970) ''Cornwall''; 2nd ed., revised by Enid Radcliffe. Harmondsworth: Penguinl p. 238</ref> Begun in 1468 and completed in 1485, the bridge was traditionally known as the \"Bridge on Wool\" because it was reputedly built on wool sacks.

The line was intended to carry sand from the [[Camel Estuary]] to inland farms for use as [[fertiliser]]. It was opened on 30 September 1834 with the locomotive ''Camel'' pulling a train load of 400 passengers (one of the first railways in Britain to carry passengers). When the company ordered its second locomotive it came with a name plate already affixed. It had been named the ''Elephant'' as the makers had failed to realise that the first engine had been named after the river and not an animal.<ref name=bandw>{{cite book | last1 = Fairclough | first1 = Tony | first2 = Wills | last2 = Alan | title = Southern Branch Line special No. 1: Bodmin and Wadebridge 1834\u20131978 | publisher =D Bradford Barton | date =1979 | location =Truro | isbn =0 85153 343 4 }}</ref>\n\nThe last passenger train left [[Wadebridge railway station]] in 1967 following railway cutbacks.

The first locomotives used on the railway were also imported through the quay, being manufactured by Neath Abbey Ironworks,<ref name=bandw /> and the railway initially linked with river traffic well, having been designed to distribute sand from the river to the local farms.

Florence brought cargos such as slag (for fertiliser), grain and coal. Flour was also a regular cargo brought from Ranks at Avonmouth. However, in the 1950s the river silted badly so that the ketch ''Agnes'' was possibly the last vessel to bring cargo to Wadebridge in 1955.<ref name=ncr />\n\n=== Eddystone Road ===\nIn 1877, after cracks appeared in the rock on which the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] was positioned, a new lighthouse was commissioned from [[James Nicholas Douglass]]. Granite quarried from [[De Lank quarry]] was brought down to Wadebridge where stonemasons [[dovetail joint|dovetailed]] each segment of stone not only to each other but also to the courses above and below. As each layer was completed and checked to fit with the layer above, it was sent out to the Eddystone rocks by sea. The lighthouse was completed in 1882. This resulted in the road where the masons worked being called Eddystone Road.\n\n===World War 1===\nDuring [[World War 1]] Wadebridge was home to refugees from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. In order to support them, a property in Park Street was converted into a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] chapel.<ref>{{cite book |last = Hambly |first = Hilda |title = North Cornwall Reflections |publisher = Bossiney Books | year =  1992 | page = 82 |isbn = 0 948158 79 4 }}></ref>\n\n===World War 2===\nDespite the rural nature of the area and the lack of military installations, during [[World War 2]] there was a single recorded [[Airstrike|air raid]] when three bombs were dropped on the hill above Fernleigh Road.

The main shopping street in Wadebridge (Molesworth Street) has subsequently been pedestrianized through construction of an inner link road, allowing traffic-free shopping.\n\nOn St Swithin's day 1965 there was a flood in Wadebridge town after five and a half inches of rain fell in four and a half hours around high tide. The Swan Hotel on The Platt was flooded to a depth of one and a half feet.<ref name=camel />\n\n==Culture and community==\n[[File:The Challenge Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Challenge Bridge]]\nThe '''Molesworth Arms''' is one of the oldest Inns in Wadebridge. Previously known as The Fox, The King's Arms and The Fountain, this coaching Inn got its current name in 1817.\n\nSince 2014 the first of the annual events in and around Wadebridge has been the '''MayPlay''' festival, a weekend of free children's activities.\n\nThe '''[[Royal Cornwall Agricultural Show]]''' is held at the Royal Cornwall Showground, {{convert|1.5|mi}} west of Wadebridge over three days in early June each year. The show began in 1793 at Bodmin and was then held every year in East and West Cornwall alternately until 1960 when it came to its present site. The showground, run by the Royal Cornwall Agricultural Association, is used for many different functions from [[The Scout Association|Scout]] [[Jamboree (Scouting)|Jamborees]] to point-to-point horse racing.\n\n'''The Big Lunch''', organised by the local chamber of commerce, is a free street party in the pedestrianised part of Molesworth St in the centre of Wadebridge, where around 500\u2013750 people get together to share food, chat, and enjoy music and other entertainment. The idea grew out of a project by the Eden Project, and was started by a former local councillor, Harriet Wild. In 2012 it also served as a celebration of the Queen's Jubilee.\n\nLater in June, the Wadebridge Lions organise a '''Beer Festival''', with brews from across Cornwall, and plenty of live music.\n\nJuly sees the '''Rock Oyster Festival''' on fields just outside the town on the Camel River. Oysters are, of course, on the menu, along with bands from the local area, the South West and further afield.\n\n'''Wadebridge Carnival''' is held annually in August, with a Carnival Queen.

The \"musician's musician\" [[Wizz Jones|Wiz Jones]] and father of the Lakeman clan Geoff Lakeman are the festival's patrons.\n\nDepending on the tides, the '''Camel River Festival''' is held around August or September.

However, NEC's Electronic Device Sales Division developed the microprocessor evaluation kit [[TK-80]], which became unexpectedly popular among hobbyists. {{nihongo|Tomio Got\u014d|\u5f8c\u85e4 \u5bcc\u96c4}}, a developer of the TK-80, observed the rise in popularity of personal computers at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. Computer manufacturers had not developed [[Personal computer|personal computers]] because they assumed microprocessors were not suitable for computing as they suffered from a lack of performance and reliability. The division decided to develop a personal computer despite criticism from the Information Processing Group, which developed mainframes, and claimed that they were making toys. The division only had a small distribution network of electronic parts stores, so they asked New Nippon Electric to sell the personal computers through their consumer distribution network.<ref name=\"tomita_1995\" />\n\nThe Electronic Device Sales Division launched the [[PC-8001]] in 1979, and it dominated 40% of the Japanese personal computer market in 1981.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u5927\u56f3\u9451 \u6700\u65b0\u30fb\u4eba\u6c17\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u76ee\u7684\u5225\u5168\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|year=1981|isbn=4-06-141673-1|pages=30\u201331|language=Japanese}}</ref> The vice president of NEC, {{Nihongo|Atsuyoshi \u014cuchi|\u5927\u5185 \u6df3\u7fa9}}, stated:\n:\"It is sure that we cannot deny contributions of Electronic Devices Group as a parent of the personal computer.

New Nippon Electric made 8-bit home computers ([[PC-6000 series]]), while Information Processing Group made 16-bit business personal computers and Electronic Devices Group made other personal computers such as the [[PC-8000 series|PC-8000]], [[PC-8800 series|PC-8800]], and [[NEC PC-100|PC-100 series]].\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:NEC personal computers advert in 1982.jpg|thumb|150px|Advert of NEC personal computers in 1982.

The development team initially planned for the new personal computer to be a small version of the business computer line which originated from the 1973 {{nihongo|NEAC System 100|NEAC\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0100}}. {{nihongo|Kazuya Watanabe|\u6e21\u908a \u548c\u4e5f}}, who directed the development of the PC-8001, stated that the personal computer must have [[Microsoft BASIC]], considered compatibility of peripheral devices with previous NEC PCs, and disclosed specifications of its expansion slot. In September 1981, Hamada requested [[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]'s [[Kazuhiko Nishi]] to rewrite [[N88-BASIC]] to run on the [[Intel 8086]] processor, and Nishi replied, saying that he wanted to talk with [[Bill Gates]]. Three months later, Nishi rejected Hamada's request because Microsoft was busy with the development of [[GW-BASIC]], and they don't want to produce more variants of Microsoft BASIC. Nishi told him, \"Microsoft is rewriting a BASIC that has the same function with more structured internal code, and it will be sold as the definitive 16-bit version named GW-BASIC. We'll provide a BASIC sooner if you choose the Japanese adoption of GW BASIC.\". Hamada replied, \"As I said, we want a BASIC that is compatible with the previous ones\". They couldn't make an agreement.\n\nHamada couldn't decide which plan they should develop, a small business computer or a personal computer, because the possibilities of Watanabe's plan was uncertain. While they were visiting software companies to collect and research applications for the PC-8001 and PC-8801, Hamada and Watanabe discovered that the consumer market wanted a 16-bit machine compatible with both PCs. Hamada decided to adopt two plans for different markets. In April 1982, the small business personal computer became the {{nihongo|NEC System 20 model 15|NEC\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e020/15}}, which used a proprietary 16-bit microprocessor. The machine was introduced as a new model of traditional business computers, so it was not notable.<ref name=\"tomita_1995\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000055/card365.html|title=\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u5275\u4e16\u8a18|last=\u5bcc\u7530|first=\u502b\u751f|publisher=\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|year=1995|access-date=2019-03-11|via=[[Aozora Bunko]]|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, the software development team started [[reverse engineering]] N88-BASIC and designing N88-BASIC(86). After the team finished in March 1982, they started development on the PC-9801 (named ''N-10 Project''). A PC-9801 prototype was completed at the end of July 1982. The code of N88-BASIC (86) was written completely from scratch, but Nishi pointed out that the [[bytecode]] matched Microsoft's. It was unclear if the copyright law could apply to the bytecode. Nishi suggested to Hamada that NEC must have purchased the same amount of Microsoft's product as it corresponded to the license fee, and N88-BASIC(86) must show copyright notification for both [[Microsoft]] and NEC. Hamada approved it. The team considered third-party developers to be very important for the market's expansion. They provided 50\u2013100 prototypes and technical information for independent companies without a fee.<ref name=\"tomita_1995\" />\n\nIn 1981, the Terminal Units Division of the Information Processing Group also launched the personal computer series {{Ill|N5200|ja|}}, which was branded as the \"personal terminal\". It used an [[Intel 8086]] processor and a [[NEC \u00b5PD7220|\u00b5PD7220]] display controller. Its architecture was similar to that of the PC-98, but it mostly ran the proprietary operating system ''[[PTOS (operating system)|PTOS]]''.

The basic system could only display [[JIS X 0201]] characters including numbers, English alphabets, and [[half-width kana]], so most users added an optional [[kanji]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]] board for using a Japanese [[word processor]]. Its successor, the PC-9801F employed an 8086-2 CPU, which could selectively run at a speed of either 5 or 8&nbsp;MHz. The F2 model contained two 640 KB 5\u00bc-inch 2DD (QD) floppy drives, a [[JIS X 0208|JIS]] level 1 kanji (2965 characters) font ROM, and was priced at 398,000 yen (about US$1,700 in 1983).

NEC announced that the PC-98 would be discontinued in 2003. 18.3 million of PC-98s shipped by the end of shipments in March 2004.<ref name=\"ozawa_2004\" /> The last version of Windows to support PC-98 was Windows 2000.\n\nNEC kept much of its hardware and platform proprietary or under license, so while it had a virtual monopoly in the Japanese market, later IBM PC clones with DOS/V and Windows from companies such as [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] and [[Panasonic]] that did not require such license fees (like Epson's 98 clones) flooded the market and displaced NEC.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Hardware ==\nThe PC-98 is different from the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] in many ways; for instance, it uses its own 16-bit C-bus ([[:ja:C\u30d0\u30b9|C\u30d0\u30b9]]) instead of the [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus; BIOS, [[Memory-mapped I/O|I/O port]] addressing, memory management, and graphics output are also different. However, localized MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, or Windows will still run on PC-9801s.\n\n=== Expansion bus ===\n[[File:PC-9801DX expansion slot.jpg|thumb|Expansion slot (C-bus)]]\nAll PC-98 desktop models use a 100-pin expansion slot. It has 16 data and 24 address lines. The bus frequency is fixed at 5, 8 or 10&nbsp;MHz. PC-H98 and PC-9821A Series use a proprietary 32-bit Local Bus slot and existing 16-bit slot. The 16-bit expansion bus was also called C-bus (Compatible Bus). The PC-9821Xf introduced in 1994 shipped with C-bus slots and PCI slots on the motherboard, replacing Local Bus.\n\n=== Memory ===\n[[File:Buffalo EMJ-4000 EMS RAM board.jpg|thumb|4 MB memory board for C-bus]]\nMany PC-9801 models could increase system memory by installing expansion boards, daughterboards, or proprietary SIMMs. They were limited to 14.6 MB, due to 24-bit address pins and reserve space. [[Expanded memory|EMS]] memory boards for C-bus were also available. The PC-9821Af introduced in 1993 shipped with standard 72-pin SIMMs, broke 14.6 MB barrier and supported memory up to 79.6 MB. Later desktop models shipped with standard SIMM or [[DIMM]] memory.\n\nThe PC-98XA (1985) and its successors, called ''high-resolution machine'' or simply ''hi-reso machine'', were capable of 768 KB [[Conventional memory|base memory]], but I/O port and memory addressing was quite different from normal PC-98.\n\n=== Storage ===\nEarly PC-9801 models supported 1232 KB 8-inch floppy drives and/or 640 KB 5\u00bc-inch floppy drives. Each used different [[Interrupt request (PC architecture)|IRQ]] lines and I/O ports. Later models supported both interfaces. 5\u00bc-inch and 3\u00bd-inch HD floppy disks used the same logical format and data rate with 1232 KB 8-inch floppy disks. They became a non-standard format while formats brought by IBM PC/AT and [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] became the industry standard.\n\nThe PC-98 supports up to four floppy drives. If the system is booted from a floppy drive, MS-DOS [[Drive letter assignment|assigns letters]] to all of the floppy drives before considering hard drives; it does the opposite if it is booted from a hard drive. If the OS was installed on the hard drive, MS-DOS would assign the hard drive as drive \"A:\" and the floppy as drive \"B:\"; this would cause incompatibility among Windows PC applications, although it can be resolved with the SETUP command in Windows 95 by turning on the \"/AT\" switch to assign the Windows system drive to the standard \"C:\" drive.\n\nThe PC-98 used several different interfaces of hard drives. Early models used [[Shugart Associates System Interface]] (SASI) or [[ST506/ST412|ST506]], and later models used SCSI or IDE drives.\n\n=== Graphics ===\n[[File:N88-BASIC(86) color text with graphics.png|thumb|Drawing 8 color characters and 16 color background.]]\nA standard PC-98 has two [[NEC \u00b5PD7220|\u00b5PD7220]] display controllers (a master and a slave) with 12 KB main memory and 256 KB of video RAM respectively. The master display controller handles font ROM, displaying [[JIS X 0201]] (7x13 pixels) and [[JIS X 0208]] (15x16 pixels) characters. Each character had a variety of display options, including bits for secret, blinking, reverse, underline and three intensity bits (grayscale or RGB). The other display controller is set to slave mode and connected to 256 KB of [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]] video memory, allowing it to display 640 x 400 pixel graphics with 16 colors out of a palette of 4096. The video RAM is divided into pages (2 pages x 4 planes x 32 KB in 640x400 16 colour mode), and the programmer can control which page is written to and which page is output.\n\nThe high-resolution machines (PC-98XA, XL, and PC-H98) offered 1120x750 display mode, and aimed for tasks such as CAD and word processing.\n\nThe PC-9801U (optional) and VM introduced a custom chipset GRCG (''GRaphic CharGer'') to access several [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar memory]] in parallel. The PC-9801VX introduced a [[blitter]] chip called EGC (''Enhanced Graphic Charger'').<ref>{{Cite journal|year=1986|title=\u65b0\u6a5f\u7a2e\u7dca\u6025\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8 : PC-9801VX|journal=[[ASCII (magazine)|ASCII]]|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|volume=10|issue=12|pages=130\u2013133|issn=0386-5428}}</ref> It had raster operations and bit shifting.\n\nIn 1993, NEC introduced a 2D Windows accelerator card for PC-98 called the ''Window Accelerator Board'' and employed [[S3 Graphics|S3]]'s 86C928.

The PC-8801mkIISR home computer, introduced in 1985, had a [[Yamaha YM2203]] sound chip, an [[Atari joystick port]], and BASIC sound commands. The optional PC-9801-26 sound card was based around these features, although in some PC-9801 models it is integrated with the motherboard. It was replaced by the PC-9801-26K to support the 80286 CPU.

PC-9801 models}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Marketing===\nA journalist explained in 1988 how NEC ''established the nation of Japanese personal computers'':<ref name=\"kobayashi_1988\" />\n\n* NEC responded quickly to the new demand for business personal computers.\n* NEC succeeded in attracting many third-party suppliers and dominated software production and distribution.\n* NEC adopted Microsoft's MS-DOS as an operating system for the PC-98.\n\nWestern computers lacked Japanese support due to its display resolution and speed, so they could not get into the Japanese PC market until the [[DOS/V]] and faster computers came out; for example, IBM Japan sold the [[IBM 5550]] instead of the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]. Akihiko Hyodo, a programmer who developed the text editor [[VZ Editor]], said two advantage that the PC-98 had were its kanji character memory and non-[[Interlaced video|interlaced]] monitor. Both provided users with a more comfortable Japanese environment.<ref name=\"ascii_2004_memory\">{{Cite book|title=\u8607\u308bPC-9801\u4f1d\u8aac \u6c38\u4e45\u4fdd\u5b58\u7248 \u7b2c1\u5f3e|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|year=2004|isbn=4-7561-4419-5|pages=17\u201321|language=Japanese|chapter=PC\u696d\u754c\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30f3\u304c\u8a9e\u308b \u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306ePC-9801}}</ref> A senior vice president of Otsuka Shokai (a computer distributor for enterprises) recalled that \"early users such as [[Kao Corporation|Kao]] already had office automation with the PC-8000, but it lacked speed and kanji support. Then, the PC-9800 was released, and it was perfect, so distributors and users immediately switched to it.\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u670d\u90e8|first=\u96c5\u5e78|publication-date=1989-05-01|title=PC-9800\u306f\u3069\u3053\u3078\u884c\u304f \u7b2c2\u90e8 \u7de9\u3084\u304b\u306b\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u30bb\u30e9\u30fc\u8a18|journal=\u65e5\u7d4c\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3|publisher=[[Nikkei Business Publications]]|pages=180\u2013190|issn=0287-9506|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nShunzo Hamada of NEC thought the biggest reason for the success of PC-98 was that NEC could get software companies to cooperate. He said, \"Third-party suppliers of Japanese PCs had already grown up to a certain extent. However, it was not because they were organized. They were born by themselves, and hardware manufacturers didn't touch them. When we developed the PC-9800 series, we changed our method to make a conscious effort to grow them up\".<ref name=\"hamada_2004\">{{Cite book|title=\u8607\u308bPC-9801\u4f1d\u8aac \u6c38\u4e45\u4fdd\u5b58\u7248 \u7b2c1\u5f3e|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|year=2004|isbn=4-7561-4419-5|pages=4\u20139|language=Japanese|chapter=\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3067\u8f9b\u9178\u3092\u5617\u3081\u601d\u8003\u3092180\u5ea6\u8ee2\u63db\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304cPC-9800\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3078\u306e\u6210\u529f\u3078\u3064\u306a\u304c\u3063\u305f}}</ref>\n\nIchiran Kou, a computer consultant, pointed out that IBM influenced NEC's strategy. Since 1982, NEC had four personal computer lines, and they covered a wide price range, similar to IBM's mainframe business. However, NEC's computers had poor backward compatibility and as such was criticized by users and software developers. After reforming personal computer lines in 1983, NEC began expanding the PC-9801 series and its number of models exceeded its competitors.<ref name=\"kou_1988\">{{Cite book|title=100\u4e07\u4eba\u306e\u8b0e\u3092\u89e3\u304f \u30b6\u30fbPC\u306e\u7cfb\u8b5c|last=\u5e83|first=\u4e00\u862d|publisher=\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u793e|year=1988|isbn=4-8061-0316-0|editor-last=\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u793e|pages=124\u2013127|chapter=IBM\u5927\u578b\u6a5f\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u304c\u898b\u3048\u308bNEC\u306e\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u958b\u767a\u6226\u7565|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nNEC encouraged third-party developers as IBM did for the IBM PC. The basic hardware of PC-98 was also similar to the IBM PC, though it was not IBM compatible. Kou guessed that NEC avoided releasing an IBM compatible PC because the company was proud of developing an original mainframe.<ref name=\"kou_1988\" />\n\nYasuhiro Uchida, a literature professor, wrote an essay titled \"Users chose the most ''playable'' PC\". He felt the PC-98 was an \"ordinary\" 16-bit personal computer, but it had plenty of games because it did not deny the ''playability''. He theorized that Fujitsu did not consider the 16-bit personal computer as a game platform, and considered [[IBM JX]] handling games to be of minor importance, which made personal computers less attractive. He concluded that the actual value of personal computers must be found by not sellers but consumers.<ref name=\"uchida_1988\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nA writer of the [[ASCII (magazine)|ASCII magazine]] wrote that the [[Japanese input method]] and the Japanese [[video game industry]] were significantly developed in the PC-98 era. Because the PC-98 had a kanji character ROM, Japanese applications were developed for it, which influenced Japanese input methods being developed for them; the two built off of each other. Software companies that developed games for the PC-98 immediately expanded the video game business on the [[Famicom]] platform. He believed most programmers learned [[computer programming]] on the PC-98 at that time.<ref name=\"ascii_2004_memory\" />\n\n===Criticism===\nIn the late 1980s, competitors criticized NEC [[Monopoly|monopolizing]] the market. Takayoshi Shina, a founder of [[Sord Computer Corporation|Sord]], said, \"The Japanese PC market is suffocating because of one company's dominance. There is no freedom. This is why its prices are 3-4 times as expensive as America's. To fulfil the same international price as America's, we really need the era of clone computers.\". A software company also complained that \"although there are few excellent engineers in Japan, the more incompatible machines appear, the more development resources are divided.\".<ref name=\"matsuo_1988\" />\n\nContrary to the IBM PC and the [[Apple II]], every Japanese personal computer had a short lifespan; NEC released a new model of the PC-98 every year. When the PC-9801VX01/21/41 models brought a new BASIC interpreter which supported the Enhanced Graphic Charger (EGC) chipset, most commercial software did not use it as they were written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Many developers did not follow it because they wanted to make their software less dependent on the specific platform. A software developer said, \"Using the special one (EGC) goes against the trend. I don't want to use it if new machines come out so frequently.\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u5800\u5ddd|first=\u660e\u7f8e|publication-date=1987-08-10|title=\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u6700\u524d\u7dda\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u96fb\u6c17PC-9800VX01/21/41/41WN \u4e92\u63db\u6a5f\u5dfb\u304d\u8fd4\u3057\u306f\u9ad8\u901f\u5316\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3067|journal=\u65e5\u7d4c\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3|publisher=[[Nikkei McGraw-Hill]]|pages=77\u201381|issn=0287-9506|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[PC game]]\n* [[PC-8800 Series]]\n* [[X68000]]\n* [[TurboGrafx-16]]\n* [[Commodore 64]]\n* [[FM-7]]\n* [[FM Towns]]\n* [[MSX]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Joel West and Jason Dedrick, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110544/http://www.cob.sjsu.edu/WEST_J/Papers/WestDedrick2000.pdf Innovation and Control in Standards Architectures: The Rise and Fall of Japan's PC-98]\", ''[[Information Systems Research]]'', Vol. 11, No. 2, June 2000, pp.&nbsp;197\u2013216\n* {{cite book |title=\u6539\u8a02\u7248 PC-9800\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba \u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30c3\u30af HARDWARE\u7de8 |date=1993 |author=Ascii Techwrite |publisher=Ascii |isbn=4756104568 |trans-title=PC-9800 Series Technical Databook (Hardware, Revised Ed.)}}\n* {{cite book |title=PC-9800\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba \u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30c3\u30af BIOS\u7de8 |date=1992 |author=Ascii Techwrite |publisher=Ascii |isbn=475610441X |trans-title=PC-9800 Series Technical Databook (BIOS)}}\n* {{cite journal |author-first1=Steven |author-last1=Myers |author-first2=Greg |author-last2=Smith |title=DOS/V: The Soft(ware) Solution to Hard(ware) Problems |date=March 1995 |journal=Computing Japan Magazine |url=http://www.japaninc.com/cpj/magazine/issues/1995/mar95/03dosv.html |access-date=2017-01-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115192029/http://www.japaninc.com/cpj/magazine/issues/1995/mar95/03dosv.html |archive-date=2017-01-15}}\n* {{cite journal |author-first=John |author-last=Boyd |title=From Chaos to Competition -

However, NEC's Electronic Device Sales Division developed the microprocessor evaluation kit [[TK-80]], which became unexpectedly popular among hobbyists. {{nihongo|Tomio Got\u014d|\u5f8c\u85e4 \u5bcc\u96c4}}, a developer of the TK-80, observed the rise in popularity of personal computers at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. Computer manufacturers had not developed [[Personal computer|personal computers]] because they assumed microprocessors were not suitable for computing as they suffered from a lack of performance and reliability. The division decided to develop a personal computer despite criticism from the Information Processing Group, which developed mainframes, and claimed that they were making toys. The division only had a small distribution network of electronic parts stores, so they asked New Nippon Electric to sell the personal computers through their consumer distribution network.<ref name=\"tomita_1995\" />\n\nThe Electronic Device Sales Division launched the [[PC-8001]] in 1979, and it dominated 40% of the Japanese personal computer market in 1981.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u5927\u56f3\u9451 \u6700\u65b0\u30fb\u4eba\u6c17\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u76ee\u7684\u5225\u5168\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|year=1981|isbn=4-06-141673-1|pages=30\u201331|language=Japanese}}</ref> The vice president of NEC, {{Nihongo|Atsuyoshi \u014cuchi|\u5927\u5185 \u6df3\u7fa9}}, stated:\n:\"It is sure that we cannot deny contributions of Electronic Devices Group as a parent of the personal computer.

New Nippon Electric made 8-bit home computers ([[PC-6000 series]]), while Information Processing Group made 16-bit business personal computers and Electronic Devices Group made other personal computers such as the [[PC-8000 series|PC-8000]], [[PC-8800 series|PC-8800]], and [[NEC PC-100|PC-100 series]].\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:NEC personal computers advert in 1982.jpg|thumb|150px|Advert of NEC personal computers in 1982.

The development team initially planned for the new personal computer to be a small version of the business computer line which originated from the 1973 {{nihongo|NEAC System 100|NEAC\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0100}}. {{nihongo|Kazuya Watanabe|\u6e21\u908a \u548c\u4e5f}}, who directed the development of the PC-8001, stated that the personal computer must have [[Microsoft BASIC]], considered compatibility of peripheral devices with previous NEC PCs, and disclosed specifications of its expansion slot. In September 1981, Hamada requested [[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]'s [[Kazuhiko Nishi]] to rewrite [[N88-BASIC]] to run on the [[Intel 8086]] processor, and Nishi replied, saying that he wanted to talk with [[Bill Gates]]. Three months later, Nishi rejected Hamada's request because Microsoft was busy with the development of [[GW-BASIC]], and they don't want to produce more variants of Microsoft BASIC. Nishi told him, \"Microsoft is rewriting a BASIC that has the same function with more structured internal code, and it will be sold as the definitive 16-bit version named GW-BASIC. We'll provide a BASIC sooner if you choose the Japanese adoption of GW BASIC.\". Hamada replied, \"As I said, we want a BASIC that is compatible with the previous ones\". They couldn't make an agreement.\n\nHamada couldn't decide which plan they should develop, a small business ccomputer or a personal computer, because the possibilities of Watanabe's plan was uncertain. While they were visiting software companies to collect and research applications for the PC-8001 and PC-8801, Hamada and Watanabe discovered that the consumer market wanted a 16-bit machine compatible with both PCs. Hamada decided to adopt two plans for different markets. In April 1982, the small business personal computer became the {{nihongo|NEC System 20 model 15|NEC\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e020/15}}, which used a proprietary 16-bit microprocessor. The machine was introduced as a new model of traditional business computers, so it was not notable.<ref name=\"tomita_1995\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000055/card365.html|title=\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u5275\u4e16\u8a18|last=\u5bcc\u7530|first=\u502b\u751f|publisher=\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|year=1995|access-date=2019-03-11|via=[[Aozora Bunko]]|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, the software development team started [[reverse engineering]] N88-BASIC and designing N88-BASIC(86). After the team finished in March 1982, they started development on the PC-9801 (named ''N-10 Project''). A PC-9801 prototype was completed at the end of July 1982. The code of N88-BASIC (86) was written completely from scratch, but Nishi pointed out that the [[bytecode]] matched Microsoft's. It was unclear if the copyright law could apply to the bytecode. Nishi suggested to Hamada that NEC must have purchased the same amount of Microsoft's product as it corresponded to the license fee, and N88-BASIC(86) must show copyright notification for both [[Microsoft]] and NEC. Hamada approved it. The team considered third-party developers to be very important for the market's expansion. They provided 50\u2013100 prototypes and technical information for independent companies without a fee.<ref name=\"tomita_1995\" />\n\nIn 1981, the Terminal Units Division of the Information Processing Group also launched the personal computer series {{Ill|N5200|ja|}}, which was branded as the \"personal terminal\". It used an [[Intel 8086]] processor and a [[NEC \u00b5PD7220|\u00b5PD7220]] display controller. Its architecture was similar to that of the PC-98, but it mostly ran the proprietary operating system ''[[PTOS (operating system)|PTOS]]''.

Its 8-color display had a maximum resolution of 640\u00d7400 pixels.\n\nWhen the PC-9801 launched in 1982, it was initially priced at 298,000 yen (about US$1,200 in 1982 dollars). This model required an expensive 8-inch [[floppy disk]] drive or smaller capacity of 320 KB 5\u00bc-inch floppy drive. The basic system could only display [[JIS X 0201]] characters including numbers, English alphabets, and [[half-width kana]], so most users added an optional [[kanji]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]] board for using a Japanese [[word processor]]. Its successor, the PC-9801F employed an 8086-2 CPU, which could selectively run at a speed of either 5 or 8&nbsp;MHz. The F2 model contained two 640 KB 5\u00bc-inch 2DD (QD) floppy drives, a [[JIS X 0208|JIS]] level 1 kanji (2965 characters) font ROM, and was priced at 398,000 yen (about US$1,700 in 1983).

NEC announced that the PC-98 would be discontinued in 2003. 18.3 million of PC-98s shipped by the end of shipments in March 2004.<ref name=\"ozawa_2004\" /> The last version of Windows to support PC-98 was Windows 2000.\n\nNEC kept much of its hardware and platform proprietary or under license, so while it had a virtual monopoly in the Japanese market, later IBM PC clones with DOS/V and Windows from companies such as [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] and [[Panasonic]] that did not require such license fees (like Epson's 98 clones) flooded the market and displaced NEC.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Hardware ==\nThe PC-98 is different from the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] in many ways; for instance, it uses its own 16-bit C-bus ([[:ja:C\u30d0\u30b9|C\u30d0\u30b9]]) instead of the [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus; BIOS, [[Memory-mapped I/O|I/O port]] addressing, memory management, and graphics output are also different. However, localized MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, or Windows will still run on PC-9801s.\n\n=== Expansion bus ===\n[[File:PC-9801DX expansion slot.jpg|thumb|Expansion slot (C-bus)]]\nAll PC-98 desktop models use a 100-pin expansion slot. It has 16 data and 24 address lines. The bus frequency is fixed at 5, 8 or 10&nbsp;MHz. PC-H98 and PC-9821A Series use a proprietary 32-bit Local Bus slot and existing 16-bit slot. The 16-bit expansion bus was also called C-bus (Compatible Bus). The PC-9821Xf introduced in 1994 shipped with C-bus slots and PCI slots on the motherboard, replacing Local Bus.\n\n=== Memory ===\n[[File:Buffalo EMJ-4000 EMS RAM board.jpg|thumb|4 MB memory board for C-bus]]\nMany PC-9801 models could increase system memory by installing expansion boards, daughterboards, or proprietary SIMMs. They were limited to 14.6 MB, due to 24-bit address pins and reserve space. [[Expanded memory|EMS]] memory boards for C-bus were also available. The PC-9821Af introduced in 1993 shipped with standard 72-pin SIMMs, broke 14.6 MB barrier and supported memory up to 79.6 MB. Later desktop models shipped with standard SIMM or [[DIMM]] memory.\n\nThe PC-98XA (1985) and its successors, called ''high-resolution machine'' or simply ''hi-reso machine'', were capable of 768 KB [[Conventional memory|base memory]], but I/O port and memory addressing was quite different from normal PC-98.\n\n=== Storage ===\nEarly PC-9801 models supported 1232 KB 8-inch floppy drives and/or 640 KB 5\u00bc-inch floppy drives. Each used different [[Interrupt request (PC architecture)|IRQ]] lines and I/O ports. Later models supported both interfaces. 5\u00bc-inch and 3\u00bd-inch HD floppy disks used the same logical format and data rate with 1232 KB 8-inch floppy disks. They became a non-standard format while formats brought by IBM PC/AT and [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] became the industry standard.\n\nThe PC-98 supports up to four floppy drives. If the system is booted from a floppy drive, MS-DOS [[Drive letter assignment|assigns letters]] to all of the floppy drives before considering hard drives; it does the opposite if it is booted from a hard drive. If the OS was installed on the hard drive, MS-DOS would assign the hard drive as drive \"A:\" and the floppy as drive \"B:\"; this would cause incompatibility among Windows PC applications, although it can be resolved with the SETUP command in Windows 95 by turning on the \"/AT\" switch to assign the Windows system drive to the standard \"C:\" drive.\n\nThe PC-98 used several different interfaces of hard drives. Early models used [[Shugart Associates System Interface]] (SASI) or [[ST506/ST412|ST506]], and later models used SCSI or IDE drives.\n\n=== Graphics ===\n[[File:N88-BASIC(86) color text with graphics.png|thumb|Drawing 8 color characters and 16 color background.]]\nA standard PC-98 has two [[NEC \u00b5PD7220|\u00b5PD7220]] display controllers (a master and a slave) with 12 KB main memory and 256 KB of video RAM respectively. The master display controller handles font ROM, displaying [[JIS X 0201]] (7x13 pixels) and [[JIS X 0208]] (15x16 pixels) characters. Each character had a variety of display options, including bits for secret, blinking, reverse, underline and three intensity bits (grayscale or RGB). The other display controller is set to slave mode and connected to 256 KB of [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]] video memory, allowing it to display 640 x 400 pixel graphics with 16 colors out of a palette of 4096. The video RAM is divided into pages (2 pages x 4 planes x 32 KB in 640x400 16 colour mode), and the programmer can control which page is written to and which page is output.\n\nThe high-resolution machines (PC-98XA, XL, and PC-H98) offered 1120x750 display mode, and aimed for tasks such as CAD and word processing.\n\nThe PC-9801U (optional) and VM introduced a custom chipset GRCG (''GRaphic CharGer'') to access several [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar memory]] in parallel. The PC-9801VX introduced a [[blitter]] chip called EGC (''Enhanced Graphic Charger'').<ref>{{Cite journal|year=1986|title=\u65b0\u6a5f\u7a2e\u7dca\u6025\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8 : PC-9801VX|journal=[[ASCII (magazine)|ASCII]]|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|volume=10|issue=12|pages=130\u2013133|issn=0386-5428}}</ref> It had raster operations and bit shifting.\n\nIn 1993, NEC introduced a 2D Windows accelerator card for PC-98 called the ''Window Accelerator Board'' and employed [[S3 Graphics|S3]]'s 86C928.

responded quickly to the new demand for business personal computers.\n* NEC succeeded in attracting many third-party suppliers and dominated software production and distribution.\n* NEC adopted Microsoft's MS-DOS as an operating system for the PC-98.\n\nWestern computers lacked Japanese support due to its display resolution and speed, so they could not get into the Japanese PC market until the [[DOS/V]] and faster computers came out; for example, IBM Japan sold the [[IBM 5550]] instead of the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]. Akihiko Hyodo, a programmer who developed the text editor [[VZ Editor]], said two advantage that the PC-98 had were its kanji character memory and non-[[Interlaced video|interlaced]] monitor. Both provided users with a more comfortable Japanese environment.<ref name=\"ascii_2004_memory\">{{Cite book|title=\u8607\u308bPC-9801\u4f1d\u8aac \u6c38\u4e45\u4fdd\u5b58\u7248 \u7b2c1\u5f3e|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|year=2004|isbn=4-7561-4419-5|pages=17\u201321|language=Japanese|chapter=PC\u696d\u754c\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30f3\u304c\u8a9e\u308b \u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306ePC-9801}}</ref> A senior vice president of Otsuka Shokai (a computer distributor for enterprises) recalled that \"early users such as [[Kao Corporation|Kao]] already had office automation with the PC-8000, but it lacked speed and kanji support.

He said, \"Third-party suppliers of Japanese PCs had already grown up to a certain extent. However, it was not because they were organized. They were born by themselves, and hardware manufacturers didn't touch them. When we developed the PC-9800 series, we changed our method to make a conscious effort to grow them up\".<ref name=\"hamada_2004\">{{Cite book|title=\u8607\u308bPC-9801\u4f1d\u8aac \u6c38\u4e45\u4fdd\u5b58\u7248 \u7b2c1\u5f3e|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|year=2004|isbn=4-7561-4419-5|pages=4\u20139|language=Japanese|chapter=\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3067\u8f9b\u9178\u3092\u5617\u3081\u601d\u8003\u3092180\u5ea6\u8ee2\u63db\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304cPC-9800\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3078\u306e\u6210\u529f\u3078\u3064\u306a\u304c\u3063\u305f}}</ref>\n\nIchiran Kou, a computer consultant, pointed out that IBM influenced NEC's strategy. Since 1982, NEC had four personal computer lines, and they covered a wide price range, similar to IBM's mainframe business. However, NEC's computers had poor backward compatibility and as such was criticized by users and software developers. After reforming personal computer lines in 1983, NEC began expanding the PC-9801 series and its number of models exceeded its competitors.<ref name=\"kou_1988\">{{Cite book|title=100\u4e07\u4eba\u306e\u8b0e\u3092\u89e3\u304f \u30b6\u30fbPC\u306e\u7cfb\u8b5c|last=\u5e83|first=\u4e00\u862d|publisher=\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u793e|year=1988|isbn=4-8061-0316-0|editor-last=\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u793e|pages=124\u2013127|chapter=IBM\u5927\u578b\u6a5f\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u304c\u898b\u3048\u308bNEC\u306e\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u958b\u767a\u6226\u7565|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nNEC encouraged third-party developers as IBM did for the IBM PC. The basic hardware of PC-98 was also similar to the IBM PC, though it was not IBM compatible. Kou guessed that NEC avoided releasing an IBM compatible PC because the company was proud of developing an original mainframe.<ref name=\"kou_1988\" />\n\nYasuhiro Uchida, a literature professor, wrote an essay titled \"Users chose the most ''playable'' PC\". He felt the PC-98 was an \"ordinary\" 16-bit personal computer, but it had plenty of games because it did not deny the ''playability''. He theorized that Fujitsu did not consider the 16-bit personal computer as a game platform, and considered [[IBM JX]] handling games to be of minor importance, which made personal computers less attractive. He concluded that the actual value of personal computers must be found by not sellers but consumers.<ref name=\"uchida_1988\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nA writer of the [[ASCII (magazine)|ASCII magazine]] wrote that the [[Japanese input method]] and the Japanese [[video game industry]] were significantly developed in the PC-98 era. Because the PC-98 had a kanji character ROM, Japanese applications were developed for it, which influenced Japanese input methods being developed for them; the two built off of each other. Software companies that developed games for the PC-98 immediately expanded the video game business on the [[Famicom]] platform. He believed most programmers learned [[computer programming]] on the PC-98 at that time.<ref name=\"ascii_2004_memory\" />\n\n===Criticism===\nIn the late 1980s, competitors criticized NEC [[Monopoly|monopolizing]] the market. Takayoshi Shina, a founder of [[Sord Computer Corporation|Sord]], said, \"The Japanese PC market is suffocating because of one company's dominance. There is no freedom. This is why its prices are 3-4 times as expensive as America's. To fulfil the same international price as America's, we really need the era of clone computers.\". A software company also complained that \"although there are few excellent engineers in Japan, the more incompatible machines appear, the more development resources are divided.\".<ref name=\"matsuo_1988\" />\n\nContrary to the IBM PC and the [[Apple II]], every Japanese personal computer had a short lifespan; NEC released a new model of the PC-98 every year. When the PC-9801VX01/21/41 models brought a new BASIC interpreter which supported the Enhanced Graphic Charger (EGC) chipset, most commercial software did not use it as they were written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Many developers did not follow it because they wanted to make their software less dependent on the specific platform. A software developer said, \"Using the special one (EGC) goes against the trend. I don't want to use it if new machines come out so frequently.\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u5800\u5ddd|first=\u660e\u7f8e|publication-date=1987-08-10|title=\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u6700\u524d\u7dda\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u96fb\u6c17PC-9800VX01/21/41/41WN \u4e92\u63db\u6a5f\u5dfb\u304d\u8fd4\u3057\u306f\u9ad8\u901f\u5316\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3067|journal=\u65e5\u7d4c\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3|publisher=[[Nikkei McGraw-Hill]]|pages=77\u201381|issn=0287-9506|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[PC game]]\n* [[PC-8800 Series]]\n* [[X68000]]\n* [[TurboGrafx-16]]\n* [[Commodore 64]]\n* [[FM-7]]\n* [[FM Towns]]\n* [[MSX]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Joel West and Jason Dedrick, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110544/http://www.cob.sjsu.edu/WEST_J/Papers/WestDedrick2000.pdf Innovation and Control in Standards Architectures: The Rise and Fall of Japan's PC-98]\", ''[[Information Systems Research]]'', Vol. 11, No. 2, June 2000, pp.&nbsp;197\u2013216\n* {{cite book |title=\u6539\u8a02\u7248 PC-9800\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba \u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30c3\u30af HARDWARE\u7de8 |date=1993 |author=Ascii Techwrite |publisher=Ascii |isbn=4756104568 |trans-title=PC-9800 Series Technical Databook (Hardware, Revised Ed.)}}\n* {{cite book |title=PC-9800\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba \u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30c3\u30af BIOS\u7de8 |date=1992 |author=Ascii Techwrite |publisher=Ascii |isbn=475610441X |trans-title=PC-9800 Series Technical Databook (BIOS)}}\n* {{cite journal |author-first1=Steven |author-last1=Myers |author-first2=Greg |author-last2=Smith |title=DOS/V: The Soft(ware) Solution to Hard(ware) Problems |date=March 1995 |journal=Computing Japan Magazine |url=http://www.japaninc.com/cpj/magazine/issues/1995/mar95/03dosv.html |access-date=2017-01-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115192029/http://www.japaninc.com/cpj/magazine/issues/1995/mar95/03dosv.html |archive-date=2017-01-15}}\n* {{cite journal |author-first=John |author-last=Boyd |title=From Chaos to Competition - Japan's PC industry in transformation |date=April 1997 |journal=Computing Japan Magazine |url=http://www.japaninc.com/cpj/magazine/issues/1997/apr97/chaos.html |access-date=2017-01-16 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116023428/http://www.japaninc.com/cpj/magazine/issues/1997/apr97/chaos.html |archive-date=2017-01-16}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://euc.jp/articles/pc9800.en.html Intro to NEC PC-9800 World]\n* [http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/personal/0011.html PC 9801, the first model of the series]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140725224201/http://computer-zoo.org/m/n/nec_pc-9801m.html Info about NEC PC-9801M with uPD8086D-2]\n* {{cite web|url=http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA011804/pc9801.htm|title=PC\u535a\u7269\u9928|trans-title=PC Museum|accessdate =June 7, 2016|language=Japanese}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.pc-9800.net/|title=With98 : PC-98\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d0\u30f3\u30af|trans-title=With98 : PC-98 Data Bank|publisher=(unofficial)|accessdate =June 7, 2016|language=Japanese}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.jp/retro_zzz/machines/nec/9801/mdl98cpu.html|title=\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc \uff08\u672c\u4f53\uff09 - PC-9800 - NEC - \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\uff30\uff23 - Retro Computer People|trans-title=Model number (computers) - PC-9800 - NEC - Retro PC - Retro Computer People|accessdate=June 10, 2016|language=Japanese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210034057/http://www.geocities.jp/retro_zzz/machines/nec/9801/mdl98cpu.html|archive-date=December 10, 2014|url-status=dead}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~NaoCh/cat.html|title=\u306a\u304a\u3061\u307e\u5c4b = \u6614\u306e\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0\u4fdd\u5b58\u9928|trans-title=Naochima-ya - Old catalogue museum|accessdate =June 10, 2016|language=Japanese}}\n* [http://www.yui.ne.jp/np2/ Neko Project II, a PC-98 emulator for Windows and Mac OS X]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-bef|before = [[PC-8800 Series]] }}\n{{s-ttl|title = NEC Personal Computers }}\n{{s-aft|after = }}\n{{end}}\n\n[[Category:NEC personal computers|PC-9801]]\n[[Category:8086-based home computers]]\n[[Category:Home video game consoles]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1982]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in Japan]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "ccomputer->computer -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-9800_series"}

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]]. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on A&E between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\nConvicted killer [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]], vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed.\n\nNorman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]).\n\nOne of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel.\n\nNorman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in.\n\nBelieving the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police.\n\nMary eventually finds Norman in the attic. The sheriff questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder.\n\nMary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother.\n\nMary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar.\n\nWhile removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar. Meanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk.\n\nRealizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house.\n\nA stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police.\n\nThe sheriff inaccurately believes Mary committed all the murders. That evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner.\n\nNorman gives her a cup of tea. Ms. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Ms. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel.\n\nNorman is now completely insane again. He carries Ms. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nThe film begins with Maureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his \"true\" mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician in his 20s desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles Marion Crane ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase Norman freaks out and leaves the diner.\n\nAfter the conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red (''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'''s [[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship.\n\nThe same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the [[Psycho (1960 film)|original]]) gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\". At that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\"\n\nShe discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nIn 1987, [[NBC]] released a [[television film]] spin-off entitled ''Bates Motel''. The film follows Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]), a man who roomed with [[Norman Bates]] at the state lunatic asylum for nearly 20 years. After the death of Bates, Alex finds that he is in Norman's will as the inheritor of the Bates Motel, which has been vacant since the time of Norman's arrest. Alex travels to Fairville, California and with a little help from a teenage runaway named Willie ([[Lori Petty]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, only to have strange things happen. Is someone trying to drive him away, or is the motel really haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother?\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950 Norman's mother, Norma Bates ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to stab her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]]. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on A&E between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\nConvicted killer [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]], vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed.\n\nNorman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]).\n\nOne of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel.\n\nNorman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in.\n\nBelieving the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police.\n\nMary eventually finds Norman in the attic. The sheriff questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder.\n\nMary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother.\n\nMary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar.\n\nWhile removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar. Meanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk.\n\nRealizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house.\n\nA stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police.\n\nThe sheriff inaccurately believes Mary committed all the murders. That evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner.\n\nNorman gives her a cup of tea. Ms. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Ms. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel.\n\nNorman is now completely insane again. He carries Ms. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nThe film begins with Maureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his \"true\" mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician in his 20s desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles Marion Crane ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase Norman freaks out and leaves the diner.\n\nAfter the conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red (''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'''s [[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship.\n\nThe same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the [[Psycho (1960 film)|original]]) gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\". At that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\"\n\nShe discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nIn 1987, [[NBC]] released a [[television film]] spin-off entitled ''Bates Motel''. The film follows Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]), a man who roomed with [[Norman Bates]] at the state lunatic asylum for nearly 20 years. After the death of Bates, Alex finds that he is in Norman's will as the inheritor of the Bates Motel, which has been vacant since the time of Norman's arrest. Alex travels to Fairville, California and with a little help from a teenage runaway named Willie ([[Lori Petty]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, only to have strange things happen. Is someone trying to drive him away, or is the motel really haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother?\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950 Norman's mother, Norma Bates ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to stab her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes.

He was an [[asceticism|ascetic]] and [[celibacy|celibate]], and was almost definitely a [[Members of the Covenant|son of the covenant]] (an early Syriac form of communal [[monasticism]]). He may have been a [[bishop]], and later Syriac tradition places him at the head of [[Mar Mattai monastery]] near [[Mosul]] in what is now [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].{{sfn|McLean|1911|p=165}} He was a near contemporary to the slightly younger [[Ephrem the Syrian]], but the latter lived within the sphere of the [[Roman Empire]]. Called the ''Persian Sage'' ({{lang-syr|\u071a\u071f\u071d\u0721\u0710 \u0726\u072a\u0723\u071d\u0710}}, ''\u1e24akkim\u0101 P\u0101rs\u0101y\u0101''), Aphrahat witnesses to the concerns of the early church beyond the eastern boundaries of the Roman Empire.\n\n==Life, history and identity==\nAphrahat was born in current Iran during the rule of emperor [[Shapur II]] on the border with [[Roman Syria]] around 280.<ref name=Dukhrana>[http://dukhrana.in/aphrahat-the-persian-sage/ Kalariparampil, Joseph. \"Aphrahat the Persian Sage\", ''Dukhrana'', August 1, 2014]</ref>\nThe name Aphrahat is the Syriac version of the Persian name ''Frah\u0101t'', which is the modern Persian ''Farh\u0101d'' ({{lang|fa|\u0641\u0631\u0647\u0627\u062f}}). The author, who was known as \"the Persian sage\", may have come from a [[paganism|pagan]] family and been himself a convert from paganism, though this appears to be later speculation. However, he tells us that he took the Christian name Jacob at his [[baptism]], and is so entitled in the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] to a manuscript of 512 which contains twelve of his homilies. Hence he was already confused with [[Jacob of Nisibis]],<ref name=ccel>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf213.iii.iii.iii.html Schaff, Philip. \"Aphrahat\", ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', Vol. XIII, T&T Clark, Edinburgh]</ref> by the time of [[Gennadius of Massilia]] (before 496), and the ancient [[Armenian language|Armenian]] version of nineteen of The Demonstrations has been published under this latter name. Thorough study of the ''Demonstrations'' makes identification with Jacob of Nisibis impossible. Aphrahat, being a Persian subject, cannot have lived at Nisibis, which became Persian only by [[Jovian (emperor)|Emperor Jovian]]'s treaty of 363.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFurthermore, Jacob of Nisibis, who attended the [[First Council of Nicaea]], died in 338, and from the internal evidence of Aphrahat's works he must have witnessed the beginning of the [[persecution of Christians]] in the early 340s by Shapur II. The persecutions arose out of political tensions between Rome and Persia, particularly the declaration of [[Constantine the Great]] that Rome should be a Christian empire. Shapur perhaps grew anxious that the largely Syriac and Armenian Christians within his Empire might secretly support Rome. There are elements in Aphrahat's writing that show great pastoral concern for his harried flock, caught in the midst of all this turmoil.\n\nIt is understood that his name was Aphrahat from comparatively late writers, such as [[Bar Bahlul]] (10th century), Elias of Nisibis (11th), [[Bar Hebraeus]] and [[Abdisho]]. He appears to have been quite prominent in the Christian Church of the Persian Empire during the first half of the fourth century.<ref>Pierre, M.-J., \"Aphraate le sage persan: Les Expos\u00e9s\", ''Source Chr\u00e9tiennes'' 349 (Paris:1988)</ref> George, bishop of the Arabs, writing in  714 to a friend who had sent him a series of questions about the \"Persian sage\", confesses ignorance of his name, home and rank, but gathers from his works that he was a monk, and of high esteem in the clergy. The fact that in 344 he was selected to draw up a circular letter from a council of bishops and other clergy to the churches of [[Ctesiphon]] and [[Seleucia]]<ref name=ccel/> and elsewhere (later to become Demonstration 14) is held by [[William Wright (orientalist)|William Wright]] and others to prove that he was a bishop. According to a marginal note in a 14th-century manuscript (B.M. Orient. 1017), he was \"bishop of Mar Mattai,\" a famous monastery near Mosul, but it is unlikely that this institution existed so early.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==About \"The Demonstrations\"==\nAphrahat's works are collectively called the ''Demonstrations'', from the identical first word in each of their titles ({{lang-syr|\u072c\u071a\u0718\u071d\u072c\u0710}}, ta\u1e25w\u00ee\u1e6f\u00e2). They are sometimes also known as \"the homilies\". There are twenty-three ''Demonstrations'' in all.<ref name=Dukhrana/> Each work deals with a different item of faith or practice, and is a pastoral [[homily]] or exposition. According to [[Francis Crawford Burkitt]], they are intended to form \"a full and ordered exposition of the Christian faith.\" The standpoint is that of the Syriac-speaking church, before it was touched by the [[Arian controversy]]. Beginning with faith as the foundation, the writer proceeds to build up the structure of doctrine and duty.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe ''Demonstrations'' are works of prose, but frequently, Aphrahat employs a poetic rhythm and imagery to his writing. Each of the first twenty-two ''Demonstrations'' begins with each successive letter of the [[Syriac alphabet]] (of which there are twenty-two). The ''Demonstrations'' were not composed all at one time, but in three distinct periods. The first ten, composed in 337, concern themselves with Christian life and church order, and predate the persecutions. ''Demonstrations'' 11\u201322 were composed at the height of the persecution, in 344. Some of this group deal with matters as before, others focus on [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] themes. However, four ''Demonstrations'' are concerned with [[Judaism]]. It appears that there was a movement within the Persian church by some either to become Jews or return to Judaism, or to incorporate Jewish elements into Christianity. Aphrahat makes his stand by explaining the meaning of the symbols of [[circumcision]], [[Passover]] and [[Shabbat]]. The twenty-third ''Demonstration'' falls outside of the alphabetic system of the early works, and appears to be slightly later, perhaps near the end of Aphrahat's life. The twenty-third piece takes the symbolism of the grape, drawn from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] chapter 65 and elsewhere, as its cue. It deals with the fulfilment of Messianic promise from [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] to Christ.<ref name=ccel/> Aphrahat never strays too far from the [[Bible]] in the ''Demonstrations'': he is not given to philosophizing. All of his [[gospel]] quotations seem to be drawn from the ''[[Diatessaron]]'', the gospel harmony that served the church at his time. Aphrahat's mode of [[exegesis|biblical interpretation]] is strikingly similar to that of the [[Babylon]]ian [[rabbi]]nic academies of his day. His position within the church is indicated in ''Demonstration'' 14, in which Aphrahat appears to be writing a letter on behalf of his [[synod]] to the [[clergy]] of the Persian capital, [[Ctesiphon]]-[[Seleucia on the Tigris]].\n\nIn ''Demonstrations 5'', Aphrahat, dealt with eschatology.  Concerning the beasts of [[Daniel 7]], he identified the first beast as [[Babylon]]; the second, [[Achaemenid Empire|Media and Persia]]; the third, [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian empire]].   The four heads of the leopard were the four successors of Alexander.   The fourth beast appeared to include both the Macedonian successors of Alexander and the Roman emperors.  Its horns he applied to the Seleucid kings down to [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus]], whom he identified as the Little Horn.   He reduced the ''time, times, and half a time'' to ''one and one-half times'', in order to fit the ten and a half years of Antiochus' persecution of the Jews.  Aphrahat also mentioned the Persian ram and the Grecian he-goat of [[Daniel 8]].{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=403-404}}\n\nIn ''Demonstrations 8'', Aphrahat stated that the Kingdom of Christ would not be established until the [[Second Coming|Second Advent]] at which time there would occur a [[Resurrection#Christianity|literal resurrection]] of the righteous dead.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=402}}\n\n==Translations==\nThe ''Demonstrations'' were originally composed in the [[Syriac language]], but were quickly translated into other languages. The [[Armenian language|Armenian]] version, published by Antonelli in 1756 and containing only 19 homilies, circulated mistakenly under the name ''Jacob of Nisibis''. Important versions in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] exist. A few of the ''Demonstrations'' were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but wrongly attributed to [[Ephrem the Syrian]].\n\n==Order and subjects of The Demonstrations==\n#''Demonstration on faith'' \u2014 ''Demonstrations'' 1\u201310 were probably written 336\u20137\n#''Demonstration on charity''\n#''Demonstration on fasting''\n#''Demonstration on prayer''\n#''Demonstration on wars''\n#''Demonstration on [[members of the covenant]]''\n#''Demonstration on penitents''\n#''Demonstration on resurrection''\n#''Demonstration on humility''\n#''Demonstration on pastors''\n#''Demonstration on [[circumcision]]'' \u2014 ''Demonstrations'' 11\u201322 were probably written 344\n#''Demonstration on the [[Passover]]''\n#''Demonstration on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]''\n#''Demonstration on preaching''\n#''Demonstration on various foods''\n#''Demonstration on the call of the Gentiles''\n#''Demonstration on Jesus the Messiah''\n#''Demonstration on virginity''\n#''Demonstration on the dispersion of Israel''\n#''Demonstration on almsgiving''\n#''Demonstration on persecution''\n#''Demonstration on death and the last days''\n#''Demonstration concerning the grape'' \u2014 ''Demonstration'' 23 was probably written in the winter of 344\u20135\n<!--==Faith==\nThe homilies of Aphraates are intended to form, as Professor Burkitt has shown, \"a full and ordered exposition of the Christian faith.\" The standpoint is that of the Syriac-speaking church, before it was touched by the [[Arianism|Arian]] controversy. Beginning with faith as the foundation, the writer proceeds to build up the Structure of doctrine and duty. The first ten homilies, which form one division completed in 337, are without polemical reference; their subjects are faith, love, fasting, prayer, wars (a somewhat mysterious setting forth of the conflict between Rome and Persia under the imagery of [[Daniel]]), the sons of the covenant (monks or ascetics), penitents, the resurrection, humility, pastors.  Those numbered 11-22, written in 344, are almost all directed against the [[Jew]]s; the subjects are [[circumcision]], [[passover]], the [[Shabbat]], persuasion (the encyclical letter referred to above), distinction of meats, the substitution of the [[Gentiles]] for the Jews, that Christ is the Son of God, virginity and holiness, whether the Jews have been finally rejected or are yet to be restored, provision for the poor, persecution, death and the last times.  The 23rd homily, on the \"grape kernel\" (Is. lxv. 8), written in 344, forms an appendix on the Messianic fulfilment of prophecy, together with a treatment of the chronology from Adam to Christ.\n\nAphraates impresses a reader favourably by his moral earnestness, his guilelessness, his moderation in controversy, the simplicity of his style and language, his saturation with the ideas and words of Scripture. On the other hand, he is full of cumbrous repetition, he lacks precision in argument and is prone to digression, his quotations from Scripture are often inappropriate, and he is greatly influenced by Jewish exegesis. He is particularly fond of arguments about numbers. How wholly he and his surroundings were untouched by the Arian conflict may be judged from the 17th homily -- \"that Christ is the Son of God.\" He argues that, as the name \"God\" or \"Son of God\" was given in the [[Old Testament]] to men who were worthy, and as God does not withhold from men a share in His attributes--such as sovereignty and fatherhood--it was fitting that Christ who has wrought salvation for humanity should obtain this highest name.\n\nFrom the frequency of his quotations, Aphraates is a specially important witness to the form in which the Gospels were read in the Syriac church in his day; Zahn and others have shown that he -- mainly at least -- used the ''[[Diatessaron]]''. Finally, he bears important contemporary witness to the sufferings of the Christian church in Persia under Sapor (Shapur) II as well as the moral evils which had infected the church, to the sympathy of Persian Christians with the cause of the [[Roman Empire]], to the condition of early monastic institutions, to the practice of the Syriac church in regard to Easter, etc.-->\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n=== References noted in {{harvnb|McLean|1911}} ===\n* Editions by [[William Wright (Orientalist)|W.

He was an [[asceticism|ascetic]] and [[celibacy|celibate]], and was almost definitely a [[Members of the Covenant|son of the covenant]] (an early Syriac form of communal [[monasticism]]). He may have been a [[bishop]], and later Syriac tradition places him at the head of [[Mar Mattai monastery]] near [[Mosul]] in what is now [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].{{sfn|McLean|1911|p=165}} He was a near contemporary to the slightly younger [[Ephrem the Syrian]], but the latter lived within the sphere of the [[Roman Empire]]. Called the ''Persian Sage'' ({{lang-syr|\u071a\u071f\u071d\u0721\u0710 \u0726\u072a\u0723\u071d\u0710}}, ''\u1e24akkim\u0101 P\u0101rs\u0101y\u0101''), Aphrahat witnesses to the concerns of the early church beyond the eastern boundaries of the Roman Empire.\n\n==Life, history and identity==\nAphrahat was born in ccurrent Iran during the rule of emperor [[Shapur II]] on the border with [[Roman Syria]] around 280.<ref name=Dukhrana>[http://dukhrana.in/aphrahat-the-persian-sage/ Kalariparampil, Joseph. \"Aphrahat the Persian Sage\", ''Dukhrana'', August 1, 2014]</ref>\nThe name Aphrahat is the Syriac version of the Persian name ''Frah\u0101t'', which is the modern Persian ''Farh\u0101d'' ({{lang|fa|\u0641\u0631\u0647\u0627\u062f}}). The author, who was known as \"the Persian sage\", may have come from a [[paganism|pagan]] family and been himself a convert from paganism, though this appears to be later speculation. However, he tells us that he took the Christian name Jacob at his [[baptism]], and is so entitled in the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] to a manuscript of 512 which contains twelve of his homilies. Hence he was already confused with [[Jacob of Nisibis]],<ref name=ccel>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf213.iii.iii.iii.html Schaff, Philip. \"Aphrahat\", ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', Vol. XIII, T&T Clark, Edinburgh]</ref> by the time of [[Gennadius of Massilia]] (before 496), and the ancient [[Armenian language|Armenian]] version of nineteen of The Demonstrations has been published under this latter name. Thorough study of the ''Demonstrations'' makes identification with Jacob of Nisibis impossible. Aphrahat, being a Persian subject, cannot have lived at Nisibis, which became Persian only by [[Jovian (emperor)|Emperor Jovian]]'s treaty of 363.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFurthermore, Jacob of Nisibis, who attended the [[First Council of Nicaea]], died in 338, and from the internal evidence of Aphrahat's works he must have witnessed the beginning of the [[persecution of Christians]] in the early 340s by Shapur II. The persecutions arose out of political tensions between Rome and Persia, particularly the declaration of [[Constantine the Great]] that Rome should be a Christian empire. Shapur perhaps grew anxious that the largely Syriac and Armenian Christians within his Empire might secretly support Rome. There are elements in Aphrahat's writing that show great pastoral concern for his harried flock, caught in the midst of all this turmoil.\n\nIt is understood that his name was Aphrahat from comparatively late writers, such as [[Bar Bahlul]] (10th century), Elias of Nisibis (11th), [[Bar Hebraeus]] and [[Abdisho]].
