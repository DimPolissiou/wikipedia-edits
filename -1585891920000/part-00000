He has said that \"We don't set off our immune system early on, we are too clean. In the former East Germany for instance, with very poor work and housing conditions, people were less allergic.\"<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Pollen count===\n\nFrankland was keen to provide patients he saw in London with information about pollens, such as the levels of pollen on any given day, and the times of year when levels would tend to be at their highest. St. Mary's Hospital employed a botanist to assist with collecting this information, and to complement the work on pollen counts already being measured in [[Cardiff]]. Weekly London pollen counts were sent to members of the British Allergy Society from 1953 and shared publicly, via ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', from 1963.<ref name=Hekint>{{cite web| url= https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/| title= Grandfather of allergy: Dr. Bill Frankland, the ardent centenarian| last=Turner| first=John| publisher=Hektoen International| date=Spring 2019| accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Self-experimentation===\n\nHe was also a supporter of the idea of [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitisation]], a technique which aims to reduce the level of immune response to allergens by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]''. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects which Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to venom-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as an assistant to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland has said that he cannot recall a patient ever being discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.nhs.uk/about-us/blog/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-william-frankland-pollen-count-alexander-fleming-70-years-nhs |title=Grandfather of allergy, Dr William Frankland, aged 106, on popularising the pollen count, working with Alexander Fleming and spending 70 years in the NHS |publisher=[[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]] |date=5 July 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Frankland and Fleming were also concerned with [[antimicrobial resistance]] to penicillin, with Frankland crediting Fleming with saying that careless prescription would inadvertently lead to \"the death of man.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://healthwnews.com/health-news/discoverer-of-penicillin-foresaw-the-threat-of-antibiotic-resistance/ |title=Discoverer of penicillin foresaw the threat of antibiotic resistance |date=3 December 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020 |website=HealthWNews.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Frankland published \"Prophylaxis of summer Hay-fever and Asthma.\" The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankland|first1=A.

Contacted to visit a VIP in Baghdad having trouble with asthma, Frankland advised Hussein this was not the case and to give up his habit of 40 cigarettes a day. Frankland has said \"To my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn\u2019t be head of state. I heard some time later that he had had a disagreement with his secretary of state for health, so he took him outside and shot him.

He worked at Guy's on this basis for another twenty years on peanut [[anaphylaxis]] and [[Pediatrics|paediatric]] allergies. After retiring from Guy's he continued to participate in academic life by attending conferences and publishing articles in journals.<ref name=Lane/>\n\nIn February 2012, Frankland appeared as an expert witness in a British court. The accused had claimed that a vehicle crash in which he was involved was caused by his losing control following a [[bee sting]]. Although Frankland agreed with the defence that such a scenario was possible, he gave an opinion that delayed-response reactions to bee stings only occurred after there had been initial symptoms following the sting. In this case there had not been such symptoms, and the accused was found guilty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/worlds-oldest-expert-witness-william-frankland/story-fnb64oi6-1226283231827|title=World's oldest expert witness William Frankland|work=The Australian|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he appeared in an episode of the [[BBC 2]] TV series ''Britain's Greatest Generation'' and as a guest on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=David|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dmdnpp/britains-greatest-generation--series-1---3-the-fight-for-freedom|title=Britain's Greatest Generation: Series 1 \u2013 3.

Weekly London pollen counts were sent to members of the British Allergy Society from 1953 and shared publicly, via ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', from 1963.<ref name=Hekint>{{cite web| url= https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/| title= Grandfather of allergy: Dr. Bill Frankland, the ardent centenarian| last=Turner| first=John| publisher=Hektoen International| date=Spring 2019| accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Self-experimentation===\n\nHe was also a supporter of the idea of [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitisation]], a technique which aims to reduce the level of immune response to allergens by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]''. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects which Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to venom-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as an assistant to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland has said that he cannot recall a patient ever being discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.nhs.uk/about-us/blog/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-william-frankland-pollen-count-alexander-fleming-70-years-nhs |title=Grandfather of allergy, Dr William Frankland, aged 106, on popularising the pollen count, working with Alexander Fleming and spending 70 years in the NHS |publisher=[[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]] |date=5 July 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Frankland and Fleming were also concerned with [[antimicrobial resistance]] to penicillin, with Frankland crediting Fleming with saying that careless prescription would inadvertently lead to \"the death of man.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://healthwnews.com/health-news/discoverer-of-penicillin-foresaw-the-threat-of-antibiotic-resistance/ |title=Discoverer of penicillin foresaw the threat of antibiotic resistance |date=3 December 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020 |website=HealthWNews.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Frankland published \"Prophylaxis of summer Hay-fever and Asthma.\" The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankland|first1=A.

Contacted to visit a VIP in Baghdad having trouble with asthma, Frankland advised Hussein this was not the case and to give up his habit of 40 cigarettes a day. Frankland has said \"To my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn\u2019t be head of state. I heard some time later that he had had a disagreement with his secretary of state for health, so he took him outside and shot him.

He worked at Guy's on this basis for another twenty years on peanut [[anaphylaxis]] and [[Pediatrics|paediatric]] allergies. After retiring from Guy's he continued to participate in academic life by attending conferences and publishing articles in journals.<ref name=Lane/>\n\nIn February 2012, Frankland appeared as an expert witness in a British court. The accused had claimed that a vehicle crash in which he was involved was caused by his losing control following a [[bee sting]]. Although Frankland agreed with the defence that such a scenario was possible, he gave an opinion that delayed-response reactions to bee stings only occurred after there had been initial symptoms following the sting. In this case there had not been such symptoms, and the accused was found guilty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/worlds-oldest-expert-witness-william-frankland/story-fnb64oi6-1226283231827|title=World's oldest expert witness William Frankland|work=The Australian|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he appeared in an episode of the [[BBC 2]] TV series ''Britain's Greatest Generation'' and as a guest on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=David|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dmdnpp/britains-greatest-generation--series-1---3-the-fight-for-freedom|title=Britain's Greatest Generation: Series 1 \u2013 3.

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Littleton, Cynthia|title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos''|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=May 20, 1996|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"contestrules\">https://www.afv.com/contest-rules</ref> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues.

However, since the 2012\u201313 season, videos shot in 4:3 standard definition began to be [[pillarbox]]ed (particularly videos that are recorded on mobile devices that are shot at a vertical angle that would not even fit the 4:3 [[safe area (television)|safe area]] of many television sets entirely; since the conversion to HD, the series has featured advisories to viewers to tilt their mobile devices horizontally to when recording in order for their videos to fit 16:9 screens). In 2014, all episodes of the show that were originally produced and aired in standard definition before both the season 21 premiere and the show's initial conversion to HD capability simultaneously in 2010 and/or already airing in rerun syndication for almost over a decade or more (and still are) got stretched vertically downward with slightly re-edited graphics due to widescreen and HD broadcast capability and signals on more broadcast television stations (and cable) networks, ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary, Tom Bergeron's 15th and final year as host of the show, and Alfonso Ribiero's entrance as the current host in season 26 that also included an almost-brand-new set, new version of the theme song, new graphics, and new logo among other things; while the funny video clips recorded with the use of camcorders before 2009 or the years preceding the invention of today's mobile devices such as the iPhone or iPad (and especially the videos that were aired on episodes in the Bob Saget, John Fugelsang, Daisy Fuentes, and the early Tom Bergeron eras of ''AFV'') continued (and still continue in the Alfonso Ribiero run of ''AFV'') to be stretched horizontally to this day. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), AFV (and ABC) aired reruns of throwback classic (and until the season 30 finale - aired on Sunday, May 17, 2020 - comprised of tapings from the year 2020 done before COVID-19 related mandated social distancing and ban on large gatherings and in-studio audiences temporarily went into effect; then-unaired) episodes due in part to AFV's 30th anniversary and television production being halted by the virus.\n\n==History==\n===1989\u20131997: Bob Saget===\nThe show debuted on November 26, 1989 as an hour-long special,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Moran | first = James | title = There's No Place Like Home Video | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-8166-3800-4 | postscript = <!--None--> | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780816638017_0 }}</ref> produced by Vin Di Bona and Steve Paskay, with actor/comedian [[Bob Saget]] (then starring in the ABC sitcom ''[[Full House]]'') as its host.

Besides hosting the series, Saget also served as a member of its writing staff, alongside Todd Thicke and Bob Arnott. The success of ''AFHV'' led to a spinoff called ''[[America's Funniest People]],'' hosted by Saget's ''Full House'' co-star [[Dave Coulier]] (and co-hosted by actress/producer [[Arleen Sorkin]] for the first two seasons, then model [[Tawny Kitaen]] for the final two), focusing on videos featuring people ''intentionally'' trying to be funny by doing celebrity impressions, committing pranks, and performing short amateur comedy routines, among other things.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120305/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Ernest Tucker|title='Video' host rewinds pal's format|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=June 3, 1990|access-date=March 8, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> During the show's first four seasons, ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' aired on Sunday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120321/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=John Carmody|title=The TV Column|website=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 6, 1989|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> beginning with the fifth season, the show started the Sunday primetime lineup on ABC, airing at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., followed by ''America's Funniest People'' at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. as part of an hour-long block of funny home videos.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC153DF932A25756C0A965958260|author=Bill Carter|title=Coming Next: New ABC Prime Time|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 1993}}</ref> Saget always ended each episode with the phrase \"Keep those cameras safely rolling\" and saying something to his wife who was (implied to be) watching the show. Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season. In 1994, ABC canceled ''America's Funniest People'' after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with its Sunday night 7:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

During this period, the show introduced a segment called \"Bad News, Good News,\" which shows a video of an accident; then one of the hosts makes a humorous statement about the upside of what happened. This segment continued to appear occasionally until the fourth year of Bergeron's stint as host. Another notable segment was the \"AFV Hall of Fame,\" in which a clip is shown and Fugelsang reveals the moment of impact (a screen that shows a still picture of that clip) that occurred in it. This segment was scrapped at the end of season ten. Another featured segment was \"Who Would You Like to See...\" in which a random person is asked which celebrity they would like to see involved in a random humorous mishap, with a photo of a celebrity's face posterized over the face of the actual person in the video.

Retrieved March 6, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> On July 20, 2001, the show returned in its third format, this time with Bergeron, who was also hosting [[Hollywood Squares]] at the time. The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008-09 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018.

Bergeron's final new episode from his in-studio stage home of 15 years (which was really his second to final episode) aired on May 10, 2015 (and for the final time in rerun form on September 13, 2015) and was the final (and season 25's second) $100,000 show of his tenure and featured at different times of the episode a look back at classic and modern funny home videos that defined the show's then-25-year run. Bergeron's \"real\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after 15 seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode-- taped on-location at [[Disneyland]] for that season's edition of the annual \"Grand Prize Spectacular,\" ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], or in earlier seasons, an [[Adventures by Disney]] vacation package)-- featured an [[auto-tune]]d montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] following the grand prize presentation on a golf cart driven by Saget in a special [[cameo appearance]]. ABC aired encores of this episode on two different occasions-- the first on July 19, 2015, to coincide with Disneyland's official 60th birthday on the weekend of July 17, 2015 (the actual 60th anniversary of Disneyland's grand-opening on July 17, 1955) and the second on September 20, 2015, as the network's final episode airing, new or rerun, of ''AFV'' with Saget and Bergeron signing off for the final time.

Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC.

For the start of the season on October 8, 2017, instead of leading off Sunday nights, it aired Sunday nights at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT and was led into at the start of the season by ''[[The Toy Box]].''

''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019. ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 29th season on March 13, 2018, which premiered at its regular 7/6 central Sunday night timeslot (and was the lead-off starting on October 7, 2018 to ''Dancing With The Stars Juniors'') on September 30, 2018.\n\n==$100,000 contest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd|title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14-22, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other.

In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the PAX airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6-8 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2004 to October 2007 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6-8) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94-97 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form. The 2003-2015 Bergeron episodes began airing on [[BiteTV|Bite]] on August 28, 2014 and stopped airing on June 5, 2015.\n\n==Seasons==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Littleton, Cynthia|title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos''|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=May 20, 1996|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"contestrules\">https://www.afv.com/contest-rules</ref> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues.

Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season. In 1994, ABC canceled ''America's Funniest People'' after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with its Sunday night 7:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

These specials (except for the special sports edition) were not taped in front of a live studio audience, with pre-recorded applause and laugh tracks were used during commercial bumpers and just before, during, and after video packages being used instead.\n\n===2001\u20132015: Tom Bergeron===\nIn October 2000, ABC announced its decision to return ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' as a regular weekly series, ordering 13 new episodes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120630/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4571525.html \"America's Funniest' to return\"], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', October 27, 2000. Retrieved March 6, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> On July 20, 2001, the show returned in its third format, this time with Bergeron, who was also hosting [[Hollywood Squares]] at the time. The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008-09 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018. While only four or more of the Bergeron-era segments (\"Vs.,\" \"The Dog/Cat Park,\" \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Moment With...\" to say the least) and a few interactive games continue to be shown on Ribiero's ''AFV'' at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Bergeron hosted the show include: \n*\"Vs.\" (featuring compilations of two sets of related videos, in which the \"winner\" of the two is revealed at the end, followed by a fictional \"preview\" of the videos in which the winner is claimed to face in the next segment)\n*\"A Moment of EWWWWW!\" (featuring a video that focuses on something gross such as mucus hanging from a person's nose after sneezing)\n*\"The Dog/Cat Park\" (a compilation of animal videos featuring dogs or cats that is named accordingly to the animals featured)\n*\"AFV Family of the Week\" (featuring funny videos of adults and children, the \"family\" featured are actually people of no familial relation)\n*\"Nincompoop Corner\" (a compilation of videos of people getting into situations that humorously showcase a lack of good judgement)\n*\"AFV Dictionary\" (featuring a humorous dictionary definition made to apply to the video being shown)\n*\"Name that Sound\" (which features audio of an unusual sound, followed by a clip of the video which the sound came from that usually reveals a person or animal making the noise)\n*\"Pick the Real Video\" (a multiple-choice game in which audience members are asked to choose which video is the one that will be shown)\n*\"What's Behind the Blue Blob,\" \"Kid, Cat, or Canine\" (both are games which audience members are asked to guess the person, animal or object featured in the video that is then revealed)\n*\"The Naughty File\" (featuring a video incorporating inappropriate behavior such as a child urinating at a family gathering)\n*\"A Moment With...\" (An out of the ordinary video is shown for a few seconds)\n*\"What's with the French?\"\n*\"AFV Pop Quiz\" (a multiple-choice game leading into and out of a commercial break in which viewers are asked to guess what occurs next in the video)\n*\"The AFV $10,000 Club\" (an early segment in which a home video that already won $10,000 in a previous show was showcased) \n*''Mysterious Mysteries of Mystery'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a video with mysterious things happening like balloons replacing faces, in news headline form)\n*''On This Day in AFV History'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a very old video, with a date, which Tom says that date, for example, a video from October 10, 1987, features a kid petting a pig, which bites him in the crotch)\n*\"A Salute To... \" (a segment that salutes specifically themed clips)\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail. Except for reruns of episodes from seasons 21 and 22 that referenced uploading to ABC.com, the re-edited season 11\u201320 episodes that used to originally reference ABC.com on the unaltered versions of the episodes reference uploading to AFV.com. \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Salute To...\" were discontinued after season 29; the completion of Alfonso Ribiero's first four years as AFV host.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-174845414.html \"America's Funniest Videos Takes Submission Via Internet\"]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, [[PR Newswire]], February 15, 2008.

In the final six seasons of Bergeron's run as host, the show started its \"Funny Since 1989\" campaign in 2009 and had two anniversary seasons. Season 20, in 2009, had a special 20th anniversary episode that aired on November 29, with Saget returning to ''AFV'' for the first time in 12 years as a guest. Both Saget and Bergeron ended that episode with a pinata party skit and a nod to the Star Wars lightsaber fight scenes when the credits started rolling.

Bergeron's final new episode from his in-studio stage home of 15 years (which was really his second to final episode) aired on May 10, 2015 (and for the final time in rerun form on September 13, 2015) and was the final (and season 25's second) $100,000 show of his tenure and featured at different times of the episode a look back at classic and modern funny home videos that defined the show's then-25-year run. Bergeron's \"real\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after 15 seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode-- taped on-location at [[Disneyland]] for that season's edition of the annual \"Grand Prize Spectacular,\" ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], or in earlier seasons, an [[Adventures by Disney]] vacation package)-- featured an [[auto-tune]]d montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] following the grand prize presentation on a golf cart driven by Saget in a special [[cameo appearance]]. ABC aired encores of this episode on two different occasions-- the first on July 19, 2015, to coincide with Disneyland's official 60th birthday on the weekend of July 17, 2015 (the actual 60th anniversary of Disneyland's grand-opening on July 17, 1955) and the second on September 20, 2015, as the network's final episode airing, new or rerun, of ''AFV'' with Saget and Bergeron signing off for the final time. Bergeron made his first guest appearance in the studio on the season 26 \"Grand Prize Spectacular\" finale of Ribiero's ''AFV'' on May 22, 2016 and played the show's final on-air audience participation game \"Who Breaks It?\" and won an Ribiero ''AFV'' pillow and socks. Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV>{{cite web|title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos'|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html|author=Nick Venable|website=Cinema Blend|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC. In season 30, a temporary \"Throwback 30\" version of this segment debuted in ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary season that takes you to clips from specific years-- all clips from, let's say 1989-- similar to the \"On This Day In AFV History\" segment from Bergeron's ''AFV'' run, but with more clips and not just one)\n*\"Hey Alfonso!\" (segment not \"officially\" named until season 30 that since season 26 features kids and adults in videos asking Alfonso to show them and the viewers specifically themed clips-- Dogs, slow-mo, the like)\n*\"This One Time On AFV\" (clips shown with a [[Mother Goose]] or fairy tale storytelling skit)\n*\"Alfonso's Flubs\" (blooper clips of Ribeiro in the studio trying to get his monologue lines right)\n*\"Alfonso's Rhyme Time\" (Ribeiro comes up with rhyming words in his clip narration that relate to the funny subject matter of the clip)\n*\"I Think I See The Problem\" (a segment featuring clips of people looking for one way to solve a problem, but unintentionally discover another way household problems can be solved through funny fails)\n*\"#NotTrending\" (clips of attempted trends and fads by ordinary people never thought of that could catch on later, but haven't or don't look like they could trend or catch on soon on social media-- ''AFV'' is a start for them)\n*\"Maybe It's Not Your Thing\" (clips of people trying to do things and finally fail at doing that not be their thing)\n*\"Alfonso's Advice\" (Ribeiro giving advice to the viewer on how to avoid a fail as clips show people failing to follow the advice)\n*\"Video Symphony\" (Clips featuring sound effects in ''AFV''{{'}}s version of a musical symphony)\n*\"What The Fluff\" (Clips featuring people disappearing or sometimes attempting and failing to disappear \"magically\" behind towels by running; to the amazement and/or despair of kids and/or animals)\n*\"Bad Places To Sit\" (Clips featuring people sitting in bad chairs and calling down or animals sitting in strange, bad locations)\n*\"Something To Brighten Your Day\" (Clips to make you laugh and brighten your day after a bad day)\n*\"The Problem Then/Now\" (featuring clips from, let's say, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2004 likely representing the \"Then\" and clips from 2017, 2019 and 2020 representing the \"Now\" while the \"Now's\" will eventually become \"Then's\" as the clips and episode become classics and reruns in their own right in the upcoming decades)\n*\"Horrible Headlines\" (''AFV''{{'}}s funny version of \"Fake News\" featuring horribly non-newsworthy funny-- or scary-- clips)\n*\"Catastrophe Countdown\" (Featuring clips of people who hopefully will avert catastrophe in 3, 2, 1 and catastrophe happens)\n*\"Here's Why\" (Showing viewers why people shouldn't do things the way they do them or get things where they shouldn't get them)\nBeginning with the 2018-19 season, Ribeiro nearly ended each week's episode with the phrase \"Good night, everybody and remember, send your video to us (or 'me' referring to Ribeiro), get yourself on TV\" after three (and including the final seven years of the Bergeron-era, 10) years of saying \"Upload to us.

''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019.

This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009.

The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14-22, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html McClellan, Steve. \"MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\"], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', October 3, 1994. Retrieved March 7, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1-5 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6-8 (1994-97). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1-5 aired on [[Ion Televison (American TV channel)|PAX]] from 2003 to 2005, [[Nick at Nite]] from April to October 2007 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2011. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the PAX airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6-8 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2004 to October 2007 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6-8) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94-97 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form. The 2003-2015 Bergeron episodes began airing on [[BiteTV|Bite]] on August 28, 2014 and stopped airing on June 5, 2015.\n\n==Seasons==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

She was born in Nashik (Maharashtra) and was known as the \"Resident Sister\" of Bollywood.<ref>[http://cineplot.com/nazima-profile-filmography/ Nazima - Profile and Filmography on Cineplot]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nNazima was born as Mehr-un-Nisa on 25 March 1946 in [[Nasik]]. She was related to actresses Sharifa Bai (of 1930s) and Husn Bano (of 1940s) who happened to be her grandmother and aunt respectively. She was admitted to a high school in [[Mumbai]] (then Bombay) and being from a filmy background, she was soon cast as a child artist by the name '''Baby Chand''' in her early films.<ref name=\"The Magnificient Nazima\"/>\n\n==Career==\nNazima started her career as a child artist in 1954 with ''[[Biraj Bahu]]''. By 1958, she made her debut as a heroine in stunt film ''Princess Saaba''. She went into mainstream cinema in 1961 with ''Umar Qaid'' which was directed by filmmaker Aspi Irani who was also her uncle. Then came ''Ziddi'' (1964) directed by Pramod Chakravarty, a hit. There was then ''Arzoo'' (1965) produced and directed by Ramanand Sagar, a silver jubilee runner. She won the best supporting actress award for the acting in Arzoo from the Bengal Film Journalists\u2019 Association. Then came ''April Fool'' (1964) directed by Subodh Mukerjee which was appreciated by millions. She then acted in J. Om Prakash's ''Aye Din Bahar Ke'' (1968), which celebrated silver jubilee at many places. She also acted in Gemini's ''Aurat'' (1967), another box-office hit. In between she had acted in ''Vidyapati'' (1964) as heroine opposite veteran [[Bharat Bhushan]]. This was a Hindi picture made in Calcutta. In a 1968 interview, Nazima said that to her it was the best role of her film career containing all facets \u2014 humor, romance and emotion. However, the picture failed at the box office. She also acted in another Hindi film, ''Wohi Ladki'' (1967), produced in Calcutta opposite a newcomer Sharvendra as hero.<ref>[http://cineplot.com/nazima-interview/ Nazima - Interview (1968) on Cineplot]</ref>\n\nShe was nominated in the [[Filmfare]] Best Supporting Actress Category for playing Manoj Kumar's sister in the 1972 film ''[[Beimaan]]''.
