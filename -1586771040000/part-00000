It seems that the relationship between the semi-nomadic Jurchen and their peninsular neighbours bore much resemblance to the relationship between Chinese states and their nomad neighbours, as described by Thomas Barfield.\"</ref> \n[[File:\ucc99\uacbd\uc785\ube44\ub3c4 2.jpg|140px|thumb|left|General Yun Gwan (1040-1111) and his army.]]\nThe Jurchens north of Goryeo had traditionally rendered tribute to the Goryeo monarchs and called Goryeo their \"parent country\",<ref>{{cite book|last1=Breuker|first1=Remco E.|title=Establishing a Pluralist Society in Medieval Korea, 918-1170: History, Ideology and Identity in the Kory\u014f Dynasty|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9004183254|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZx0VvujPqcC&q=%22The+reason+that+the+Jurchen+referred+to+Koryo+as+their+%27father+and+mother%27+country+when+they+founded+the+Jin+dynasty%22#v=snippet&q=%22The%20reason%20that%20the%20Jurchen%20referred%20to%20Koryo%20as%20their%20%27father%20and%20mother%27%20country%20when%20they%20founded%20the%20Jin%20dynasty%22&f=false|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=en|year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Yi|first1=Ki-baek|title=A New History of Korea|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674615762|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2mdVwXpMzwC&q=%22they+looked+upon+Koryo+in+particular+as+their+parent+country%22#v=snippet&q=%22they%20looked%20upon%20Koryo%20in%20particular%20as%20their%20parent%20country%22&f=false|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=en|year=1984}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Hugh Dyson|title=East Asia: A New History|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781477265178|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBvRs-za0CIC&q=%22Tradition+says+they+saw+Korea+as+moguk%2C+motherland%2C+and+paid+tribute+to+the+Koryo+court.%22#v=snippet&q=%22Tradition%20says%20they%20saw%20Korea%20as%20moguk%2C%20motherland%2C%20and%20paid%20tribute%20to%20the%20Koryo%20court.%22&f=false|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=en|date=2012-11-20}}</ref> but thanks to the defeat of Liao in 1018, the [[Wanyan]] tribe of the [[Heishui Mohe]] unified the Jurchen tribes and gained in might.\n\nIn 1102, the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] threatened and another crisis emerged.

In 1108, however, General Yun was given orders to withdraw his troops by the new ruler, [[Yejong of Goryeo|King Yejong]]. Due to manipulation and court intrigue from opposing factions, he was discharged from his post.

Goryeo resisted for about 30 years but finally sued for peace in 1259.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mongols began a campaign from 1231 to 1259 that ravaged parts of [[Gyeongsang]] and [[Jeolla]]. There were six major campaigns: 1231, 1232, 1235, 1238, 1247, 1253; between 1253 and 1258, the Mongols under [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]]'s general [[Jalairtai Qorchi]] launched four devastating invasions against Korea at tremendous cost to civilian lives throughout the Korean peninsula.\n\nCivilian resistance was strong, and the Imperial Court at Ganghwa attempted to strengthen its fortress. Korea won several victories but the Korean military could not withstand the waves of invasions. The repeated Mongol invasions caused havoc, loss of human lives and famine in Korea. In 1236, Gojong ordered the recreation of the ''Tripitaka Koreana'', which was destroyed during the 1232 invasion. This collection of Buddhist scriptures took 15 years to carve on some 81,000 wooden blocks, and is preserved to this day.\n\nIn March 1258, the dictator [[Choe Ui]] was assassinated by [[Kim Jun (Goryeo)|Kim Jun]]. Thus, dictatorship by his military group was ended, and the scholars who had insisted on peace with Mongolia gained power. Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after decades of fighting, Goryeo sent Crown Prince [[Wonjong of Goryeo|Wonjong]] to the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] capital to swear allegiance to the Mongols; [[Kublai Khan]] accepted, and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince.<ref name=\"Mongols\">{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Kenneth B.|title=Korea and East Asia: The Story of a Phoenix|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275958237|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrZQs-6KswMC&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=12 November 2016|language=en|year=1997}}</ref> Khubilai, who became khan of the Mongols and emperor of China in 1260, did not impose direct rule over most of Goryeo.

He was forced to spend many years at the Yuan court, being sent there in 1341 as a virtual prisoner before becoming king. He married the Mongol princess [[Queen Noguk]]. But in the mid-14th century the Yuan was beginning to crumble, soon to be replaced by the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368. King Gongmin began efforts to reform the Goryeo government and remove Mongolian influences.\n\nHis first act was to remove all pro-Mongol aristocrats and military officers from their positions. Mongols had annexed the northern provinces of Goryeo after the invasions and incorporated them into their empire as the [[Ssangseong]] and [[Dongnyeong Prefectures]]. The Goryeo army retook these provinces partly thanks to defection from [[Yi Jachun]], a minor Korean official in service of Mongols in Ssangseong, and his son Yi Seonggye. In addition, Generals Yi Seonggye and Ji Yongsu led a campaign into [[Liaoyang]].\n\nAfter the death of Gongmin's wife Noguk in 1365, he fell into depression. In the end, he became indifferent to politics and entrusted that great task to the Buddhist monk [[Shin Don]]. But after six years, Shin Don lost his position. In 1374, Gongmin was killed by Hong Ryun ({{korean|labels=no|\ud64d\ub95c}}), Choe Mansaeng ({{korean|labels=no|\ucd5c\ub9cc\uc0dd}}), and others.\n\nAfter his death, a high official [[Yi In-im]] assumed the helm of the government and enthroned eleven-year-old, King U, the son of King Gongmin.\n\nDuring this tumultuous period, Goryeo momentarily conquered [[Liaoyang]] in 1356, repulsed two large [[Red Turban invasions of Goryeo|invasions by the Red Turbans]] in 1359 and 1360, and defeated the final attempt by the Yuan to dominate Goryeo when General [[Choe Yeong]] defeated an invading Mongol [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] in 1364. During the 1380s, Goryeo turned its attention to the [[Wokou]] menace and used [[Naval history of Korea|naval artillery]] created by [[Choe Museon]] to annihilate hundreds of pirate ships.\n\n====Fall====\nIn 1388, [[U of Goryeo|King U]] (son of [[Gongmin of Goryeo|King Gongmin]] and a concubine) and general [[Choe Yeong]] planned a campaign to invade present-day [[Liaoning]] of China. King U put the general [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] (later [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]]) in charge, but he stopped at the border and rebelled.\n\nGoryeo fell to General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]], a son of [[Yi Ja-chun]], who put to death the last three Goryeo kings, usurped the throne and established in 1392 the [[Joseon]] dynasty.\n\n==Foreign relations==\nGoryeo affiliated itself with the successive short-lived [[Five Dynasties]] beginning with the [[Shatuo]] [[Later Tang]] dynasty in 933, and [[Taejo of Goryeo|Taejo]] was acknowledged as the legitimate successor to [[Dongmyeong of Goguryeo]].{{sfn|Em|2013|p=25}}{{sfn|Rossabi|1983|p=154}} In 962, Goryeo entered relations with the nascent [[Song dynasty]].{{sfn|Rossabi|1983|p=154}} Song did not have real suzerainty over Goryeo, and Goryeo sent \"tribute\" mainly for the sake of trade.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hsu |first1=Cho-yun |title=China: A New Cultural History |date=2012 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=9780231528184 |pages=266\u2013267 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2_GQpLPPl8C&pg=PA266#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=12 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Later, Goryeo entered nominal tributary relations with the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]] then the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] while maintaining trade and unofficial relations with the Song dynasty.

During the Goryeo period, Seon thoroughly became a \"religion of the state,\" receiving extensive support and privileges through connections with the ruling family and powerful members of the court.<ref>Shin ki-seop, \u300aKorea Annual\u300b, Hapdong News Agency, p.76</ref> Although Buddhist takes primary place, [[Korean Taoism|Taoism]] was worshiped in some temples, as did [[Korean Shamanism|shamanism]].<ref name=\"ABC\">Djun Kil Kim, \u300aThe History of Korea: 2nd edition\u300b, ABC-CLIO, 2014. {{ISBN|1610695828}}, p.9</ref>\n\nAlthough most of the scholastic schools waned in activity and influence during this period of the growth of Seon, the ''[[Hwaeom]]'' school continued to be a lively source of scholarship well into the Goryeo, much of it continuing the legacy of [[Uisang]] and [[Wonhyo]].<ref name=\"ABC\" /> In particular the work of '''[[Gyunyeo]]''' (\u5747\u5982; 923-973) prepared for the reconciliation of Hwaeom and Seon,<ref>Pyong-jo Chong, \u300aHistory of Buddhism\u300b, Jimoondang, 2007. {{ISBN|8988095243}} p.83</ref> with Hwaeom's accommodating attitude toward the latter.<ref name=\"Sakya\">Madhusudan Sakya, \u3008Current Perspectives in Buddhism: Buddhism today / issues&global dimensions\u3009, Cyber Tech Publications, 2011. {{ISBN|8178847337}}. p.108</ref> Gyunyeo's works are an important source for modern scholarship in identifying the distinctive nature of Korean Hwaeom.<ref name=\"Sakya\" />\n\nAnother important advocate of Seon/Gyo unity was ''[[Uicheon]]''. Like most other early Goryeo monks, he began his studies in Buddhism with the Hwaeom school. He later traveled to China, and upon his return, actively promulgated the ''[[Cheontae]]'' (\u5929\u53f0\u5b97, or ''[[Tiantai]]'' in Chinese) teachings, which became recognized as another Seon school. This period thus came to be described as \"five doctrinal and two meditational schools\" (''ogyo yangjong''). Uicheon himself, however, alienated too many Seon adherents, and he died at a relatively young age without seeing a Seon-Gyo unity accomplished.\n[[File:Goryeo Seobun.jpg|160px|thumb|Gwangyeongseopum Byeonsangdo, Goryeo buddhist painting.]]\nThe most important figure of Seon in the Goryeo was ''[[Jinul]]'' (\u77e5\u8a25; 1158\u20131210). In his time, the sangha was in a crisis of external appearance and internal issues of doctrine. Buddhism had gradually become infected by secular tendencies and involvements, such as fortune-telling and the offering of prayers and rituals for success in secular endeavors. This kind of corruption resulted in the profusion of increasingly larger numbers of monks and nuns with questionable motivations. Therefore, the correction, revival, and improvement of the quality of Buddhism were prominent issues for Buddhist leaders of the period.\n\nJinul sought to establish a new movement within Korean Seon, which he called the ''\"[[sam\u0101dhi]] and [[praj\u00f1a|praj\u00f1\u0101]] society\"'',<ref name=\"Alexander\">Alexander Wynee, \u300aBuddhism: An Introduction\u300b, I.B. Tauris, 2015. {{ISBN|1848853971}} p.236</ref> whose goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains.<ref name=\"Keel\" /> He eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of the Seonggwangsa monastery at Mt. Jogye (\u66f9\u6eaa\u5c71).<ref name=\"Keel\" /> Jinul's works are characterized by a thorough analysis and reformulation of the methodologies of Seon study and practice. One major issue that had long fermented in Chinese ''[[Zen|Seon]]'', and which received special focus from Jinul, was the relationship between \"gradual\" and \"sudden\" methods in practice and enlightenment. Drawing upon various Chinese treatments of this topic, most importantly those by '''[[Zongmi]]''' (780-841) and '''Dahui''' (\u5927\u6167; 1089\u20131163),<ref>Damien Keown, Charles S.Prebish, \u300aEncyclopedia of Buddhism\u300b, Routledge, 2013. {{ISBN|1136985883}} p.226</ref> Jinul created a  \"sudden enlightenment followed by gradual practice\" dictum, which he outlined in a few relatively concise and accessible texts.<ref>Steven Heine, \u300aLike Cats and Dogs:Contesting the Mu Koan in Zen Buddhism\u300b, OUP USA, 2013. {{ISBN|0199837309}} p.82</ref> From Dahui, Jinul also incorporated the ''gwanhwa'' (\u89c0\u8a71) method into his practice.<ref name=\"Alexander\" /> This form of meditation is the main method taught in Korean Seon today. Jinul's philosophical resolution of the Seon-Gyo conflict brought a deep and lasting effect on Korean Buddhism.\n\n[[File:Goryeo-Illustrated manuscript of the Lotus Sutra c.1340 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|Illustrated manuscript of the [[Lotus Sutra]], {{circa}} 1340]]\nThe general trend of Buddhism in the latter half of the Goryeo was a decline due to corruption, and the rise of strong anti-Buddhist political and philosophical sentiment.<ref>Sonja Vegdahl, Ben Hur, \u300aCultureShock! Korea: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette\u300b, Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2008. {{ISBN|9814408948}} p.9</ref> However, this period of relative decadence would nevertheless produce some of Korea's most renowned Seon masters. Three important monks of this period who figured prominently in charting the future course of Korean Seon were contemporaries and friends: '''Gyeonghan Baeg'un''' (\u666f\u9591\u767d\u96f2; 1298\u20131374), '''Taego Bou''' (\u592a\u53e4\u666e\u611a; 1301\u20131382) and '''Naong Hyegeun''' (\u61f6\u7fc1\u6167\u52e4; 1320\u20131376). All three went to [[Yuan China]] to learn the ''[[Linji school|Linji]]'' (\u81e8\u6fdf or ''[[Imje]]'' in [[Korean language|Korean]]) ''gwanhwa'' teaching that had been popularized by Jinul. All three returned, and established the sharp, confrontational methods of the Imje school in their own teaching. Each of the three was also said to have had hundreds of disciples, such that this new infusion into Korean Seon brought about considerable effect. Despite the Imje influence, which was generally considered to be anti-scholarly in nature, Gyeonghan and Naong, under the influence of Jinul and the traditional ''[[tong bulgyo]]'' tendency, showed an unusual interest in scriptural study, as well as a strong understanding of ''[[Confucianism]]'' and ''[[Taoism]]'', due to the increasing influence of Chinese philosophy as the foundation of official education. From this time, a marked tendency for Korean Buddhist monks to be \"three teachings\" exponents appeared.\n\nA significant historical event of the Goryeo period is the production of the first woodblock edition of the [[Tripitaka]], called the [[Tripitaka Koreana]]. Two editions were made, the first one completed from 1210 to 1231, and the second one from 1214 to 1259. The first edition was destroyed in a fire, during an attack by [[Mongol]] invaders in 1232, but the second edition is still in existence at [[Haeinsa]] in [[Gyeongsang]] province. This edition of the Tripitaka was of high quality, and served as the standard version of the Tripitaka in East Asia for almost 700 years.<ref name=\"Sakya2\">Madhusudan Sakya, \u3008Current Perspectives in Buddhism: Buddhism today / issues&global dimensions\u3009, Cyber Tech Publications, 2011. {{ISBN|8178847337}}. p.111</ref>\n\n====Confucianism====\n{{Main|Korean Confucianism}}\n[[Gwangjong of Goryeo|Emperor Gwangjong]] creating the [[Gwageo|national civil service examinations]].<ref name=\"Djun2\">{{harvnb|Kim|2014}}, p. 64.</ref> and [[Seongjong of Goryeo|King Seongjong]] was a key figure in establishing Confucianism.

As a result, a number of Muslim traders from the [[Near East]] and [[Central Asia]] settled down in Korea and established families there.

Stoneware with underglaze slip decoration and celadon glaze. [[Celadon]] ceramics of the Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) are among the most celebrated works of Korean art. Their luminous green color is the result of iron in both the clay and the glaze oxidizing in a reduction kiln. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThe ceramics of Goryeo are considered by some to be the finest small-scale works of ceramics in Korean history.\nKey-fret, foliate designs, geometric or scrolling flowerhead bands, elliptical panels, stylized fish and insects, and the use of incised designs began at this time. Glazes were usually various shades of celadon, with browned glazes to almost black glazes being used for stoneware and storage. Celadon glazes could be rendered almost transparent to show black and white inlays.\n\nWhile the forms generally seen are broad-shouldered bottles, larger low bowls or shallow smaller bowls, highly decorated celadon cosmetic boxes, and small slip-inlaid cups, the Buddhist potteries also produced melon-shaped vases, chrysanthemum cups often of spectacularly architectural design on stands with lotus motifs and lotus flower heads. In-curving rimmed alms bowls have also been discovered similar to Korean metalware. Wine cups often had a tall foot which rested on dish-shaped stands.\n\n====Lacquerware with mother of pearl inlay====\nDuring the Goryeo period, lacquerware with mother-of-pearl inlay reached a high point of technical and aesthetic achievement and was widely used by members of the aristocracy for Buddhist ritual implements and vessels, as well as horse saddles and royal carriages. Inlaid lacquers combine texture, color, and shape to produce a dazzling effect in both large and small objects. Although Korean lacquerware of the Goryeo period was highly prized throughout East Asia, fewer than fifteen examples are known to have survived, one of which is this exquisite box in the Museum's collection. This paucity of material is largely attributable to the fragility of lacquer objects and, to a certain extent, to wars and raids by foreign powers, notably those launched from Japan by Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536\u20131598) in the late sixteenth century.\n[[File:Cosmetic box, stoneware with celadon glaze, Goryeo Dynasty.jpg|thumb|upright|A Korean stoneware cosmetic box with white and black inlay and a [[celadon]] glaze, from the Goryeo Dynasty, dated c. 1150\u20131250]]\n[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/25.215.41a,b More info on Goryeo lacquerware]\n\n====Construction techniques====\nThese ceramics are of a hard porcellaneous body with porcelain stone as one of the key ingredients; however, it is not to be confused with porcelain. The body is low clay, quartz rich, high potassia and virtually identical in composition to the Chinese Yueh ceramics which scholars hypothesize occasioned the first production of celadon in Korea. The glaze is an ash glaze with iron colourant, fired in a reduction atmosphere in a modified Chinese-style 'dragon' kiln. The distinctive blue-grey-green of Korean celadon is caused by the iron content of the glaze with a minimum of titanium contaminant, which modifies the color to a greener cast, as can be seen in Chinese Yueh wares. However, the Goryeo potters took the glaze in a different direction than their Chinese forebears; instead of relying solely on underglaze incised designs, they eventually developed the ''sanggam'' technique of inlaying black (magnetite) and white (quartz) which created bold contrast with the glaze. Scholars also theorize that this developed in part to an inlay tradition in Korean metalworks and lacquer, and also to the dissatisfaction with the nearly invisible effect of incising when done under a thick celadon glaze.<ref>Wood, Nigel. \"Technological Parallels between Chinese Yue wares and Korean celadons.\" in Papers of the British Association for Korean Studies (BAKS Papers), vol 5.

Technology in Korea took a big step in Goryeo and strong relation with the [[Song dynasty]] contributed to this. In the dynasty, Korean ceramics and paper, which come down to now, started to be manufactured.\n\nDuring the late Goryeo Dynasty, Goryeo was at the cutting edge of shipboard artillery. In 1356 early experiments were carried out with gunpowder weapons that shot wood or metal projectiles.

Goryeo peacefully annexed Later Silla in 935 and militarily conquered Later Baekje in 936, successfully reunifying the Korean Peninsula. Beginning in 993, Goryeo faced multiple invasions by the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]], a powerful nomadic empire to the north, but a decisive military victory in 1019 brought about a century of peace and prosperity as Goryeo entered its golden age.{{sfn|Kim|2012|pp=143\u2013144}} During this period, a balance of power was maintained in East Asia between Goryeo, Liao, and

By 1356 Goryeo regained its lost northern territories.\n\n====Last reform====\n[[File:Goryeo-Portrait of Yeom Jesin.jpg|140px|thumb|Yeom Jesin (1304\u20131382) was the main political opponent of the monk, Shin Don, who was in power.]]\n\nWhen King Gongmin ascended to the throne, Goryeo was under the influence of the Mongol Yuan China. He was forced to spend many years at the Yuan court, being sent there in 1341 as a virtual prisoner before becoming king. He married the Mongol princess [[Queen Noguk]]. But in the mid-14th century the Yuan was beginning to crumble, soon to be replaced by the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368. King Gongmin began efforts to reform the Goryeo government and remove Mongolian influences.\n\nHis first act was to remove all pro-Mongol aristocrats and military officers from their positions. Mongols had annexed the northern provinces of Goryeo after the invasions and incorporated them into their empire as the [[Ssangseong]] and [[Dongnyeong Prefectures]]. The Goryeo army retook these provinces partly thanks to defection from [[Yi Jachun]], a minor Korean official in service of Mongols in Ssangseong, and his son Yi Seonggye. In addition, Generals Yi Seonggye and Ji Yongsu led a campaign into [[Liaoyang]].\n\nAfter the death of Gongmin's wife Noguk in 1365, he fell into depression. In the end, he became indifferent to politics and entrusted that great task to the Buddhist monk [[Shin Don]]. But after six years, Shin Don lost his position. In 1374, Gongmin was killed by Hong Ryun ({{korean|labels=no|\ud64d\ub95c}}), Choe Mansaeng ({{korean|labels=no|\ucd5c\ub9cc\uc0dd}}), and others.\n\nAfter his death, a high official [[Yi In-im]] assumed the helm of the government and enthroned eleven-year-old, King U, the son of King Gongmin.\n\nDuring this tumultuous period, Goryeo momentarily conquered [[Liaoyang]] in 1356, repulsed two large [[Red Turban invasions of Goryeo|invasions by the Red Turbans]] in 1359 and 1360, and defeated the final attempt by the Yuan to dominate Goryeo when General [[Choe Yeong]] defeated an invading Mongol [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] in 1364. During the 1380s, Goryeo turned its attention to the [[Wokou]] menace and used [[Naval history of Korea|naval artillery]] created by [[Choe Museon]] to annihilate hundreds of pirate ships.\n\n====Fall====\nIn 1388, [[U of Goryeo|King U]] (son of [[Gongmin of Goryeo|King Gongmin]] and a concubine) and general [[Choe Yeong]] planned a campaign to invade present-day [[Liaoning]] of China. King U put the general [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] (later [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]]) in charge, but he stopped at the border and rebelled.\n\nGoryeo fell to General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]], a son of [[Yi Ja-chun]], who put to death the last three Goryeo kings, usurped the throne and established in 1392 the [[Joseon]] dynasty.\n\n==Foreign relations==\nGoryeo affiliated itself with the successive short-lived [[Five Dynasties]] beginning with the [[Shatuo]] [[Later Tang]] dynasty in 933, and [[Taejo of Goryeo|Taejo]] was acknowledged as the legitimate successor to [[Dongmyeong of Goguryeo]].{{sfn|Em|2013|p=25}}{{sfn|Rossabi|1983|p=154}} In 962, Goryeo entered relations with the nascent [[Song dynasty]].{{sfn|Rossabi|1983|p=154}} Song did not have real suzerainty over Goryeo, and Goryeo sent \"tribute\" mainly for the sake of trade.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hsu |first1=Cho-yun |title=China: A New Cultural History |date=2012 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=9780231528184 |pages=266\u2013267 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2_GQpLPPl8C&pg=PA266#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=12 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Later, Goryeo entered nominal tributary relations with the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]] then the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] while maintaining trade and unofficial relations with the Song dynasty.

The Liao invasions of Kory\u014f from 993 to 1020 were successfully repelled by the Koreans. The Chin made no serious attempts against Kory\u014f. The dynastic historians accepted nevertheless the official fiction and referred to Kory\u014f by an unrealistic terminology.{{sfn|Bielenstein|2005|p=182}}<br /><br />To repeat, Kory\u014f was not a vassal with tributary duties to the Five Dynasties, Sung, Liao, and Chin. In spite of its smaller size, it was able to stand up to Liao and Chin, and did not have to buy peace. This required clever diplomacy and a minimum of appeasement.

The struggles which ensued continued for most of the Goryeo period, but gradually the Seon argument for the possession of the true transmission of enlightenment would gain the upper hand.<ref name=\"seungyeon\" /> The position that was generally adopted in the later Seon schools, due in large part to the efforts of '''[[Jinul]]''', did not claim clear superiority of Seon meditational methods, but rather declared the intrinsic unity and similarities of the Seon and Gyo viewpoints.<ref name=\"Keel\">Hee-sung Keel, \u300aChinul:The Founder of the Korean Son Tradition\u300b, Jain Publishing Company, 1978. {{ISBN|0895811553}}. pp.6-10</ref> Although all these schools are mentioned in historical records, toward the end of the dynasty, Seon became dominant in its effect on the government and society, and the production of noteworthy scholars and adepts. During the Goryeo period, Seon thoroughly became a \"religion of the state,\" receiving extensive support and privileges through connections with the ruling family and powerful members of the court.<ref>Shin ki-seop, \u300aKorea Annual\u300b, Hapdong News Agency, p.76</ref> Although Buddhist takes primary place, [[Korean Taoism|Taoism]] was worshiped in some temples, as did [[Korean Shamanism|shamanism]].<ref name=\"ABC\">Djun Kil Kim, \u300aThe History of Korea: 2nd edition\u300b, ABC-CLIO, 2014. {{ISBN|1610695828}}, p.9</ref>\n\nAlthough most of the scholastic schools waned in activity and influence during this period of the growth of Seon, the ''[[Hwaeom]]'' school continued to be a lively source of scholarship well into the Goryeo, much of it continuing the legacy of [[Uisang]] and [[Wonhyo]].<ref name=\"ABC\" /> In particular the work of '''[[Gyunyeo]]''' (\u5747\u5982; 923-973) prepared for the reconciliation of Hwaeom and Seon,<ref>Pyong-jo Chong, \u300aHistory of Buddhism\u300b, Jimoondang, 2007. {{ISBN|8988095243}} p.83</ref> with Hwaeom's accommodating attitude toward the latter.<ref name=\"Sakya\">Madhusudan Sakya, \u3008Current Perspectives in Buddhism: Buddhism today / issues&global dimensions\u3009, Cyber Tech Publications, 2011. {{ISBN|8178847337}}. p.108</ref> Gyunyeo's works are an important source for modern scholarship in identifying the distinctive nature of Korean Hwaeom.<ref name=\"Sakya\" />\n\nAnother important advocate of Seon/Gyo unity was ''[[Uicheon]]''. Like most other early Goryeo monks, he began his studies in Buddhism with the Hwaeom school. He later traveled to China, and upon his return, actively promulgated the ''[[Cheontae]]'' (\u5929\u53f0\u5b97, or ''[[Tiantai]]'' in Chinese) teachings, which became recognized as another Seon school. This period thus came to be described as \"five doctrinal and two meditational schools\" (''ogyo yangjong''). Uicheon himself, however, alienated too many Seon adherents, and he died at a relatively young age without seeing a Seon-Gyo unity accomplished.\n[[File:Goryeo Seobun.jpg|160px|thumb|Gwangyeongseopum Byeonsangdo, Goryeo buddhist painting.]]\nThe most important figure of Seon in the Goryeo was ''[[Jinul]]'' (\u77e5\u8a25; 1158\u20131210). In his time, the sangha was in a crisis of external appearance and internal issues of doctrine. Buddhism had gradually become infected by secular tendencies and involvements, such as fortune-telling and the offering of prayers and rituals for success in secular endeavors. This kind of corruption resulted in the profusion of increasingly larger numbers of monks and nuns with questionable motivations. Therefore, the correction, revival, and improvement of the quality of Buddhism were prominent issues for Buddhist leaders of the period.\n\nJinul sought to establish a new movement within Korean Seon, which he called the ''\"[[sam\u0101dhi]] and [[praj\u00f1a|praj\u00f1\u0101]] society\"'',<ref name=\"Alexander\">Alexander Wynee, \u300aBuddhism: An Introduction\u300b, I.B. Tauris, 2015. {{ISBN|1848853971}} p.236</ref> whose goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains.<ref name=\"Keel\" /> He eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of the Seonggwangsa monastery at Mt. Jogye (\u66f9\u6eaa\u5c71).<ref name=\"Keel\" /> Jinul's works are characterized by a thorough analysis and reformulation of the methodologies of Seon study and practice. One major issue that had long fermented in Chinese ''[[Zen|Seon]]'', and which received special focus from Jinul, was the relationship between \"gradual\" and \"sudden\" methods in practice and enlightenment. Drawing upon various Chinese treatments of this topic, most importantly those by '''[[Zongmi]]''' (780-841) and '''Dahui''' (\u5927\u6167; 1089\u20131163),<ref>Damien Keown, Charles S.Prebish, \u300aEncyclopedia of Buddhism\u300b, Routledge, 2013. {{ISBN|1136985883}} p.226</ref> Jinul created a  \"sudden enlightenment followed by gradual practice\" dictum, which he outlined in a few relatively concise and accessible texts.<ref>Steven Heine, \u300aLike Cats and Dogs:Contesting the Mu Koan in Zen Buddhism\u300b, OUP USA, 2013. {{ISBN|0199837309}} p.82</ref> From Dahui, Jinul also incorporated the ''gwanhwa'' (\u89c0\u8a71) method into his practice.<ref name=\"Alexander\" /> This form of meditation is the main method taught in Korean Seon today. Jinul's philosophical resolution of the Seon-Gyo conflict brought a deep and lasting effect on Korean Buddhism.\n\n[[File:Goryeo-Illustrated manuscript of the Lotus Sutra c.1340 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|Illustrated manuscript of the [[Lotus Sutra]], {{circa}} 1340]]\nThe general trend of Buddhism in the latter half of the Goryeo was a decline due to corruption, and the rise of strong anti-Buddhist political and philosophical sentiment.<ref>Sonja Vegdahl, Ben Hur, \u300aCultureShock! Korea: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette\u300b, Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2008. {{ISBN|9814408948}} p.9</ref> However, this period of relative decadence would nevertheless produce some of Korea's most renowned Seon masters. Three important monks of this period who figured prominently in charting the future course of Korean Seon were contemporaries and friends: '''Gyeonghan Baeg'un''' (\u666f\u9591\u767d\u96f2; 1298\u20131374), '''Taego Bou''' (\u592a\u53e4\u666e\u611a; 1301\u20131382) and '''Naong Hyegeun''' (\u61f6\u7fc1\u6167\u52e4; 1320\u20131376). All three went to [[Yuan China]] to learn the ''[[Linji school|Linji]]'' (\u81e8\u6fdf or ''[[Imje]]'' in [[Korean language|Korean]]) ''gwanhwa'' teaching that had been popularized by Jinul. All three returned, and established the sharp, confrontational methods of the Imje school in their own teaching. Each of the three was also said to have had hundreds of disciples, such that this new infusion into Korean Seon brought about considerable effect. Despite the Imje influence, which was generally considered to be anti-scholarly in nature, Gyeonghan and Naong, under the influence of Jinul and the traditional ''[[tong bulgyo]]'' tendency, showed an unusual interest in scriptural study, as well as a strong understanding of ''[[Confucianism]]'' and ''[[Taoism]]'', due to the increasing influence of Chinese philosophy as the foundation of official education. From this time, a marked tendency for Korean Buddhist monks to be \"three teachings\" exponents appeared.\n\nA significant historical event of the Goryeo period is the production of the first woodblock edition of the [[Tripitaka]], called the [[Tripitaka Koreana]]. Two editions were made, the first one completed from 1210 to 1231, and the second one from 1214 to 1259. The first edition was destroyed in a fire, during an attack by [[Mongol]] invaders in 1232, but the second edition is still in existence at [[Haeinsa]] in [[Gyeongsang]] province. This edition of the Tripitaka was of high quality, and served as the standard version of the Tripitaka in East Asia for almost 700 years.<ref name=\"Sakya2\">Madhusudan Sakya, \u3008Current Perspectives in Buddhism: Buddhism today / issues&global dimensions\u3009, Cyber Tech Publications, 2011. {{ISBN|8178847337}}. p.111</ref>\n\n====Confucianism====\n{{Main|Korean Confucianism}}\n[[Gwangjong of Goryeo|Emperor Gwangjong]] creating the [[Gwageo|national civil service examinations]].<ref name=\"Djun2\">{{harvnb|Kim|2014}}, p. 64.</ref> and [[Seongjong of Goryeo|King Seongjong]] was a key figure in establishing Confucianism.

Their luminous green color is the result of iron in both the clay and the glaze oxidizing in a reduction kiln. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThe ceramics of Goryeo are considered by some to be the finest small-scale works of ceramics in Korean history.\nKey-fret, foliate designs, geometric or scrolling flowerhead bands, elliptical panels, stylized fish and insects, and the use of incised designs began at this time. Glazes were usually various shades of celadon, with browned glazes to almost black glazes being used for stoneware and storage. Celadon glazes could be rendered almost transparent to show black and white inlays.\n\nWhile the forms generally seen are broad-shouldered bottles, larger low bowls or shallow smaller bowls, highly decorated celadon cosmetic boxes, and small slip-inlaid cups, the Buddhist potteries also produced melon-shaped vases, chrysanthemum cups often of spectacularly architectural design on stands with lotus motifs and lotus flower heads. In-curving rimmed alms bowls have also been discovered similar to Korean metalware. Wine cups often had a tall foot which rested on dish-shaped stands.\n\n====Lacquerware with mother of pearl inlay====\nDuring the Goryeo period, lacquerware with mother-of-pearl inlay reached a high point of technical and aesthetic achievement and was widely used by members of the aristocracy for Buddhist ritual implements and vessels, as well as horse saddles and royal carriages. Inlaid lacquers combine texture, color, and shape to produce a dazzling effect in both large and small objects. Although Korean lacquerware of the Goryeo period was highly prized throughout East Asia, fewer than fifteen examples are known to have survived, one of which is this exquisite box in the Museum's collection. This paucity of material is largely attributable to the fragility of lacquer objects and, to a certain extent, to wars and raids by foreign powers, notably those launched from Japan by Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536\u20131598) in the late sixteenth century.\n[[File:Cosmetic box, stoneware with celadon glaze, Goryeo Dynasty.jpg|thumb|upright|A Korean stoneware cosmetic box with white and black inlay and a [[celadon]] glaze, from the Goryeo Dynasty, dated c. 1150\u20131250]]\n[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/25.215.41a,b More info on Goryeo lacquerware]\n\n====Construction techniques====\nThese ceramics are of a hard porcellaneous body with porcelain stone as one of the key ingredients; however, it is not to be confused with porcelain. The body is low clay, quartz rich, high potassia and virtually identical in composition to the Chinese Yueh ceramics which scholars hypothesize occasioned the first production of celadon in Korea. The glaze is an ash glaze with iron colourant, fired in a reduction atmosphere in a modified Chinese-style 'dragon' kiln. The distinctive blue-grey-green of Korean celadon is caused by the iron content of the glaze with a minimum of titanium contaminant, which modifies the color to a greener cast, as can be seen in Chinese Yueh wares. However, the Goryeo potters took the glaze in a different direction than their Chinese forebears; instead of relying solely on underglaze incised designs, they eventually developed the ''sanggam'' technique of inlaying black (magnetite) and white (quartz) which created bold contrast with the glaze. Scholars also theorize that this developed in part to an inlay tradition in Korean metalworks and lacquer, and also to the dissatisfaction with the nearly invisible effect of incising when done under a thick celadon glaze.<ref>Wood, Nigel. \"Technological Parallels between Chinese Yue wares and Korean celadons.\" in Papers of the British Association for Korean Studies (BAKS Papers), vol 5.

Technology in Korea took a big step in Goryeo and strong relation with the [[Song dynasty]] contributed to this. In the dynasty, Korean ceramics and paper, which come down to now, started to be manufactured.\n\nDuring the late Goryeo Dynasty, Goryeo was at the cutting edge of shipboard artillery. In 1356 early experiments were carried out with gunpowder weapons that shot wood or metal projectiles. In 1373 experiments with incendiary arrows and \"fire tubes\" possibly an early form of the [[Hwacha]] were developed and placed on Korean warships. The policy of placing cannons and other gunpowder weapons continued well into the [[Joseon]] dynasty and by 1410, over 160 Joseon warships had cannons on board.
