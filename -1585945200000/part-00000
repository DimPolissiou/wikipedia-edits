She appeared with [[Bob Denver]] two years later in the beach party film ''[[For Those Who Think Young (film)|For Those Who Think Young]]''.\n\nIn 1964, she left the Broadway musical ''[[Fade Out \u2013 Fade In]]'' to portray movie star [[Ginger Grant]] on the situation comedy ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', after [[Jayne Mansfield]] turned it down. Over time, she became unhappy with the role and worried that it would typecast her. The series ended in 1967 and she continued to work in film and made guest appearances on television. She did not appear in the movies ''[[Rescue from Gilligan's Island]]'', ''The Castaways on Gilligan's Island'', or ''The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island''. She did appear in the Matt Helm spy spoof ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1969 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'' (1969) with [[Dean Martin]] and in ''[[The Stepford Wives (1975 film)|The Stepford Wives]]'' (1975).\n\nLouise attempted to shed her comedic image by playing darker roles, such as a guest appearance as a heroin addict in a 1974 ''[[Kojak]]'' episode and as a corrections officer in the 1976 television movie ''[[Nightmare in Badham County]]''. Her other television appearances of the period included ''[[Look What's Happened to Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1976), ''[[SST: Death Flight]]'' (1977), ''Friendships, Secrets and Lies'' (1979), and the soap opera ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' during the 1978\u20131979 seasons. In the fall of 1984, she replaced [[Jo Ann Pflug]] as Taylor Chapin on the syndicated soap opera ''[[Rituals (TV series)|Rituals]]''.\n\n===Later work===\nLouise declined to participate in any of three ''Gilligan's Island'' reunion television films. Despite maintaining a steady acting career after the series ended, she stated repeatedly that the show had actually ruined her career. The role of Ginger was recast with [[Judith Baldwin]] and [[Constance Forslund]]. Although she did not appear in the television movies, she made brief walk-on appearances on a few talk shows and specials for ''Gilligan's Island'' reunions, including ''[[Good Morning America]]'' (1982), ''[[The Late Show (1986 talk show)|The Late Show]]'' (1988) and the 2004 TV Land award show with the other surviving cast members.

She appeared with [[Bob Denver]] two years later in the beach party film ''[[For Those Who Think Young (film)|For Those Who Think Young]]''.\n\nIn 1964, she left the Broadway musical ''[[Fade Out \u2013 Fade In]]'' to portray movie star [[Ginger Grant]] on the situation comedy ''Gilligan's Island'', after [[Jayne Mansfield]] turned it down. Over time, she became unhappy with the role and worried that it would typecast her. The series ended in 1967 and she continued to work in film and made guest appearances on television. She did not appear in the movies ''[[Rescue from Gilligan's Island]]'', ''The Castaways on Gilligan's Island'', or ''The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island''.

Despite maintaining a steady acting career after the series ended, she stated repeatedly that the show had actually ruined her career. The role of Ginger was recast with [[Judith Baldwin]] and [[Constance Forslund]].

The village consists of seven hamlets: Kozja\u010da, Kru\u0161\u010dica, Lisarica, Ljuboti\u0107, Obi\u010daj, Sveta Marija Magdalena, and \u0160ibuljina. In a geopolitical context, Tribanj was the border of Austrian [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] in the 19th century, and is still viewed as a cultural border between [[Dalmatia]] and [[Croatian Littoral]]. It is situated on the southern slopes of [[Velebit]] mountain, also known as ''Podgorje''. \n\n==History==\n===Prehistory and ancient history===\nArea of Tribanj has a evident history of human activity since the [[Mesolithic]]. The earliest evidence of human presence are found in caves, such as Reljina pe\u0107ina, a cave near Ljuboti\u0107. Arrival of [[Liburnians]] during the [[Iron Age]] saw the abandonment of caves as primary settlements. Instead, the Liburnians introduced building fortified [[hillforts]] and burying their deceased in [[tumuli]].

The hillfort Tribnjina stands at 330 metres above sea level, and thus dominates the surrounding area. The ancient settlement was protected on the west side by a gorge (Tribanjska draga), and by defensive walls on the north, east, and south side.

The Roman conquest saw the formation of Argyruntum and its development as [[civitas]], thus lessening the significance of Tribnjina.

In a geopolitical context, Tribanj was the border of Austrian [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] in the 19th century, and is still viewed as a cultural border between [[Dalmatia]] and [[Croatian Littoral]]. It is situated on the southern slopes of [[Velebit]] mountain. \n\n==History==\n===Prehistory and ancient history===\nArea of Tribanj has a evident history of human activity since the [[Mesolithic]]. The earliest evidence of human presence are found in caves, such as Reljina pe\u0107ina, a cave near Ljuboti\u0107.
