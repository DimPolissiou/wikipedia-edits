The song is thought to have spread from the islands to other Southern states and the North, as well as other places in the world.  The first known recording, of someone known only as H. Wylie, who sang in the [[Gullah language|Gullah dialect]], was recorded by folk enthusiast [[Robert Winslow Gordon]] in 1926. It later became a standard campfire song in [[scouting]] and [[summer camp]]s and enjoyed broader popularity during the [[folk revival]] of the 1950s and 1960s.\n \nThe song was originally an appeal to God to come and help those in need.<ref name=\"winick-folknews\">{{cite web\n  | last = Winick\n  | first = Stephen\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = The World's First 'Kumbaya' Moment: New Evidence about an Old Song\n  | publisher = Folklife Center News, [[Library of Congress]]\n  | date = Summer\u2013Fall 2010\n  | url = https://www.loc.gov/folklife/news/pdf/FCNews32_3-4_opt.pdf\n  | accessdate = March 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n{{Listen\n| type = music\n| filename    = Kumbaya - earliest known recording (1926).flac\n| title       = Come By Here / Kum Ba Ya / Kumbaya\n| description = Earliest known recording (1926)\n| pos         =\n}}\nAccording to [[Library of Congress]] editor Stephen Winick, the song almost certainly originated among African Americans in the Southeastern United States, and had a [[Gullah language|Gullah]] version early in its history even if it did not originate in that dialect.<ref name=\"winick-folknews\"/> The two oldest versions whose year of origin is known for certain were both collected in 1926, and both reside in the Library's [[American Folklife Center]]. No precise month or day was recorded for either version, so either may be the earliest known version of the song. One was submitted as a high-school collecting project by a student named Minnie Lee to her teacher, [[Julian P. Boyd]], later a professor of history at Princeton University and president of the American Historical Association. This version, collected in Alliance, North Carolina, is a manuscript featuring lyrics but no music. The other 1926 version was recorded on [[Phonograph cylinder|wax cylinder]] by [[Robert Winslow Gordon]], founder of what began as the Library of Congress's [[Archive of Folk Song]], which became the [[American Folklife Center]]. The singer's name was H. Wylie, and the song was recorded within a few hours' drive of [[Darien, Georgia]], although Gordon did not note the exact location.  Between 1926 and 1928, Gordon recorded three more versions of traditional [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] with the refrain \"come by here\" or \"come by heah\".  One of these is a different song concerning the story of [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the den of lions. Of the other two, one has been lost, and one cylinder was broken, so it cannot be determined if they are versions of \"Kumbaya\".<ref name=\"winick-folknews\"/>\n\nAccording to an article in ''Kodaly Envoy'' by Lum Chee-Hoo, some time between 1922 and 1931, members of  the Society for the Preservation of Spirituals<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gullahspirituals.org/ |website=The Society for the Preservation of Spirituals |title=Gullah Spirituals |accessdate=23 December 2018}}</ref> collected a version from the South Carolina coast.<ref name=\"weiss-dallasnews\">{{cite web\n  | last = Jeffery\n  | first = Weiss\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = 'Kumbaya': How did a sweet simple song become a mocking metaphor?\n  | publisher = [[The Dallas Morning News]]\n  | date = November 12, 2006\n  | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/DN-kumbaya_11rel.ART0.State.Edition1.3e6da2d.html\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080914095037/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/DN-kumbaya_11rel.ART0.State.Edition1.3e6da2d.html\n  | archivedate = September 14, 2008\n  | accessdate = July 17, 2008}}</ref> \"Come by Yuh\", as they called it, was sung in [[Gullah language|Gullah]], the creole language spoken by the former slaves living on the [[Sea Islands]] of [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], as well as [[The Bahamas]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mama Lisa'a World-Kumbaya |url=http://www.mamalisa.com/?t=es&p=108&c=23 |accessdate=November 1, 2008}}</ref> It is possible this is the earliest version, if it was collected before 1926.

during the [[American folk music revival]] of the early to mid-1960s, largely due to [[Joan Baez]]'s 1962 recording of the song, and became associated with the [[American Civil Rights Movement|Civil

The character was the brainchild of the company's 40-year-old commercial manager, [[Ashton B. Collins, Sr.]].<ref name=smithsonian>{{cite web|url= https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/sova-nmah-ac-0913|title= Reddy Kilowatt records|author=National Museum of American History|work=Smithsonian|date=|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLike other electric utilities of the period, APC was seeking to grow consumer demand for electrical power.  Commercially viable [[Alternating current|AC]] generating stations had begun powering North American streets and homes by the end of the 19th century.<ref>Edison Tech Center [http://edisontechcenter.org/HistElectPowTrans.html The history of electrification: The birth of our power grid].</ref> By the mid-1920s electric utilities had succeeded in bringing electricity to virtually all major cities and towns in North America; however, rural areas remained chronically underserved. In 1930 almost 90 percent of farms in the United States were still without access to electric service.<ref>Lewis, J. and Severnini, E. (2014). The Value of Rural Electricity: Evidence from the\nRollout of the U.S. Power Grid. http://www.economichistory.ca/pdfs/2014/lewisSevernini.pdf</ref> Collins was convinced that the best way to win over new customers, including frugal small business owners and skeptical farmers and rural dwellers, was to give his mostly invisible new commodity a more human face.<ref name=r7>Reddy Kilowatt Inc. (1963). The Reddy Kilowatt Story</ref>\n\nAccording to corporate lore, Collins found his inspiration in a dramatic [[Alabama]] [[lightning]] storm.  As he watched the electric discharges strike the ground, he imagined the dancing limbs of a powerful creature, one that could be harnessed in the service of the public.<ref name=r7/> He turned to a colleague, APC engineer Dan Clinton, to create the first drawings of Reddy Kilowatt, an \u201celectrical servant\u201d with lightning bolt arms and legs, wearing safety gloves and shoes.  He added a friendly face with a light bulb nose and wall outlets for ears.<ref name=smithsonian/>\t\n\nAPC copyrighted the character on March 6, 1926.  Over the next few years Reddy appeared in print advertising for the company.  He made his first three-dimensional appearance at the Alabama Electrical Exposition of 1926.<ref name=smithsonian />\n\n==Adolescence==\n[[Image:Reddy Kilowatt US patent picture 1933.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Image of Reddy Kilowatt, 1933: U.S. trademark 302,093]]\nThe onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 would further suppress demand for new electric services and slow progress toward [[rural electrification]].<ref>Beal, R.T. (1940). [http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/IND43893747/PDF Rural Electrification]. US Department of Agriculture.</ref> Collins remained convinced that the Reddy Kilowatt character could be a powerful promoter of electric power.  A lifelong advocate for [[capitalism]], Collins was alarmed by growing government intervention in the sector and also saw Reddy as an ambassador for [[investor-owned utility]] companies (IOUs).<ref name=smithsonian />\n\nIn 1933, IOUs banded together to advance their interests, forming the [[Edison Electric Institute]].  Collins joined the new organization, travelling the [[United States]] to promote the use of electrical energy.  APC gave Collins the rights to the character he created. He engaged a young family friend, Dorothea Warren (1914\u20131999), to refine Reddy Kilowatt's image.  On March 28, 1933 Collins was granted trademark number 302,093 by the [[U.S. Patent Office]]. Warren would go on to become a prolific commercial artist and author of children's books.<ref>Fox Rice, R. [http://www.americanartarchives.com/fox.htm Charles and Dorothea Warren Fox]. American Art Archives</ref>\n\nUnder the umbrella of the Reddy Kilowatt Service (RKS), Collins used his interactions with other IOUs to promote what he called the \u201cReddy Kilowatt Program\u201d.  He entered into his first licensing agreement with the [[Philadelphia Electric Company]] in January 1934.<ref>Oswald, D. (2013). [http://blog.invention.smithsonian.org/tag/trademarks/ Your Electric Servant]. Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation</ref> Over the next couple of years, Collins would add several other major utilities including Ohio Edison Company, [[Pennsylvania Power and Light]], [[Duke Power]], South Carolina Power Company and [[Tennessee Electric Power Company]].<ref name=smithsonian />\n \nRKS entered into a contract with each licensee.  The original 1934 version was amended in 1941, 1953, 1963, 1968, 1971 and 1976. In signing the contract, the licensing IOU promised to always represent Reddy Kilowatt as \u201cgenial, likeable, well-mannered [and] even-tempered\u201d and to abide by \u201cgenerally accepted standards of good taste.\u201d<ref name=r2>[http://www.leagle.com/decision/19791413477FSupp936_11282.xml/REDDY%20COMMUNICATIONS%20v.%20ENVIRONMENTAL%20ACTION Reddy Communications v. Environmental Action]. leagle.com</ref>\n\nIn exchange, the licensee was guaranteed a range of products and services by RKS.  The most important of these came to be known as the ''Reddy Kilowatt Art Service Reproduction Proofs Book'', a catalogue of Reddy Kilowatt images, applications and stock advertisements that could be used or customized by the utility to promote its electrical services. Using the ''Proofs Book'' as a guide, companies could order mat service sheets and layout art to meet their needs. By the time of its final edition in 1998, the book had grown to hundreds of pages, containing thousands of images.<ref>Reddy Communications Inc. (1998). Reddy Kilowatt Art Service Reproduction Proofs Book.</ref>  RKS also produced a periodical called the ''Reddy Bulletin'', containing news and promotional ideas for licensees.<ref name=smithsonian />\n\nCollins recognized early that Reddy Kilowatt's appeal was without borders.  He first sought and obtained trademark protection for the character in Canada in 1934 and subsequently in Argentina (1937), Great Britain (1938), and Mexico (1938).  Over the years, Reddy would be licensed extensively in the Caribbean, South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia.<ref name=smithsonian />\n\n==Maturity==\n\nWith the impending end of hostilities in the final months of [[World War II]], utility companies began to prepare for a return to a consumer-driven economy, and to respond to 15 years of pent-up demand for new household appliances.  Demand for electric power jumped 14 per cent between 1946 and 1947 alone. An important driver was that, even as demand for electrical energy increased, the cost of energy continued to decline.  When Reddy was created in the mid-20s, a kilowatt-hour cost 55 cents (in constant 1992 dollars).

As early as 1943, Collins approached the prominent American animator [[Walt Disney]] in a bid to adapt Reddy for film. The studio was heavily involved in producing films for the U.S. military at the time and the project did not proceed.<ref>Disney History Institute (January 2010). [http://www.disneyhistoryinstitute.com/2010/01/disney-guest-star-day-with-reddy.html Disney guest star day with Reddy Kilowatt].</ref>\n[[Image:Reddy Kilowatt Reddy Made Magic 1946.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Reddy Kilowatt, 1946, as adapted by the Walter Lantz studio]] \nTwo years later, Collins approached another noted animator, [[Walter Lantz]], with the idea of starring Reddy on the big screen. Lantz, whose characters like [[Woody Woodpecker]] and [[Andy Panda]] were well known to theatre-goers of the period, agreed, releasing the [[short film]] ''Reddy Made Magic'' in March 1946. Lantz and Collins shared producing credits on the film, which was directed by [[Dick Lundy (animator)|Dick Lundy]], a former Disney animator. The screenplay, by [[Ben Hardaway]] and Milt Schaffer, featured the story of the creation of electricity as told by Reddy Kilowatt. In conjunction with the film version of ''Reddy Made Magic'', [[Educational Comics]] produced a companion comic book with a cover price of five cents and the subtitle ''The amazing true story of electricity''. Reddy's movie voice was provided by [[Walter Tetley]], the prolific [[Voice acting|voiceover]] actor whose talents were in demand by producers needing a high-pitched, adolescent sound. Tetley's credits included the voice of Sherman, sidekick of [[Jay Ward]]\u2019s canine genius [[Mr. Peabody]].<ref name=r6/>\n\nLantz\u2019s contribution to the Reddy Kilowatt story is considerable.  Prior to 1946, Reddy Kilowatt was usually portrayed as a lanky and sometimes awkward-looking creature.  Lantz\u2019s animators refined Reddy\u2019s look to make his body shorter and more proportional. Reddy\u2019s wide-cuffed (and five-fingered) safety gloves were replaced with four-fingered white gloves of the type traditionally worn by [[Mickey Mouse]] and other popular cartoon creatures. Most important, the Lantz artists broadened Reddy\u2019s grin and added whites to his eyes, instantly increasing his range of expression.\n\nThe Lantz film included a song, sung by Walter Tetley as Reddy. It was later used in advertising and commercial applications by licensees.  Called simply \u201cReddy Kilowatt\u201d, the song was written by jazz artist [[Del Porter]] and [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated composer [[Darrell Calker]].  Its catchy lyric concluded:\n{{quote|I wash and dry your clothes, play your radios, I can heat your coffee pot,\nI am always there, with lots of power to spare, \u2019cause I\u2019m REDDY KILOWATT!<ref>Conelrad Adjacent (September 2, 2010) [http://conelrad.blogspot.ca/2010/09/reddy-kilowatt-embraces-atomic-energy.html Reddy Kilowatt Embraces Atomic Energy]</ref>}}\n\nIn 1953 Collins incorporated RKS as Reddy Kilowatt, Inc., (RKI) establishing its head office in [[New York City]]. The company continued to provide a range of products and services to licensees.  In addition to the Proofs Book, RKI produced a handbook with guidelines to assist utilities in using Reddy to their advantage.  The ''Reddy Bulletin'' was replaced around 1942 by ''Reddy News'', a glossy periodical that highlighted successes and best practices of RKI licensees.<ref name=smithsonian />\n\nRKI continued to aggressively promote its Reddy Kilowatt trademarks worldwide.  By 1957, 222 utility companies around the world had licensed use of the character.<ref name=r5>Reddy Kilowatt, Inc., [http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/240/282/119473/ Appellant, v.

Trinkets ranging from men's and women's jewellery, writing instruments and lighters, to oven mitts, aprons and playing cards, featured Reddy Kilowatt's consistently smiling face. Collins\u2019 prime objective remained unchanged: to provide a human, accessible face to the business of energy generation.  The theme is evident in RKI art from the time: a winded Reddy running uphill to demonstrate the stress of rising costs; Reddy in hunting togs warning shooters away from power lines; a smiling Reddy framing a power bill as his \u201cwages\u201d.<ref name=\"Reddy Communications Inc 1998\">Reddy Communications Inc.

The company encouraged licensees to spread this message to young people. Beginning in the late 1940s, utilities began to sponsor \u201cReddy Kilowatt Youth Clubs\u201d, incorporating educational activities with capitalist values.<ref name=smithsonian /> At the same time, RKI distributed stock advertisements with conservative political messages for use by licensees. Among the promotions for electric heat and appliances were images of a visibly sweating Reddy warning that government ownership of utilities is \u201cSocialism \u2013 the twin brother of Communism \u2013 and we don\u2019t want either of those isms!\u201d<ref name=\"Reddy Communications Inc 1998\"/>\n\nRKI took steps to vigorously protect its intellectual property. In 1956, RKI sued the [[National Rural Electric Cooperative Association]], an association of [[cooperative]]-owned utilities, for trademark infringement. Four years earlier, the organization had introduced Willie Wiredhand, a character with a body of electric cable and electric plug feet.  On January 7, 1957 the court ruled the characters were different and dismissed the complaint.<ref name=r5/>\n\nIn 1958, [[John Sutherland (producer)|John Sutherland]] Productions updated ''Reddy Made Magic'' for the atomic age, producing the short film ''The Mighty Atom''.  The film incorporated some footage from ''Reddy Made Magic''. As before, the film's release was followed by a companion comic book.

The growing influence of the [[environmental movement]] in the late '60s, coupled with the [[1973 oil crisis|fuel shortages]] of the early '70s, had directed the utilities\u2019 focus away from expansion and toward conservation. RKI began to advise its licensees on environmental issues, urging them to use the character to advance a message of \"environmental improvement.\"<ref>Bender, L.M. (June 1972).

In the late '90s Reddy hung up his pointed-toed safety boots, replacing them with track shoes.<ref name=\"Reddy Communications Inc 1998\"/>\n\nIn 1976, in an effort to broaden its range of marketable services, RKI would rebrand itself as Reddy Communications, Inc. [RCI], moving its headquarters to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]].<ref name=smithsonian />\n\n\"Reddy,\" insisted Louise Bender in 1978, \"is the friend of the consumer,\" adding that urging users to keep their power consumption down was just fulfilling his mission;<ref name=r3/> however, the character's updated image was not an easy fit.  Reddy Kilowatt had acted as a cheerleader for energy consumption for more than half a century and his transformation to environmentalist was viewed skeptically by many.  Conservation groups and editorial cartoonists began to appropriate the character in ironic and negative ways to satirize the energy industry, to the irritation of the company.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00139157.1972.9930641| title = Letters| journal = Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development| volume = 14| issue = 8| pages = 43\u201344| year = 1972}}</ref>  In a 1979 case, RCI sued the Environmental Action Foundation (EAF) for its use of Reddy's image to criticize the industry in its publications. The court sided with the EAF and concluded that their parody of the character was fair use.<ref name=r2/>\n\nReddy's decline was hastened further by skyrocketing energy prices in the late 20th century. The changing corporate environment led to mergers, consolidations and government takeovers of energy companies, running afoul of the company's decree that only investor-owned utilities could license the use of Reddy's image. In one example, the Province of [[Nova Scotia]] moved to acquire [[Nova Scotia Light and Power]], a Reddy Kilowatt licensee since 1948. Immediately after the sale concluded in January 1972, company officials fanned out across the system to excise the character's image from signs, vehicles and structures. The corporate [[logo]], which formerly featured a beaming Reddy Kilowatt gripping a placard with the company name, was reduced to an unadorned triangle, sometimes with Reddy's amputated fingers remaining as evidence of his passing.<ref>Nova Scotia Light and Power Company,  Limited, Annual Report, 1972.</ref>\n\nA final nail in Reddy's coffin was the general fall from grace of fictional and animated characters as corporate spokespersons.

He engaged a young family friend, Dorothea Warren (1914\u20131999), to refine Reddy Kilowatt's image.  On March 28, 1933 Collins was granted trademark number 302,093 by the [[U.S. Patent Office]].

Reddy Kilowatt Art Service Reproduction Proofs Book.</ref>  RKS also produced a periodical called the ''Reddy Bulletin'', containing news and promotional ideas for licensees.<ref name=smithsonian />\n\nCollins recognized early that Reddy Kilowatt's appeal was without borders.  He first sought and obtained trademark protection for the character in Canada in 1934 and subsequently in Argentina (1937), Great Britain (1938), and Mexico (1938).  Over the years, Reddy would be licensed extensively in the Caribbean, South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia.<ref name=smithsonian />\n\n==Maturity==\n\nWith the impending end of hostilities in the final months of [[World War II]], utility companies began to prepare for a return to a consumer-driven economy, and to respond to 15 years of pent-up demand for new household appliances.  Demand for electric power jumped 14 per cent between 1946 and 1947 alone. An important driver was that, even as demand for electrical energy increased, the cost of energy continued to decline.  When Reddy was created in the mid-20s, a kilowatt-hour cost 55 cents (in constant 1992 dollars).  By 1947 it had fallen to 19 cents, and it would continue to fall over the ensuing two decades.<ref>Smithsonian Institution (2002). [http://americanhistory.si.edu/powering/past/history2.htm Powering the past].</ref>  \nAshton Collins saw that Reddy Kilowatt could play an important role in promoting electrical use in a period of post-war prosperity, but recognized a need to refine the character's image.  As early as 1943, Collins approached the prominent American animator [[Walt Disney]] in a bid to adapt Reddy for film. The studio was heavily involved in producing films for the U.S. military at the time and the project did not proceed.<ref>Disney History Institute (January 2010). [http://www.disneyhistoryinstitute.com/2010/01/disney-guest-star-day-with-reddy.html Disney guest star day with Reddy Kilowatt].</ref>\n[[Image:Reddy Kilowatt Reddy Made Magic 1946.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Reddy Kilowatt, 1946, as adapted by the Walter Lantz studio]] \nTwo years later, Collins approached another noted animator, [[Walter Lantz]], with the idea of starring Reddy on the big screen. Lantz, whose characters like [[Woody Woodpecker]] and [[Andy Panda]] were well known to theatre-goers of the period, agreed, releasing the [[short film]] ''Reddy Made Magic'' in March 1946. Lantz and Collins shared producing credits on the film, which was directed by [[Dick Lundy (animator)|Dick Lundy]], a former Disney animator. The screenplay, by [[Ben Hardaway]] and Milt Schaffer, featured the story of the creation of electricity as told by Reddy Kilowatt. In conjunction with the film version of ''Reddy Made Magic'', [[Educational Comics]] produced a companion comic book with a cover price of five cents and the subtitle ''The amazing true story of electricity''. Reddy's movie voice was provided by [[Walter Tetley]], the prolific [[Voice acting|voiceover]] actor whose talents were in demand by producers needing a high-pitched, adolescent sound. Tetley's credits included the voice of Sherman, sidekick of [[Jay Ward]]\u2019s canine genius [[Mr. Peabody]].<ref name=r6/>\n\nLantz\u2019s contribution to the Reddy Kilowatt story is considerable.  Prior to 1946, Reddy Kilowatt was usually portrayed as a lanky and sometimes awkward-looking creature.  Lantz\u2019s animators refined Reddy\u2019s look to make his body shorter and more proportional. Reddy\u2019s wide-cuffed (and five-fingered) safety gloves were replaced with four-fingered white gloves of the type traditionally worn by [[Mickey Mouse]] and other popular cartoon creatures. Most important, the Lantz artists broadened Reddy\u2019s grin and added whites to his eyes, instantly increasing his range of expression.\n\nThe Lantz film included a song, sung by Walter Tetley as Reddy. It was later used in advertising and commercial applications by licensees.  Called simply \u201cReddy Kilowatt\u201d, the song was written by jazz artist [[Del Porter]] and [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated composer [[Darrell Calker]].  Its catchy lyric concluded:\n{{quote|I wash and dry your clothes, play your radios, I can heat your coffee pot,\nI am always there, with lots of power to spare, \u2019cause I\u2019m REDDY KILOWATT!<ref>Conelrad Adjacent (September 2, 2010) [http://conelrad.blogspot.ca/2010/09/reddy-kilowatt-embraces-atomic-energy.html Reddy Kilowatt Embraces Atomic Energy]</ref>}}\n\nIn 1953 Collins incorporated RKS as Reddy Kilowatt, Inc., (RKI) establishing its head office in [[New York City]]. The company continued to provide a range of products and services to licensees.  In addition to the Proofs Book, RKI produced a handbook with guidelines to assist utilities in using Reddy to their advantage.  The ''Reddy Bulletin'' was replaced around 1942 by ''Reddy News'', a glossy periodical that highlighted successes and best practices of RKI licensees.<ref name=smithsonian />\n\nRKI continued to aggressively promote its Reddy Kilowatt trademarks worldwide.  By 1957, 222 utility companies around the world had licensed use of the character.<ref name=r5>Reddy Kilowatt, Inc., [http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/240/282/119473/ Appellant, v.

Renewable Energy World</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, RKI was a prolific producer of promotional materials and incentives, broadly distributed by licensees. Trinkets ranging from men's and women's jewellery, writing instruments and lighters, to oven mitts, aprons and playing cards, featured Reddy Kilowatt's consistently smiling face. Collins\u2019 prime objective remained unchanged: to provide a human, accessible face to the business of energy generation.  The theme is evident in RKI art from the time: a winded Reddy running uphill to demonstrate the stress of rising costs; Reddy in hunting togs warning shooters away from power lines; a smiling Reddy framing a power bill as his \u201cwages\u201d.<ref name=\"Reddy Communications Inc 1998\">Reddy Communications Inc.

Reddy Kilowatt Art Service Reproduction Proofs Book</ref>\n\n[[Image:Reddy Kilowatt - small wages.jpg|thumb|left|317px|Reddy Kilowatt explains an electricity bill, c. 1959]] \nRKI continued to advance Collins' pro-free enterprise philosophy.  The company encouraged licensees to spread this message to young people. Beginning in the late 1940s, utilities began to sponsor \u201cReddy Kilowatt Youth Clubs\u201d, incorporating educational activities with capitalist values.<ref name=smithsonian /> At the same time, RKI distributed stock advertisements with conservative political messages for use by licensees. Among the promotions for electric heat and appliances were images of a visibly sweating Reddy warning that government ownership of utilities is \u201cSocialism \u2013 the twin brother of Communism \u2013 and we don\u2019t want either of those isms!\u201d<ref name=\"Reddy Communications Inc 1998\"/>\n\nRKI took steps to vigorously protect its intellectual property. In 1956, RKI sued the [[National Rural Electric Cooperative Association]], an association of [[cooperative]]-owned utilities, for trademark infringement. Four years earlier, the organization had introduced Willie Wiredhand, a character with a body of electric cable and electric plug feet.  On January 7, 1957 the court ruled the characters were different and dismissed the complaint.<ref name=r5/>\n\nIn 1958, [[John Sutherland (producer)|John Sutherland]] Productions updated ''Reddy Made Magic'' for the atomic age, producing the short film ''The Mighty Atom''.  The film incorporated some footage from ''Reddy Made Magic''. As before, the film's release was followed by a companion comic book.

The growing influence of the [[environmental movement]] in the late '60s, coupled with the [[1973 oil crisis|fuel shortages]] of the early '70s, had directed the utilities\u2019 focus away from expansion and toward conservation. RKI began to advise its licensees on environmental issues, urging them to use the character to advance a message of \"environmental improvement.\"<ref>Bender, L.M. (June 1972).

In the late '90s Reddy hung up his pointed-toed safety boots, replacing them with track shoes.<ref name=\"Reddy Communications Inc 1998\"/>\n\nIn 1976, in an effort to broaden its range of marketable services, RKI would rebrand itself as Reddy Communications, Inc. [RCI], moving its headquarters to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]].<ref name=smithsonian />\n\n\"Reddy,\" insisted Louise Bender in 1978, \"is the friend of the consumer,\" adding that urging users to keep their power consumption down was just fulfilling his mission;<ref name=r3/> however, the character's updated image was not an easy fit.  Reddy Kilowatt had acted as a cheerleader for energy consumption for more than half a century and his transformation to environmentalist was viewed skeptically by many.  Conservation groups and editorial cartoonists began to appropriate the character in ironic and negative ways to satirize the energy industry, to the irritation of the company.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00139157.1972.9930641| title = Letters| journal = Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development| volume = 14| issue = 8| pages = 43\u201344| year = 1972}}</ref>  In a 1979 case, RCI sued the Environmental Action Foundation (EAF) for its use of Reddy's image to criticize the industry in its publications. The court sided with the EAF and concluded that their parody of the character was fair use.<ref name=r2/>\n\nReddy's decline was hastened further by skyrocketing energy prices in the late 20th century. The changing corporate environment led to mergers, consolidations and government takeovers of energy companies, running afoul of the company's decree that only investor-owned utilities could license the use of Reddy's image. In one example, the Province of [[Nova Scotia]] moved to acquire [[Nova Scotia Light and Power]], a Reddy Kilowatt licensee since 1948. Immediately after the sale concluded in January 1972, company officials fanned out across the system to excise the character's image from signs, vehicles and structures. The corporate [[logo]], which formerly featured a beaming Reddy Kilowatt gripping a placard with the company name, was reduced to an unadorned triangle, sometimes with Reddy's amputated fingers remaining as evidence of his passing.<ref>Nova Scotia Light and Power Company,  Limited, Annual Report, 1972.</ref>\n\nA final nail in Reddy's coffin was the general fall from grace of fictional and animated characters as corporate spokespersons.
