The region has also been home to some of Britain's most renowned writers, including [[Daphne du Maurier]] and [[Agatha Christie]], both of whom set many of their works here, and the South West is also the location of [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex]], the setting for many of his best-known novels.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Politics of England}}\n[[File:High Willhays.jpg|thumb|[[High Willhays]] on [[Dartmoor]], Devon, the region's highest point.]]\n\n===Geology and landscape===\nMost of the region is located on the [[South West Peninsula]], between the [[English Channel]] and [[Bristol Channel]].

The oceanic climate typically experiences cool winters with warmer summers and precipitation all year round, with more experienced in winter. Annual rainfall is about {{convert|1000|mm}} and up to {{convert|2000|mm}} on higher ground.<ref name=\"weather\"/>  Summer maxima averages range from {{convert|18|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|22|\u00b0C}} and winter minimum averages range from {{convert|1|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|4|\u00b0C}} across the south-west.<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web|title=South West England: climate |work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |accessdate=14 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003222/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |archivedate= 5 June 2011 }}</ref> It is the second windiest area of the United Kingdom, the majority of winds coming from the south-west and north-east.<ref name=\"weather\"/> Government organisations predict the region to rise in temperature and become the hottest region in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"future\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/8108383.stm|title=South west faces temperature jump|date=19 June 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nInland areas of low altitude experience the least amount of precipitation. They experience the highest summer maxima temperatures, but winter minima are colder than the coast. Snowfalls are more frequent in comparison to the coast, but less so in comparison to higher ground.<ref name=\"weather\"/> It experiences the lowest wind speeds and sunshine total in between that of the coast and the moors. The climate of inland areas is more noticeable the further north-east into the region.\n\nIn comparison to inland areas, the coast experiences high minimum temperatures, especially in winter, and it experiences slightly lower maximum temperatures during the summer. Rainfall is the lowest at the coast and snowfall is rarer than the rest of the region. Coastal areas are the windiest parts of the peninsula and they receive the most sunshine. The general coastal climate is more typical the further south-west into the region.\n\nAreas of [[moorland]] inland such as: [[Bodmin Moor]], [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] experience lower temperatures and more precipitation than the rest of the southwest (approximately twice as much rainfall as lowland areas), because of their high altitude. Both of these factors also cause it to experience the highest levels of snowfall and the lowest levels of sunshine. Exposed areas of the moors are windier than lowlands and can be almost as windy as the coast.\n\n===Regional identity===\nThe boundaries of the South West region are based upon those devised by central government in the 1930s for civil defence administration and subsequently used for various statistical analyses. The region is also similar to that used in the 17th-century [[Rule of the Major-Generals]] under [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]. (For further information, see [[Historical and alternative regions of England]]). By the 1960s, the South West region (including Dorset, which for some previous purposes had been included in a Southern region), was widely recognised for government administration and statistics. The boundaries were carried forward into the 1990s when regional administrations were formally established as Government Office Regions. A [[South West Regional Assembly|regional assembly]] and [[South West of England Regional Development Agency|regional development agency]] were created in 1999, then abolished in 2008 and 2012 respectively.\n\nIt has been argued that the official South West region does not possess a cultural and historic unity or identity of itself, which has led to criticism of it as an \"artificial\" construct. The large area of the region, stretching as it does from the Isles of Scilly to Gloucestershire, encompasses diverse areas which have little more in common with each other than they do with other areas of England. The region has several TV stations and newspapers based in different areas, and no single acknowledged regional \"capital\".  Many people of the region have some level of a 'South West', or 'West Country' regional identity, although this may not necessarily correspond to an identification with the official government-defined [[Regions of England|region]]. It is common for people in the region to identify at a national level (whether [[English nationalism|English]], [[British nationalism|British]], [[Cornish nationalism|Cornish]], and/or a county or city/town level). Identifying as being from 'the Westcountry', amorphous though it is, tends to be more predominant further into the peninsula where the status of being from the region is less equivocal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | title=The Cornish Question: Devolution in the South-West Region | last=Sandford | first=Mark | publisher=UCL | accessdate=12 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221191805/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | archive-date=21 February 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |title=Regional Spaces: Spaces of Regionalism, Territory, Insurgent Politics and the English Question |publisher=Scribd.com |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118042520/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |archive-date=18 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn particular, [[Cornwall]]'s inclusion in the region is disputed by Cornish nationalists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Cornish Constitutional Convention |url=http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |title=Campaign for a Cornish Assembly |publisher=Cornishassembly.org |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310230049/http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |archive-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The cross-party [[Cornish Constitutional Convention]] and Cornish nationalist party [[Mebyon Kernow]] have campaigned for a [[Cornish Assembly]] ever since the idea of regional devolution was put forward.\n\n===Settlements===\n[[File:Pulteney Bridge, Bath 2.jpg|alt=A three arch stone bridge with buildings on it, over water.

Sweyn ruled Wessex, along with his other realms, from 1013 onwards, followed by his son [[Canute the Great]]. But Cornwall was ''not'' part of his realm of Wessex. A map by the American historian called \"The Dominions of Canute\" (pictured just above) shows that Cornwall, like Wales and Scotland, was part neither of Sweyn Forkbeard's nor of Canute's Danish empire.

In 1140, during the [[The Anarchy|civil war]] of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]]'s reign, the castles of Plympton and [[Rougemont Castle|Exeter]] were held against the king by [[Baldwin de Redvers, 1st Earl of Devon|Baldwin de Redvers]] and this gave rise to the defensive castles at [[Corfe Castle]], [[Powerstock]], [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] and [[Shaftesbury]]. The period saw the growth of towns such as [[Truro]], [[Totnes]], [[Okehampton]] and [[Plympton]] in the west of the region, but these were small compared with the established wealth of ancient [[cathedral city|cathedral cities]] in the east of the region such as [[Exeter]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]]. Wealth grew from sheep farming in the east of the region: church controlled estates such as [[Glastonbury Abbey]] and [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]] became among the richest in England, while [[tin]] and silver mining was important in Devon and Cornwall; [[Stannary Parliament]]s with semi-autonomous powers were established. Farming prospered until it was severely hit by the [[Black Death]] which arrived in [[Dorset]] in 1348 and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread death, with mortality rates perhaps as high as 50% in places. The resulting labour shortage led to changes in feudal practices.

Herschel then built a 20-ft reflecting telescope and invented the [[star count]], working out that the [[Milky Way]] was a disc, which he called a ''grindstone'', and the Milky Way was a galaxy but that that was all the universe contained; he had noticed other [[nebula]]s but did not recognise what these were; only when the Hooker telescope was built sufficiently large-enough in California in 1924, did [[Edwin Hubble]] realise that these nebulas ([[Andromeda Galaxy]]) were other galaxies. The [[Herschel Space Observatory]] was launched by [[European Space Agency|ESA]] in March 2009 to map the Milky Way. Sir [[Arthur C. Clarke]] of [[Minehead]] invented the idea of artificial [[satellite]]s; he sent a letter to [[Harry Wexler]] who then developed the first [[weather satellite]] [[TIROS-1]]. Sir [[Arthur Eddington]] of Weston-super-Mare was the first to realise that [[nuclear fusion]] powered the Sun; previously the age of Sun was thought to be only 20&nbsp;million years old, which he knew had to be older than that; at the 1920 [[British Science Association|British Association]] meeting he said that the Sun converted hydrogen into helium, but he did not know how, and that mass was lost; [[nuclear fission]] was only considered in 1933. [[James Bradley]] was an important astronomer from Gloucestershire, who discovered the [[aberration of light]].\n\n[[Jan Ingenhousz]], the Dutch biologist discovered [[photosynthesis]] in 1779 at [[Bowood House]] in Wiltshire; on 1 August 1774, [[Joseph Priestley]] discovered oxygen at Bowood House.

The oceanic climate typically experiences cool winters with warmer summers and precipitation all year round, with more experienced in winter. Annual rainfall is about {{convert|1000|mm}} and up to {{convert|2000|mm}} on higher ground.<ref name=\"weather\"/>  Summer maxima averages range from {{convert|18|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|22|\u00b0C}} and winter minimum averages range from {{convert|1|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|4|\u00b0C}} across the south-west.<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web|title=South West England: climate |work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |accessdate=14 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003222/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |archivedate= 5 June 2011 }}</ref> It is the second windiest area of the United Kingdom, the majority of winds coming from the south-west and north-east.<ref name=\"weather\"/> Government organisations predict the region to rise in temperature and become the hottest region in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"future\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/8108383.stm|title=South west faces temperature jump|date=19 June 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nInland areas of low altitude experience the least amount of precipitation. They experience the highest summer maxima temperatures, but winter minima are colder than the coast. Snowfalls are more frequent in comparison to the coast, but less so in comparison to higher ground.<ref name=\"weather\"/> It experiences the lowest wind speeds and sunshine total in between that of the coast and the moors. The climate of inland areas is more noticeable the further north-east into the region.\n\nIn comparison to inland areas, the coast experiences high minimum temperatures, especially in winter, and it experiences slightly lower maximum temperatures during the summer. Rainfall is the lowest at the coast and snowfall is rarer than the rest of the region. Coastal areas are the windiest parts of the peninsula and they receive the most sunshine. The general coastal climate is more typical the further south-west into the region.\n\nAreas of [[moorland]] inland such as: [[Bodmin Moor]], [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] experience lower temperatures and more precipitation than the rest of the southwest (approximately twice as much rainfall as lowland areas), because of their high altitude. Both of these factors also cause it to experience the highest levels of snowfall and the lowest levels of sunshine. Exposed areas of the moors are windier than lowlands and can be almost as windy as the coast.\n\n===Regional identity===\nThe boundaries of the South West region are based upon those devised by central government in the 1930s for civil defence administration and subsequently used for various statistical analyses. The region is also similar to that used in the 17th-century [[Rule of the Major-Generals]] under [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]. (For further information, see [[Historical and alternative regions of England]]). By the 1960s, the South West region (including Dorset, which for some previous purposes had been included in a Southern region), was widely recognised for government administration and statistics. The boundaries were carried forward into the 1990s when regional administrations were formally established as Government Office Regions. A [[South West Regional Assembly|regional assembly]] and [[South West of England Regional Development Agency|regional development agency]] were created in 1999, then abolished in 2008 and 2012 respectively.\n\nIt has been argued that the official South West region does not possess a cultural and historic unity or identity of itself, which has led to criticism of it as an \"artificial\" construct. The large area of the region, stretching as it does from the Isles of Scilly to Gloucestershire, encompasses diverse areas which have little more in common with each other than they do with other areas of England. The region has several TV stations and newspapers based in different areas, and no single acknowledged regional \"capital\".  Many people of the region have some level of a 'South West', or 'West Country' regional identity, although this may not necessarily correspond to an identification with the official government-defined [[Regions of England|region]]. It is common for people in the region to identify at a national level (whether [[English nationalism|English]], [[British nationalism|British]], [[Cornish nationalism|Cornish]], and/or a county or city/town level). Identifying as being from 'the Westcountry', amorphous though it is, tends to be more predominant further into the peninsula where the status of being from the region is less equivocal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | title=The Cornish Question: Devolution in the South-West Region | last=Sandford | first=Mark | publisher=UCL | accessdate=12 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221191805/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | archive-date=21 February 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |title=Regional Spaces: Spaces of Regionalism, Territory, Insurgent Politics and the English Question |publisher=Scribd.com |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118042520/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |archive-date=18 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn particular, [[Cornwall]]'s inclusion in the region is disputed by Cornish nationalists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Cornish Constitutional Convention |url=http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |title=Campaign for a Cornish Assembly |publisher=Cornishassembly.org |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310230049/http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |archive-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The cross-party [[Cornish Constitutional Convention]] and Cornish nationalist party [[Mebyon Kernow]] have campaigned for a [[Cornish Assembly]] ever since the idea of regional devolution was put forward.\n\n===Settlements===\n[[File:Pulteney Bridge, Bath 2.jpg|alt=A three arch stone bridge with buildings on it, over water.

The region has the lowest number of people registered on higher education courses at FE colleges.\n\nThe University of Bristol receives the most total funding, according to [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] figures for the 2006/2007 academic year,  and the largest research grant\u2014twice as big as any other in the region.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2007/07_18/outputSW.pdf | format= PDF | publisher= HEFCE | work= Regional profiles of higher education 2007 | title= South West Region | accessdate= 31 March 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091112183516/http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2007/07_18/outputSW.pdf | archive-date= 12 November 2009 | url-status= live }}</ref> Bath has the next largest research grant, closely followed by Exeter. UWE and Plymouth get small research grants, but no other universities in the region receive much of a research grant. The University of Plymouth has the largest teaching grant.\n\nOf the region's students (postgraduate and undergraduate), 50% are from the region, and around 40% from other regions. For full-time first degree students, 35% come from the region, around 22% are from [[South East England]], and 8% are from London. Including the [[East of England]], around 70% are from [[Southern England]]. 10% are from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], and 5% from [[Northern England]]. The main access for students from the north is the [[Cross Country Route]]. Around 33% of native South West students stay in the region, with 18% going to the South East (around 60% stay in the south of England). Around 14% go to Wales, but very few go to the East of England. Access by road or rail to the East of England region is not straightforward, with around the same amount of travel as to Scotland. Many more native South West students are prepared to go to the north of England, than northern students are prepared to study in the South West. Once graduated, around 50% stay in the region, with 15% each going to London or the South East (around 80% find work in the south of England). Very few go elsewhere (especially the north of England); around 4% go to the West Midlands or Wales.\n\n==Local media==\n[[File:BBC Radio Swindon - geograph.org.uk - 110351.jpg|thumb|right|[[BBC Wiltshire]] building in Swindon]]\n;TV\n*[[BBC South West]], based in [[Plymouth]] with the ''[[Spotlight (BBC News)|Spotlight]]'' regional programme.\n*[[BBC West]], based in [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] in Bristol with the ''[[BBC Points West|Points West]]'' regional programme. \n*[[ITV West Country]], based in Bristol (following the merger of [[ITV Wales & West|ITV West]] and [[ITV Westcountry]]), with the ''[[ITV News West Country]]'' regional programme.\n*N.B.

Possible character classes include hunter, blacksmith and sage.<ref name = \"jussi\" /> The contents of the game box included three rulebooks and dice.\n\nDesigner Pasi Janhunen said he had \"sunk incredible time and, when necessary, equity\" into the game, and that he planned to create expansions and adventures for ''ANKH '' as well as a separate board game. However, the game was not a commercial success, and no further material was published.<ref name = \"jussi\" />\n\n==Reception==\nIn the 1994 book ''Roolipeliopas'' (''Role-playing Guide''), Lauri Tudeer recalled that ''ANKH'' \"was disappointing compared to the advertising campaign.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Tudeer | first=Lauri | title =  Roolipeliopas| publisher = Arctic Ranger Productions | date = 1994 | page = 51|language=Finnish}}</ref>\n\nIn their 2007 book ''Roolipelikirja'' (''Role Playing Book''), Jukka S\u00e4rkij\u00e4rvi and Kaj Sotala believed the game design's reliance on other role-playing games explained its lack of success, but thought it might have some value as a collectible: \"''ANKH'' may not contain very innovative game design, but it is an interesting curiosity for collectors.\"<ref> {{cite book | last1=S\u00e4rkijpevi |first1= Jukka | last2 = Sotala | first2=  Kaj | title = Roolipelikirja | date = 2007 | page = 156|language=Finnish}}</ref>\n\n== References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Fantasy role-playing games]]\n[[Category:Finnish role-playing games]]\n[[Category:Kalevala]]\n\n\n{{rpg-stub}}\n", "name_user": "GoingBatty", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced:1988\u2192 1988 (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventurers_of_the_North_-_Kalevala_Heroes"}
