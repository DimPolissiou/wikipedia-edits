Two of Troy's four National Historic Landmarks, the [[W. & L.E. Gurley Building|Gurley Building]] and [[Troy Savings Bank]], are located within its boundaries. Nine other buildings are listed on the Register in their own right. Among the architects represented are [[Alexander Jackson Davis]], [[George B. Post]], [[Calvert Vaux]] and [[Frederick Clarke Withers]]. There are many buildings designed  by the regionally significant architect [[Marcus F. Cummings]]. The downtown street plan was borrowed from [[Philadelphia]], and one neighborhood, Washington Square, was influenced by [[Squares in London|London's squares]] of its era.\n\nThe district reflects Troy's evolution from its origins as a [[Hudson River]] port into an [[industrialization|early industrial]] center built around [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile manufacture]] and [[steelmaking]]. During this period it was rebuilt twice in the wake of two devastating [[structure fire|fires]], resulting in its mix of architecture styles. After the decline of its industries in the mid-20th century, downtown Troy was threatened by [[urban renewal]] efforts that galvanized local [[historic preservation|preservationists]], leading to the early NRHP listings and eventually the creation of the district.\n\nToday, the city of Troy protects and preserves the district with special provisions in its [[Zoning in the United States|zoning]] and programs which, with assistance from the state of New York, encourage and subsidize property owners who maintain and [[building restoration|restore]] historic buildings. These efforts have paid off with increased attention from [[land developer|developers]], the revival of much of the area, and praise from visitors to the city. With the collaboration of nearby [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI), Troy is hoping to make the district a center for the development of cutting-edge technologies, a \"[[Silicon Valley]] of the 19th century.\"<ref name=\"Reinventing Troy\">{{Cite news |last=O'Brien |first=Tim |title=Reinventing Troy |url= http://www.rpi.edu/dept/NewsComm/Magazine/spring04/features/2-1.html |publisher=[[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] |work=Rensselaer |date=Spring 2004 |accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe district boundary was drawn to include the highest concentration of historic resources. The street plan dates to 1787 and the most recent historic building dates to 1940, making those years the period of significance. While some newer buildings are inevitably located within the area, the boundary, where possible, excluded significant mid and late 20th-century buildings like the city hall, low-income [[housing project]]s, and the [[Uncle Sam Atrium]], a large [[shopping mall]] downtown. All of the original five historic districts are included in full, along with other historic neighborhoods,<ref name=\"NRHP nom3\" /> for a total of 10% of the city's area.<ref name=\"NRHP nom11\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], p. 11</ref>\n[[File:Map of central Troy historic district 2.svg |thumb|250px |left |alt=A map of the district shows its irregular shape, which extends roughly from Adams Street at the south to Grand Street at the north; and First Street, River Street, Front Street at the west to Third Street, Fourth Street, and Union Street at the east.|Map of the district<br />{{Color box|red|border=darkgray}} Current (single) district<br />{{Color box|#00FF00|border=darkgray}} Original districts]]\nIt is centered around the axes of [[U.S. Route 4 in New York|US 4]] and [[New York State Route 2|NY 2]], both of which divide into [[one-way street]]s (Third and Fourth, and Congress and Ferry, respectively) to facilitate traffic flow through the city.  Monument Square, the center of Troy since the late 19th century, along with all the buildings around it (save for the late 20th-century [[brutalism|brutalist]] City Hall, demolished in 2011<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowe |first=Kenneth |title=State cites Troy over City Hall demolition |url= http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/State-cites-Troy-over-City-Hall-demolition-977535.php |accessdate=13 August 2013|newspaper=Albany Times-Union|date=January 26, 2011}}</ref>) are located within its northwestern corner. At its western end it is partially bounded by the [[Hudson River]] and the former River Street Historic District.<ref name=\"NRHP nom4-5\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], pp. 4\u20135, 155</ref>\n\nTo the south it includes the older buildings of [[Russell Sage College]], Washington Square Park and the houses on Adams Street, the district's southern boundary. The mostly regular southeastern boundary follows Clinton Street until it reaches Ferry. Then it becomes ragged and irregular, reaching the district's northernmost extent at the former Grand Street Historic District. This extension allows it to include as well the Gurley Building and its surrounding neighborhood, formerly the Fifth Street-Fulton Street Historic District.<ref name=\"NRHP nom4-5\" />\n\nTo the east of the district [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI), Troy's most notable institution of higher learning, is situated on a low rise overlooking downtown. RPI has played an increasing role in the district in recent years, and now owns several notable buildings.\n\nThe entire district is densely developed, primarily residential in its northern and southern portions, with commercial [[land use|use]] concentrated in central blocks near Monument Square. The only significant [[Open space reserve|open space]]s within it are the one-block Washington Park near its southern end and Seminary Park, the main [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]] at Russell Sage. Most of the major streets and the central area of the district are lined with multi-story dwellings that are primarily commercial but with a [[mixed-use development|mix]] of office and residential space on their upper floors. On the side streets, there are smaller-scale residential [[townhouse]]s. Institutional use is limited to Russell Sage, a few churches, RPI's buildings and governmental structures like the county courthouse and [[U.S. Post Office (Troy, New York)|post office]]. No industrial use, past or present, is within the district, with the notable exception of the Gurley Building, and even that has been scaled back in recent years.\n\n===2016 expansion===\n\nIn 2014 the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|State Historic Preservation Board]] considered a boundary adjustment that removes a small area at the northeast corner but adds far more, primarily at the southeast. It would include a total of 200 new contributing properties and extend the district's period of significance to 1978, to take into account the city's [[urban renewal]] era. Most of the new areas had been found to be consistent with those already included in the district or accidentally excluded when the district was originally designated.<ref name=\"LaFrank 5\u20138\">LaFrank, 5\u20138</ref> Two years later the [[National Park Service]] officially approved the expansion.<ref name=\"Boundary increase announcement\" />\n\nThe most significant change to the district is the extension on the southeast, to the boundary of the city's Eighth [[Wards of the United States|Ward]] in 1870. Between Adams and Ferry streets, three [[city block|blocks]] would be added, with the new boundary following the west side of St. Mary's Avenue, excluding a newer house at the northwest corner of the Washington Avenue intersection, and then rear property lines to Kennedy Lane and Hill Street just south of Adams.<ref name=\"LaFrank 60\">LaFrank, 60</ref> Two-story [[rowhouse]]s predominate in this area, many built as worker housing during the 19th century, some as early as the [[Federal style|Federal]] period. Some have intact storefronts. It also has the only significant industrial building in the proposed expanded district, the former Lusco Paper Works on the northwest corner of Fifth and Liberty streets. The area has begun to see some [[building restoration|restoration]] efforts, such as some [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] rowhouses on Liberty Street near Fourth, which will benefit from state [[tax credit]]s should the area be added to the district.<ref name=\"LaFrank 5\u20138\" />\n\nOn the west side the boundary would be extended a block, from First to River Street at the [[Congress Street Bridge]] approaches, between Division and Ferry streets.<ref name=\"LaFrank 60\" /> This includes a large brick dorm complex built by [[Russell Sage College]] (RSC) in the early 1960s. It was the college's last large-scale construction project in the city; with its inclusion all of RSC would be within the district. To its south another proposed extension reaches across a small park on First to include the 1905 Beth Tephilah [[synagogue]], a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] brick structure that retains most of its integrity.<ref name=\"LaFrank 5\u20138\" />\n\nTwo other changes take in other significant buildings. Along the north side of Ferry at the district's east, just north of the Eighth Ward addition, the boundary would be extended east, taking in another set of rowhouses on the west side of Fifth and the city's former jail and sheriff's office at the northeast corner of Ferry and Fifth. On the north, the [[Uncle Sam Atrium]] shopping mall and parking garage complex, occupying most of the block between Broadway and Third, Fourth and Fulton streets would now be included.<ref name=\"LaFrank 60\" /> Built in 1978, it is the only significant example of [[modern architecture]] in the district and the last large-scale project built in downtown Troy.<ref name=\"LaFrank 5\u20138\" />\n\nOther, smaller areas proposed for inclusion are a group of brick houses, some of them [[urban decay|blighted]], along the south side of Washington Street between First Street Alley and River; a rowhouse and [[community garden]] on the corners of Adams Street and Second Street Alley; and another group of rowhouses along the west side of Fifth Street between State and Congress Streets.<ref name=\"LaFrank 60\" /> The only areas proposed for removal are large portions of the blocks on the west side of Sixth Avenue on either side of Fulton.

They were widely imitated elsewhere in the city.<ref name=\"NRHP nom143\" />\n\nThe city's industries reached their peak in the 1850s, and the wealth it created explored new architectural trends. The emerging [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] style began to make its mark, particularly in commercial buildings around Monument Square and along \"Bankers' Row\", First between State and River. St. Paul's Place was built around 1850 on the south side of State between Fourth and Fifth. Following the dictates of the Washington Park-area deeds, the houses were built with a unified facade as well as a central [[parapet]].

On the edges of town, some architects began exploring that style's [[Picturesque]] mode. A new row of townhouses at Washington Park went up, and another Second Street row followed in 1855. The following year, St. John's Episcopal Church, at First and Liberty Streets, was the first use of that style for a city church.<ref name=\"NRHP nom142\" />\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Troy's industries played a key role in supporting the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause. The [[Burden Ironworks]] is said to have supplied all the [[Union Army]]'s [[horseshoe]]s, and another local ironworks supplied the ''[[USS Monitor]]'''s [[Ironclad warship|hull plating]].

As before, the city rebuilt quickly, with the area along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street, where Cummings built a row of houses between Fifth and Sixth, most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction. The Gurley Building, too, rose in just eight months from the ashes of its predecessor.<ref name=\"NRHP nom146\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], p. 146</ref> The nearby neighborhood also became desirable, with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth.<ref name=\"Fulton-Fifth HD nom\">{{cite web |last=Waite |first=Diana |title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, Fifth Avenue-Fulton Avenue Historic District |url= http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7609 |publisher= [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] |date=December 1969 |page=28}}</ref>\n\n===Postwar prosperity===\n\nAs the postwar years yielded to the [[Gilded Age]], Troy's prosperity continued.

But the textile industry remained strong, and even grew. Accordingly, its residents continued to embrace new movements in architecture. The 1880 pharmacy building at 137 Second Street featured a highly decorated [[cast iron]] storefront and curved windows showing the influence of the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne Style]].

Two of Troy's four National Historic Landmarks, the [[W. & L.E. Gurley Building|Gurley Building]] and [[Troy Savings Bank]], are located within its boundaries. Nine other buildings are listed on the Register in their own right. Among the architects represented are [[Alexander Jackson Davis]], [[George B. Post]], [[Calvert Vaux]] and [[Frederick Clarke Withers]]. There are many buildings designed  by the regionally significant architect [[Marcus F. Cummings]]. The downtown street plan was borrowed from [[Philadelphia]], and one neighborhood, Washington Square, was influenced by [[Squares in London|London's squares]] of its era.\n\nThe district reflects Troy's evolution from its origins as a [[Hudson River]] port into an [[industrialization|early industrial]] center built around [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile manufacture]] and [[steelmaking]]. During this period it was rebuilt twice in the wake of two devastating [[structure fire|fires]], resulting in its mix of architecture styles. After the decline of its industries in the mid-20th century, downtown Troy was threatened by [[urban renewal]] efforts that galvanized local [[historic preservation|preservationists]], leading to the early NRHP listings and eventually the creation of the district.\n\nToday, the city of Troy protects and preserves the district with special provisions in its [[Zoning in the United States|zoning]] and programs which, with assistance from the state of New York, encourage and subsidize property owners who maintain and [[building restoration|restore]] historic buildings. These efforts have paid off with increased attention from [[land developer|developers]], the revival of much of the area, and praise from visitors to the city. With the collaboration of nearby [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI), Troy is hoping to make the district a center for the development of cutting-edge technologies, a \"[[Silicon Valley]] of the 19th century.\"<ref name=\"Reinventing Troy\">{{Cite news |last=O'Brien |first=Tim |title=Reinventing Troy |url= http://www.rpi.edu/dept/NewsComm/Magazine/spring04/features/2-1.html |publisher=[[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] |work=Rensselaer |date=Spring 2004 |accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe district boundary was drawn to include the highest concentration of historic resources. The street plan dates to 1787 and the most recent historic building dates to 1940, making those years the period of significance. While some newer buildings are inevitably located within the area, the boundary, where possible, excluded significant mid and late 20th-century buildings like the city hall, low-income [[housing project]]s, and the Uncle Sam Atrium, a large [[shopping mall]] downtown. All of the original five historic districts are included in full, along with other historic neighborhoods,<ref name=\"NRHP nom3\" /> for a total of 10% of the city's area.<ref name=\"NRHP nom11\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], p. 11</ref>\n[[File:Map of central Troy historic district 2.svg |thumb|250px |left |alt=A map of the district shows its irregular shape, which extends roughly from Adams Street at the south to Grand Street at the north; and First Street, River Street, Front Street at the west to Third Street, Fourth Street, and Union Street at the east.|Map of the district<br />{{Color box|red|border=darkgray}} Current (single) district<br />{{Color box|#00FF00|border=darkgray}} Original districts]]\nIt is centered around the axes of [[U.S. Route 4 in New York|US 4]] and [[New York State Route 2|NY 2]], both of which divide into [[one-way street]]s (Third and Fourth, and Congress and Ferry, respectively) to facilitate traffic flow through the city.  Monument Square, the center of Troy since the late 19th century, along with all the buildings around it (save for the late 20th-century [[brutalism|brutalist]] City Hall, demolished in 2011<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowe |first=Kenneth |title=State cites Troy over City Hall demolition |url= http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/State-cites-Troy-over-City-Hall-demolition-977535.php |accessdate=13 August 2013|newspaper=Albany Times-Union|date=January 26, 2011}}</ref>) are located within its northwestern corner. At its western end it is partially bounded by the [[Hudson River]] and the former River Street Historic District.<ref name=\"NRHP nom4-5\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], pp. 4\u20135, 155</ref>\n\nTo the south it includes the older buildings of [[Russell Sage College]], Washington Square Park and the houses on Adams Street, the district's southern boundary. The mostly regular southeastern boundary follows Clinton Street until it reaches Ferry. Then it becomes ragged and irregular, reaching the district's northernmost extent at the former Grand Street Historic District. This extension allows it to include as well the Gurley Building and its surrounding neighborhood, formerly the Fifth Street-Fulton Street Historic District.<ref name=\"NRHP nom4-5\" />\n\nTo the east of the district [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI), Troy's most notable institution of higher learning, is situated on a low rise overlooking downtown. RPI has played an increasing role in the district in recent years, and now owns several notable buildings.\n\nThe entire district is densely developed, primarily residential in its northern and southern portions, with commercial [[land use|use]] concentrated in central blocks near Monument Square. The only significant [[Open space reserve|open space]]s within it are the one-block Washington Park near its southern end and Seminary Park, the main [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]] at Russell Sage. Most of the major streets and the central area of the district are lined with multi-story dwellings that are primarily commercial but with a [[mixed-use development|mix]] of office and residential space on their upper floors. On the side streets, there are smaller-scale residential [[townhouse]]s. Institutional use is limited to Russell Sage, a few churches, RPI's buildings and governmental structures like the county courthouse and [[U.S. Post Office (Troy, New York)|post office]]. No industrial use, past or present, is within the district, with the notable exception of the Gurley Building, and even that has been scaled back in recent years.\n\n===2016 expansion===\n\nIn 2014 the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|State Historic Preservation Board]] considered a boundary adjustment that removes a small area at the northeast corner but adds far more, primarily at the southeast. It would include a total of 200 new contributing properties and extend the district's period of significance to 1978, to take into account the city's [[urban renewal]] era. Most of the new areas had been found to be consistent with those already included in the district or accidentally excluded when the district was originally designated.<ref name=\"LaFrank 5\u20138\">LaFrank, 5\u20138</ref> Two years later the [[National Park Service]] officially approved the expansion.<ref name=\"Boundary increase announcement\" />\n\nThe most significant change to the district is the extension on the southeast, to the boundary of the city's Eighth [[Wards of the United States|Ward]] in 1870. Between Adams and Ferry streets, three [[city block|blocks]] would be added, with the new boundary following the west side of St. Mary's Avenue, excluding a newer house at the northwest corner of the Washington Avenue intersection, and then rear property lines to Kennedy Lane and Hill Street just south of Adams.<ref name=\"LaFrank 60\">LaFrank, 60</ref> Two-story [[rowhouse]]s predominate in this area, many built as worker housing during the 19th century, some as early as the [[Federal style|Federal]] period. Some have intact storefronts. It also has the only significant industrial building in the proposed expanded district, the former Lusco Paper Works on the northwest corner of Fifth and Liberty streets. The area has begun to see some [[building restoration|restoration]] efforts, such as some [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] rowhouses on Liberty Street near Fourth, which will benefit from state [[tax credit]]s should the area be added to the district.<ref name=\"LaFrank 5\u20138\" />\n\nOn the west side the boundary would be extended a block, from First to River Street at the [[Congress Street Bridge]] approaches, between Division and Ferry streets.<ref name=\"LaFrank 60\" /> This includes a large brick dorm complex built by [[Russell Sage College]] (RSC) in the early 1960s. It was the college's last large-scale construction project in the city; with its inclusion all of RSC would be within the district. To its south another proposed extension reaches across a small park on First to include the 1905 Beth Tephilah [[synagogue]], a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] brick structure that retains most of its integrity.<ref name=\"LaFrank 5\u20138\" />\n\nTwo other changes take in other significant buildings. Along the north side of Ferry at the district's east, just north of the Eighth Ward addition, the boundary would be extended east, taking in another set of rowhouses on the west side of Fifth and the city's former jail and sheriff's office at the northeast corner of Ferry and Fifth. On the north, the Uncle Sam Atrium shopping mall and parking garage complex, occupying most of the block between Broadway and Third, Fourth and Fulton streets would now be included.<ref name=\"LaFrank 60\" /> Built in 1978, it is the only significant example of [[modern architecture]] in the district and the last large-scale project built in downtown Troy.<ref name=\"LaFrank 5\u20138\" />\n\nOther, smaller areas proposed for inclusion are a group of brick houses, some of them [[urban decay|blighted]], along the south side of Washington Street between First Street Alley and River; a rowhouse and [[community garden]] on the corners of Adams Street and Second Street Alley; and another group of rowhouses along the west side of Fifth Street between State and Congress Streets.<ref name=\"LaFrank 60\" /> The only areas proposed for removal are large portions of the blocks on the west side of Sixth Avenue on either side of Fulton. At the time the district was established, they were occupied by large industrial buildings, both of which were later demolished and replaced by parking lots.<ref name=\"LaFrank 5\u20138\" />\n\n==History==\n\nThe history of the Central Troy Historic District is, particularly in its earlier years, the history of Troy itself. Until the later 19th century, the present downtown area ''was'' the city. Two devastating fires, along with changes in the economy brought about by [[industrialization]], shaped the district into today's architecturally diverse downtown.\n\n===Pre-industrial years===\n[[File:RiverStreetTroy.jpg|thumb|right|Antique District on River Street]]\nPrior to [[American independence|independence]], there had only been a few scattered [[Dutch American|Dutch]] farmers [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|settled]] on the Hudson above Albany. In 1787, a group of [[New England]]ers headed west and persuaded one Jacob Vanderhyden to sell them a large tract which they then [[land subdivision|subdivided]] and named Troy.<ref name=\"NRHP nom138\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], p. 138</ref> The dividing line between two of the family's farms was called Grand Division Street, later shortened to Grand Street.<ref name=\"Grand Street NRHP nom\">{{Cite web|last=Waite|first=Diana|title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, Grand Street Historic District|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7612|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]|pages=6|date=March 1972|accessdate=2008-11-03|quote=Formerly called Grand Division Street, the thoroughfare once formed the boundary between the northern and middle farms of Dirk Van der Hyden, one of the earliest settlers of the Troy area.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420094138/http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7612|archive-date=2012-04-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThey based its grid-like street plan on [[Philadelphia]]'s, with numbered north-south streets running inland from the river after River Street, the city's first commercial center.<ref name=\"NRHP nom138\" /> Lots there, at the time, ran all the way to the river's waterline, giving their owners the unusual advantage of river and street frontage.

Two years later, the visiting [[Fran\u00e7ois Alexandre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt|Duke de la Rochefoucauld]] noted the \"neat and numerous houses\" and active businesses engaged in river-based trade. \"The sight of this activity is truly charming\", he said, in one of the earliest published descriptions of the city.

There are two or three short streets which branch off from the main one, but it is in the latter that all of the principal stores, warehouses and shops are situated.

The access to [[iron ore]] mines in the [[Adirondack Mountains]] also got some local businessmen into [[Iron#Industrial production|iron refining]].

The development of the [[detachable collar]] by Hannah Lord Montague in 1827 had given the city the product that still lends it its \"Collar City\" nickname.<ref name=\"Collar City\">{{cite web|last=Rittner|first=Don|title=The Collar City|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/article11.htm|publisher=[[rootsweb.com]]|work=Troy Record|accessdate=2008-12-21|quote=Mrs. Montague, tired of washing her husband's shirts because only the collars were dirty, decided one day to snip off a collar, wash it, and sew it back on.

Unusual for urban houses, they featured one-and-a-half-story [[portico]]s on their front facades, with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[column]]s, and (originally) side yards. Another house was built at 170, several years later, in a similar style. They were widely imitated elsewhere in the city.<ref name=\"NRHP nom143\" />\n\nThe city's industries reached their peak in the 1850s, and the wealth it created explored new architectural trends. The emerging [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] style began to make its mark, particularly in commercial buildings around Monument Square and along \"Bankers' Row\", First between State and River. St. Paul's Place was built around 1850 on the south side of State between Fourth and Fifth. Following the dictates of the Washington Park-area deeds, the houses were built with a unified facade as well as a central [[parapet]]. The Gilbert Mansion on Second Street west of Washington Park is the most significant detached [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] home from that era.<ref name=\"NRHP nom14\" /><ref name=\"NRHP nom145\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], p. 145</ref>\n[[File:Grand Street, Troy, NY.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Street rowhouses built in wake of 1862 fire]]\n[[Russell Sage]] built a row of [[Gothic Revival]] houses on Second Street in 1846 that survives, albeit without some of their original ornamentation. On the edges of town, some architects began exploring that style's [[Picturesque]] mode. A new row of townhouses at Washington Park went up, and another Second Street row followed in 1855. The following year, St. John's Episcopal Church, at First and Liberty Streets, was the first use of that style for a city church.<ref name=\"NRHP nom142\" />\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Troy's industries played a key role in supporting the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause. The [[Burden Ironworks]] is said to have supplied all the [[Union Army]]'s [[horseshoe]]s, and another local ironworks supplied the ''[[USS Monitor]]'''s [[Ironclad warship|hull plating]]. Its owners would later produce the first [[Bessemer process]] steel in the United States after the war.<ref name=\"NRHP nom145\" />\n\nIn 1862 Troy suffered another major fire, the worst in its history. A [[locomotive]]'s spark ignited the wooden [[Green Island, New York|Green Island]] [[drawbridge]] that existed at the time, and when that could not be contained to the bridge it spread to the east, ultimately devastating 507 buildings over a 16-block area. As before, the city rebuilt quickly, with the area along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street, where Cummings built a row of houses between Fifth and Sixth, most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction. The Gurley Building, too, rose in just eight months from the ashes of its predecessor.<ref name=\"NRHP nom146\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], p. 146</ref> The nearby neighborhood also became desirable, with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth.<ref name=\"Fulton-Fifth HD nom\">{{cite web |last=Waite |first=Diana |title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, Fifth Avenue-Fulton Avenue Historic District |url= http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7609 |publisher= [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] |date=December 1969 |page=28}}</ref>\n\n===Postwar prosperity===\n\nAs the postwar years yielded to the [[Gilded Age]], Troy's prosperity continued.

In 1875, [[George B. Post]] won a competition to build a new home for the [[Troy Savings Bank]], with an upstairs [[auditorium]]. While his building was in the [[Neo-Renaissance|Renaissance Revival]] style of the time, its forms and decorations anticipated his later work in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] vein.<ref name=\"NRHP nom147\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], p. 147</ref><ref name=\"Savings Bank NRHP nom\">Pitt, Carolyn; {{NHLS url|id=89001066|title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, Troy Savings Bank}}, undated, retrieved January 8, 2009.</ref>\n{{multiple image\n | align     = left\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | header_align =\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align = center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Monument Square, Troy, NY.jpg\n | width1    = 140\n | caption1  = [[Soldiers and Sailors Monument (Troy, New York)|Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument]], with [[Troy Savings Bank|Savings Bank]] (center rear) and [[Cannon Building (Troy, New York)|Cannon Building]] (right)\n | image2    = HendrickHudsonHotelTroy.jpg\n | width2    = 138\n | caption2  = The Hendrick Hudson Hotel on Monument Square\n}}\nThe [[Panic of 1873]] put a damper on this growth, and in the interim the city's steel industry began to decline, squeezed by [[competition (economics)|competition]] from newer, more efficient producers in [[Western Pennsylvania]] and the [[Midwest]] on one side and [[labor unrest]] at home. But the textile industry remained strong, and even grew. Accordingly, its residents continued to embrace new movements in architecture. The 1880 pharmacy building at 137 Second Street featured a highly decorated [[cast iron]] storefront and curved windows showing the influence of the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne Style]]. Further down Second Street, industrialist Jonas Heartt's house built that same year is one of the best residential applications of the same style.<ref name=\"NRHP nom148\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], p. 148 \"Infill residential construction on some of Troy's older streets also illustrates the [Queen Anne] style. One of the best examples in the historic district is the Jonas Heartt house at 169 Second Street in Washington Park.\"</ref>\n\nCummings explored the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] mode in several of his buildings at Russell Sage. The Paine Mansion at 49 Second Street applied the same style, with [[arcade (architecture)|arcaded]] entrance [[loggia]] and corner tower, to a home. The brick drugstore annex at 155-157 River Street is a particularly representative commercial example of the style.<ref name=\"NRHP nom149\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], p. 149</ref> In 1893 the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] popularized the [[Neoclassical architecture|Classical]] and [[Neo-Renaissance|Renaissance]] revivals and Beaux-Arts style. They came to Troy very quickly when Marcus Cummings and his son Frederick designed the [[Neoclassicism|Classical Revival]] county courthouse at 80 Second Street, the third to occupy the site, the following year. A short distance away three years later, the Renaissance Revival [[Troy Public Library|Hart Memorial Library]] was built of [[Vermont]] [[marble]], joining the similarly styled 1895 Frear Mansion, also on Second Street.<ref name=\"NRHP nom150\" />\n\nAs the 20th century dawned, builders and architects concentrated their efforts in the northern half of the district, primarily on commercial structures as the downtown area was no longer popular as a place for new residences. Monument Square, created in 1891 when a statue of [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] was erected atop the [[Soldiers and Sailors Monument (Troy, New York)|Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument]] in the triangular area formed by the intersection of Broadway, River and Second streets, became a new focal point of development.<ref name=\"NRHP nom150\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], p. 150</ref> There the [[McCarthy Building (Troy, New York)|McCarthy Building]] on Monument Square, and the similar [[National State Bank Building|National State Bank]] and [[Ilium Building|Ilium]] buildings on Broadway, all built in 1904, show the decorative influence of the era's revival styles.<ref name=\"McCarthy Building NRHP nom\">{{cite web|last=Waite|first=Diana|title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, McCarthy Building|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7623|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]|date=December 1969|accessdate=2008-11-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210080032/http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7623|archivedate=2011-12-10}}</ref><ref name=\"National State Bank Building NRHP nom\">{{cite web|last=Liebs|first=Chester|title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, National State Bank Building|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7626|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]|date=May 1970|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Ilium Building NRHP nom\">{{Cite web|last=Liebs|first=Chester|title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, Ilium Building|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7620|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]|date=May 1970|accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref><ref name=\"NRHP nom151\">[[#Peckham|Peckham]], p. 151</ref> [[Proctor's Theater (Troy, New York)|Proctor's Theater]], ten years later on Fourth Street, continued the tradition.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" /><ref name=\"Proctor's Theater NRHP nom\">{{Cite web|last=Powers|first=Robert|title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, Proctor's Theater|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=11276|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]|date=May 1979|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>\n\nOther architects chose the era's simpler styles, like [[Arts and Crafts Movement#In the United States|Arts and Crafts]], as a contrast.

Its stripped-down [[Neoclassicism|Classical Revival]] style shows the influence of [[Art Deco]] in its smooth, finished surfaces.

The city began the first of several [[urban renewal]] plans shortly after adopting its 1962 [[comprehensive planning|master plan]]. Those plans called for the demolition of many buildings downtown, to be replaced by a new arterial road, large [[public housing]] projects and a [[shopping mall]].

{"title_page": "Troika (ride)", "text_new": "[[File:Troika Cedar Point.jpg|thumb|250px|Troika at [[Cedar Point]] in [[Sandusky, OH]]]]\nThe '''Troika''' is an [[amusement park]] ride designed and manufactured by [[HUSS Park Attractions]] in the mid-1970s. The name [[Wikt:troika|Troika]] means \"group of three\" in Russian, a reference to its three armed design. There are several variations on the design.\n\n== Design ==\n[[HUSS Park Attractions]] designed and manufactured the first Troika [[Amusement park ride|ride]] in the mid-1970s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} It is named after the Russian word meaning [[Wikt:troika|\"group of three\"]], a reference to its three armed design.\n\n==Description and operation==\n[[File:Cedar Point Troika ride (1746).ogv|thumb|Video of the Troika ride at [[Cedar Point]].]]\nA Troika consists of three arms radiating from a central column. At the end of each arm is a wheel-like assembly (star) holding seven gondolas, each of which seats 2 people side by side. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nWhen the ride is activated, the central column rotates clockwise, while the Star at the end of each arm rotates counterclockwise. Hydraulic cylinders then raise the arms to an angle of 40\u00b0. The gondolas do have some capacity to rock from side to side, but this is minimal. At the end of the ride cycle, the arms are lowered, and the rotation stopped. Because it is a relatively mild thrill ride, it is a good ride for younger children or beginning riders who aren't up to riding more extreme attractions, like Huss's own [[Enterprise (ride)|Enterprise]] or [[Top Spin (ride)|Top Spin]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe main safety restraint is a [[Buzz bars|buzz bar]] system, which locks into one of five positions. Huss recommends that riders be at least 42 inches tall with an adult or over 50 inches tall to ride alone.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n==Variants and modern adaptions==\nThe ride is available in both transportable and permanent forms, although due to the total weight and size of the ride (35 tons, plus an additional 27 tons for the temporary base and platform), transportable Troikas are unpopular and uncommon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nPortable versions of the Troika can be disassembled, but due to the size and weight of the machinery and platform, rack onto no fewer than three trailers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===AirBoat===\nHuss now makes a modern version of the Troika, called the AirBoat. It is smaller and can only carry 24 people (with 3 pods and 4 cars per pod). It runs at about the same speed. One example that is no longer running was the Gator Bait ride at [[Six Flags New Orleans]]; this ride closed due to damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Scorpion===\nThe Tivoli Scorpion is based on the same pattern as the Troika, but a much smaller gondola wheel diameter results in greater speed and centripetal force experienced by the riders (claimed to be over {{convert|100|km/h}}).

The name [[Wikt:troika|Troika]] means \"group of three\" in Russian, a reference to its three armed design. There are several variations on the design.\n\n== Design ==\n[[HUSS Park Attractions]] designed and manufactured the first Troika [[Amusement park ride|ride]] in the mid-1970s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} It is named after the Russian word meaning [[Wikt:troika|\"group of three\"]], a reference to its three armed design.\n\n==Description and operation==\n[[File:Cedar Point Troika ride (1746).ogv|thumb|Video of the Troika ride at [[Cedar Point]].]]\nA Troika consists of three arms radiating from a central column. At the end of each arm is a wheel-like assembly (star) holding seven gondolas, each of which seats 2 people side by side. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nWhen the ride is activated, the central column rotates clockwise, while the Star at the end of each arm rotates counterclockwise. Hydraulic cylinders then raise the arms to an angle of 40\u00b0. The gondolas do have some capacity to rock from side to side, but this is minimal. At the end of the ride cycle, the arms are lowered, and the rotation stopped. Because it is a relatively mild thrill ride, it is a good ride for younger children or beginning riders who aren't up to riding more extreme attractions, like Huss's own [[Enterprise (ride)|Enterprise]] or [[Top Spin (ride)|Top Spin]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe main safety restraint is a [[Buzz bars|buzz bar]] system, which locks into one of five positions. Huss recommends that riders be at least 42 inches tall with an adult or over 50 inches tall to ride alone.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n==Variants and modern adaptions==\nThe ride is available in both transportable and permanent forms, although due to the total weight and size of the ride (35 tons, plus an additional 27 tons for the temporary base and platform), transportable Troikas are unpopular and uncommon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nPortable versions of the Troika can be disassembled, but due to the size and weight of the machinery and platform, rack onto no fewer than three trailers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===AirBoat===\nHuss now makes a modern version of the Troika, called the AirBoat. It is smaller and can only carry 24 people (with 3 pods and 4 cars per pod). It runs at about the same speed. One example that is no longer running was the Gator Bait ride at [[Six Flags New Orleans]]; this ride closed due to damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Scorpion===\nThe Tivoli Scorpion is based on the same pattern as the Troika, but a much smaller gondola wheel diameter results in greater speed and centripetal force experienced by the riders (claimed to be over {{convert|100|km/h}}). The Scorpion is significantly lighter than a Troika, making it more popular for operation at carnivals and fairs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Troika Installations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name !!

It was primarily an [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]], [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration]], and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] movement, originally starting as a [[secret society]]. The Know Nothing movement also briefly emerged as a major political party in the form of the American Party. Adherents to the movement were to simply reply \"I know nothing\" when asked about its specifics by outsiders, providing the group with its common name.<ref name=\"Boissoneault\">{{cite web|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|title=How the 19th-Century Know Nothing Party Reshaped American Politics|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/immigrants-conspiracies-and-secret-society-launched-american-nativism-180961915/|website=Smithsonian Magazine|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nSupporters of the Know Nothing movement believed that an alleged \"[[Romanism|Romanist]]\" conspiracy was being planned to subvert civil and religious liberty in the United States, and sought to politically organize native-born [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in what they described as a defense of their traditional religious and political values. The Know Nothing movement is remembered for this theme because of fears by Protestants that Catholic priests and bishops would control a large bloc of voters. In most places, the ideology and influence of the Know Nothing movement lasted only a year or two before disintegrating due to weak and inexperienced local leaders, a lack of publicly declared national leaders, and a deep split over the issue of slavery. In the South, the party did not emphasize anti-Catholicism as frequently as it did in the North, but it became the main alternative to the dominant [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref name=\"Boissoneault\"/>\n\nThe collapse of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] after the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] left an opening for the emergence of a new major political party in opposition to the Democratic Party. The Know Nothing movement managed to elect congressman [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] of [[Massachusetts]] and several other individuals in the [[1854 United States elections|1854 elections]] into the U.S. Congress (with Banks becoming [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] of Representatives), and subsequently coalesced into a new political party known as the American Party. Particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]], the American Party served as a group of politicians who opposed the Democrats. Many also hoped that it would stake out a middle ground between the pro-slavery positions of Democratic politicians and the radical anti-slavery positions of the rapidly emerging [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The American Party nominated former President [[Millard Fillmore]] in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]], although he kept quiet about his membership, and personally refrained from supporting the Know Nothing movement's activities and ideology. Fillmore received 21.5% of the popular vote in the 1856 presidential election, finishing behind the Democratic and Republican nominees.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/know-nothings-opposed-immigration-in-lincoln-s-day/article_504e1b70-3331-5640-9248-0fc62c866a39.html|title='Know Nothings' Opposed Immigration in Lincoln's Day|newspaper=[[The Pantagraph]]|date=January 17, 2016|accessdate=April 11, 2016|last=Kemp|first=Bill}}</ref>\n\nThe party entered a period of rapid decline after Millard Fillmore's loss in the 1856 election, and the controversial ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' decision made by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in 1857 further galvanized opposition to slavery in the North, causing many former Know Nothings to join the Republicans. Most of the remaining members of the party supported the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], which subsequently lost to [[Abraham Lincoln]] of the Republican Party, and said defeat ultimately led to the final dissolution of the Know Nothing movement that same year.\n\n== History ==\nAnti-Catholicism had been a factor in colonial America but played a minor role in American politics until the arrival of large numbers of Irish and German Catholics in the 1840s.<ref>Francis D. Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (Greenwood 1995).</ref> It then reemerged in nativist attacks on Catholic immigration. It appeared in [[New York City|New York]] politics as early as 1843 under the banner of the [[American Republican Party (1843)|American Republican Party]].<ref>Ira M. Leonard, \"The Rise and Fall of the American Republican Party in New York City, 1843\u20131845.\" ''New-York Historical Society Quarterly'' 50 (1966): 151\u201392.</ref> The movement quickly spread to nearby states using that name or Native American Party or variants of it. They succeeded in a number of local and Congressional elections, notably in 1844 in Philadelphia, where the anti-Catholic orator [[Lewis Charles Levin]], who went on to be the first Jewish congressman, was elected Representative from Pennsylvania's 1st district. In the early 1850s, numerous secret orders grew up, of which the Order of United Americans<ref>Louis D. Scisco, ''Political Nativism in New York State'' (1901) p. 267.</ref> and the [[Order of the Star Spangled Banner]] came to be the most important. They merged in New York in the early 1850s as a secret order that quickly spread across the North, reaching non-Catholics, particularly those who were lower middle class or skilled workmen.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2675102|title = Conservatism, Nativism, and Slavery: Thomas R.

When a member was asked about his activities, he was supposed to reply, \"I know nothing.\" Outsiders derisively called them \"Know Nothings\", and the name stuck. In 1855, the Know Nothings first entered politics under the American Party label.<ref>Sean Wilentz. pp. 681\u20132, 693.</ref><ref>Ray A. Billington. pp. 337, 380\u2013406.</ref>\n\n=== Underlying issues ===\nThe immigration of large numbers of [[Irish Catholic|Irish]] and [[German Catholic|German]] Catholics to the United States in the period between 1830 and 1860 made religious differences between Catholics and Protestants a political issue. Violence occasionally erupted at the polls. Protestants alleged that Pope [[Pius IX]] had put down the failed liberal [[Revolutions of 1848]] and that he was an opponent of [[liberty]], [[democracy]] and [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]. One [[Boston]] minister described Catholicism as \"the ally of tyranny, the opponent of material prosperity, the foe of thrift, the enemy of the railroad, the caucus, and the school\".<ref>Ray A. Billington. ''The Protestant Crusade, 1800\u20131860'' (1938) p. 242.</ref><ref>John T. McGreevey. ''Catholicism and American Freedom: A History'' (2003) pp. 22\u20135, 34 (quotation).</ref> These fears encouraged [[conspiracy theories]] regarding papal intentions of subjugating the United States through a continuing influx of Catholics controlled by Irish bishops obedient to and personally selected by the Pope.\n\nIn 1849, an oath-bound [[secret society]], the [[Order of the Star Spangled Banner]], was created by Charles B. Allen in New York City. At its inception, the Order of the Star Spangled Banner only had about 36 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wigwags.wordpress.com/category/the-order-of-the-star-spangled-banner/|title=Order of the Star Spangled Banner|last=Tyree|first=Rene|date=2008-12-29|website=wig-wags.worldpress.com|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref> Fear of Catholic immigration led to a dissatisfaction with the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], whose leadership in many cities included Catholics of Irish descent. Activists formed secret groups, coordinating their votes and throwing their weight behind candidates sympathetic to their cause: {{quote|Immigration during the first five years of the 1850s reached a level five times greater than a decade earlier. Most of the new arrivals were poor Catholic peasants or laborers from Ireland and Germany who crowded into the tenements of large cities. Crime and welfare costs soared.

McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', p. 131|source=}}\n\n=== Rise ===\nIn spring 1854, the Know Nothings carried Boston, [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], and other [[New England]] cities. They swept the state of Massachusetts in the fall 1854 elections, their biggest victory. The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate for mayor of [[Philadelphia]], editor [[Robert T. Conrad]], was soon revealed as a Know Nothing as he promised to crack down on crime, close saloons on Sundays and to appoint only native-born Americans to office\u2014he won by a landslide. In Washington, D.C., Know Nothing candidate [[John T. Towers]] defeated incumbent Mayor [[John Walker Maury]], causing opposition of such proportion that the Democrats, Whigs, and [[Free Soil Party|Freesoilers]] in the capital united as the \"Anti-Know-Nothing Party\". In New York, in a four-way race the Know Nothing candidate ran third with 26%. After the 1854 elections, they exerted decisive influence in Maine, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and California, but historians are unsure about the accuracy of this information due to the secrecy of the party as all parties were in turmoil and the [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] and [[Prohibition of alcohol|prohibition]] issues overlapped with nativism in complex and confusing ways. They helped elect [[Stephen Palfrey Webb]] as [[Mayor of San Francisco]] and [[J. Neely Johnson]] as [[Governor of California]]. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] was elected to Congress as a Know Nothing candidate, but after a few months he aligned with Republicans. A coalition of Know Nothings, Republicans and other members of Congress [[Opposition Party (Northern U.S.)|opposed]] to the Democratic Party elected Banks to the position of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]].\n\nThe results of the 1854 elections were so favorable to the Know Nothings, up to then an informal movement with no centralized organization, that they formed officially as a political party called the American Party, which attracted many members of the now nearly defunct [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] party as well as a significant number of Democrats. Membership in the American Party increased dramatically, from 50,000 to an estimated one million plus in a matter of months during that year.<ref>Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery'', pp. 75\u2013102.</ref>\n\nThe historian Tyler Anbinder concluded: {{quote|The key to Know Nothing success in 1854 was the collapse of the [[second party system]], brought about primarily by the demise of the Whig Party. The Whig Party, weakened for years by internal dissent and chronic factionalism, was nearly destroyed by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. Growing anti-party sentiment, fueled by anti-slavery sentiment as well as [[Temperance movement|temperance]] and nativism, also contributed to the disintegration of the party system. The collapsing second party system gave the Know Nothings a much larger pool of potential converts than was available to previous nativist organizations, allowing the Order to succeed where older nativist groups had failed.<ref>Tyler Anbinder.

Their Ohio success seems to have come from winning over immigrants, especially [[German American]] Lutherans and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] [[Presbyterians]], both hostile to Catholicism. In Alabama, Know Nothings were a mix of former Whigs, discontented Democrats and other political outsiders who favored state aid to build more railroads. Virginia attracted national attention in its tempestuous 1855 gubernatorial election. Democrat [[Henry Alexander Wise]] won by convincing state voters that Know Nothings were in bed with Northern abolitionists. With the victory by Wise, the movement began to collapse in the South.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing 1852\u20131857'' (1947) 2:396\u20138.</ref><ref>John David Bladek, {{\"'}}Virginia Is Middle Ground': The Know Nothing Party and the Virginia Gubernatorial Election of 1855\".

Although most of the new immigrants lived in the North, resentment and anger against them was national and the American Party initially polled well in the South, attracting the votes of many former southern Whigs.<ref name=\"Carey1995\" />\n\nThe party name gained wide but brief popularity. Nativism became a new American rage: Know Nothing candy, Know Nothing tea, and Know Nothing toothpicks appeared. Stagecoaches were dubbed \"The Know Nothing\". In [[East Central Washington, Maine|Trescott]], [[Maine]], a shipowner dubbed his new 700-ton freighter ''Know Nothing.''<ref>David Harry Bennett, ''The Party of Fear: From Nativist Movements to the New Right in American History'' (1988), p. 15.</ref> The party was occasionally referred to, contemporaneously, in a slightly pejorative shortening, \"Knism.\"<ref>William E. Gienapp. ''Salmon P. Chase, Nativism, and the Formation of the Republican Party in Ohio'', pp. 22, 24. ''Ohio History'', p. 93.</ref>\n\n=== Leadership and legislation ===\nHistorian John Mulkern has examined the party's success in sweeping to almost complete control of the Massachusetts legislature after its 1854 landslide victory. He finds the new party was populist and highly democratic, hostile to wealth, elites and to expertise and deeply suspicious of outsiders, especially Catholics. The new party's voters were concentrated in the rapidly growing industrial towns, where Yankee workers faced direct competition with new Irish immigrants. Whereas the Whig Party was strongest in high income districts, the Know Nothing electorate was strongest in the poor districts. They expelled the traditional upper-class closed political leadership class, especially the lawyers and merchants. In their stead, they elected working class men, farmers and a large number of teachers and ministers. Replacing the moneyed elite were men who seldom owned $10,000 in property.<ref>{{cite book|author=John R. Mulkern|title=The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts: The Rise and Fall of a People's Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KyISxp0yfG0C&pg=PA86|year=1990|publisher=University Press of New England|pages=74\u201389|isbn=9781555530716}}</ref>\n\nNationally, the new party leadership showed incomes, occupation and social status that were about average. Few were wealthy, according to detailed historical studies of once-secret membership rosters. Fewer than 10% were unskilled workers who might come in direct competition with Irish laborers. They enlisted few farmers, but on the other hand they included many merchants and factory owners.<ref>Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery'', pp. 34\u201343.</ref> The party's voters were by no means all native-born Americans, for it won more than a fourth of the German and British Protestants in numerous state elections. It especially appealed to Protestants such as the Lutherans, Dutch Reformed and Presbyterians.<ref>{{cite book |first=William E. |last=Gienapp |title=Origins of the Republican Party 1852\u20131856 |year=1987 |pages=538\u2013542 }}</ref>\n\nThe most aggressive and innovative legislation came out of Massachusetts, where the new party controlled all but three of the 400 seats\u2014only 35 had any previous legislative experience. The Massachusetts legislature in 1855 passed a series of reforms that \"burst the dam against change erected by party politics, and released a flood of reforms.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald P. |last=Formisano |title=The Transformation of Political Culture: Massachusetts Parties, 1790s\u20131840s |url=https://archive.org/details/transformationof0000form |url-access=registration |year=1983 |page=[https://archive.org/details/transformationof0000form/page/332 332] }}</ref> Historian Stephen Taylor says: {{quote|[In addition to nativist legislation], the party also distinguished itself by its opposition to slavery, support for an expansion of the rights of women, regulation of industry, and support of measures designed to improve the status of working people.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Taylor |title=Progressive Nativism: The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts |journal=Historical Journal of Massachusetts |year=2000 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=167\u201384 }}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nIt passed legislation to regulate railroads, insurance companies and public utilities. It funded free textbooks for the public schools and raised the appropriations for local libraries and for the school for the blind. Purification of Massachusetts against divisive social evils was a high priority. The legislature set up the state's first reform school for juvenile delinquents while trying to block the importation of supposedly subversive government documents and academic books from Europe. It upgraded the legal status of wives, giving them more property rights and more rights in divorce courts. It passed harsh penalties on speakeasies, gambling houses and bordellos. It passed prohibition legislation with penalties that were so stiff\u2014such as six months in prison for serving one glass of beer\u2014that juries refused to convict defendants. Many of the reforms were quite expensive; state spending rose 45% on top of a 50% hike in annual taxes on cities and towns. This extravagance angered the taxpayers, and few Know Nothings were reelected.<ref>Taylor, \"Progressive Nativism: The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts\" pp. 171\u20132.</ref>\n\nThe highest priority included attacks on the civil rights of Irish Catholic immigrants. After this, state courts lost the power to process applications for citizenship and public schools had to require compulsory daily reading of the Protestant Bible (which the nativists were sure would transform the Catholic children). The governor disbanded the Irish militias and replaced Irish holding state jobs with Protestants. It failed to reach the two-thirds vote needed to pass a state constitutional amendment to restrict voting and office holding to men who had resided in Massachusetts for at least 21 years. The legislature then called on Congress to raise the requirement for naturalization from five years to 21 years, but Congress never acted.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mulkern|title=The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts: The Rise and Fall of a People's Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KyISxp0yfG0C&pg=PA101|year=1990|pages=101\u20132|isbn=9781555530716}}</ref> The most dramatic move by the Know Nothing legislature was to appoint an investigating committee designed to prove widespread sexual immorality underway in Catholic convents.

States-rightist Whigs shunned it, enabling the Democrats to win most of the South. Whigs supported the American Party because of their desire to defeat the Democrats, their unionist sentiment, their anti-immigrant attitudes and the Know Nothing neutrality on the slavery issue.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Some Determinants of Know-Nothing Electoral Strength in the South, 1856|journal=Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association |year=1966 |last=Broussard |first=James H. |volume=7|issue=1|pages=5\u201320|jstor=4230880}}</ref>\n\nDavid T. Gleeson notes that many Irish Catholics in the South feared the arrival of the Know-Nothing movement portended a serious threat. He argues:\n\n<blockquote>The southern Irish, who had seen the dangers of Protestant bigotry in Ireland, had the distinct feeling that the Know-Nothings were an American manifestation of that phenomenon. Every migrant, no matter how settled or prosperous, also worried that this virulent strain of nativism threatened his or her hard-earned gains in the South and integration into its society. Immigrants' fears were unjustified, however, because the national debate over slavery and its expansion, not nativism or anti-Catholicism, was the major reason for Know-Nothing success in the South. The southerners who supported the Know-Nothings did so, for the most part, because they thought the Democrats who favored the expansion of slavery might break up the Union.<ref>David T. Gleeson, ''The Irish in the South, 1815\u20131877'' (2001) p. 78.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1855, the American Party challenged the Democrats' dominance. In Alabama, the Know Nothings were a mix of former Whigs, malcontented Democrats and other political misfits; they favored state aid to build more railroads. In the fierce campaign, the Democrats argued that Know Nothings could not protect slavery from Northern abolitionists. The Know Nothing American Party disintegrated soon after losing in 1855.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Unintended Consequences: The Rise and Fall of the Know-Nothing Party in Alabama |journal=[[Alabama Review]] |year=2002 |last=Frederick |first=Jeff|volume=55|issue=1|pages=3\u201333 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/5569301/unintended-consequences-rise-fall-know-nothing-party-alabama|access-date=January 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Louisiana and Maryland, the Know Nothings enlisted native-born Catholics.<ref name=\"Anbinder1992\">{{cite book|last=Anbinder|first=Tyler|title=Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the Politics of the 1850s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBZxbQRA0JkC&pg=PA103|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-507233-4|page=167}}</ref> Know Nothing congressman [[John Edward Bouligny]] was the only member of the Louisiana congressional delegation to refuse to resign his seat after the state seceded from the Union.<ref>{{cite speech |title=Feb. 5, 1861: Secession of Louisiana |first=John Edward |last=Bouligny |event=Speech in the House of Representatives |location=Washington, D.C. |date=February 5, 1861 |url=https://www.hnoc.org/programs/documents/LessonPlan_CivilWar.pdf |access-date=January 23, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202023424/https://www.hnoc.org/programs/documents/LessonPlan_CivilWar.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In Maryland, the party's influence lasted at least through the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]:  the American Party's Governor and later Senator [[Thomas Holliday Hicks]], Representative [[Henry Winter Davis]], and Senator [[Anthony Kennedy (Maryland)|Anthony Kennedy]], with his brother, former Representative [[John Pendleton Kennedy]], all supported the United States in a State which bordered the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]]. Historian Michael F. Holt argues that \"Know Nothingism originally grew in the South for the same reasons it spread in the North\u2014nativism, anti-Catholicism, and animosity toward unresponsive politicos\u2014not because of conservative Unionism\". Holt cites [[William B. Campbell]], former governor of Tennessee, who wrote in January 1855: \"I have been astonished at the widespread feeling in favor of their principles\u2014to wit, Native Americanism and anti-Catholicism\u2014it takes everywhere\".<ref name=\"Holt2003\">{{cite book|last=Holt|first=Michael F.|title=The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aGyVFn3VnMC|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-516104-5|page=856}}</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\n[[File:KnowNothingPresidentialCounty1856.gif|thumb|250px|Results by county indicating the percentage for Fillmore in each county]]\nThe party declined rapidly in the North after 1855. In the [[1856 U.S. presidential election|presidential election of 1856]], it was bitterly divided over slavery. The main faction supported the ticket of presidential nominee [[Millard Fillmore]] and vice presidential nominee [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]]. Fillmore, a former President, had been a Whig and Donelson was the nephew of Democratic President [[Andrew Jackson]], so the ticket was designed to appeal to loyalists from both major parties, winning 23% of the popular vote and carrying one state, [[Maryland]], with eight electoral votes. Fillmore did not win enough votes to block Democrat [[James Buchanan]] from the White House. During this time, Nathaniel Banks decided he was not as strongly for the anti-immigrant platform as the party wanted him to be, so he left the Know Nothing Party for the more anti-slavery Republican Party. He contributed to the decline of the Know Nothing Party by taking two-thirds of its members with him.\n\nMany were appalled by the Know Nothings. [[Abraham Lincoln]] expressed his own disgust with the political party in a private letter to [[Joshua Speed]] written August 24, 1855. Lincoln never publicly attacked the Know Nothings, whose votes he needed:\n\n<blockquote>I am not a Know-Nothing\u2014that is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that \"all men are created equal.\" We now practically read it \"all men are created equal, except negroes.\" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \"all men are created equals, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.\" When it comes to that I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty\u2014to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Francis Fisher|authorlink1=Francis Fisher Browne|title=The Every-day Life of Abraham Lincoln: A Narrative and Descriptive Biography with Pen-pictures and Personal Recollections by Those Who Knew Him|date=1914|publisher=Browne & Howell|page=[https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeabr03browgoog/page/n210 153]|url=https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeabr03browgoog|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Allan Nevins]], writing about the turmoil preceding the American Civil War, states that Millard Fillmore was never a Know Nothing nor a nativist. Fillmore was out of the country when the presidential nomination came and had not been consulted about running.  Nevins further states:\n\n<blockquote>[Fillmore] was not a member of the party; he had never attended an American [Know-Nothing] gathering. By no spoken or written word had he indicated a subscription to American [Party] tenets.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing 1852\u20131857'' (1947), 2:467</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the Supreme Court's controversial ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruling in 1857, most of the anti-slavery members of the American Party joined the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. The pro-slavery wing of the American Party remained strong on the local and state levels in a few southern states, but by the [[1860 U.S. presidential election|1860 election]], they were no longer a serious national political movement. Most of their remaining members supported the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in 1860.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Anbinder |first=Tyler |year=1992 |title=Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the Politics of the 1850s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBZxbQRA0JkC&pg=PA270#v=twopage&q&f=false |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=270 |isbn=9780195072334 |oclc=925224120}}</ref>\n\n== Electoral history ==\n=== Congressional elections ===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|+United States<br />House of Representatives\n|-\n!Election year\n!No. of<br />overall seats won\n!+/\u2013\n!Presidency\n|-{{Party shading/Democratic}}\n![[1844 United States House of Representatives elections|1844]]\n|{{composition bar|6|227|hex=#999999}}\n|{{increase}} 6\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} & rowspan=\"2\"|[[James K.

It was primarily an [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]], [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration]], and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] movement, originally starting as a [[secret society]]. The Know Nothing movement also briefly emerged as a major political party in the form of the American Party. Adherents to the movement were to simply reply \"I know nothing\" when asked about its specifics by outsiders, providing the group with its common name.<ref name=\"Boissoneault\">{{cite web|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|title=How the 19th-Century Know Nothing Party Reshaped American Politics|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/immigrants-conspiracies-and-secret-society-launched-american-nativism-180961915/|website=Smithsonian Magazine|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nSupporters of the Know Nothing movement believed that an alleged \"[[Romanism|Romanist]]\" conspiracy was being planned to subvert civil and religious liberty in the United States, and sought to politically organize native-born [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in what they described as a defense of their traditional religious and political values. The Know Nothing movement is remembered for this theme because of fears by Protestants that Catholic priests and bishops would control a large bloc of voters. In most places, the ideology and influence of the Know Nothing movement lasted only a year or two before disintegrating due to weak and inexperienced local leaders, a lack of publicly declared national leaders, and a deep split over the issue of slavery. In the South, the party did not emphasize anti-Catholicism as frequently as it did in the North, but it became the main alternative to the dominant [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref name=\"Boissoneault\"/>\n\nThe collapse of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] after the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] left an opening for the emergence of a new major political party in opposition to the Democratic Party. The Know Nothing movement managed to elect congressman [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] of [[Massachusetts]] and several other individuals in the [[1854 United States elections|1854 elections]] into the U.S. Congress (with Banks becoming [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] of Representatives), and subsequently coalesced into a new political party known as the American Party. Particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]], the American Party served as a group of politicians who opposed the Democrats. Many also hoped that it would stake out a middle ground between the pro-slavery positions of Democratic politicians and the radical anti-slavery positions of the rapidly emerging [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The American Party nominated former President [[Millard Fillmore]] in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]], although he kept quiet about his membership, and personally refrained from supporting the Know Nothing movement's activities and ideology. Fillmore received 21.5% of the popular vote in the 1856 presidential election, finishing behind the Democratic and Republican nominees.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/know-nothings-opposed-immigration-in-lincoln-s-day/article_504e1b70-3331-5640-9248-0fc62c866a39.html|title='Know Nothings' Opposed Immigration in Lincoln's Day|newspaper=[[The Pantagraph]]|date=January 17, 2016|accessdate=April 11, 2016|last=Kemp|first=Bill}}</ref>\n\nThe party entered a period of rapid decline after Millard Fillmore's loss in the 1856 election, and the controversial ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' decision made by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in 1857 further galvanized opposition to slavery in the North, causing many former Know Nothings to join the Republicans. Most of the remaining members of the party supported the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], which subsequently lost to [[Abraham Lincoln]] of the Republican Party, and said defeat ultimately led to the final dissolution of the Know Nothing movement that same year.\n\n== History ==\nAnti-Catholicism had been a factor in colonial America but played a minor role in American politics until the arrival of large numbers of Irish and German Catholics in the 1840s.<ref>Francis D. Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (Greenwood 1995).</ref> It then reemerged in nativist attacks on Catholic immigration. It appeared in [[New York City|New York]] politics as early as 1843 under the banner of the [[American Republican Party (1843)|American Republican Party]].<ref>Ira M. Leonard, \"The Rise and Fall of the American Republican Party in New York City, 1843\u20131845.\" ''New-York Historical Society Quarterly'' 50 (1966): 151\u201392.</ref> The movement quickly spread to nearby states using that name or Native American Party or variants of it. They succeeded in a number of local and Congressional elections, notably in 1844 in Philadelphia, where the anti-Catholic orator [[Lewis Charles Levin]], who went on to be the first Jewish congressman, was elected Representative from Pennsylvania's 1st district. In the early 1850s, numerous secret orders grew up, of which the Order of United Americans<ref>Louis D. Scisco, ''Political Nativism in New York State'' (1901) p. 267.</ref> and the [[Order of the Star Spangled Banner]] came to be the most important. They merged in New York in the early 1850s as a secret order that quickly spread across the North, reaching non-Catholics, particularly those who were lower middle class or skilled workmen.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2675102|title = Conservatism, Nativism, and Slavery: Thomas R.

When a member was asked about his activities, he was supposed to reply, \"I know nothing.\" Outsiders derisively called them \"Know Nothings\", and the name stuck. In 1855, the Know Nothings first entered politics under the American Party label.<ref>Sean Wilentz. pp. 681\u20132, 693.</ref><ref>Ray A. Billington. pp. 337, 380\u2013406.</ref>\n\n=== Underlying issues ===\nThe immigration of large numbers of [[Irish Catholic|Irish]] and [[German Catholic|German]] Catholics to the United States in the period between 1830 and 1860 made religious differences between Catholics and Protestants a political issue. Violence occasionally erupted at the polls. Protestants alleged that Pope [[Pius IX]] had put down the failed liberal [[Revolutions of 1848]] and that he was an opponent of [[liberty]], [[democracy]] and [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]. One [[Boston]] minister described Catholicism as \"the ally of tyranny, the opponent of material prosperity, the foe of thrift, the enemy of the railroad, the caucus, and the school\".<ref>Ray A. Billington. ''The Protestant Crusade, 1800\u20131860'' (1938) p. 242.</ref><ref>John T. McGreevey. ''Catholicism and American Freedom: A History'' (2003) pp. 22\u20135, 34 (quotation).</ref> These fears encouraged [[conspiracy theories]] regarding papal intentions of subjugating the United States through a continuing influx of Catholics controlled by Irish bishops obedient to and personally selected by the Pope.\n\nIn 1849, an oath-bound [[secret society]], the [[Order of the Star Spangled Banner]], was created by Charles B. Allen in New York City. At its inception, the Order of the Star Spangled Banner only had about 36 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wigwags.wordpress.com/category/the-order-of-the-star-spangled-banner/|title=Order of the Star Spangled Banner|last=Tyree|first=Rene|date=2008-12-29|website=wig-wags.worldpress.com|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref> Fear of Catholic immigration led to a dissatisfaction with the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], whose leadership in many cities included Catholics of Irish descent. Activists formed secret groups, coordinating their votes and throwing their weight behind candidates sympathetic to their cause: {{quote|Immigration during the first five years of the 1850s reached a level five times greater than a decade earlier. Most of the new arrivals were poor Catholic peasants or laborers from Ireland and Germany who crowded into the tenements of large cities. Crime and welfare costs soared. Cincinnati's crime rate, for example, tripled between 1846 and 1853 and its murder rate increased sevenfold. Boston's expenditures for poor relief rose threefold during the same period.|[[James M. McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', p. 131|source=}}\n\n=== Rise ===\nIn spring 1854, the Know Nothings carried Boston, [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], and other [[New England]] cities. They swept the state of Massachusetts in the fall 1854 elections, their biggest victory. The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate for mayor of [[Philadelphia]], editor [[Robert T. Conrad]], was soon revealed as a Know Nothing as he promised to crack down on crime, close saloons on Sundays and to appoint only native-born Americans to office\u2014he won by a landslide. In Washington, D.C., Know Nothing candidate [[John T. Towers]] defeated incumbent Mayor [[John Walker Maury]], causing opposition of such proportion that the Democrats, Whigs, and [[Free Soil Party|Freesoilers]] in the capital united as the \"Anti-Know-Nothing Party\". In New York, in a four-way race the Know Nothing candidate ran third with 26%. After the 1854 elections, they exerted decisive influence in Maine, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and California, but historians are unsure about the accuracy of this information due to the secrecy of the party as all parties were in turmoil and the [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] and [[Prohibition of alcohol|prohibition]] issues overlapped with nativism in complex and confusing ways. They helped elect [[Stephen Palfrey Webb]] as [[Mayor of San Francisco]] and [[J. Neely Johnson]] as [[Governor of California]]. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] was elected to Congress as a Know Nothing candidate, but after a few months he aligned with Republicans. A coalition of Know Nothings, Republicans and other members of Congress [[Opposition Party (Northern U.S.)|opposed]] to the Democratic Party elected Banks to the position of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]].\n\nThe results of the 1854 elections were so favorable to the Know Nothings, up to then an informal movement with no centralized organization, that they formed officially as a political party called the American Party, which attracted many members of the now nearly defunct [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] party as well as a significant number of Democrats. Membership in the American Party increased dramatically, from 50,000 to an estimated one million plus in a matter of months during that year.<ref>Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery'', pp. 75\u2013102.</ref>\n\nThe historian Tyler Anbinder concluded: {{quote|The key to Know Nothing success in 1854 was the collapse of the [[second party system]], brought about primarily by the demise of the Whig Party. The Whig Party, weakened for years by internal dissent and chronic factionalism, was nearly destroyed by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. Growing anti-party sentiment, fueled by anti-slavery sentiment as well as [[Temperance movement|temperance]] and nativism, also contributed to the disintegration of the party system. The collapsing second party system gave the Know Nothings a much larger pool of potential converts than was available to previous nativist organizations, allowing the Order to succeed where older nativist groups had failed.<ref>Tyler Anbinder. ''Nativism and Slavery'', p. 95.</ref>}}\n\nIn [[San Francisco, California]], a Know Nothing chapter was founded in 1854 to oppose Chinese immigration\u2014members included a judge of the state supreme court, who ruled that no Chinese person could testify as a witness against a white man in court.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael C.

Their Ohio success seems to have come from winning over immigrants, especially [[German American]] Lutherans and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] [[Presbyterians]], both hostile to Catholicism. In Alabama, Know Nothings were a mix of former Whigs, discontented Democrats and other political outsiders who favored state aid to build more railroads. Virginia attracted national attention in its tempestuous 1855 gubernatorial election. Democrat [[Henry Alexander Wise]] won by convincing state voters that Know Nothings were in bed with Northern abolitionists. With the victory by Wise, the movement began to collapse in the South.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing 1852\u20131857'' (1947) 2:396\u20138.</ref><ref>John David Bladek, {{\"'}}Virginia Is Middle Ground': The Know Nothing Party and the Virginia Gubernatorial Election of 1855\".

Although most of the new immigrants lived in the North, resentment and anger against them was national and the American Party initially polled well in the South, attracting the votes of many former southern Whigs.<ref name=\"Carey1995\" />\n\nThe party name gained wide but brief popularity. Nativism became a new American rage: Know Nothing candy, Know Nothing tea, and Know Nothing toothpicks appeared. Stagecoaches were dubbed \"The Know Nothing\". In [[East Central Washington, Maine|Trescott]], [[Maine]], a shipowner dubbed his new 700-ton freighter ''Know Nothing.''<ref>David Harry Bennett, ''The Party of Fear: From Nativist Movements to the New Right in American History'' (1988), p. 15.</ref> The party was occasionally referred to, contemporaneously, in a slightly pejorative shortening, \"Knism.\"<ref>William E. Gienapp. ''Salmon P. Chase, Nativism, and the Formation of the Republican Party in Ohio'', pp. 22, 24. ''Ohio History'', p. 93.</ref>\n\n=== Leadership and legislation ===\nHistorian John Mulkern has examined the party's success in sweeping to almost complete control of the Massachusetts legislature after its 1854 landslide victory. He finds the new party was populist and highly democratic, hostile to wealth, elites and to expertise and deeply suspicious of outsiders, especially Catholics. The new party's voters were concentrated in the rapidly growing industrial towns, where Yankee workers faced direct competition with new Irish immigrants. Whereas the Whig Party was strongest in high income districts, the Know Nothing electorate was strongest in the poor districts. They expelled the traditional upper-class closed political leadership class, especially the lawyers and merchants. In their stead, they elected working class men, farmers and a large number of teachers and ministers. Replacing the moneyed elite were men who seldom owned $10,000 in property.<ref>{{cite book|author=John R. Mulkern|title=The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts: The Rise and Fall of a People's Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KyISxp0yfG0C&pg=PA86|year=1990|publisher=University Press of New England|pages=74\u201389|isbn=9781555530716}}</ref>\n\nNationally, the new party leadership showed incomes, occupation and social status that were about average. Few were wealthy, according to detailed historical studies of once-secret membership rosters. Fewer than 10% were unskilled workers who might come in direct competition with Irish laborers.

It funded free textbooks for the public schools and raised the appropriations for local libraries and for the school for the blind. Purification of Massachusetts against divisive social evils was a high priority. The legislature set up the state's first reform school for juvenile delinquents while trying to block the importation of supposedly subversive government documents and academic books from Europe. It upgraded the legal status of wives, giving them more property rights and more rights in divorce courts. It passed harsh penalties on speakeasies, gambling houses and bordellos. It passed prohibition legislation with penalties that were so stiff\u2014such as six months in prison for serving one glass of beer\u2014that juries refused to convict defendants. Many of the reforms were quite expensive; state spending rose 45% on top of a 50% hike in annual taxes on cities and towns. This extravagance angered the taxpayers, and few Know Nothings were reelected.<ref>Taylor, \"Progressive Nativism: The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts\" pp. 171\u20132.</ref>\n\nThe highest priority included attacks on the civil rights of Irish Catholic immigrants. After this, state courts lost the power to process applications for citizenship and public schools had to require compulsory daily reading of the Protestant Bible (which the nativists were sure would transform the Catholic children). The governor disbanded the Irish militias and replaced Irish holding state jobs with Protestants. It failed to reach the two-thirds vote needed to pass a state constitutional amendment to restrict voting and office holding to men who had resided in Massachusetts for at least 21 years. The legislature then called on Congress to raise the requirement for naturalization from five years to 21 years, but Congress never acted.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mulkern|title=The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts: The Rise and Fall of a People's Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KyISxp0yfG0C&pg=PA101|year=1990|pages=101\u20132|isbn=9781555530716}}</ref> The most dramatic move by the Know Nothing legislature was to appoint an investigating committee designed to prove widespread sexual immorality underway in Catholic convents.

Gleeson notes that many Irish Catholics in the South feared the arrival of the Know-Nothing movement portended a serious threat. He argues:\n\n<blockquote>The southern Irish, who had seen the dangers of Protestant bigotry in Ireland, had the distinct feeling that the Know-Nothings were an American manifestation of that phenomenon. Every migrant, no matter how settled or prosperous, also worried that this virulent strain of nativism threatened his or her hard-earned gains in the South and integration into its society. Immigrants' fears were unjustified, however, because the national debate over slavery and its expansion, not nativism or anti-Catholicism, was the major reason for Know-Nothing success in the South. The southerners who supported the Know-Nothings did so, for the most part, because they thought the Democrats who favored the expansion of slavery might break up the Union.<ref>David T. Gleeson, ''The Irish in the South, 1815\u20131877'' (2001) p. 78.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1855, the American Party challenged the Democrats' dominance. In Alabama, the Know Nothings were a mix of former Whigs, malcontented Democrats and other political misfits; they favored state aid to build more railroads. In the fierce campaign, the Democrats argued that Know Nothings could not protect slavery from Northern abolitionists. The Know Nothing American Party disintegrated soon after losing in 1855.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Unintended Consequences: The Rise and Fall of the Know-Nothing Party in Alabama |journal=[[Alabama Review]] |year=2002 |last=Frederick |first=Jeff|volume=55|issue=1|pages=3\u201333 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/5569301/unintended-consequences-rise-fall-know-nothing-party-alabama|access-date=January 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Louisiana and Maryland, the Know Nothings enlisted native-born Catholics.<ref name=\"Anbinder1992\">{{cite book|last=Anbinder|first=Tyler|title=Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the Politics of the 1850s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBZxbQRA0JkC&pg=PA103|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-507233-4|page=167}}</ref> Know Nothing congressman [[John Edward Bouligny]] was the only member of the Louisiana congressional delegation to refuse to resign his seat after the state seceded from the Union.<ref>{{cite speech |title=Feb. 5, 1861: Secession of Louisiana |first=John Edward |last=Bouligny |event=Speech in the House of Representatives |location=Washington, D.C. |date=February 5, 1861 |url=https://www.hnoc.org/programs/documents/LessonPlan_CivilWar.pdf |access-date=January 23, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202023424/https://www.hnoc.org/programs/documents/LessonPlan_CivilWar.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In Maryland, the party's influence lasted at least through the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]:  the American Party's Governor and later Senator [[Thomas Holliday Hicks]], Representative [[Henry Winter Davis]], and Senator [[Anthony Kennedy (Maryland)|Anthony Kennedy]], with his brother, former Representative [[John Pendleton Kennedy]], all supported the United States in a State which bordered the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]]. Historian Michael F. Holt argues that \"Know Nothingism originally grew in the South for the same reasons it spread in the North\u2014nativism, anti-Catholicism, and animosity toward unresponsive politicos\u2014not because of conservative Unionism\". Holt cites [[William B.

In the [[1856 U.S. presidential election|presidential election of 1856]], it was bitterly divided over slavery. The main faction supported the ticket of presidential nominee [[Millard Fillmore]] and vice presidential nominee [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]]. Fillmore, a former President, had been a Whig and Donelson was the nephew of Democratic President [[Andrew Jackson]], so the ticket was designed to appeal to loyalists from both major parties, winning 23% of the popular vote and carrying one state, [[Maryland]], with eight electoral votes. Fillmore did not win enough votes to block Democrat [[James Buchanan]] from the White House. During this time, Nathaniel Banks decided he was not as strongly for the anti-immigrant platform as the party wanted him to be, so he left the Know Nothing Party for the more anti-slavery Republican Party. He contributed to the decline of the Know Nothing Party by taking two-thirds of its members with him.\n\nMany were appalled by the Know Nothings. [[Abraham Lincoln]] expressed his own disgust with the political party in a private letter to [[Joshua Speed]] written August 24, 1855. Lincoln never publicly attacked the Know Nothings, whose votes he needed:\n\n<blockquote>I am not a Know-Nothing\u2014that is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that \"all men are created equal.\" We now practically read it \"all men are created equal, except negroes.\" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \"all men are created equals, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.\" When it comes to that I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty\u2014to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Francis Fisher|authorlink1=Francis Fisher Browne|title=The Every-day Life of Abraham Lincoln: A Narrative and Descriptive Biography with Pen-pictures and Personal Recollections by Those Who Knew Him|date=1914|publisher=Browne & Howell|page=[https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeabr03browgoog/page/n210 153]|url=https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeabr03browgoog|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Allan Nevins]], writing about the turmoil preceding the American Civil War, states that Millard Fillmore was never a Know Nothing nor a nativist. Fillmore was out of the country when the presidential nomination came and had not been consulted about running.  Nevins further states:\n\n<blockquote>[Fillmore] was not a member of the party; he had never attended an American [Know-Nothing] gathering. By no spoken or written word had he indicated a subscription to American [Party] tenets.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing 1852\u20131857'' (1947), 2:467</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the Supreme Court's controversial ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruling in 1857, most of the anti-slavery members of the American Party joined the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. The pro-slavery wing of the American Party remained strong on the local and state levels in a few southern states, but by the [[1860 U.S. presidential election|1860 election]], they were no longer a serious national political movement.
