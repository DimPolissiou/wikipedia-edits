Since 1999, he formally embraced a branch of the [[Old Believers]], a Russian religious movement which rejected the 1652\u20131666 [[Old Believers#Reforms of Patriarch Nikon|reforms]] of the official [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}} Dugin's Eurasian philosophy owes much to [[Traditionalist School|Traditional Integralism]] and ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' movements, and as such it resonates with [[Neopaganism]],{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|pp=11\u201314}} a category which in this context means the movement of [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery), especially in the forms of [[Anastasianism]] and [[Ynglism]]. Dugin's Eurasianism is often cited as belonging to the same spectrum of these movements,<ref>[[Marat Shterin]] (2016). \"[https://g2w.eu/zeitschrift/leseprobe/1250-attraktivitaet-und-dilemma-neue-religioese-bewegungen-in-russland Attraktivit\u00e4t und Dilemma: Neue religi\u00f6se Bewegungen in Russland]\".

His choice is not paradoxical, since, according to him\u2014in the wake of [[Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non]]\u2014Russian Orthodoxy and especially the Old Believers have preserved an [[esotericism|esoteric]] and initiatory character which was utterly lost in Western Christianity. As such, the Russian Orthodox tradition may be merged with [[Modern Paganism|Neopaganism]] and may host \"Neopaganism's nationalist force, which anchors it in the Russian soil, and separates it from the two other Christian confessions\".{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}}\n\n===Esotericism, fascism, and integrative geopolitics===\n\nIn the early 1990s Dugin's work at the [[National Bolshevik Front]] included research into the roots of national movements and the activities of [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria|supporting esoteric groups]] in the first half of the 20th century.

Since 1999, he formally embraced a branch of the [[Old Believers]], a Russian religious movement which rejected the 1652\u20131666 [[Old Believers#Reforms of Patriarch Nikon|reforms]] of the official [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}} Dugin's Eurasian philosophy owes much to [[Traditionalist School|Traditional Integralism]] and ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' movements, and as such it resonates with [[Neopaganism]],{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|pp=11\u201314}} a category which in this context means the movement of [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery), especially in the forms of [[Anastasianism]] and [[Ynglism]]. Dugin's Eurasianism is often cited as belonging to the same spectrum of these movements,<ref>[[Marat Shterin]] (2016). \"[https://g2w.eu/zeitschrift/leseprobe/1250-attraktivitaet-und-dilemma-neue-religioese-bewegungen-in-russland Attraktivit\u00e4t und Dilemma: Neue religi\u00f6se Bewegungen in Russland]\".

His choice is not paradoxical, since, according to him\u2014in the wake of [[Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non]]\u2014Russian Orthodoxy and especially the Old Believers have preserved an [[esotericism|esoteric]] and initiatory character which was utterly lost in Western Christianity. As such, the Russian Orthodox tradition may be merged with [[Modern Paganism|Neopaganism]] and may host \"Neopaganism's nationalist force, which anchors it in the Russian soil, and separates it from the two other Christian confessions\".{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}}\n\n===Esotericism, fascism, and integrative geopolitics===\n\nIn the early 1990s Dugin's work at the [[National Bolshevik Front]] included research into the roots of national movements and the activities of [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria|supporting esoteric groups]] in the first half of the 20th century.

His career began at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 1990, where he spent the first six years of his career. In 1996, he moved to [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], helping the \"Mariners\" to the [[EFL Trophy|League Trophy]] and promotion out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in [[1998 Football League Second Division play-off Final|1998]]. The next year he moved on to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] for a two-year spell. Voted the club's [[Port Vale F.C. Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] in 2000, he captained the \"Valiants\" to the League Trophy in [[2001 Football League Trophy Final|2001]]. Later in the year he was transferred to [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]], helping the club to win promotion out of [[EFL League Two|League Two]] in 2002\u201303, before he moved on to [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]]. In 2005 his career in the Football League ended back at Port Vale. He then spent 2005 to 2010 at non-league [[Salisbury City F.C.|Salisbury City]]. As a player, he enjoyed promotion four times with three clubs, and lifted the League Trophy twice.\n\nPlayer-manager at [[Salisbury City F.C.|Salisbury City]] for the 2009\u201310 season, he returned to the Football League at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], as assistant manager but left the position in December 2010. He was appointed [[Hemel Hempstead Town F.C.|Hemel Hempstead Town]] manager in October 2011, before he was put it charge at [[Eastbourne Borough F.C.|Eastbourne Borough]] in February 2012. He left Eastbourne Borough in April 2017.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Southampton===\nBorn in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], Widdrington started his career as a [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] [[Southampton F.C. Academy|trainee]] and signed a professional contract with the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club in May 1990. He enjoyed a short loan spell at [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] at the start of the [[1991\u201392 Southampton F.C. season|1991\u201392]] season. He made his \"Saints\" debut at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 1 March 1992.\n\nA tough, no-nonsense midfield player, he survived some frantic managerial changes to carve out a respectable [[Premier League]] career over a four-year period for Southampton. He was combative and energetic, comfortable in most areas of the pitch. However he didn't become a regular player until the [[1994\u201395 Southampton F.C. season|1994\u201395 season]], when he made 28 league appearances without scoring as the \"Saints\" finished tenth in the league. He made a further 21 appearances in the [[1995\u201396 Southampton F.C. season|1995\u201396 season]], scoring twice, as the \"Saints\" narrowly avoided relegation, but still reached the quarter finals of the FA Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=44497|title=Tommy Widdrington|work=sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nHe was not far short of making 100 appearances in total when, in July 1996, [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] came in with a club record offer of \u00a3300,000 \u2013 as \"Saints\" had yet another new manager in [[Graeme Souness]].<ref name=\"mag\">{{cite book |title=PV Eye: the Official Matchday Magazine of Port Vale F.C. |date=2 March 1999 |page=22}}</ref> Widdrington decided to accept their terms and headed to [[Blundell Park]].\n\n===Grimsby Town===\nGrimbsy were a struggling [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side, and suffered relegation at the end of the [[1996\u201397 Grimsby Town F.C. season|1996\u201397]] campaign, though Widdrington did score a memorable goal past [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] on the last day of the season. They enjoyed an immediate return in [[1997\u201398 Grimsby Town F.C. season|1997\u201398]] after winning [[1998 Football League Second Division play-off Final|the play-off Final]] against [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] 1\u20130. However injury meant that he missed out on the [[EFL Trophy|League Trophy]] Final [[1998 Football League Trophy Final|victory]] over [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. Widdrington played his last game for the \"Mariners\" towards the end of the [[1998\u201399 Grimsby Town F.C. season|1998\u201399]] season, when he was loaned out to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] for the final three months of the season.\n\n===Port Vale===\nAt the end of the [[1998\u201399 Port Vale F.C. season|1998\u201399]] season Port Vale signed Widdrington (now out of contract, and transfer\u2013listed) on a free transfer. He was sent off on the final day of the 1998\u201399 season, and he returned to action in 1999\u20132000 by getting sent off in the opening minute of a 4\u20132 defeat at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. Supporters voted him [[Port Vale F.C. Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] for the [[1999\u20132000 Port Vale F.C. season|1999\u20132000]] season, as the \"Valiants\" suffered relegation into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].\n\nManager [[Brian Horton]] appointed Widdrington as [[Captain (association football)|club-captain]] for the [[2000\u201301 Port Vale F.C. season|2000\u201301]] season.

His career began at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 1990, where he spent the first six years of his career. In 1996, he moved to [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], helping the \"Mariners\" to the [[EFL Trophy|League Trophy]] and promotion out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in [[1998 Football League Second Division play-off Final|1998]]. The next year he moved on to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] for a two-year spell. Voted the club's [[Port Vale F.C. Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] in 2000, he captained the \"Valiants\" to the League Trophy in [[2001 Football League Trophy Final|2001]]. Later in the year he was transferred to [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]], helping the club to win promotion out of [[EFL League Two|League Two]] in 2002\u201303, before he moved on to [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]]. In 2005 his career in the Football League ended back at Port Vale. He then spent 2005 to 2010 at non-league [[Salisbury City F.C.|Salisbury City]]. As a player, he enjoyed promotion four times with three clubs, and lifted the League Trophy twice.\n\nPlayer-manager at [[Salisbury City F.C.|Salisbury City]] for the 2009\u201310 season, he returned to the Football League at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], as assistant manager but left the position in December 2010. He was appointed [[Hemel Hempstead Town F.C.|Hemel Hempstead Town]] manager in October 2011, before he was put it charge at [[Eastbourne Borough F.C.|Eastbourne Borough]] in February 2012. He left Eastbourne Borough in April 2017.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Southampton===\nBorn in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], Widdrington started his career as a [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] [[Southampton F.C. Academy|trainee]] and signed a professional contract with the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club in May 1990. He enjoyed a short loan spell at [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] at the start of the [[1991\u201392 Southampton F.C. season|1991\u201392]] season. He made his \"Saints\" debut at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 1 March 1992.\n\nA tough, no-nonsense midfield player, he survived some frantic managerial changes to carve out a respectable [[Premier League]] career over a four-year period for Southampton. He was combative and energetic, comfortable in most areas of the pitch. However he didn't become a regular player until the [[1994\u201395 Southampton F.C. season|1994\u201395 season]], when he made 28 league appearances without scoring as the \"Saints\" finished tenth in the league. He made a further 21 appearances in the [[1995\u201396 Southampton F.C. season|1995\u201396 season]], scoring twice, as the \"Saints\" narrowly avoided relegation, but still reached the quarter finals of the FA Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=44497|title=Tommy Widdrington|work=sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nHe was not far short of making 100 appearances in total when, in July 1996, [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] came in with a club record offer of \u00a3300,000 \u2013 as \"Saints\" had yet another new manager in [[Graeme Souness]].<ref name=\"mag\">{{cite book |title=PV Eye: the Official Matchday Magazine of Port Vale F.C. |date=2 March 1999 |page=22}}</ref> Widdrington decided to accept their terms and headed to [[Blundell Park]].\n\n===Grimsby Town===\nGrimbsy were a struggling [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side, and suffered relegation at the end of the [[1996\u201397 Grimsby Town F.C. season|1996\u201397]] campaign, though Widdrington did score a memorable goal past [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] on the last day of the season. They enjoyed an immediate return in [[1997\u201398 Grimsby Town F.C. season|1997\u201398]] after winning [[1998 Football League Second Division play-off Final|the play-off Final]] against [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] 1\u20130. However injury meant that he missed out on the [[EFL Trophy|League Trophy]] Final [[1998 Football League Trophy Final|victory]] over [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. Widdrington played his last game for the \"Mariners\" towards the end of the [[1998\u201399 Grimsby Town F.C. season|1998\u201399]] season, when he was loaned out to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] for the final three months of the season.\n\n===Port Vale===\nAt the end of the [[1998\u201399 Port Vale F.C. season|1998\u201399]] season Port Vale signed Widdrington (now out of contract, and transfer\u2013listed) on a free transfer. He was sent off on the final day of the 1998\u201399 season, and he returned to action in 1999\u20132000 by getting sent off in the opening minute of a 4\u20132 defeat at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. Supporters voted him [[Port Vale F.C. Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] for the [[1999\u20132000 Port Vale F.C. season|1999\u20132000]] season, as the \"Valiants\" suffered relegation into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].\n\nManager [[Brian Horton]] appointed Widdrington as [[Captain (association football)|club-captain]] for the [[2000\u201301 Port Vale F.C. season|2000\u201301]] season.

During the baking process, the mixture is stirred to maintain a loose breakfast cereal consistency. [[Dried fruit]], such as [[raisin]]s and [[Date palm|dates]], and confections such as [[chocolate]] are sometimes added.  Granola is often eaten in combination with [[yogurt]], [[honey]], fresh [[fruit]] (such as [[banana]]s, [[Strawberry|strawberries]] or [[blueberries]]), [[milk]] or other forms of [[Breakfast cereal|cereal]]. It also serves as a topping for various [[pastry|pastries]], [[dessert]]s or [[ice cream]].\n\nGranola is carried by people who are [[hiking]], [[camping]], or [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] because it is [[Nutrition|nutritious]], lightweight, high in [[Calorie|calories]], and easy to store (properties that make it similar to [[trail mix]] and [[muesli]]). As a [[snack]], it is often combined with [[honey]] or [[corn syrup]] and condensed into a [[Granola bar|granola bar form]] that makes it easy to carry for [[packed lunch]]es, [[hiking]], or other [[Outdoor recreation|outdoor activities]].\n\n== History ==\nThe names ''[[Granula]]'' and ''Granola'' were registered [[trademark]]s in the late 19th century [[United States]] for foods consisting of [[whole grain]] products crumbled and then baked until crisp, in contrast to the, at that time (about 1900), contemporary invention, [[muesli]], which is traditionally neither baked nor sweetened. The name is now a trademark only in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], but is still more commonly referred to as muesli there.<ref>Registration 20067</ref> The trademark is owned by the Australian Health & Nutrition Association Ltd.'s [[Sanitarium Health Food Company]] in Australia<ref>{{cite web|title=IP Australia Trademark#32227|url=http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/atmoss/falcon_details.show_tm_details?p_tm_number=32227&p_detail=DETAILED|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> and Australasian Conference Association Limited in New Zealand.\n[[File:Granola advertisement, 1893.png|thumb|right|200px|An 1893 advertisement for Kellogg's Granola]]\nGranula was invented in [[Dansville, Livingston County, New York|Dansville, New York]] by Dr. [[James Caleb Jackson]] at the Jackson Sanitarium in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nibble: Granola Girl. Part 1, the History of Granola|url=https://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/cereals/granola-girl-cereal.asp#history|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref> The Jackson Sanitarium was a prominent [[Health club|health spa]] that operated into the early 20th century on the hillside overlooking Dansville. It was also known as Our Home on the Hillside; thus the company formed to sell Jackson's cereal was known as the Our Home Granula Company. Granula was composed of [[Graham flour]] and was similar to an oversized form of [[Grape-Nuts]]. A similar cereal was developed by [[John Harvey Kellogg]]. It too was initially known as Granula, but the name was changed to Granola to avoid legal problems with Jackson.\n\nThe food and name were revived in the 1960s, and [[Fruit|fruits]] and nuts were added to it to make it a [[health food]] that was popular with the health and nature-oriented [[hippie]] movement. At the time, several people claim to have revived or re-invented granola. During [[Woodstock]], a soon to become hippie icon known as [[Wavy Gravy]], popularized granola as a means of feeding large numbers of people during the festival. Another major promoter was Layton Gentry, profiled in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as \"Johnny Granola-Seed\".<ref name=\"#CITEREF1972|Time 1972\">[[#CITEREF1972|Time 1972]]</ref> In 1964, Gentry sold the rights to a granola recipe using oats, which he claimed to have invented himself, to Sovex Natural Foods for $3,000. The company was founded in 1953 in [[Holly, Michigan]] by the Hurlinger family with the main purpose of producing a concentrated paste of brewers [[yeast]] and [[soy sauce]] known as \"Sovex\". Earlier in 1964, it had been bought by John Goodbrad and moved to [[Collegedale, Tennessee]]. In 1967, Gentry bought back the rights for west of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] for $1,500 and then sold the west coast rights to Wayne Schlotthauer of Lassen Foods in [[Chico, California]], for $18,000.<ref name=\"#CITEREF1972|Time 1972\"/> Lassen was founded from a health food bakery run by Schlotthauer's father-in-law.<ref name=\"#CITEREFKlein1978|Klein 1978\">[[#CITEREFKlein1978|Klein 1978]]</ref> Canadian rights were ceded in 1972 to the Congregation Shalom Ba-olam, a charitable organization which produced  \"Layton Gentry's Original Crunchy Granola\" as a fundraiser.<ref>pers. communication Fulton (legal council for Gentry, Salinas Calif. 1972</ref> Oro Foods from Ontario also produced granola from the same recipe, but fell out with Gentry.

Granola bars consist of granola mixed with [[honey]] or other sweetened syrup, pressed and baked into a bar shape, resulting in the production of a more convenient snack. Granola bars are always individually packaged in a sealed pouch, even when a box of multiple bars is purchased. This enables people to place the packaged bar in a purse, backpack or other bag for consumption at a later point. The product is most popular in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, parts of southern Europe, Brazil, Israel, South Africa, and Japan. Recently, granola has begun to expand its market into India and southeast Asian countries. A wide variety of flavours is available, ranging from fruit and nuts to chocolate and marshmallows.

During the baking process, the mixture is stirred to maintain a loose breakfast cereal consistency. [[Dried fruit]], such as [[raisin]]s and [[Date palm|dates]], and confections such as [[chocolate]] are sometimes added.  Granola is often eaten in combination with [[yogurt]], honey, fresh fruit (such as [[banana]]s, [[Strawberry|strawberries]] or [[blueberries]]), [[milk]] or other forms of [[Breakfast cereal|cereal]]. It also serves as a topping for various [[pastry|pastries]], [[dessert]]s or [[ice cream]].\n\nGranola is carried by people who are [[hiking]], [[camping]], or [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] because it is nutritious, lightweight, high in calories, and easy to store (properties that make it similar to [[trail mix]] and [[muesli]]). As a snack, it is often combined with [[honey]] or [[corn syrup]] and condensed into a [[Granola bar|granola bar form]] that makes it easy to carry for [[packed lunch]]es, hiking, or other outdoor activities.\n\n== History ==\nThe names ''[[Granula]]'' and ''Granola'' were registered [[trademark]]s in the late 19th century United States for foods consisting of [[whole grain]] products crumbled and then baked until crisp, in contrast to the, at that time (about 1900), contemporary invention, [[muesli]], which is traditionally neither baked nor sweetened. The name is now a trademark only in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], but is still more commonly referred to as muesli there.<ref>Registration 20067</ref> The trademark is owned by the Australian Health & Nutrition Association Ltd.'s [[Sanitarium Health Food Company]] in Australia<ref>{{cite web|title=IP Australia Trademark#32227|url=http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/atmoss/falcon_details.show_tm_details?p_tm_number=32227&p_detail=DETAILED|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> and Australasian Conference Association Limited in New Zealand.\n[[File:Granola advertisement, 1893.png|thumb|right|200px|An 1893 advertisement for Kellogg's Granola]]\nGranula was invented in Dansville, New York by Dr. [[James Caleb Jackson]] at the Jackson Sanitarium in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nibble: Granola Girl.

It was also known as Our Home on the Hillside; thus the company formed to sell Jackson's cereal was known as the Our Home Granula Company. Granula was composed of [[Graham flour]] and was similar to an oversized form of [[Grape-Nuts]]. A similar cereal was developed by [[John Harvey Kellogg]]. It too was initially known as Granula, but the name was changed to Granola to avoid legal problems with Jackson.\n\nThe food and name were revived in the 1960s, and fruits and nuts were added to it to make it a [[health food]] that was popular with the health and nature-oriented [[hippie]] movement. At the time, several people claim to have revived or re-invented granola. During [[Woodstock]], a soon to become hippie icon known as [[Wavy Gravy]], popularized granola as a means of feeding large numbers of people during the festival. Another major promoter was Layton Gentry, profiled in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as \"Johnny Granola-Seed\".<ref name=\"#CITEREF1972|Time 1972\">[[#CITEREF1972|Time 1972]]</ref> In 1964, Gentry sold the rights to a granola recipe using oats, which he claimed to have invented himself, to Sovex Natural Foods for $3,000. The company was founded in 1953 in [[Holly, Michigan]] by the Hurlinger family with the main purpose of producing a concentrated paste of brewers [[yeast]] and [[soy sauce]] known as \"Sovex\". Earlier in 1964, it had been bought by John Goodbrad and moved to [[Collegedale, Tennessee]]. In 1967, Gentry bought back the rights for west of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] for $1,500 and then sold the west coast rights to Wayne Schlotthauer of Lassen Foods in [[Chico, California]], for $18,000.<ref name=\"#CITEREF1972|Time 1972\"/> Lassen was founded from a health food bakery run by Schlotthauer's father-in-law.<ref name=\"#CITEREFKlein1978|Klein 1978\">[[#CITEREFKlein1978|Klein 1978]]</ref> Canadian rights were ceded in 1972 to the Congregation Shalom Ba-olam, a charitable organization which produced  \"Layton Gentry's Original Crunchy Granola\" as a fundraiser.<ref>pers. communication Fulton (legal council for Gentry, Salinas Calif. 1972</ref> Oro Foods from Ontario also produced granola from the same recipe, but fell out with Gentry.
