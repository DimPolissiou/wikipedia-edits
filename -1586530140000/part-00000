In some counties the winner of the event became the National Champion even if the winning team came from a different country, like the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]] or the [[United States]]. In other countries like [[Germany]], [[Austria]] or [[Italy]] the Champion is the first team from the organizing country even if they do not win the event. Since the Soling has always been an \"open\" class in that spirit we list in this overview the winners of the event. The first boat of the organizing country can be found in the references.\n\nThe [[Soling Australian Championship|Australian Soling Championship]] is recognized as an Continental Championship like the [[Soling European Championship|Europeans]] and the [[Soling North American Championship|North]] and [[Soling South American Championship| South Americans]]. Therefor the Championships of [[New South Wales]] and [[Western Australia]] are listed. However [[Scotland]] is not a member of [[World Sailing]] they Nationals are listed any way since the event is listed under National Championships in the Soling Guide of 1996-2000. <ref name=\"SolingGuide1996\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Winners of National Championships ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;

In some counties the winner of the event became the National Champion even if the winning team came from a different country, like the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]] or the [[United States]]. In other countries like [[Germany]], [[Austria]] or [[Italy]] the Champion is the first team from the organizing country even if they do not win the event. Since the Soling has always been an \"open\" class in that spirit we list in this overview the winners of the event. The first boat of the organizing country can be found in the references.\n\nThe [[Soling Australian Championship|Australian Soling Championship]] is recognized as an Continental Championship like the [[Soling European Championship|Europeans]] and the [[Soling North American Championship|North]] and [[Soling South American Championship| South Americans]]. Therefor the Championships of [[New South Wales]] and [[Western Australia]] are listed. However [[Scotland]] is not a member of [[World Sailing]] they Nationals are listed any way since the event is listed under National Championships in the Soling Guide of 1996-2000. <ref name=\"SolingGuide1996\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Winners of National Championships ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;

Mecca, Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A pilgrim makes a supplication in the direction of [[Ka'bah]], the Muslim qibla, in the [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Sacred Mosque]] of [[Mecca]].]]\n[[File:US Army 51420 Soldiers celebrate end of Ramadan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A prayer congregation [[sujud|prostate]]s in the same direction, the qibla.]]\nThe '''qibla''' ({{lang-ar|{{script|Arab|\u0642\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0629|}}|qiblat}}, \"direction\", transliterations include ''qiblah'', ''qibleh'', ''kiblah'', ''k\u0131ble'', ''kibla'', or ''kiblat'') is the direction used by Muslims in various religious contexts, including the [[salah]] or ritual prayer. The qibla is the direction of the building of [[Ka'bah]] in the [[Great Mosque|Sacred Mosque]], [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia, which Muslims believe to be a sacred site built by the prophets [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]]. According to the Islamic belief, this direction was ordained by God in the Quran, in chapter [[Al-Baqarah]] verses 144, 149, and 150, revealed to Muhammad in the second [[Hijri calendar|Hijri year]]; prior to this revelation Muhammad and his followers in [[Medina]] faced [[Jerusalem]] for prayers. Other than for the ritual prayer, it is also the direction for entering the state of [[ihram]] for the [[hajj]] pilgrimage, where animals are turned to in an [[dhabihah|Islamic slaughter]], for the dead when buried, the recommended direction to make [[dua|supplications]], and the avoided direction when relieving nature and spitting. Most mosque contains a ''[[mihrab]]'' or a wall niche indicating the direction of the qibla. In practice, there are two manners of observing the qibla: ''ayn al-ka'bah'' which faces the Ka'ba exactly, and ''jihat al-ka'bah'' which faces only its general direction. Most Islamic authorities believe that the more precise ''ayn al-ka'bah'' is only required when possible (for example, inside the Sacred Mosque or in its surroundings), and otherwise ''jihat al-ka'bah'' can be used.\n\nThe most common technical definition used by Muslim astronomers is the direction shown by the [[great circle]]\u2014in the [[Spherical Earth|Earth's sphere]]\u2014passing through the Ka'bah and one's location. This direction shows the shortest possible path from one's place to Ka'bah, and allows for the exact calculation (''hisab'') of the qibla using a [[spherical trigonometry|spherical trigonometric]] formula taking the coordinates of one's place and the Ka'bah as inputs.  The method is applied to develop [[Mobile app|mobile applications]] and websites for Muslims, and to compile qibla tables used in instruments such as the [[qibla compass]]. In addition, the qibla can also be determined by observing the shadow of a vertical rod at or around two times of the year when the sun is directly overhead in Mecca\u2014on 28 May at 12:18 [[Saudi Arabia Standard Time]] or 9:18 UTC and on 16 July at 12:27 SAST/9:27 UTC).\n\nBefore the development of astronomy in the Islamic world, Muslims used traditional methods to determine the qibla; these includes following the customs of the [[companions of the Prophet]] in one's place, using the setting and rising points of celestial objects, the direction of the wind, or using due south\u2014Muhammad's qibla in Medina\u2014everywhere. Early Islamic astronomy were built on its Indian and Greek counterparts\u2014especially the works of [[Ptolemy]], and soon Muslim astronomers developed methods to calculate approximate directions of the qibla, starting from mid-9th century. In the late 9th century and in the 10th century, Muslim astronomers developed methods to find the exact direction of the qibla that are equivalent to the modern formula. Initially, this \"qibla of the astronomers\" were used alongside various traditionally determined qiblas, resulting in a diversity of qiblas in medieval Muslim cities. In addition, the accurate geographic data necessary for the astronomical methods to yield an accurate result were only available in the 18th and 19th centuries, resulting in further diversity of the qibla. Historical mosques with differing qiblas still stand today throughout the Islamic world. The spaceflight of a devout Muslim [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] on October 2007 generated a discussion with regards to qibla from the outer space.

Such directions were used by some Muslims in the following centuries, side-by-side with other directions, even after Muslim astronomers used calculations to find more accurate directions to Mecca. Directions described as the qiblas of the companions include due south in Syria and Palestine,{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013131}} the direction of the winter sunrise in Egypt, and the direction of the winter sunset in Iraq.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132}} The direction of the winter sunrise and sunset are also traditionally favoured because they are parallel to the walls of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132, also figure 4.2 in p. 131}}\n\n== Development of methods ==\n=== Pre-astronomy ===\nThe determination of qibla is an important problems for Muslim communities throughout history. Muslims are required to know the qibla in order to perform their daily prayers, and it is also needed to determine the orientation of mosques.{{sfn|King|1996|p=128}} When Muhammad lived among the Muslims in Medina (which, like Mecca, is also in the [[Hejaz]] region), he prayed due south, according to the known direction of Mecca. Within the few generations after Muhammad's death in 632, Muslims have reached places far away from Mecca, presenting the problem of determining the qibla in new places.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013132}} Mathematical methods based on astronomy would only develop at the end of the eighth century or the beginning of the ninth and even then they were not initally popular.

Initially, the science was introduced through the works if Indian authors, but since the ninth century the works of Greek astronomers such as [[Ptolemy]] were translated to Arabic and became the main reference in the field.{{sfn|Morelon|1996b|p=20\u201321}} Muslim astronomers prefered Greek astronomy because they consider it to be better supported by theoretical explanations and therefore can be developed as an exact science; however, the influence of Indian astronomy survives especially on the compilation of astronomical tables.{{sfn|Morelon|1996b|p=21}} This new science is applied to develop new methods of determining the qibla, making use of the concept of [[Latitude|latitudes]] and [[Longitude|longitudes]] introduced in Ptolemy's ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' as well as trigonometric formulae developed by Muslim scholars.{{sfn|King|1996|p=141}} Most textbooks of astronomy written in the medieval Islamic World contain a chapter on the determination of qibla, considered one of the many things connecting astronomy with the [[Sharia|Islamic law]] (''sharia'').{{sfn|King|1986|p=83}}{{sfn|Morelon|1996a|p=15}} According to David A. King, various medieval solutions for the determination of qibla \"bear witness to the development of mathematical methods from the 3rd/9th to the 8th/14th centuries and to the level of sophistication in trigonometry and computational techniques attained by these scholars.\"{{sfn|King|1986|p=83}}\n\nThe first mathematical methods developed in the early ninth century were approximate solutions to the mathematical problem, usually using a flat map or two-dimensional geometry. Because in reality the earth is spherical, the directions found were not exact, but they were sufficient for locations relatively close to Mecca (including as far as Egypt and Iran) because the errors were only less than 2\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=142-143}}\n\nExact solutions based on three-dimensional geometry and spherical trigometry began to appear in middle of 9th century. [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi|Habash al-Hasib]] (fl. c. 850 M in Baghdad and Damascus) wrote an early example of such solutions, using an \"[[Orthographic projection|analemma]]\", or a two-dimensional procedure to derive formulas in spherical trigonometry. His procedure involves working with a circle and a series of points and lines drawn in a specific manner to find a direction now known to be equivalent to the solution obtained from the modern formula.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=144\u2013145}}{{efn|The details of this method and its proof are provided in {{harvnb|King|1996|pp=144\u2013145}}}} Another group of solution uses trigonometric formulas, for example [[Al-Nayrizi]] from Baghdad (fl. c. 900) developed a mathematical procedure using a four-step application of [[Menelaus's theorem]].{{sfn|King|1996|pp=145\u2013146}}{{efn|The details of this method and its proof are provided in {{harvnb|King|1996|pp=145\u2013146}}}} Subsequent scholars, including Ibn Yunus, Abu al-Wafa, Ibn al-Haitham and Al-Biruni, proposers other methods which are confirmed to be accurate from the viewpoint of modern astronomy, using either analemmas or direct application of formulas.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}\n\nMuslim astronomers subsequently used these methods to compile tables showing qibla from a list of locations, grouped by their latitude and longitude differences from Mecca. The oldest known example was written in Baghdad ca. 9th century CE containing entries for each degrees and [[arc minute]]s up to 20\u00b0.{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}} In the fourteenth century, [[Shams al-Din al-Khalili]], an astronomer who serves as a ''[[muwaqqit]]'' (timekeeper) in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] of Damascus, compiled a table of qibla for 2,880 coordinates with longitude difference of up to 60\u00b0 from Mecca, and with latitudes ranging from 10\u00b0 to 50\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}} King opined that among the medieval qibla tables, al-Khalili's work is \"the most impressive from the view of its scope and its accuracy\".{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}}\n\nThe accuracy of applying these methods to actual locations depend on the accuracy of its input parameters\u2014the local latitude and the latitude of Mecca, and the longitude difference. At the time of the development of these methods, the latitude of a location can be determined to several arc minutes' accuracy, but there was no accurate method to determine a location's longitude.{{sfn|King|1996|p=153}} Common approximate methods used to determine the longitude difference include comparing the local timing of [[lunar eclipse]] versus the timing in Mecca, or measuring the distance of caravan routes;{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}{{sfn|King|1986|p=86}} the Central Asian scholar Al-Biruni made his estimate by averaging various approximate methods.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}} Because the longitude inaccuracy, medieval qibla calculations (including those using mathematically accurate methods) differ from the modern values. For example, while the [[Al-Azhar Mosque]] in Cairo was built using the \"qibla of the astronomers\", but the mosque's qibla (127\u00b0) somewhat differs from the result of modern calculations (135\u00b0) because the longitude difference used was off by 3\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nAccurate longitude values in the Islamic world were only available after the application of [[cartography|cartographic]] [[surveying|surveys]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Modern coordinates, along with new technologies such as [[GPS satellite]]s and electronic instruments, resulted in the development of practical instruments to calculate the qibla.{{sfn|King|2004|p=177}} Qibla found using modern instruments might differ from the direction of mosques, because a mosque might be built before the advent of modern data, and orientation inaccuracies might have been introduced during the building process of modern mosques.{{sfn|King|2004|p=177}}{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=83}} When this is known, sometimes the direction of the mosque's ''mihrab'' is still observers, and sometimes a marker is added (such as lines drawn in the mosque) that can be followed instead of the ''mihrab''.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=83}}\n\n== Instruments ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = QiblaMat.jpg\n | image2 = Turkish and Islamic Museum 0951.jpg\n | footer = A [[prayer mat]] with a modern [[qibla compass]] (''left''); an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman-era]] qibla compass dated 1738 (''right'').}}\nMuslims use various instrument to find the qibla when not near a mosque. The [[qibla compass]] is a magnetic compass which include a table or a list of qibla angle from major settlements. An electronic version could use satellite coordinates in order to calculate and indicate the qibla automatically.{{sfn|King|2004|p=177}} Qibla compasses have existed since around 1300, supplemented by the list of qibla angles often written on the instruments themselves.{{sfn|King|2004|p=171}} Hotel rooms with Muslim guests may use a sticker showing the qibla on the ceiling or a drawer.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} With the advent of computing, various [[mobile app]]s and websites use formulae to calculate the qibla for their users.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}{{sfn|MacGregor|2018|p=130}}\n\n==Diversity ==\n=== Early Islamic world===\n[[File:Mosques in Cairo showing different direction.png|thumb|left|A map of parts of Cairo showing mosques with different qiblas.]]\nBecause varying methods have been used to determine the qibla, mosques are built throughout history in different directions, including some mosques that still stand today.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=29}} Methods based on astronomy and mathematics were not always used,{{sfn|King|2004|p=175}} and the same determination method can yield different qibla due to difference in the accuracy of data and calculation.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=32}} Egyptian historian [[Al-Maqrizi]] (d. 1442) recorded various qibla used in Cairo of his time: 90\u00b0 (due east), 117\u00b0 (winter sunrise, \"qibla of the sahaba\"), 127\u00b0 (calculated by astronomers, such as [[Ibn Yunus]]), 141\u00b0 ([[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]]), 156\u00b0 (the rising point of Suhayl/Canopus), 180\u00b0 (due south, emulating the qibla of Muhammad in Medina), and 204\u00b0 (the setting point of Canopus). The modern qibla for Cairo is 135\u00b0, which was not known at the time.{{sfn|King|2004|pp=175\u2013176}} This diversity also result in the non-uniform layout in Cairo's districts, because the streets are often oriented according to the orientation of the mosques. Muslim historical records also indicate the diversity of qibla in other major cities, including [[Cordoba, Spain|Cordoba]] (113\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 150\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 were recorded in the 12th century) and [[Samarkand]] (180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 230\u00b0, 240\u00b0, and 270\u00b0 were recorded in the 11th century).{{sfn|King|2004|pp=175\u2013176}} According to the doctrine of ''jihat al-ka'bah'', the diverse directions of qibla are still valid as long as they are still in the same broad direction.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n=== North America ===\n[[File:01 05 Street WDC 8jul05.jpg|thumb|The [[Islamic Center of Washington]] (founded 1953), one of the early mosques in the United States, the qibla of which faces northeast in line with astronomical calculations.{{sfn|May|1953|p=367}} ]]\nPlaces long settled by Muslim populations tend to have resolved the question of the direction of qibla over time. Other places, like the United States and Canada, have only had large Muslim communities in the past several decades, and the determination of qibla can be a matter of debate.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} The [[Islamic Center of Washington|Islamic Center of Washington, D.C.]] was built in 1953 facing slightly north of east and initially puzzled some observers, including Muslims, because [[Washington, D.C.]]'s latitude is 17\u00b030\u2032 more northerly than that of Mecca. Even though line drawn on world maps\u2014such as those using the Mercator projection\u2014would suggest a southeastern direction to Mecca, astronomical calculations using the great circle method do yield a north-of-east direction (56\u00b033\u2032).{{sfn|May|1953|p=367}} Nevertheless, most early mosques in the United States face east or southeast, following the apparent direction in world maps.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} As the Muslim community grew and the number of mosque increased, in 1978 an American Muslim scientist S. Kamal Abdali, wrote an article arguing that the correct qibla from North America was north or northeast as calculated by the great circle method, which identifies the shortest path to Mecca.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=54\u201355}}{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Abdali's conclusion was widely circulated and then  accepted by the Muslim community, and mosques were subsequently reoriented as a resi;t.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} In 1990, two religious scholars Riad Nachef and Samir Kadi published a book arguing for a southeastern qibla, writing that the north/northeast qibla was invalid and resulted from a lack of religious knowledge.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}}{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=31}} The two opinions resulted in a period of debate about the correct qibla,{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}} and eventually most North American Muslims accepted the north/northeast qibla with a minority following the east/southeast qibla.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=57}}\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nVariation of the qibla also occurs in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest world Muslim population. The astronomically calculated qibla ranges from 291\u00b0\u2014295\u00b0 (21\u00b0\u201425\u00b0 north of west) depending on the exact location in the archipelago.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=59\u201360}} However, the qibla is often traditionally known as simply 'the west', resulting in mosques built oriented due west or to the direction of sunset\u2014which slightly varies throughout the year. Different opinions exist among Indonesian Islamic astronomers: Tono Saksono ''et al.'' argues that facing the qibla during prayers is more of a \"spiritual prerequisite\" than a precise physical one, and that an exact direction to the Ka'bah itself from thousands of kilometres away requires an extreme precision impossible to achieve when building a mosque or when standing for prayers.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} On the other hands, Muhammad Hadi Bashori opined that \"correcting the qibla is indeed a very urgent thing,\" and can be guided by simple methods such as observing the shadow.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=60\u201361}} In the history of the region, disputes about the qibla has also occurred in the then-[[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1890s. When the Indonesian scholar and future founder of [[Muhammadiyah]], [[Ahmad Dahlan]] returned from his Islamic and astronomy studies in Mecca he found that mosques in the royal capital of [[Yogyakarta]] had inaccurate qiblas, including the [[Kauman Great Mosque]] which faced due west. His efforts in adjusting the qibla was opposed by the traditional ulama of the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], and a new mosque built by Dahlan using his calculations was demolished by a mob. Dahlan rebuilt his mosque in the 1900s and later the Kauman Great Mosque too would be reoriented using the astronomically calculated qibla.{{sfn|Kersten|2017|p=130}}{{sfn|Nashir|2015|p=77}}\n\n=== Outer space ===\n[[File:ISS Aug2005.jpg|thumb|The spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] started discussion about Islamic religious practices in space, including the determination of qibla.]]\nThe issue of qibla from outer space publicly arose before the spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]], a Malaysian surgeon who is a devout Muslim, to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) on October 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=114}} The ISS orbits the earth in high speed so that the direction to Mecca changes significantly in matters of seconds.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Before his departure, Sheikh Muzsaphar requested guidance from Malaysian religious authorities about the performance of Islamic practices in space, including how to pray, fast, and determine the qibla. In its response, the Malaysian National Fatwa Council recommended four options in regard to the qibla, in order of priority: 1) the Ka'bah itself 2) the projection of the Ka'bah into space 3) the Earth 4) \"wherever\".{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} The authors of the fatwa intended that it will also be used as guidelines for future Muslim astronauts, and it has been translated into multiple languages.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=114}} In line with the Malaysian fatwa council, other Muslim scholars argue for the importance of flexibility and adapting the qibla requirement to what an astronaut is capable of fulfilling.

The qibla is the direction of the building of [[Ka'bah]] in the [[Great Mosque|Sacred Mosque]], [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia, which Muslims believe to be a sacred site built by the prophets [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]]. According to the Islamic belief, this direction was ordained by God in the Quran, in chapter [[Al-Baqarah]] verses 144, 149, and 150, revealed to Muhammad in the second [[Hijri calendar|Hijri year]]; prior to this revelation Muhammad and his followers in [[Medina]] faced [[Jerusalem]] for prayers. Other than for the ritual prayer, it is also the direction for entering the state of [[ihram]] for the [[hajj]] pilgrimage, where animals are turned to in an [[dhabihah|Islamic slaughter]], for the dead when buried, the recommended direction to make [[dua|supplications]], and the avoided direction when relieving nature and spitting. Most mosque contains a ''[[mihrab]]'' or a wall niche indicating the direction of the qibla. In practice, there are two manners of observing the qibla: ''ayn al-ka'bah'' which faces the Ka'ba exactly, and ''jihat al-ka'bah'' which faces only its general direction. Most Islamic authorities believe that the more precise ''ayn al-ka'bah'' is only required when possible (for example, inside the Sacred Mosque or in its surroundings), and otherwise ''jihat al-ka'bah'' can be used.\n\nThe most common technical definition used by Muslim astronomers is the direction shown by the [[great circle]]\u2014in the [[Spherical Earth|Earth's sphere]]\u2014passing through the Ka'bah and one's location. This direction shows the shortest possible path from one's place to Ka'bah, and allows for the exact calculation (''hisab'') of the qibla using a [[spherical trigonometry|spherical trigonometric]] formula taking the coordinates of one's place and the Ka'bah as inputs.  The method is applied to develop [[Mobile app|mobile applications]] and websites for Muslims, and to compile qibla tables used in instruments such as the [[qibla compass]]. In addition, the qibla can also be determined by observing the shadow of a vertical rod at or around two times of the year when the sun is directly overhead in Mecca\u2014on 28 May at 12:18 [[Saudi Arabia Standard Time]] or 9:18 UTC and on 16 July at 12:27 SAST/9:27 UTC).\n\nBefore the development of astronomy in the Islamic world, Muslims used traditional methods to determine the qibla; these includes following the customs of the [[companions of the Prophet]] in one's place, using the setting and rising points of celestial objects, the direction of the wind, or using due south\u2014Muhammad's qibla in Medina\u2014everywhere. Early Islamic astronomy were built on its Indian and Greek counterparts\u2014especially the works of [[Ptolemy]], and soon Muslim astronomers developed methods to calculate approximate directions of the qibla, starting from mid-9th century. In the late 9th century and in the 10th century, Muslim astronomers developed methods to find the exact direction of the qibla that are equivalent to the modern formula. Initially, this \"qibla of the astronomers\" were used alongside various traditionally determined qiblas, resulting in a diversity of qiblas in medieval Muslim cities. In addition, the accurate geographic data necessary for the astronomical methods to yield an accurate result were only available in the 18th and 19th centuries, resulting in further diversity of the qibla. Historical mosques with differing qiblas still stand today throughout the Islamic world. The spaceflight of a devout Muslim [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] on October 2007 generated a discussion with regards to qibla from the outer space. On Sheikh Muszaphar's request, the Islamic authority of his home country Malaysia issued a detailed guidance, suggesting a determination \"based on what is possible\" for the astronaut, in line with recommendations from other Islamic scholars.\n\n==Location==\n{{main|Ka'bah|al-Masjid al-Haram}}\n{{Location map+|Middle East2| relief = yes |float=right|caption=Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem|places=\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=21.4228714|long=39.823546 |label=[[Mecca]]}}\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=24.4672105|long=39.6089423|label=[[Medina]]}}\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=31.7760692|long=35.2335915|label=[[Jerusalem]]}}\n}}\nThe qibla is the direction of the [[Ka'bah]], a cube-like building at the centre of the [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Sacred Mosque]] (''al-Masjid al-Haram'') in Mecca, in the [[Hejaz]] region of Saudi Arabia. Other than its role as qibla, it is a [[Holiest sites in Islam|sacred site]] for Muslims, known as the House of God (''Bait Allah'') and where the [[tawaf]] is performed during the [[hajj]] and [[umra]] pilgrimages. The Ka'bah has an approximately rectangular ground plan with its four corners pointing close to the four [[cardinal direction]]s.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=317}} According to the [[Quran]], it was built by [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]]\u2014both are prophets in Islam.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=318}} Not much historical records remain about the history of the Ka'bah prior to the rise of Islam, but in the generations before [[Muhammad]], the building had been used as a shrine of the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabic religion]].{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=318}}\n\nThe religious status of Ka'bah (or the Sacred Mosque in which it is located) as the qibla is based on the verses 144, 149, and 150 of the Quran's chapter of [[Surat al-Baqara|al-Baqarah]], each of which contains a command to \"turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque\" (''fawalli wajhaka shatr al-Masjid il-Haram'').{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=97\u201398}} According to the Islamic tradition, these verses were revealed on the month of [[Rajab]] or [[Shaban]] on the second [[Hijri calendar|Hijri year]] (624 [[Common Era|CE]]), or about 15 or 16 months after Muhammad's [[Hegira|migration to Medina]].{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=104}}{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} Prior to these revelations, Muhammad and the Muslims in Medina had prayed toward [[Jerusalem]] as qibla, the same direction [[Mizrah|used]] by the Jews of Medina for their prayers. Islamic traditions say that these verses were revealed during a prayer congregation; Muhammad and his followers immediately turned their directions from Jerusalem to Mecca in the middle of the prayer ritual. The location of this event now becomes [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] (\"the Mosque of the Two Qiblas\").{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}\n\nThere are different reports about the qibla direction when Muhammad was in Mecca (before his migration to Medina). According to one report, cited by historian [[al-Tabari]] and exegete [[al-Baydawi]], Muhammad prayed towards the Ka'bah. Another report, cited by [[al-Baladhuri]] and also by al-Tabari, says that Muhammad prayed towards Jerusalem while in Mecca. Another report, mentioned by [[Ibn Hisham]]'s [[Prophetic biography|biography of Muhammad]], says that Muhammad prayed in such a way as to simultaneously face the Ka'bah and Jerusalem.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} Today Muslims of all branches, including the Sunni and the Shia, all toward the Ka'bah. Historically, one major exception was the [[Qarmatians]], a now-defunct syncretic Shia sect which rejected the Ka'bah as the qibla; in 930, they sacked Mecca, took Ka'bah's [[Black Stone]] to their centre of power in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Ahsa]], with the intention of starting a new era in Islam.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=321}}{{sfn|Daftary|2007|p=149}}{{efn|This act was condemned both by the Sunni [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid caliph]] and the Shia [[Fatimid caliphate|Fatimid one]].

In Islamic ritual and law, it refers to a special direction faced by Muslims during prayers and other religious contexts.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} [[Ulama|Islamic religious scholars]] agree that facing the qibla is a necessary condition for the validity of [[salah]]\u2014the Islamic ritual prayer\u2014in normal conditions;{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=103}} exceptions include prayers during the state of fear or of war, as well as non-obligatory prayers during travel.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=91}}  In addition, the [[hadith]] also prescribed Muslims to face the qibla when entering the state of [[ihram]] for hajj, as after the middle ''[[Stoning of the Devil|jamrah]]'' (stone-throwing ritual) during the pilgrimage.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}  The [[Adab (Islam)|Islamic etiquette]] (''adab'') calls for Muslim to turn the head of the animal when [[Dhabihah|slaughtered]], and the faces of the dead when buried, toward the qibla.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} The qibla is the preferred direction when making a [[dua|supplication]] and is to be avoided when [[defecation|defecating]], [[urination|urinating]], and [[spitting]].{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}\n\nInside a [[mosque]], the qibla is usually indicated by a ''[[mihrab]]'', a [[niche (architecture)|niche]] in its qibla-facing wall. In a congregational prayer, the [[imam]] (worship leader) stands in it or close to it, in front of the rest of the congregation.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=3}} The ''mihrab'' started became part of a mosque during the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad period]] and its form is standardised during the [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid period]]; before that, the qibla of a mosque is known from the orientation of one of its walls, called the qibla wall. The term ''mihrab'' itself is only attested once in the Quran, but it refers to a place of prayer of the [[Israelites]] rather than a part of a mosque.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=3}}{{efn|This reference occurs in {{Cite Quran|19|11|style=nosup}}}}  The [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Fustat]], Egypt, one of the oldest mosques, is known to have been originally built without a ''mihrab'', even though now one has been added.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=4}}\n\n===''Ayn al-ka'bah'' and ''jihat al-ka'bah''===\n''Ayn al-ka'bah'' is facing the qibla so that an imaginary line extending from the person's line of sight would pass through the Ka'bah. This manner of observing the qibla is easily done inside the Great Mosque of Mecca and its surroundings, but given that the Ka'bah is less than {{conv|20|m|ft}} wide, this is virtually impossible from further locations.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=104\u2013105}} For example, from Medina\u2014with a {{conv|338|km|mi}} straight-line distance from the Ka'bah\u2014a 1\u00b0 deviation from the precise imaginary line\u2014an error hardly noticeable when setting one's prayer mat or assuming one's posture\u2014results in some {{convert|5.9|km|mi}} shift from the site of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=137}} This effect is amplified when further than Mecca:{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=134}} from [[Jakarta]], Indonesia\u2014some {{conv|7900|km|mi}} away, a 1\u00b0 deviation causes more than {{conv|100|km|mi}} shift, and even an [[arc second]]'s deviation\u2014{{nowrap|({{frac|1|3600}} of a degree)}}\u2014 causes more than {{conv|100|m|ft}} of shift from the location of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} In comparison, the construction process of a mosque can easily introduce up to 5\u00b0 error from the calculated qibla, and the installation of prayer rugs inside the mosque as indicators for worshippers can add up to a further 5\u00b0 deviation from the mosque's orientation.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}}\n\nA minority of Islamic religious scholars\u2014for example [[Ibn Arabi]]\u2014considers ''ayn al-ka'bah'' to be obligatory during the ritual prayer, while others consider it only obligatory when one is able. For locations further than Mecca, scholars such as [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Al-Qurtubi]] argue that it is permissible to assume ''jihat al-ka'bah'', facing only the general direction of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=92, 95}}  Some further argues that the ritual condition of facing the qibla is already fulfilled simply when the imaginary line to the Ka'bah is within one's field of vision.{{sfn|King|1996|p=134}} Therefore, for instance, there are legal opinions that accept the entire southeastern quadrant in [[Al-Andalus]] (historical Spain and Portugal), and the southwestern quadrant in [[Central Asia]], to be valid qibla.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=134\u2013135}} Arguments for the validity of ''jihat al-Ka'bah'' include the wording of the Quran which only commands Muslims to \"turn [one's] face\" toward the Great Mosque, and to avoid the impossible requirement which would result if ''ayn al-Ka'bah'' were to be obligatory in all places.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=95}} The [[Shafi'i school]] of Islamic law, as codified in [[Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi]]'s ''Kitab al-Tanbih fi'l-Fiqh'', argues that one must follow the qibla indicated by the local mosque when one is not near Mecca or, when not near a mosque, ask a trustworthy person.

Some early Muslims uses due south everywhere as qibla, following Muhammad's instruction to face south while he was in Medina (Mecca is due south of Medina) in a literal manner. Some mosques in as far as al-Andalus to the west and Central Asia to the east faces south even though Mecca is nowhere near that direction.{{sfn|King|1996|p=130}} In various places, there is also the \"qiblas of the companion\" (''qiblat al-sahaba''), those which were used in those places by the [[Companions of the Prophet]]\u2014the first generation of Muslims, who are considered role models in Islam. Such directions were used by some Muslims in the following centuries, side-by-side with other directions, even after Muslim astronomers used calculations to find more accurate directions to Mecca. Directions described as the qiblas of the companions include due south in Syria and Palestine,{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013131}} the direction of the winter sunrise in Egypt, and the direction of the winter sunset in Iraq.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132}} The direction of the winter sunrise and sunset are also traditionally favoured because they are parallel to the walls of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132, also figure 4.2 in p. 131}}\n\n== Development of methods ==\n=== Pre-astronomy ===\nThe determination of qibla is an important problems for Muslim communities throughout history. Muslims are required to know the qibla in order to perform their daily prayers, and it is also needed to determine the orientation of mosques.{{sfn|King|1996|p=128}} When Muhammad lived among the Muslims in Medina (which, like Mecca, is also in the [[Hejaz]] region), he prayed due south, according to the known direction of Mecca. Within the few generations after Muhammad's death in 632, Muslims have reached places far away from Mecca, presenting the problem of determining the qibla in new places.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013132}} Mathematical methods based on astronomy would only develop at the end of the eighth century or the beginning of the ninth and even then they were not initally popular. Therefore, early Muslims relied on non-astronomical methods.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nThere is a wide range of traditional methods in determining the qibla in the early Islamic period, resulting in different directions even from the same place. In addition to due south (used because it was the direction to which Muhammad prayed from Medina) and directions known as the qiblas of the companions (varies by place), the Arabs also knew a form of \"folk\" astronomy\u2014called so by [[David A. King (historian)|David A.

These methods yields specific directions in individual localities, often using the fixed setting and rising points of a specific star, the sunrise or sunset at the [[equinoxes]] or at the [[summer solstice|summer]] or the [[winter solstice]]s.{{sfn|King|1996|p=133}} Such qibla directions recorded in historical sources include: sunrise at the equinoxes (due west) in [[the Maghreb]], sunset at the equinoxes (due east) in India, the origin of the [[north wind]] or the fixed location of the [[North Star]] in Yemen, the rising point of the star ''Suhayl'' ([[Canopus]]) in Syria, and the midwinter sunset in Iraq.{{sfn|King|1996|p=133}} Such directions appear in texts of ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence) and texts of folk astronomy.

Other places, like the United States and Canada, have only had large Muslim communities in the past several decades, and the determination of qibla can be a matter of debate.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} The [[Islamic Center of Washington|Islamic Center of Washington, D.C.]] was built in 1953 facing slightly north of east and initially puzzled some observers, including Muslims, because [[Washington, D.C.]]'s latitude is 17\u00b030\u2032 more northerly than that of Mecca. Even though line drawn on world maps\u2014such as those using the Mercator projection\u2014would suggest a southeastern direction to Mecca, astronomical calculations using the great circle method do yield a north-of-east direction (56\u00b033\u2032).{{sfn|May|1953|p=367}} Nevertheless, most early mosques in the United States face east or southeast, following the apparent direction in world maps.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} As the Muslim community grew and the number of mosque increased, in 1978 an American Muslim scientist S. Kamal Abdali, wrote an article arguing that the correct qibla from North America was north or northeast as calculated by the great circle method, which identifies the shortest path to Mecca.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=54\u201355}}{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Abdali's conclusion was widely circulated and then  accepted by the Muslim community, and mosques were subsequently reoriented as a resi;t.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} In 1990, two religious scholars Riad Nachef and Samir Kadi published a book arguing for a southeastern qibla, writing that the north/northeast qibla was invalid and resulted from a lack of religious knowledge.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}}{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=31}} The two opinions resulted in a period of debate about the correct qibla,{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}} and eventually most North American Muslims accepted the north/northeast qibla with a minority following the east/southeast qibla.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=57}}\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nVariation of the qibla also occurs in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest world Muslim population. The astronomically calculated qibla ranges from 291\u00b0\u2014295\u00b0 (21\u00b0\u201425\u00b0 north of west) depending on the exact location in the archipelago.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=59\u201360}} However, the qibla is often traditionally known as simply 'the west', resulting in mosques built oriented due west or to the direction of sunset\u2014which slightly varies throughout the year. Different opinions exist among Indonesian Islamic astronomers: Tono Saksono ''et al.'' argues that facing the qibla during prayers is more of a \"spiritual prerequisite\" than a precise physical one, and that an exact direction to the Ka'bah itself from thousands of kilometres away requires an extreme precision impossible to achieve when building a mosque or when standing for prayers.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} On the other hands, Muhammad Hadi Bashori opined that \"correcting the qibla is indeed a very urgent thing,\" and can be guided by simple methods such as observing the shadow.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=60\u201361}} In the history of the region, disputes about the qibla has also occurred in the then-[[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1890s. When the Indonesian scholar and future founder of [[Muhammadiyah]], [[Ahmad Dahlan]] returned from his Islamic and astronomy studies in Mecca he found that mosques in the royal capital of [[Yogyakarta]] had inaccurate qiblas, including the [[Kauman Great Mosque]] which faced due west. His efforts in adjusting the qibla was opposed by the traditional ulama of the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], and a new mosque built by Dahlan using his calculations was demolished by a mob. Dahlan rebuilt his mosque in the 1900s and later the Kauman Great Mosque too would be reoriented using the astronomically calculated qibla.{{sfn|Kersten|2017|p=130}}{{sfn|Nashir|2015|p=77}}\n\n=== Outer space ===\n[[File:ISS Aug2005.jpg|thumb|The spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] started discussion about Islamic religious practices in space, including the determination of qibla.]]\nThe issue of qibla from outer space publicly arose before the spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]], a Malaysian surgeon who is a devout Muslim, to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) on October 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=114}} The ISS orbits the earth in high speed so that the direction to Mecca changes significantly in matters of seconds.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Before his departure, Sheikh Muzsaphar requested guidance from Malaysian religious authorities about the performance of Islamic practices in space, including how to pray, fast, and determine the qibla. In its response, the Malaysian National Fatwa Council recommended four options in regard to the qibla, in order of priority: 1) the Ka'bah itself 2) the projection of the Ka'bah into space 3) the Earth 4) \"wherever\".{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} The authors of the fatwa intended that it will also be used as guidelines for future Muslim astronauts, and it has been translated into multiple languages.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=114}} In line with the Malaysian fatwa council, other Muslim scholars argue for the importance of flexibility and adapting the qibla requirement to what an astronaut is capable of fulfilling. Khaleel Muhammad of the [[San Diego State University]] opined \"God does not take a person to task for that which is beyond his/her ability to work with\" and Abdali argued that concentration during a prayer is more important than the exact orientation, and suggest keeping the qibla direction at the start of a prayer instead of \"worrying about possible changes in position\".{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Before Sheikh Muszaphar's mission, at least eight Muslims had flown to space, but none of them publicly discussed issues relating to worship in space.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=109}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Black Stone]]\n*[[Craig retroazimuthal projection]]\n*[[Haram (site)#Holy site|Holy site]]\n**[[Holiest sites in Islam]]\n*''[[Mizrah|Mizr\u00e2\u1e25]]'', the [[Judaism|Jewish]] equivalent of the Qiblah\n*''[[Qiblih]]'', the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] equivalent\n*[[List of Muslim astronauts#Praying towards Mecca in space|Praying towards Mecca in space]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n==References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite journal|title=Services and Applications Based on Mobile User\u2019s Location Detection and Prediction|first1=Mohammed|last1=Abo-Zahhad|first2=Sabah M.|last2=Ahmed|first3=Mohamed|last3=Mourad|journal=International Journal of Communications, Network and System Sciences|volume=6|issue=4|year=2013|doi=10.4236/ijcns.2013.64020|issn=1913-3723 |ref=harv|publisher=Scientific Research Publishing|pages=167\u2013175}}\n* {{cite journal|title=Calculating an Azimuth from One Location to Another A Case Study in Determining the Qibla to Makkah|first1=Ghazy|last1=Almakky|first2=John|last2=Snyder|journal=Cartographica: The International Journal for Geographic Information and Geovisualization | volume =33| issue =2 | year = 1996 | publisher = [[University of Toronto Press]] | issn=0317-7173 | pages = 29\u201336 | ref=harv |doi = 10.3138/C567-3003-1225-M204}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bilici|first=Mucahit|title=Finding Mecca in America: How Islam Is Becoming an American Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-GLAV-KTtQ0C|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-92287-4}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|title=The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSO9zh61AGEC|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-46578-6}}\n* {{cite magazine | title = A Muslim Astronaut's Dilemma: How to Face Mecca From Space | magazine = [[WIRED (magazine)|WIRED]] | first=Patrick | last=Di Justo | year = 2007  | url = https://www.wired.com/2007/09/mecca-in-orbit/ | publisher = [[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hadi Bashori|first=Muhammad|title=Penanggalan Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YhKDwAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Elex Media Komputindo|location=Jakarta|isbn=978-602-02-3675-9|language=id}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hadi Bashori|first=Muhammad|title=Pengantar Ilmu Falak|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=erLqDAAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Pustaka Al Kautsar|location=Jakarta|isbn=978-979-592-701-3|language=id}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first=Mohammad |last=Ilyas|title=A modern guide to astronomical calculations of Islamic calendar, times & qibla|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mrvAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|location=Kuala Lumpur|publisher=Berita Publishing|oclc=13512629|isbn=9789679690095}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kersten|first=Carool |title=History of Islam in Indonesia: Unity in Diversity|year=2017|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-8187-7}}\n* {{Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition|volume=5|title=\u1e32ibla: Astronomical Aspects |page=83\u201388|first=David A.|last=King|authorlink=David A.

Then the following are equivalent:{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=403-404}} \n# ''(Z, T)'' is a [[tensor product]] of ''X'' and ''Y'';\n# (a) the image of ''T'' spans all of ''Z'', and (b) ''X'' and ''Y'' are ''T''-linearly disjoint (this means that for all positive integers ''n'' and all elements <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in X</math> and <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\in Y</math> such that <math>\\sum_{i=1}^{n} T(x_i, y_i) = 0</math>, (i) if all <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n</math> are linearly independent then all <math>y_i</math> are 0, and (ii) if all <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n</math> are linearly independent then all <math>x_i</math> are 0).\n:* Equivalently, ''X'' and ''Y'' are ''T''-linearly disjoint if and only if for all linearly independent sequences <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_m</math> in ''X'' and all linearly independent sequences <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n</math> in ''Y'', the vectors <math>\\left\\{ T(x_i, y_j) : 1 \\leq i \\leq m, 1 \\leq j \\leq n \\right\\}</math> are linearly independent.\n\n=== Topology ===\n\nHenceforth, all topological vector spaces considered will be assumed to be locally convex. \nIf ''Z'' is any locally convex topological vector space, then for any [[equicontinuous]] subsets <math>G \\subseteq X^{\\prime}</math> and <math>H \\subseteq Y^{\\prime}</math>, and any neighborhood <math>N</math> in ''Z'', define \n:<math>\\mathcal{U}(G, H, N) = \\{b \\in \\mathcal{B}\\left( X^{\\prime}_{b}, Y^{\\prime}_{b}; Z \\right) : b(G, H) \\subseteq N\\}</math>\nIt can be shown that every set <math>b(G, H)</math> is bounded, which is necessary and sufficient for the collection of all such <math>\\mathcal{U}(G, H, N)</math> to form a locally convex TVS topology on <math>\\mathcal{B}\\left( X^{\\prime}_{b}, Y^{\\prime}_{b}; Z \\right)</math> called the '''\u03b5-topology'''.

The space <math>\\mathcal{B}\\left( X^{\\prime}_{\\sigma}, Y^{\\prime}_{\\sigma}\\right)</math> is complete if and only if both ''X'' and ''Y'' are complete, in which case the completion of <math>B\\left( X^{\\prime}_{\\sigma}, Y^{\\prime}_{\\sigma}\\right)</math> is a subvector space of <math>\\mathcal{B}\\left( X^{\\prime}_{\\sigma}, Y^{\\prime}_{\\sigma}\\right)</math>.\n\n== Relation to projective tensor product and nuclear spaces ==\nThe [[strongest]] locally convex topology on <math>B\\left( X^{\\prime}_{\\sigma}, Y^{\\prime}_{\\sigma}\\right) = X \\otimes Y</math> making the canonical map <math>\\cdot \\otimes \\cdot : X \\times Y \\to B\\left( X_{\\sigma}^{\\prime}, Y_{\\sigma}^{\\prime} \\right)</math> (defined by sending <math>(x, y) \\in X \\times Y</math> to the bilinear form <math>x \\otimes y</math>) continuous is called the '''projective topology''' or the '''\u03c0-topology'''. When <math>B\\left( X^{\\prime}_{\\sigma}, Y^{\\prime}_{\\sigma}\\right) = X \\otimes Y</math> is endowed with this topology then it will be denoted by <math>X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y</math> and called the '''projective tensor product''' of ''X'' and ''Y''. \n\n\n== Canonical identifications of bilinear and linear maps ==\nIn this section we describe canonical identifications between spaces of bilinear and linear maps. These identifications will be used to define important subspaces and topologies (particularly those that relate to [[nuclear operator]]s and [[nuclear space]]s).\n\n== Properties ==\n\n* The canonical map <math>\\cdot \\otimes \\cdot : X \\times Y \\to \\mathcal{B}\\left( X_{\\sigma}^{\\prime}, Y_{\\sigma}^{\\prime} \\right)</math> is continuous.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=434}} \n* If ''X'' and ''Y'' are normed then <math>X \\otimes_{\\epsilon} Y</math> is normable. \n* <math>X \\otimes_{\\epsilon} Y</math> is Hausdorff if and only if both ''X'' and ''Y'' are Hausdorff.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=434}}\n* Suppose that <math>u : X_1 \\to Y_1</math> and <math>v : X_2 \\to Y_2</math> are two linear maps between locally convex spaces.

Before the bridge was built, the ferry was the main mode of transport across River Mandovi in the 1970s between Panaji and [[Betim]] village. Due to heavy traffic, the first bridge was built in the 1970s. Later in 1986 the first bridge collapsed and was later rebuilt. The second bridge was constructed in 1998 in order to accommodate heavy transport vehicles. The third bridge began construction in 2014. The reason for the third cable-stayed bridge is to accommodate heavy traffic, especially during the peak year end tourist season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/new-bridges-necessary-to-handle-year-end-tourist-traffic-says-cm/articleshow/62273768.cms|title=New bridges necessary to handle year-end tourist traffic, says CM - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref> The bridge was inaugurated on 27 January 2019.\n\n== Construction ==\nOn 14 June 2014, the foundation stone for the third Mandovi bridge was laid by [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]].

Before the bridge was built, the ferry was the main mode of transport across River Mandovi in the 1970s between Panaji and [[Betim]] village. Due to heavy traffic, the first bridge was built in the 1970s. Later in 1986 the first bridge collapsed and was later rebuilt. The second bridge was constructed in 1998 in order to accommodate heavy transport vehicles. The third bridge began construction in 2014. The reason for the third cable-stayed bridge is to accommodate heavy traffic especially during the peak year end tourist season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/new-bridges-necessary-to-handle-year-end-tourist-traffic-says-cm/articleshow/62273768.cms|title=New bridges necessary to handle year-end tourist traffic, says CM - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref> The bridge was inaugurated on 27 January 2019.\n\n== Construction ==\nOn 14 June 2014, the foundation stone for the third Mandovi bridge was laid by [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]].

It is directly across the river from [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The power station closed in 1981.\n\nPrior to redevelopment, the power station was a {{Convert|200|m|abbr=on}} long, [[steel frame]]d, brick [[Cladding (construction)|clad]] building with a substantial central chimney standing {{Convert|99|m|abbr=on}}. The structure was roughly divided into three main areas each running east\u2013west \u2013 the huge main [[Turbine Hall]] in the centre, with the [[Mechanical room|boiler house]] to the north and the switch house to the south.\n\n=== Initial redevelopment ===\nFor many years after closure Bankside Power station was at risk of being demolished by developers. Many people campaigned for the building to be saved and put forward suggestions for possible new uses. An application to [[listed building|list]] the building was refused. In April 1994 the [[Tate]] Gallery announced that Bankside would be the home for the new Tate Modern. In July of the same year, an international competition was launched to select an architect for the new gallery. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of [[Herzog & de Meuron]] were announced as the winning architects in January 1995. The \u00a3134&nbsp;million conversion to the Tate Modern started in June 1995 and completed in January 2000.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/10439829.Tate_Modern_builders_win___400m_Battersea_Power_Station_contract/|title=Tate Modern builders Carillion win \u00a3400m Battersea Power Station contract|publisher=Your local Guardian|date=23 May 2013|accessdate=27 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe most obvious external change was the two-story glass extension on one half of the roof. Much of the original internal structure remained, including the cavernous main turbine hall, which retained the overhead travelling crane. An [[electrical substation]], taking up the Switch House in the southern third of the building, remained on-site and owned by the French power company [[EDF Energy]] while Tate took over the northern Boiler House for Tate Modern's main exhibition spaces.\n\n[[File:Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony.JPG|300px|thumb|Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony]]\nThe history of the site as well as information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary ''Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building & Tate Modern''.

At six stories tall it represents the full height of the original power station building. It is cut by bridges between the Boiler House and the Switch House on levels 1 and 4 but the space is otherwise undivided.

These exhibitions normally run for three or four months. When they were located on a single floor, the two exhibition areas could be combined to host a single exhibition. This was done for the [[Gilbert and George]] retrospective due to the size and number of the works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/gilbert-george|title=Gilbert & George \u2013 Tate|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref> Currently the two wings used are on level 3.

One tank is used to display installation and video art specially commissioned for the space while smaller areas are used to show installation and video art from the collection. The Tanks have also been used as a venue for live music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/emzj6q|title=Proms at ... The Tanks at Tate Modern|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Project Space ====\nThe Project Space (formerly known as the Level 2 Gallery) was a smaller gallery located on the north side of the Boiler House on level 1 which housed exhibitions of contemporary art in collaboration with other international art organisations. Its exhibitions typically ran for 2\u20133 months and then travelled to the collaborating institution for display there. The space was only accessible by leaving the building and re-entering using a dedicated entrance. It is no longer used as gallery space.\n\n==== Other areas ====\nWorks are also sometimes shown in the restaurants and members' rooms. Other locations that have been used in the past include the mezzanine on Level 1 and the north facing exterior of the Boiler House building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/street-art|title=Street Art \u2013 Tate|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Other facilities ==\nIn addition to exhibition space there are a number of other facilities:\n* A large performance space in one of the tanks on level 0 used to show a changing programme of performance works for which there is sometimes an entrance charge.\n* The Starr Auditorium and a seminar room on level 1 which are used to show films and host events for which there is usually an entrance charge.\n* The Clore Education Centre, Clore Information Room and McAulay Studios on level 0 which are facilities for use by visiting educational institutions.\n* One large and several small shops selling books, prints and merchandise.\n* A cafe, an espresso bar, a restaurant and bar and a members' room.\n* Tate Modern community garden, co-managed with [[Bankside Open Spaces Trust]]\n\n== Access and environs ==\n[[File:Wobbly bridge 120600.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tate Modern on the opening day of the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] in 2000]]\nThe closest station is [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]] via its new south entrance.

It is directly across the river from [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The power station closed in 1981.\n\nPrior to redevelopment, the power station was a {{Convert|200|m|abbr=on}} long, [[steel frame]]d, brick [[Cladding (construction)|clad]] building with a substantial central chimney standing {{Convert|99|m|abbr=on}}. The structure was roughly divided into three main areas each running east\u2013west \u2013 the huge main [[Turbine Hall]] in the centre, with the [[Mechanical room|boiler house]] to the north and the switch house to the south.\n\n=== Initial redevelopment ===\nFor many years after closure Bankside Power station was at risk of being demolished by developers. Many people campaigned for the building to be saved and put forward suggestions for possible new uses. An application to [[listed building|list]] the building was refused. In April 1994 the [[Tate]] Gallery announced that Bankside would be the home for the new Tate Modern. In July of the same year, an international competition was launched to select an architect for the new gallery. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of [[Herzog & de Meuron]] were announced as the winning architects in January 1995. The \u00a3134&nbsp;million conversion to the Tate Modern started in June 1995 and completed in January 2000.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/10439829.Tate_Modern_builders_win___400m_Battersea_Power_Station_contract/|title=Tate Modern builders Carillion win \u00a3400m Battersea Power Station contract|publisher=Your local Guardian|date=23 May 2013|accessdate=27 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe most obvious external change was the two-story glass extension on one half of the roof. Much of the original internal structure remained, including the cavernous main turbine hall, which retained the overhead travelling crane. An [[electrical substation]], taking up the Switch House in the southern third of the building, remained on-site and owned by the French power company [[EDF Energy]] while Tate took over the northern Boiler House for Tate Modern's main exhibition spaces.\n\n[[File:Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony.JPG|300px|thumb|Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony]]\nThe history of the site as well as information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary ''Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building & Tate Modern''. This challenging conversion work was carried by [[Carillion]].<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n=== Opening and initial reception ===\nTate Modern was opened by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] on 11 May 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/8/newsid_2519000/2519069.stm|title=2000: Sneak preview of new Tate Modern|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nTate Modern received 5.25&nbsp;million visitors in its first year.

The Switch House shows art from 1960 to the present day.<ref name=\"map\" />\n\nThe Turbine Hall is a single large space running the whole length of the building between the Boiler House and the Switch House. At six stories tall it represents the full height of the original power station building. It is cut by bridges between the Boiler House and the Switch House on levels 1 and 4 but the space is otherwise undivided. The western end consists of a gentle ramp down from the entrance and provides access to both sides on level 0.

These exhibitions normally run for three or four months. When they were located on a single floor, the two exhibition areas could be combined to host a single exhibition. This was done for the [[Gilbert and George]] retrospective due to the size and number of the works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/gilbert-george|title=Gilbert & George \u2013 Tate|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref> Currently the two wings used are on level 3.

One tank is used to display installation and video art specially commissioned for the space while smaller areas are used to show installation and video art from the collection. The Tanks have also been used as a venue for live music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/emzj6q|title=Proms at ... The Tanks at Tate Modern|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Project Space ====\nThe Project Space (formerly known as the Level 2 Gallery) was a smaller gallery located on the north side of the Boiler House on level 1 which housed exhibitions of contemporary art in collaboration with other international art organisations. Its exhibitions typically ran for 2\u20133 months and then travelled to the collaborating institution for display there. The space was only accessible by leaving the building and re-entering using a dedicated entrance. It is no longer used as gallery space.\n\n==== Other areas ====\nWorks are also sometimes shown in the restaurants and members' rooms. Other locations that have been used in the past include the mezzanine on Level 1 and the north facing exterior of the Boiler House building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/street-art|title=Street Art \u2013 Tate|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Other facilities ==\nIn addition to exhibition space there are a number of other facilities:\n* A large performance space in one of the tanks on level 0 used to show a changing programme of performance works for which there is sometimes an entrance charge.\n* The Starr Auditorium and a seminar room on level 1 which are used to show films and host events for which there is usually an entrance charge.\n* The Clore Education Centre, Clore Information Room and McAulay Studios on level 0 which are facilities for use by visiting educational institutions.\n* One large and several small shops selling books, prints and merchandise.\n* A cafe, an espresso bar, a restaurant and bar and a members' room.\n* Tate Modern community garden, co-managed with [[Bankside Open Spaces Trust]]\n\n== Access and environs ==\n[[File:Wobbly bridge 120600.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tate Modern on the opening day of the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] in 2000]]\nThe closest station is [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]] via its new south entrance.

The lampposts between Southwark tube station and Tate Modern are painted orange to show pedestrian visitors the route.\n\nThere is also a [[Thames Clippers|riverboat]] pier just outside the gallery called [[Bankside Pier]], with connections to the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] and [[Greenwich]] via regular passenger boat services (commuter service) and the Tate to Tate service, which connects Tate Modern with Tate Britain.\n\nTo the west of Tate Modern lie the sleek stone and glass Ludgate House, the former headquarters of [[Express Newspapers]] and [[Sampson House]], a massive late [[Brutalist]] office building.\n\n=== Transport connections ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The sport was created in 1882 by [[Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d|Jigoro Kano]] (\u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce) as a physical, mental, and moral [[pedagogy]] in Japan. With its origins coming from [[Jujutsu]], Judo's most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either [[Throw (grappling)|throw]] or [[Takedown (grappling)|take down]] an opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a [[Pinning hold|pin]], or force an opponent to submit with a [[joint lock]] or a [[Chokehold|choke]]. [[Strike (attack)|Strikes]] and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms ([[kata]], \u5f62) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ([[randori]], \u4e71\u53d6\u308a). Also refereed to as Kan\u014d Jiu-Jitsu until the introduction to the [[Olympic Games]], A judo practitioner is called a '''judoka'''.\n\nThe philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from {{nihongo3|''[[kory\u016b]]''|\u53e4\u6d41||traditional schools}}. Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world, such as [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[Krav Maga]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] and [[ARB (martial art)|ARB]].\n\n== History and philosophy ==\n\n=== Early life of the founder ===\n[[File:Kano Jigoro.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jigoro Kano]]]]\n\nThe early history of judo is inseparable from its founder, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[polymath]] and educator {{nihongo3|Jigoro Kano|\u5609\u7d0d \u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce|[[Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d]]|1860\u20131938}}, born {{nihongo3|Jigor\u014d Shinnosuke|\u65b0\u4e4b\u52a9 \u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce|Shinnosuke Jigor\u014d}}. Kano was born into a relatively affluent family. His father, Jirosaku, was the second son of the head priest of the [[Shinto]] [[Hiyoshi Shrine|Hiyoshi shrine]] in [[Shiga Prefecture]]. He married Sadako Kano, daughter of the owner of Kiku-Masamune sake brewing company and was adopted by the family, changing his name to Kano. He ultimately became an official in the [[Bakufu#Shogunate|Shogunal]] government.<ref>Kano (2008) pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nJigoro Kano had an academic upbringing and, from the age of seven, he studied English, {{nihongo3|[[Japanese calligraphy]]|\u66f8\u9053|shod\u014d}} and the {{nihongo|[[Four Books#Four Books|Four Confucian Texts]]|\u56db\u66f8|Shisho}} under a number of tutors.<ref name=\"Kano 2008, p. 1; Hoare 2009, p. 43\">Kano (2008) p. 1; Hoare (2009) p. 43</ref> When he was fourteen, Kano began boarding at an English-medium school, Ikuei-Gijuku in [[Shiba, Tokyo]]. The culture of [[bullying]] endemic at this school was the catalyst that caused Kano to seek out a {{nihongo3|[[Jujutsu]]|\u67d4\u8853|J\u016bjutsu}} {{nihongo3|[[dojo]]|\u9053\u5834|d\u014dj\u014d|training place}} at which to train.<ref name=\"Kano 2008, p. 1; Hoare 2009, p. 43\"/>\n\nEarly attempts to find a jujutsu teacher who was willing to take him on met with little success. With the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, jujutsu had become unfashionable in an increasingly [[Westernization|westernized]] Japan. Many of those who had once taught the art had been forced out of teaching or become so disillusioned with it that they had simply given up. Nakai Umenari, an acquaintance of Kan\u014d's father and a former soldier, agreed to show him ''kata'', but not to teach him.

It was a relatively small affair, consisting of a 12 [[Tatami|jo]]<ref>Jo is the Japanese unit of area.</ref> (214 sq ft) training area. Kano took in resident and non-resident students, the first two being [[Tomita Tsunejir\u014d]] and [[Shiro Saigo]].<ref>Kano (2008) p. 20</ref> In August, the following year, the pair were granted {{nihongo3|[[shodan (rank)|shodan]]|\u521d\u6bb5||first rank}} grades, the first that had been awarded in any martial art.<ref>Lowry (2006) p. 49</ref>\n\n=== Judo versus jujutsu ===\n{{main|Kodokan-Totsuka rivalry}}\nCentral to Kano's vision for judo were the principles of {{nihongo3|''seiryoku zen'y\u014d''|\u7cbe\u529b\u5584\u7528||Maximum efficiency, minimum effort}} and {{nihongo3|''jita ky\u014dei''|\u81ea\u4ed6\u5171\u6804||mutual welfare and benefit}}.

This is the theory of ''ju yoku go o seisu''.<ref>Kano (2005) pp. 39\u201340</ref>}}\n\nKano realised that ''seiryoku zen'y\u014d'', initially conceived as a jujutsu concept, had a wider philosophical application. Coupled with the [[Confucianism|Confucianist]]-influenced ''jita ky\u014dei'', the wider application shaped the development of judo from a {{nihongo3|martial art|\u6b66\u8853|bujutsu}} to a {{nihongo3|martial way|\u6b66\u9053|bud\u014d}}. Kano rejected techniques that did not conform to these principles and emphasised the importance of efficiency in the execution of techniques. He was convinced that practice of jujutsu while conforming to these ideals was a route to self-improvement and the betterment of society in general.<ref>For Kano's opinions on the wider applicability of ''jita ky\u014dei'' to life see for example, Kano (2008) p. 107</ref> He was, however, acutely conscious of the Japanese public's negative perception of jujutsu:\n\n{{quotation|At the time a few bujitsu (martial arts) experts still existed but bujitsu was almost abandoned by the nation at large.

So I thought it better to teach under a different name principally because my objectives were much wider than jujitsu.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 56</ref>}}\n\nKano believed that \"''j\u016bjutsu''\" was insufficient to describe his art: although {{nihongo3|''jutsu''|\u8853}} means \"art\" or \"means\", it implies a method consisting of a collection of physical techniques. Accordingly, he changed the second character to {{nihongo3|''d\u014d''|\u9053}}, meaning way, road or path, which implies a more philosophical context than ''jutsu'' and has a common origin with the Chinese concept of ''[[tao]]''.

In 1899, Kano was asked to chair a committee of the [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]] to draw up the first formal set of contest rules for jujutsu. These rules were intended to cover contests between different various traditional schools of jujutsu as well as practitioners of Kodokan judo. Contests were 15 minutes long and were judged on the basis of nage waza and katame waza, excluding atemi waza. Wins were by two ippons, awarded in every four-main different path of winning alternatives, by \"Throwing\", where the opponent's back strikes flat onto the mat with sufficient force, by \"Pinning\" them on their back for a \"sufficient\" amount of time, or by Submission, which could be achieved via \"Shime-waza\" or \"Kansetsu-waza\", in which the opponent was forced to give himself or herself up or summon a referee's or corner-judge's stoppage. Finger, toe and ankle locks were prohibited.<ref name=\"judoruleshistory\">Hoare (2005) pp. 4\u20137</ref> In 1900, these rules were adopted by the Kodokan with amendments made to prohibit all joint locks for kyu grades and added wrist locks to the prohibited kansetsu-waza for ''[[dan (rank)|dan]]'' grades. It was also stated that the ratio of tachi-waza to ne-waza should be between 70% to 80% for kyu grades and 60% to 70% for dan grades.<ref name=\"judoruleshistory\"/>\n\nIn 1916, additional rulings were brought in to further limit ''kansetsu waza'' with the prohibition of ''[[ashi garami]]'' and neck locks, as well as ''do jime''.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 109</ref> These were further added to in 1925.\n\nThe first time judo was seen in the [[Olympic Games]] was in an informal demonstration hosted by Kano at the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judoinfo.com/kano.htm |title=The Contribution of Judo to Education by Jigoro Kano |website=Judoinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref> However, Kano was ambivalent about judo's potential inclusion as an Olympic sport:\n{{quotation|I have been asked by people of various sections as to the wisdom and possibility of judo being introduced with other games and sports at the Olympic Games. My view on the matter, at present, is rather passive. If it be the desire of other member countries, I have no objection. But I do not feel inclined to take any initiative. For one thing, judo in reality is not a mere sport or game. I regard it as a principle of life, art and science. In fact, it is a means for personal cultural attainment. Only one of the forms of judo training, so-called randori or free practice can be classed as a form of sport. Certainly, to some extent, the same may be said of boxing and fencing, but today they are practiced and conducted as sports. Then the Olympic Games are so strongly flavored with nationalism that it is possible to be influenced by it and to develop \"Contest Judo\", a retrograde form as ju-jitsu was before the Kodokan was founded. Judo should be free as art and science from any external influences, political, national, racial, and financial or any other organized interest. And all things connected with it should be directed to its ultimate object, the \"Benefit of Humanity\". Human sacrifice is a matter of ancient history.<ref>Koizumi (1947)</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, [[Judo at the 1964 Summer Olympics|judo became an Olympic sport]] for men in the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Games]] in [[Tokyo]].

A shido (\u6307\u5c0e - literally \"guidance\") is awarded for minor rule infringements. A shido can also be awarded for a prolonged period of non-aggression. Recent rule changes allow for the first shidos to result in only warnings. If there is a tie, then and only then, will the number of shidos (if less than three) be used to determine the winner. After three shidos are given, the victory is given to the opponent, constituting an indirect hansoku-make (\u53cd\u5247\u8ca0\u3051 - literally \"foul-play defeat\"), but does not result in expulsion from the tournament. Note: Prior to 2017, the 4th shido was hansoku-make.

The terms judo and jujutsu were quite interchangeable in the early years, so some of these forms of judo are still known as jujutsu or jiu-jitsu either for that reason, or simply to differentiate them from mainstream judo. From Kano's original style of judo, several related forms have evolved\u2014some now widely considered to be distinct arts:\n\n* {{nihongo3|[[Kosen judo]]|\u9ad8\u5c08\u67d4\u9053}}: Sometimes erroneously described as a separate style of Judo, Kosen judo is a competition rules set of Kodokan judo that was popularized in the early 20th century for use in Japanese Special High Schools Championships held at Kyoto Imperial University.<ref>Kashiwazaki (1997) pp. 14\u201315</ref> The word \"Kosen\" is an acronym of {{nihongo3|Koto Senmon Gakko|\u9ad8\u7b49\u5c02\u9580\u5b66\u6821||literally \"Higher Professional School\"}}. Kosen judo's focus on newaza has drawn comparisons with [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]].\n* Russian judo: This distinctive style of judo was influenced by the Russian martial art called [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]]. It is represented by well-known coaches such as [[Alexander Retuinskih]] and [[Igor Yakimov]], and [[mixed martial arts]] fighters such as [[Fedor Emelianenko]] and [[Karo Parisyan]]. In turn, Russian judo has influenced mainstream judo, with techniques such as the [[flying armbar]] being accepted into Kodokan judo.\n* [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] (especially Sport Sambo): a derivative of Judo combined with  [[wrestling]] techniques, and striking in case of [[Combat Sambo]]. [[Vasili Oshchepkov]] was the first European judo black belt under Kano. Oshchepkov went on to contribute his knowledge of judo as one of the three founders of Sambo, which also integrated various international and [[Soviet bloc]] wrestling styles and other combative techniques. Oshchepkov died during the political [[Great Purge|purges]] of 1937. In their ''History of Sambo'', Brett Jacques and Scott Anderson wrote that in Russia \"judo and SOMBO were considered to be the same thing\"\u2014albeit with a different uniform and some differences in the rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/stratfordsombo/articles/history-2.html |title=The History of Sombo |website=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>\n* [[Brazilian jiu jitsu]]\n* Freestyle Judo is a form of competitive judo practiced primarily in the US, that retains techniques that have been removed from mainstream IJF rules.<ref>[http://image.aausports.org/dnn/judo/2016/2016JudoHandbook.pdf Judo handbook (PDF)]</ref> Freestyle Judo is currently backed by the International Freestyle Judo Alliance (IFJA).

American Pangamot instructors include former Army Ranger, Christopher J. Petrilli, mixed martial arts coach Thomas Weissmuller, and UFC Coach, Ray Yee.\n\n== Safety ==\nKano's vision for judo was one of a martial way that could be practiced realistically. [[Randori]] (free practice) was a central part of judo pedagogy and shiai (competition) a crucial test of a judoka's understanding of judo.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kano|first=Jigoro|title=The Contribution of Judo to Education|url=http://judoinfo.com/kano1.htm|website=Judoinfo.com|accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref> Safety necessitated some basic innovations that shaped judo's development. Atemi waza (striking techniques) were entirely limited to kata (prearranged forms) early in judo's history. Kansetsu waza (joint manipulation techniques) were limited to techniques that focused on the elbow joint. Various throwing techniques that were judged to be too dangerous to practice safely at full force, such as all joint-locking throws from [[Jujutsu]], were also prohibited in shiai. To maximise safety in nage waza (throwing techniques), judoka trained in [[ukemi]] (break falls) and practiced on [[tatami]] (rice straw mats).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== ''Kansetsu'' and ''shime waza'' ===\nThe application of joint manipulation and strangulation/choking techniques is generally safe under controlled conditions typical of judo dojo and in competition. It is usual for there to be age restrictions on the practice and application of these types of techniques, but the exact nature of these restrictions will vary from country to country and from organization to organization.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== ''Nage waza'' ===\nSafety in the practice of throwing techniques depends on the skill level of both tori and uke. Inexpertly applied throws have the potential to injure both tori and uke, for instance when tori compensates for poor technique by powering through the throw. Similarly, poor ukemi can result in injury, particularly from more powerful throws that uke lacks the skill to breakfall from. For these reasons, throws are normally taught in order of difficulty for both tori and uke. This is exemplified in the [[List of Kodokan judo techniques|''Gokyo'']] {{nihongo3||\u4e94\u6559||literally \"five teachings\"}}, a traditional grouping of throws arranged in order of difficulty of ukemi. Those grouped in {{nihongo3|''Dai ikkyo''|\u7b2c\u4e00\u6559||literally \"first teaching\"}} are relatively simple to breakfall from whereas those grouped in {{nihongo3|''dai gokyo'' |\u7b2c\u4e94\u6559||literally \"fifth teaching\"}} are difficult to breakfall from.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Judoka (practitioner) ==\nA practitioner of judo is known as a {{nihongo3|judoka|\u67d4\u9053\u5bb6}}.

As of 2011, [[List of judoka#Highest grades|fifteen Japanese men]] have been promoted to the tenth degree black belt ''judan'' by the Kodokan, three of whom are still alive;<ref name=judorank/> the IJF and Western and Asian national federations have promoted another eleven who are not recognized (at that level of rank) by the Kodokan. On July 28, 2011, the promotion board of USA Judo awarded [[Keiko Fukuda]] the rank of 10th ''dan'', who was the first woman to be promoted to judo's highest level, albeit not a Kodokan-recognized rank.\n\nAlthough ''dan'' ranks tend to be consistent between national organizations there is more variation in the ''ky\u016b'' grades, with some countries having more ''ky\u016b'' grades. Although initially ''ky\u016b'' grade belt colours were uniformly white, today a variety of colours are used. The first black belts to denote a [[dan rank]] in the 1880s, initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in [[kimono]], only [[white belt|white]] and black obi were used. It was not until the early 1900s, after the introduction of the [[judogi]], that an expanded colored belt system of awarding rank was created.<ref name=judorank/> Written accounts from the archives of London's Budokwai judo club, founded in 1918, record the use of colored judo belts at the 1926 9th annual Budokwai Display, and a list of ranked colored judokas appears in the Budokwai Committee Minutes of June 1927.

The sport was created in 1882 by [[Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d|Jigoro Kano]] (\u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce) as a physical, mental, and moral [[pedagogy]] in Japan. With its origins coming from [[Jujutsu]], Judo's most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either [[Throw (grappling)|throw]] or [[Takedown (grappling)|take down]] an opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a [[Pinning hold|pin]], or force an opponent to submit with a [[joint lock]] or a [[Chokehold|choke]]. [[Strike (attack)|Strikes]] and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms ([[kata]], \u5f62) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ([[randori]], \u4e71\u53d6\u308a). Also refereed to as Kan\u014d Jiu-Jitsu until the introduction to the [[Olympic Games]], A judo practitioner is called a '''judoka'''.\n\nThe philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from {{nihongo3|''[[kory\u016b]]''|\u53e4\u6d41||traditional schools}}. Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world, such as [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[Krav Maga]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] and [[ARB (martial art)|ARB]].\n\n== History and philosophy ==\n\n=== Early life of the founder ===\n[[File:Kano Jigoro.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jigoro Kano]]]]\n\nThe early history of judo is inseparable from its founder, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[polymath]] and educator {{nihongo3|Jigoro Kano|\u5609\u7d0d \u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce|[[Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d]]|1860\u20131938}}, born {{nihongo3|Jigor\u014d Shinnosuke|\u65b0\u4e4b\u52a9 \u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce|Shinnosuke Jigor\u014d}}. Kano was born into a relatively affluent family. His father, Jirosaku, was the second son of the head priest of the [[Shinto]] [[Hiyoshi Shrine|Hiyoshi shrine]] in [[Shiga Prefecture]]. He married Sadako Kano, daughter of the owner of Kiku-Masamune sake brewing company and was adopted by the family, changing his name to Kano. He ultimately became an official in the [[Bakufu#Shogunate|Shogunal]] government.<ref>Kano (2008) pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nJigoro Kano had an academic upbringing and, from the age of seven, he studied English, {{nihongo3|[[Japanese calligraphy]]|\u66f8\u9053|shod\u014d}} and the {{nihongo|[[Four Books#Four Books|Four Confucian Texts]]|\u56db\u66f8|Shisho}} under a number of tutors.<ref name=\"Kano 2008, p. 1; Hoare 2009, p. 43\">Kano (2008) p. 1; Hoare (2009) p. 43</ref> When he was fourteen, Kano began boarding at an English-medium school, Ikuei-Gijuku in [[Shiba, Tokyo]]. The culture of [[bullying]] endemic at this school was the catalyst that caused Kano to seek out a {{nihongo3|[[Jujutsu]]|\u67d4\u8853|J\u016bjutsu}} {{nihongo3|[[dojo]]|\u9053\u5834|d\u014dj\u014d|training place}} at which to train.<ref name=\"Kano 2008, p. 1; Hoare 2009, p. 43\"/>\n\nEarly attempts to find a jujutsu teacher who was willing to take him on met with little success. With the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, jujutsu had become unfashionable in an increasingly [[Westernization|westernized]] Japan. Many of those who had once taught the art had been forced out of teaching or become so disillusioned with it that they had simply given up. Nakai Umenari, an acquaintance of Kan\u014d's father and a former soldier, agreed to show him ''kata'', but not to teach him. The caretaker of Jirosaku's second house, Katagiri Ryuji, also knew jujutsu, but would not teach it as he believed it was no longer of practical use.

It was a relatively small affair, consisting of a 12 [[Tatami|jo]]<ref>Jo is the Japanese unit of area.</ref> (214 sq ft) training area. Kano took in resident and non-resident students, the first two being [[Tomita Tsunejir\u014d]] and [[Shiro Saigo]].<ref>Kano (2008) p. 20</ref> In August, the following year, the pair were granted {{nihongo3|[[shodan (rank)|shodan]]|\u521d\u6bb5||first rank}} grades, the first that had been awarded in any martial art.<ref>Lowry (2006) p. 49</ref>\n\n=== Judo versus jujutsu ===\n{{main|Kodokan-Totsuka rivalry}}\nCentral to Kano's vision for judo were the principles of {{nihongo3|''seiryoku zen'y\u014d''|\u7cbe\u529b\u5584\u7528||Maximum efficiency, minimum effort}} and {{nihongo3|''jita ky\u014dei''|\u81ea\u4ed6\u5171\u6804||mutual welfare and benefit}}.

This is the theory of ''ju yoku go o seisu''.<ref>Kano (2005) pp. 39\u201340</ref>}}\n\nKano realised that ''seiryoku zen'y\u014d'', initially conceived as a jujutsu concept, had a wider philosophical application. Coupled with the [[Confucianism|Confucianist]]-influenced ''jita ky\u014dei'', the wider application shaped the development of judo from a {{nihongo3|martial art|\u6b66\u8853|bujutsu}} to a {{nihongo3|martial way|\u6b66\u9053|bud\u014d}}. Kano rejected techniques that did not conform to these principles and emphasised the importance of efficiency in the execution of techniques. He was convinced that practice of jujutsu while conforming to these ideals was a route to self-improvement and the betterment of society in general.<ref>For Kano's opinions on the wider applicability of ''jita ky\u014dei'' to life see for example, Kano (2008) p. 107</ref> He was, however, acutely conscious of the Japanese public's negative perception of jujutsu:\n\n{{quotation|At the time a few bujitsu (martial arts) experts still existed but bujitsu was almost abandoned by the nation at large. Even if I wanted to teach jujitsu most people had now stopped thinking about it. So I thought it better to teach under a different name principally because my objectives were much wider than jujitsu.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 56</ref>}}\n\nKano believed that \"''j\u016bjutsu''\" was insufficient to describe his art: although {{nihongo3|''jutsu''|\u8853}} means \"art\" or \"means\", it implies a method consisting of a collection of physical techniques. Accordingly, he changed the second character to {{nihongo3|''d\u014d''|\u9053}}, meaning way, road or path, which implies a more philosophical context than ''jutsu'' and has a common origin with the Chinese concept of ''[[tao]]''. Thus Kano renamed it {{nihongo3|judo|\u67d4\u9053|J\u016bd\u014d}}.<ref>Judo had been used before then, as in the case of a jujutsu school that called itself {{nihongo3|''Chokushin-ry\u016b J\u016bd\u014d''|\u76f4\u4fe1\u6d41\u67d4\u9053||Sometimes rendered as Jikishin-ry\u016b J\u016bd\u014d}}, but its use was rare.</ref>\n\n== Judo ''waza'' (techniques) ==\n{{See also|List of judo techniques|List of Kodokan judo techniques}}\nThere are three basic categories of {{nihongo3|''waza''|\u6280||techniques}} in judo: {{nihongo3|''nage-waza''|\u6295\u3052\u6280||throwing techniques}}, {{nihongo3|''katame-waza''|\u56fa\u6280||grappling techniques}} and {{nihongo3|''atemi-waza''|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab\u6280||striking techniques}}.<ref>Daigo (2005) p. 8</ref> Judo is mostly known for ''nage-waza'' and ''katame-waza''.<ref>Numerous texts exist that describe the ''waza'' of judo in detail.

In 1899, Kano was asked to chair a committee of the [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]] to draw up the first formal set of contest rules for jujutsu. These rules were intended to cover contests between different various traditional schools of jujutsu as well as practitioners of Kodokan judo. Contests were 15 minutes long and were judged on the basis of nage waza and katame waza, excluding atemi waza. Wins were by two ippons, awarded in every four-main different path of winning alternatives, by \"Throwing\", where the opponent's back strikes flat onto the mat with sufficient force, by \"Pinning\" them on their back for a \"sufficient\" amount of time, or by Submission, which could be achieved via \"Shime-waza\" or \"Kansetsu-waza\", in which the opponent was forced to give himself or herself up or summon a referee's or corner-judge's stoppage. Finger, toe and ankle locks were prohibited.<ref name=\"judoruleshistory\">Hoare (2005) pp. 4\u20137</ref> In 1900, these rules were adopted by the Kodokan with amendments made to prohibit all joint locks for kyu grades and added wrist locks to the prohibited kansetsu-waza for ''[[dan (rank)|dan]]'' grades. It was also stated that the ratio of tachi-waza to ne-waza should be between 70% to 80% for kyu grades and 60% to 70% for dan grades.<ref name=\"judoruleshistory\"/>\n\nIn 1916, additional rulings were brought in to further limit ''kansetsu waza'' with the prohibition of ''[[ashi garami]]'' and neck locks, as well as ''do jime''.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 109</ref> These were further added to in 1925.\n\nThe first time judo was seen in the [[Olympic Games]] was in an informal demonstration hosted by Kano at the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judoinfo.com/kano.htm |title=The Contribution of Judo to Education by Jigoro Kano |website=Judoinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref> However, Kano was ambivalent about judo's potential inclusion as an Olympic sport:\n{{quotation|I have been asked by people of various sections as to the wisdom and possibility of judo being introduced with other games and sports at the Olympic Games. My view on the matter, at present, is rather passive. If it be the desire of other member countries, I have no objection. But I do not feel inclined to take any initiative. For one thing, judo in reality is not a mere sport or game. I regard it as a principle of life, art and science. In fact, it is a means for personal cultural attainment. Only one of the forms of judo training, so-called randori or free practice can be classed as a form of sport. Certainly, to some extent, the same may be said of boxing and fencing, but today they are practiced and conducted as sports. Then the Olympic Games are so strongly flavored with nationalism that it is possible to be influenced by it and to develop \"Contest Judo\", a retrograde form as ju-jitsu was before the Kodokan was founded. Judo should be free as art and science from any external influences, political, national, racial, and financial or any other organized interest. And all things connected with it should be directed to its ultimate object, the \"Benefit of Humanity\". Human sacrifice is a matter of ancient history.<ref>Koizumi (1947)</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, [[Judo at the 1964 Summer Olympics|judo became an Olympic sport]] for men in the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Games]] in [[Tokyo]].

A shido (\u6307\u5c0e - literally \"guidance\") is awarded for minor rule infringements. A shido can also be awarded for a prolonged period of non-aggression. Recent rule changes allow for the first shidos to result in only warnings. If there is a tie, then and only then, will the number of shidos (if less than three) be used to determine the winner. After three shidos are given, the victory is given to the opponent, constituting an indirect hansoku-make (\u53cd\u5247\u8ca0\u3051 - literally \"foul-play defeat\"), but does not result in expulsion from the tournament. Note: Prior to 2017, the 4th shido was hansoku-make.

The terms judo and jujutsu were quite interchangeable in the early years, so some of these forms of judo are still known as jujutsu or jiu-jitsu either for that reason, or simply to differentiate them from mainstream judo. From Kano's original style of judo, several related forms have evolved\u2014some now widely considered to be distinct arts:\n\n* {{nihongo3|[[Kosen judo]]|\u9ad8\u5c08\u67d4\u9053}}: Sometimes erroneously described as a separate style of Judo, Kosen judo is a competition rules set of Kodokan judo that was popularized in the early 20th century for use in Japanese Special High Schools Championships held at Kyoto Imperial University.<ref>Kashiwazaki (1997) pp. 14\u201315</ref> The word \"Kosen\" is an acronym of {{nihongo3|Koto Senmon Gakko|\u9ad8\u7b49\u5c02\u9580\u5b66\u6821||literally \"Higher Professional School\"}}. Kosen judo's focus on newaza has drawn comparisons with [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]].\n* Russian judo: This distinctive style of judo was influenced by the Russian martial art called [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]]. It is represented by well-known coaches such as [[Alexander Retuinskih]] and [[Igor Yakimov]], and [[mixed martial arts]] fighters such as [[Fedor Emelianenko]] and [[Karo Parisyan]]. In turn, Russian judo has influenced mainstream judo, with techniques such as the [[flying armbar]] being accepted into Kodokan judo.\n* [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] (especially Sport Sambo): a derivative of Judo combined with  [[wrestling]] techniques, and striking in case of [[Combat Sambo]]. [[Vasili Oshchepkov]] was the first European judo black belt under Kano. Oshchepkov went on to contribute his knowledge of judo as one of the three founders of Sambo, which also integrated various international and [[Soviet bloc]] wrestling styles and other combative techniques. Oshchepkov died during the political [[Great Purge|purges]] of 1937. In their ''History of Sambo'', Brett Jacques and Scott Anderson wrote that in Russia \"judo and SOMBO were considered to be the same thing\"\u2014albeit with a different uniform and some differences in the rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/stratfordsombo/articles/history-2.html |title=The History of Sombo |website=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>\n* [[Brazilian jiu jitsu]]\n* Freestyle Judo is a form of competitive judo practiced primarily in the US, that retains techniques that have been removed from mainstream IJF rules.<ref>[http://image.aausports.org/dnn/judo/2016/2016JudoHandbook.pdf Judo handbook (PDF)]</ref> Freestyle Judo is currently backed by the International Freestyle Judo Alliance (IFJA).

American Pangamot instructors include former Army Ranger, Christopher J. Petrilli, mixed martial arts coach Thomas Weissmuller, and UFC Coach, Ray Yee.\n\n== Safety ==\nKano's vision for judo was one of a martial way that could be practiced realistically. [[Randori]] (free practice) was a central part of judo pedagogy and shiai (competition) a crucial test of a judoka's understanding of judo.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kano|first=Jigoro|title=The Contribution of Judo to Education|url=http://judoinfo.com/kano1.htm|website=Judoinfo.com|accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref> Safety necessitated some basic innovations that shaped judo's development. Atemi waza (striking techniques) were entirely limited to kata (prearranged forms) early in judo's history. Kansetsu waza (joint manipulation techniques) were limited to techniques that focused on the elbow joint. Various throwing techniques that were judged to be too dangerous to practice safely at full force, such as all joint-locking throws from [[Jujutsu]], were also prohibited in shiai. To maximise safety in nage waza (throwing techniques), judoka trained in [[ukemi]] (break falls) and practiced on [[tatami]] (rice straw mats).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== ''Kansetsu'' and ''shime waza'' ===\nThe application of joint manipulation and strangulation/choking techniques is generally safe under controlled conditions typical of judo dojo and in competition. It is usual for there to be age restrictions on the practice and application of these types of techniques, but the exact nature of these restrictions will vary from country to country and from organization to organization.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== ''Nage waza'' ===\nSafety in the practice of throwing techniques depends on the skill level of both tori and uke. Inexpertly applied throws have the potential to injure both tori and uke, for instance when tori compensates for poor technique by powering through the throw. Similarly, poor ukemi can result in injury, particularly from more powerful throws that uke lacks the skill to breakfall from. For these reasons, throws are normally taught in order of difficulty for both tori and uke. This is exemplified in the [[List of Kodokan judo techniques|''Gokyo'']] {{nihongo3||\u4e94\u6559||literally \"five teachings\"}}, a traditional grouping of throws arranged in order of difficulty of ukemi. Those grouped in {{nihongo3|''Dai ikkyo''|\u7b2c\u4e00\u6559||literally \"first teaching\"}} are relatively simple to breakfall from whereas those grouped in {{nihongo3|''dai gokyo'' |\u7b2c\u4e94\u6559||literally \"fifth teaching\"}} are difficult to breakfall from.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Judoka (practitioner) ==\nA practitioner of judo is known as a {{nihongo3|judoka|\u67d4\u9053\u5bb6}}.

Beginning students typically wear a white belt, progressing through descending kyu ranks until they are deemed to have achieved a level of competence sufficient to be a dan grade, at which point they wear the {{nihongo3|[[Black belt (martial arts)|kuro obi]]|\u9ed2\u5e2f||black belt}}. The kyu-dan ranking system has since been widely adopted by modern martial arts.<ref name=judorank>{{cite web\n| last =Ohlenkamp\n| first =Neil\n| title =The Judo Rank System\n| publisher =JudoInfo.com\n| date = March 25, 2007\n| url = http://www.judoinfo.com/obi.htm\n| accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}\n</ref>\n\nThe ninth degree black belt ''kudan'', and higher ranks, have no formal requirements and are decided by the president of the Kodokan, currently Kano Jigoro's grandson Yukimitsu Kano. As of 2011, [[List of judoka#Highest grades|fifteen Japanese men]] have been promoted to the tenth degree black belt ''judan'' by the Kodokan, three of whom are still alive;<ref name=judorank/> the IJF and Western and Asian national federations have promoted another eleven who are not recognized (at that level of rank) by the Kodokan. On July 28, 2011, the promotion board of USA Judo awarded [[Keiko Fukuda]] the rank of 10th ''dan'', who was the first woman to be promoted to judo's highest level, albeit not a Kodokan-recognized rank.\n\nAlthough ''dan'' ranks tend to be consistent between national organizations there is more variation in the ''ky\u016b'' grades, with some countries having more ''ky\u016b'' grades. Although initially ''ky\u016b'' grade belt colours were uniformly white, today a variety of colours are used. The first black belts to denote a [[dan rank]] in the 1880s, initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in [[kimono]], only [[white belt|white]] and black obi were used. It was not until the early 1900s, after the introduction of the [[judogi]], that an expanded colored belt system of awarding rank was created.<ref name=judorank/> Written accounts from the archives of London's Budokwai judo club, founded in 1918, record the use of colored judo belts at the 1926 9th annual Budokwai Display, and a list of ranked colored judokas appears in the Budokwai Committee Minutes of June 1927. Kawaishi visited London and the Budokwai in 1928, and was probably inspired to bring the colored belt system to France.<ref name=coloredbelts>{{cite web\n| last =Callan\n| first =Mike\n| title =History of the Grading System\n| publisher =ResearchGate.com\n| date = May 2015\n| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299604160_History_of_the_Grading_System\n| accessdate = 2020-03-06 }}\n</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n* Akira Kurosawa, {{nihongo|''[[Sanshiro Sugata]]''|\u59ff\u4e09\u56db\u90ce|Sugata Sanshir\u014d|aka ''Judo Saga''}}, 1943.\n* Akira Kurosawa, {{nihongo|''[[Sanshiro Sugata Part II]]''|\u7e8c\u59ff\u4e09\u56db\u90ce|Zoku Sugata Sanshir\u014d|aka ''Judo Saga II''}}, 1945.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Japan|Society|Martial arts}}\n* [[Judo by country]]\n* [[List of celebrity judoka]]\n* [[List of judo techniques]], partial list of judo techniques\n* [[List of judoka]]\n* [[List of World Champions in Judo]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation\n  | last = Adams\n  | first = Neil\n  | title = Armlocks\n  | series = Judo Masterclass Techniques\n  | publisher = Ippon Books\n  | location = London\n  | year = 1991}}\n* {{citation\n  | last = Cachia\n  | first = Jeffrey\n  | title = Effective Judo\n  | series = \n  | publisher = Elite Publishing\n  | location = Sarasota, FL\n  | year = 2009}}\n* {{citation\n  | last = Daigo\n  | first = Toshiro\n  | year = 2005\n  | title = Kodokan Judo Throwing Techniques\n  | publisher = Kodansha International\n  | location = Tokyo, Japan}}\n* {{citation\n  | last1 = De Cr\u00e9e\n  | first1 = Carl\n  | last2 =\n  | first2 =\n  | title = K\u014dd\u014dkan j\u016bd\u014d\u2019s three orphaned forms of counter techniques \u2013 Part 3: The Katame-waza ura-no-kata \u2015\"Forms of reversing controlling techniques\"\n  | journal = Archives of Budo\n  | year = 2015\n  | volume = 11\n  | pages = 155\u2013174}}\n* {{citation\n  | last1 = De Cr\u00e9e\n  | first1 = Carl\n  | year = 2012\n  | title = The origin, inner essence, biomechanical fundamentals, and current teaching and performance anomalies of K\u014dd\u014dkan j\u016bd\u014d\u2019s esoteric sixth kata: The Itsutsu-no-kata \u2015\"Forms of five\"\n  | publisher = University of Rome\n  | location = Rome, Italy}}\n* {{citation\n  | last1 = De Cr\u00e9e\n  | first1 = Carl\n  | last2 = Jones\n  | first2 = Llyr C.\n  | title = ''K\u014dd\u014dkan J\u016bd\u014d's'' Elusive Tenth ''Kata'': The ''G\u014d-no-kata'' -
