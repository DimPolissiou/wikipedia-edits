Following the [[Cuban Revolution of 1933]], led by [[Fulgencio Batista]], which overthrew President [[Gerardo Machado]], Alberto Arnaz was jailed and all of his property was confiscated.

In 1939, he starred on Broadway in the musical ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]''. He went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] the next year to appear in the show's movie version at [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], which starred [[Lucille Ball]]. Arnaz and Ball eloped on November 30, 1940. Arnaz also played guitar for [[Xavier Cugat]].<ref name=\"Arnaz\"/>\n\nArnaz appeared in several movies in the 1940s such as ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'',  starring Robert Taylor (1943). Many consider his portrayal of the jive-loving California National Guardsman Felix Ramirez to be his best early role. He received his [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] notice, but before reporting, he injured his knee. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. He was assigned to direct [[United Service Organization]] (USO) programs at the [[Birmingham General Army Hospital]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Discovering the first thing the wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and pour the milk for them. Following his discharge from the Army on November 16, 1945, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings.<ref>Who's Who In Hollywood! By Terry Rowan, Desi Arnaz, page 15</ref> He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend [[Marco Rizo]] to play piano and arrange for the orchestra. When he became successful in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll, and Rizo arranged and orchestrated the music for ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Queens of Comedy: Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Joan Rivers, and the New Generation of Funny Women|last=Horowitz|first=Susan|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1997|isbn=9782884492447|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>[[File:Lucy desi 1957.JPG|thumb|upright|Lucille Ball and Arnaz, 1957]]\nOn October 15, 1951, Arnaz co-starred in the premiere of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', in which he played a fictionalized version of himself, Cuban orchestra leader Enrique \"Ricky\" Ricardo. His co-star was his real-life wife, Lucille Ball, who played Ricky's wife, Lucy. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'' for television. Ball insisted on Arnaz playing her on-air spouse so the two would be able to spend more time together. [[CBS]] wanted Ball's ''Husband'' co-star [[Richard Denning]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Richard Denning |url=https://variety.com/1998/scene/people-news/richard-denning-1117882474/ |website=Variety |accessdate=2 March 2019 |language=en |date=21 October 1998}}</ref>\n\nThe original premise was for the couple to portray Lucy and Larry Lopez, a successful show business couple whose glamorous careers interfered with their efforts to maintain a normal marriage. Market research indicated, however, that this scenario would not be popular, so [[Jess Oppenheimer]] changed it to make Ricky Ricardo a struggling young orchestra leader and Lucy an ordinary housewife who had show business fantasies but no talent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The character name \"Larry Lopez\" was dropped because of a real-life bandleader named Vincent Lopez, and was replaced with \"Ricky Ricardo\". Ricky often appeared at, and later owned, the Tropicana Club, which under his ownership he renamed Club Babalu.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nInitially, the idea of having Ball and the distinctly Latin American Arnaz portray a married couple encountered resistance as they were told that Desi's Cuban accent and Latin style would not be agreeable to American viewers.<ref name=\"title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do\">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allison-silver/sotomayer-more-splainin-t_b_236347.html|title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do|accessdate=June 18, 2010|work=The Huffington Post|quote=CBS executives originally did not want Ball, a sassy redhead, married to a Latino on the program|first=Allison|last=Silver|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> The couple overcame these objections, however, by touring together, during the summer of 1950, in a live [[vaudeville]] act they developed with the help of Spanish clown Pepito P\u00e9rez, together with Ball's radio show writers. Much of the material from their vaudeville act, including Lucy's memorable seal routine, was used in the pilot episode of ''I Love Lucy''. Segments of the pilot were recreated in the sixth episode of the show's first season.  During his time on the show, Arnaz and Ball became TV's most successful entrepreneurs.\n\n=== Desilu Productions ===\n{{Main|Desilu Productions}}\n[[File:Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.jpg|thumb|left|Lucille Ball and Arnaz in Los Angeles, 1953]]\nWith Ball, Arnaz founded [[Desilu Productions]]. At that time, most television programs were broadcast live, and as the largest markets were in New York, the rest of the country received only [[kinescope]] images. [[Karl Freund]], Arnaz's cameraman, and even Arnaz himself have been credited with the development of the [[multiple-camera setup]] production style using adjacent sets in front of a live audience that became the standard for subsequent [[situation comedy|situation comedies]]. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was told that it would be impossible to allow an audience onto a [[sound stage]], but he worked with Freund to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and adhere to fire and safety codes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  Due to the expense of 35mm film, Arnaz and Ball agreed to salary cuts.  In return they retained the rights to the films.  This was the basis for their invention of re-runs and syndicating TV shows (a huge source of new revenue). <ref>{{Cite web|date = 26 September 2016|first = Jeff |last = Saporito |url= http://screenprism.com/insights/article/how-did-i-love-lucy-invent-the-rerun|title=How did I Love Lucy invent the rerun and syndication? |website= ScreenPrism}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to ''I Love Lucy'', he executive produced ''[[The Ann Sothern Show]]'' and ''[[Those Whiting Girls]]'' (starring [[Margaret Whiting]] and [[Barbara Whiting Smith]]), and was involved in several other series such as ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', and ''Sheriff of Cochise'' / ''United States Marshal''. He also produced the feature film ''[[Forever, Darling]]'' (1956), in which he and Ball starred. In the late 1950s, Arnaz proposed a [[Western (genre)|Western]] television series to his then neighbor, [[Victor Orsatti]], who formed a production company, Ror-Vic, in partnership with actor [[Rory Calhoun]]. Ror-Vic produced ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'', which aired on Monday evenings on CBS from 1958 to 1960. Episodes were budgeted at $40,000 each, with two [[black-and-white]] segments filmed weekly through [[Desilu Studios]]. Despite the name, the series was filmed mostly in Pearl Flats in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[Southern California]]. The program could have been renewed for a third season had Calhoun not desired to return to films.<ref>Billy Hathorn, \"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 110\u201312</ref>\n\nThe original Desilu company continued long after Arnaz's divorce from Ball and her subsequent marriage to [[Gary Morton]]. Desilu produced its own programs and provided facilities to other producers. Desilu produced ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. When Ball sold her share of Desilu to what became [[Paramount Television]], Arnaz went on to form his own production company from his share of Desilu. With the newly formed Desi Arnaz Productions, he made ''[[The Mothers-In-Law]]'' (at Desilu) for [[United Artists Television]] and [[NBC]]. This sitcom ran for two seasons from 1967 to 1969. Arnaz's company was succeeded-in-interest by the company now known as Desilu, Too. [[Desilu, Too]] and Lucille Ball Productions work hand-in-hand with [[MPI Home Video]] in the home video reissues of the Ball/Arnaz material not currently owned by CBS (successor-in-interest to Paramount Television, which in turn succeeded the original Desilu company). This material includes ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' and ''The Mothers-In-Law'', as well as many programs and specials Ball and Arnaz made independently of each other.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&pg=PA60&dq=%22she+set+up+lucille+ball+productions%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi90uOE1InRAhWGRCYKHSPjBrYQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22she%20set%20up%20lucille%20ball%20productions%22&f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=60|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n=== Beliefs ===\nArnaz and Ball decided that the show would maintain what Arnaz termed \"basic good taste\" and were therefore determined to avoid [[ethnic joke]]s, as well as humor based on physical handicaps or mental disabilities. Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo's accent; even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking.<ref name=\"Arnaz\" />\n\nArnaz was deeply patriotic about the United States. In his memoirs, he wrote that he knew of no other country in the world where \"a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language\" could achieve the successes that he had.<ref name=\"Arnaz\" />\n\n=== Marriages ===\n[[File:Lucille_Ball_and_Desi_Arnaz_1955.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ball and Arnaz in 1955]]\nArnaz and Lucille Ball were married on November 30, 1940. Their marriage was turbulent. Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her and also because he came home drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944, but returned to him before the [[interlocutory]] decree became final.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz and Ball subsequently had two children, actors [[Lucie Arnaz]] (born 1951) and [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] (born 1953).\n\nArnaz's marriage with Ball began to collapse under the strain of his growing problems with alcohol and also because of [[womanizing]]. According to his memoir, the combined pressures of managing the production company, as well as supervising its day-to-day operations, had greatly worsened as it grew much larger, and he felt compelled to seek outlets to alleviate the stress.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz was also suffering from [[diverticulitis]]. Ball divorced him in 1960. When Ball returned to weekly television, she and Arnaz worked out an agreement regarding Desilu, wherein she bought him out.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&pg=PA16&dq=%22he+sold+his+share+of+desilu%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwix-pPG1YnRAhVGeSYKHZ1UAjgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22he%20sold%20his%20share%20of%20desilu%22&f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=16|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nArnaz married his second wife, Edith Eyre Hirsch (n\u00e9e McSkimming), on March 2, 1963, and greatly reduced his show business activities. He served as executive producer of ''The Mothers-in-Law'', and during its two-year run, made four guest appearances as a Spanish [[Torero (bullfighter)|matador]], Se\u00f1or Delgado. Edith died in 1985, aged 67, from cancer.\n\nAlthough Arnaz and Ball both married other spouses after their divorce in 1960, they remained friends and grew closer in his final decade. \"''I Love Lucy'' was never just a title\", wrote Arnaz in the last years of his life.<ref>Desilu: The Story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz {{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}</ref> Family home video later aired on television showed Ball and Arnaz playing together with their grandson Simon shortly before Arnaz's death.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Desi arnaz sr and jr 1974.JPG|thumb|left|Arnaz appeared with his son in the 1974 television special, ''California, My Way''.]]\nIn the 1970s, Arnaz co-hosted a week of shows with daytime host and producer [[Mike Douglas]].

His father was Santiago's youngest mayor and also served in the Cuban House of Representatives.

Following the [[Cuban Revolution of 1933]], led by [[Fulgencio Batista]], which overthrew President [[Gerardo Machado]], Alberto Arnaz was jailed and all of his property was confiscated. He was released after six months when his brother-in-law Alberto de Acha intervened on his behalf.<ref name=\"Gjelten, Tom 2008, p. 122\"/> The family then fled to [[Miami]], where Desi attended [[St. Patrick Catholic School (Miami Beach, Florida)|St. Patrick Catholic High School]].

In 1939, he starred on Broadway in the musical ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]''. He went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] the next year to appear in the show's movie version at [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], which starred [[Lucille Ball]]. Arnaz and Ball eloped on November 30, 1940. Arnaz also played guitar for [[Xavier Cugat]].<ref name=\"Arnaz\"/>\n\nArnaz appeared in several movies in the 1940s such as ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'',  starring Robert Taylor (1943). Many consider his portrayal of the jive-loving California National Guardsman Felix Ramirez to be his best early role. He received his [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] notice, but before reporting, he injured his knee. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. He was assigned to direct [[United Service Organization]] (USO) programs at the [[Birmingham General Army Hospital]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Discovering the first thing the wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and pour the milk for them. Following his discharge from the Army on November 16, 1945, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings.<ref>Who's Who In Hollywood! By Terry Rowan, Desi Arnaz, page 15</ref> He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend [[Marco Rizo]] to play piano and arrange for the orchestra. When he became successful in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll, and Rizo arranged and orchestrated the music for ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Queens of Comedy: Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Joan Rivers, and the New Generation of Funny Women|last=Horowitz|first=Susan|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1997|isbn=9782884492447|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>[[File:Lucy desi 1957.JPG|thumb|upright|Lucille Ball and Arnaz, 1957]]\nOn October 15, 1951, Arnaz co-starred in the premiere of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', in which he played a fictionalized version of himself, Cuban orchestra leader Enrique \"Ricky\" Ricardo. His co-star was his real-life wife, Lucille Ball, who played Ricky's wife, Lucy. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'' for television. Ball insisted on Arnaz playing her on-air spouse so the two would be able to spend more time together. [[CBS]] wanted Ball's ''Husband'' co-star [[Richard Denning]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Richard Denning |url=https://variety.com/1998/scene/people-news/richard-denning-1117882474/ |website=Variety |accessdate=2 March 2019 |language=en |date=21 October 1998}}</ref>\n\nThe original premise was for the couple to portray Lucy and Larry Lopez, a successful show business couple whose glamorous careers interfered with their efforts to maintain a normal marriage. Market research indicated, however, that this scenario would not be popular, so [[Jess Oppenheimer]] changed it to make Ricky Ricardo a struggling young orchestra leader and Lucy an ordinary housewife who had show business fantasies but no talent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The character name \"Larry Lopez\" was dropped because of a real-life bandleader named Vincent Lopez, and was replaced with \"Ricky Ricardo\". Ricky often appeared at, and later owned, the Tropicana Club, which under his ownership he renamed Club Babalu.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nInitially, the idea of having Ball and the distinctly Latin American Arnaz portray a married couple encountered resistance as they were told that Desi's Cuban accent and Latin style would not be agreeable to American viewers.<ref name=\"title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do\">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allison-silver/sotomayer-more-splainin-t_b_236347.html|title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do|accessdate=June 18, 2010|work=The Huffington Post|quote=CBS executives originally did not want Ball, a sassy redhead, married to a Latino on the program|first=Allison|last=Silver|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> The couple overcame these objections, however, by touring together, during the summer of 1950, in a live [[vaudeville]] act they developed with the help of Spanish clown Pepito P\u00e9rez, together with Ball's radio show writers. Much of the material from their vaudeville act, including Lucy's memorable seal routine, was used in the pilot episode of ''I Love Lucy''. Segments of the pilot were recreated in the sixth episode of the show's first season.  During his time on the show, Arnaz and Ball became TV's most successful entrepreneurs.\n\n=== Desilu Productions ===\n{{Main|Desilu Productions}}\n[[File:Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.jpg|thumb|left|Lucille Ball and Arnaz in Los Angeles, 1953]]\nWith Ball, Arnaz founded [[Desilu Productions]]. At that time, most television programs were broadcast live, and as the largest markets were in New York, the rest of the country received only [[kinescope]] images. [[Karl Freund]], Arnaz's cameraman, and even Arnaz himself have been credited with the development of the [[multiple-camera setup]] production style using adjacent sets in front of a live audience that became the standard for subsequent [[situation comedy|situation comedies]]. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was told that it would be impossible to allow an audience onto a [[sound stage]], but he worked with Freund to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and adhere to fire and safety codes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  Due to the expense of 35mm film, Arnaz and Ball agreed to salary cuts.  In return they retained the rights to the films.  This was the basis for their invention of re-runs and syndicating TV shows (a huge source of new revenue). <ref>{{Cite web|date = 26 September 2016|first = Jeff |last = Saporito |url= http://screenprism.com/insights/article/how-did-i-love-lucy-invent-the-rerun|title=How did I Love Lucy invent the rerun and syndication? |website= ScreenPrism}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to ''I Love Lucy'', he executive produced ''[[The Ann Sothern Show]]'' and ''[[Those Whiting Girls]]'' (starring [[Margaret Whiting]] and [[Barbara Whiting Smith]]), and was involved in several other series such as ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', and ''Sheriff of Cochise'' / ''United States Marshal''. He also produced the feature film ''[[Forever, Darling]]'' (1956), in which he and Ball starred. In the late 1950s, Arnaz proposed a [[Western (genre)|Western]] television series to his then neighbor, [[Victor Orsatti]], who formed a production company, Ror-Vic, in partnership with actor [[Rory Calhoun]]. Ror-Vic produced ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'', which aired on Monday evenings on CBS from 1958 to 1960. Episodes were budgeted at $40,000 each, with two [[black-and-white]] segments filmed weekly through [[Desilu Studios]]. Despite the name, the series was filmed mostly in Pearl Flats in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[Southern California]]. The program could have been renewed for a third season had Calhoun not desired to return to films.<ref>Billy Hathorn, \"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 110\u201312</ref>\n\nThe original Desilu company continued long after Arnaz's divorce from Ball and her subsequent marriage to [[Gary Morton]]. Desilu produced its own programs and provided facilities to other producers. Desilu produced ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. When Ball sold her share of Desilu to what became [[Paramount Television]], Arnaz went on to form his own production company from his share of Desilu. With the newly formed Desi Arnaz Productions, he made ''[[The Mothers-In-Law]]'' (at Desilu) for [[United Artists Television]] and [[NBC]]. This sitcom ran for two seasons from 1967 to 1969. Arnaz's company was succeeded-in-interest by the company now known as Desilu, Too. [[Desilu, Too]] and Lucille Ball Productions work hand-in-hand with [[MPI Home Video]] in the home video reissues of the Ball/Arnaz material not currently owned by CBS (successor-in-interest to Paramount Television, which in turn succeeded the original Desilu company). This material includes ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' and ''The Mothers-In-Law'', as well as many programs and specials Ball and Arnaz made independently of each other.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&pg=PA60&dq=%22she+set+up+lucille+ball+productions%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi90uOE1InRAhWGRCYKHSPjBrYQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22she%20set%20up%20lucille%20ball%20productions%22&f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=60|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n=== Beliefs ===\nArnaz and Ball decided that the show would maintain what Arnaz termed \"basic good taste\" and were therefore determined to avoid [[ethnic joke]]s, as well as humor based on physical handicaps or mental disabilities. Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo's accent; even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking.<ref name=\"Arnaz\" />\n\nArnaz was deeply patriotic about the United States. In his memoirs, he wrote that he knew of no other country in the world where \"a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language\" could achieve the successes that he had.<ref name=\"Arnaz\" />\n\n=== Marriages ===\n[[File:Lucille_Ball_and_Desi_Arnaz_1955.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ball and Arnaz in 1955]]\nArnaz and Lucille Ball were married on November 30, 1940. Their marriage was turbulent. Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her and also because he came home drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944, but returned to him before the [[interlocutory]] decree became final.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz and Ball subsequently had two children, actors [[Lucie Arnaz]] (born 1951) and [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] (born 1953).\n\nArnaz's marriage with Ball began to collapse under the strain of his growing problems with alcohol and also because of [[womanizing]]. According to his memoir, the combined pressures of managing the production company, as well as supervising its day-to-day operations, had greatly worsened as it grew much larger, and he felt compelled to seek outlets to alleviate the stress.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz was also suffering from [[diverticulitis]]. Ball divorced him in 1960. When Ball returned to weekly television, she and Arnaz worked out an agreement regarding Desilu, wherein she bought him out.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&pg=PA16&dq=%22he+sold+his+share+of+desilu%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwix-pPG1YnRAhVGeSYKHZ1UAjgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22he%20sold%20his%20share%20of%20desilu%22&f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=16|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nArnaz married his second wife, Edith Eyre Hirsch (n\u00e9e McSkimming), on March 2, 1963, and greatly reduced his show business activities.

The episodes \"Movin' On Up\" and \"Chasing Bobby\" show Hank escaping from his troubled home life by working on his lawn and truck when times are tough.<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=king-of-the-hill&episode=s04e16|title=King of the Hill s04e16 Episode Script |website= Springfield!

Springfield!|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref> Hank resembles\u2014in both voice and appearance\u2014the [[Mr. Anderson (Beavis and Butt-head)|Tom Anderson]] character from ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', a character also voiced by Judge. Hank is usually a well-meaning father, but is often confused and anxious towards modern trends and the antics of his friends and family members. He suffers from a narrow [[urethra]], which made Bobby's conception difficult. Hank is uncomfortable with public displays of intimacy with his wife and son. He has a very difficult time saying \"I love you\" to any member of his family, as he thinks it is unmanly. Hank's trademark exclamation when surprised or angered or in times of discomfort (sounding like \"Bwaaa!\") and his phrase \"I tell you what\" (\"what\" in his dialect being pronounced {{IPA-all|\u028d\u028ct|}}) are [[running gag]]s on the series. Hank is a byproduct of a bygone era - always faithful, friendly, firm, reasonable, well-read and hard-working. Much of the series revolves around Hank's desire to do the right thing compared to much of the rest of the people around him who would rather cheat, lie or exploit. Hank is a proud Texan, having grown up there. He was, however, born in a ladies room at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], and spent the first three days of his life in [[New York City]]. \n* '''[[Peggy Hill|Margaret J. \"Peggy\" Platter Hill]]''' (voiced by [[Kathy Najimy]]) \u2013 Hank's wife, Peggy (''n\u00e9e'' Platter), was born in [[Montana]] and raised on her family's cattle ranch. Her strained relationship with her mother is a source of drama for her. Peggy is a substitute teacher in Arlen, Texas, specializing in teaching [[Spanish language|Spanish]] despite having a terrible grasp of the language. Peggy is also a freelance newspaper columnist, [[notary public]], an exemplary [[softball]] pitcher and a [[Boggle]] champion and has started a career in [[Real Estate|real estate]]. She has a habit of adding or changing ingredients to ordinary dishes then naming them after herself. \"Spa-Peggy & Meatballs\" and \"Apple Brown Peggy\" are examples. Peggy is very self-conscious about her larger-than-normal feet (size 16 \u00bd on the left, 16 on the right). Despite boasting of her intelligence, she has been the victim of manipulation, such as being conned out of $2,500 for a [[Diploma mill|phony degree]], indoctrinated into a homogenous [[cult]], and tricked into a [[pyramid scheme]] selling [[Herbalife]] inspired products. She has brown hair and typically wears glasses, an [[aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]] sleeveless shirt, and [[denim]] [[culottes]], but often wears different outfits. \n* '''[[Bobby Hill (King of the Hill)|Robert Jeffrey \"Bobby\" Hill]]''' (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 Hank and Peggy's husky 12, later 13-year-old son and best friend to Joseph and Connie. Although friendly, gentle, lovable, and generally well-liked, he is not very bright and often prone to making bad decisions. He wants to seek fame as a [[prop comic]] and move to New York when he is older. Bobby displays little interest in gender roles and, although superb at golf and target shooting, dislikes team sports, often taking such classes as Home Economics and Peer Counseling, instead of more traditionally \"masculine classes\". Although many (including Hank) tend to typify him as \"not right\", he is romantically successful, dating Connie and other girls throughout the series.\n* '''[[Dale Gribble|Dale Alvin Gribble A.K.A. \"Rusty Shackleford\"]]''' (voiced by [[Johnny Hardwick]]) \u2013 Dale is the Hills' chain-smoking neighbor who is also an insect exterminator among various self-appointed occupations. His physical appearance was modeled after [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. Hank considers Dale a close friend, but he often gets annoyed with his schemes and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. Dale is paranoid about any government activity and frequently uses the alias of \"Rusty Shackleford\" to operate without revealing his true identity, including receiving unemployment compensation payments as Rusty. Dale is the president of the Arlen gun club and is a licensed [[bounty hunter]]. He possesses a vast collection of guns from pistols to automatic weapons and is an ardent defender of Second Amendment rights. Despite being a firearms aficionado, his aim is relatively poor and despite being knowledgeable in military matters, he is physically the weakest of the main cast and is an abject physical coward. He is an avid UFOlogist. Dale remains oblivious to the fact that his wife, Nancy, has cheated on him with John Redcorn for fourteen years and his son Joseph, who strongly resembles John Redcorn, is not his biological son. Everyone else knows of Joseph's paternity but chooses not to tell Dale because of his total obliviousness, the loving, trusting relationship he has with Joseph and Nancy, and the fact that Dale is more of a father to Joseph than John Redcorn. In the final scene in the final episode of the series, it is implied that Dale is aware that Joseph is not his biological son (how he came to learn the information is not revealed) and is rather unconcerned by it. \n* '''[[Bill Dauterive|Sgt. William \"Bill\" Fontaine de La Tour Dauterive]]''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Bill is the Hills' overweight, divorced, [[clinically depressed]] neighbor. He grew up in [[Louisiana]] with his cousin Gilbert and speaks French and English. He was formerly a rugged and attractive star fullback on Arlen High's football team where he set the school record for touchdowns and was nicknamed the \"Billdozer\", and is now a sergeant barber in the [[United States Army]]. While his job mostly consists of shaving recruits, he is in fact an extremely talented barber who is able to replicate Hank's signature flattop when Hank's longtime barber became senile. Bill once had a bright future in the Army wanting to be a [[M60 Patton|tanker]], but ended up ruining his life after marrying the promiscuous Lenore. Bill is something of a [[Sadomasochism|masochist]] and is often attracted to people who abuse him; after suffering under his father and Lenore, Bill has an almost complete lack of self-worth. He obsesses about his ex-wife, and his loneliness is a running gag on the series. He frequently tries to flirt with and win over Peggy. Despite coming across as a loser, however, Bill has enjoyed several romantic successes (or near-successes), including romances with Kahn and Luanne's mothers, former Texas governor [[Ann Richards]], and the young widows of two of his dead cousins. He is named after executive producer and writer Jim Dauterive.\n* '''[[Boomhauer|Jeffrey Dexter \"Jeff\" Boomhauer III]]''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]]) \u2013 Often referred to as his surname, Boomhauer is a slim womanizer whose mutterings are hard to understand to the audience but easily understood by his friends. A running joke is when his friends fail to understand him for some reason ''other'' than his incoherence. His speech is usually heavily littered with the phrases, \"dang\" and \"dang ol'\". Boomhauer can mumble his words, but he sings clearly and speaks other languages clearly (mainly French and Spanish). Boomhauer is a classic-car aficionado and owns a [[Dodge Super Bee|1969 Dodge Coronet Super Bee]] (in high school he owned a late 1960s [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]] nicknamed \"Ms. Sally\"), and, despite his incoherent ramblings and womanizing, often displays himself to be more intelligent and philosophical than his three friends. Although hinted at previously, in episode 18 of season 13, his first name is finally revealed when a Canadian woman who lives next door to the family that trades houses with him for the summer calls him \"Jeff\", and the driver's license shown in the series finale reads \"Boomhauer, Jeff\". Throughout the series it is never known what he does for a living, although it was revealed in an early episode that he was an electrical engineer but was on workers compensation. At the end of the series finale, a badge seen in his open wallet reveals that he is a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]].\n* {{anchor|Luanne Platter}}'''Luanne Leanne Platter Kleinschmidt''' (voiced by [[Brittany Murphy]]) \u2013 Luanne (''n\u00e9e'' Platter) is the Hills' college-age niece, daughter of Peggy's scheming [[Twin|fraternal twin]] brother Hoyt and his alcoholic former wife Leanne. Luanne moves in with the Hills after her mother Leanne stabs Hoyt with a fork during a drunken fight which tips over their trailer. Hank initially makes frequent attempts to encourage Luanne to move out on her own, but later more or less accepts her as a member of the family. She was a student at the beauty academy and later at Arlen Community College. She was often portrayed as an [[wikt:airhead|airhead]], but was shown to be an expert mechanic in the first two seasons and is good at logic puzzles. Luanne also has something of a vindictive streak, especially when she feels she has been slighted; she was once shown to have tried flushing Hank's keys down the toilet after being passed over for a propane sales position he was hired for instead (though it is revealed she actually flushed Peggy's by mistake), and later tried putting Peggy's shoes and glasses down the garbage disposal and intentionally dyed Peggy's hair green after being fired as her stylist for a local beauty pageant. Luanne was promiscuous, but she settles down after being visited by the spirit of her first boyfriend, the slacker Buckley, whom she calls \"Buckley's angel\"; and then attending a church-sponsored \"[[born-again virgin]]\" program and starts a [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] class. Luanne created a puppet show entitled \"The Manger Babies\" for a [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] station, featuring the barnyard animals who witnessed Christ's birth (though they included a penguin and an octopus). In the 10th-season finale, Luanne revealed that she was pregnant with the child of Lucky, whom she married in the 11th-season finale. In the 13th and final season, she has a baby girl named Gracie Margaret Kleinschmidt. She wears a green sleeveless crop top and red capris (or in some early episodes, a red-orange T-shirt and blue jeans) and was born on March 9, 1980.\n\n== Other Hill, Platter, and Kleinschmidt relatives ==\n\n* '''Ladybird Hill''' \u2013 The Hills' thirteen-year-old [[purebred]] [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[Bloodhound]] named after [[Lady Bird Johnson]]. It's said that her mother helped track down [[James Earl Ray]], as revealed by Hank in episode 7 of season 1 titled \"Westie Side Story\". Her companionship temporarily relieved Hank's stress (and narrow urethra), allowing him to impregnate Peggy. Later on in the series Ladybird would become deaf and despite much effort on Hank's part, would never bear puppies because of her narrow uterus. She was born on November 5, 1985.\n* '''[[Cotton Hill|Col. Cotton Lyndal Hill]]''' (voiced by [[Toby Huss]]) \u2013 Hank's cantankerous father, Peggy's father-in-law and Bobby's grandfather. He has a hair-trigger temper. Despite his many shortcomings, he occasionally showed a softer side, for example in the episode \"Cotton's Plot\" where he helped Peggy learn to walk again after her parachuting accident. His shins were blown off in [[World War II]] by a \"Japan man's machine gun\" and his feet were reattached to his knees, resulting in a short height and stilted gait. Despite his disability, he eventually reached the rank of [[colonel]] in the [[State Defense Forces|state militia]]. After Cotton and his first wife Tilly, Hank's mother, divorced, he married a much younger, soft-spoken, busty blonde [[Hospital volunteer|candy striper]] named Didi who gave birth to his youngest son \"G.H.\" (\"Good Hank\"). He was immensely proud of his military service. Though his claim of fighting \"[[Nazism|nazzies]]\" (Nazis) was proven false and his claim of killing \"fitty [fifty] men\" was dubious, his participation in several of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific Theater was confirmed and his uniform was shown to be decorated with the [[Medal of Honor]] and the [[Purple Heart]]. Cotton himself died in episode #1218, \"Death Picks Cotton\", after suffering severe burns and an allergic reaction to shrimp during a flashback at a Japanese restaurant. Instead of addressing Peggy by her name he calls her \"Hank's wife\".\n* '''Didi Hill''' (voiced by [[Ashley Gardner]]) \u2013 Didi is Cotton's second wife, Hank's stepmother, Peggy's stepmother-in-law and Bobby's stepgrandmother she's a [[Hospital volunteer|candy striper]] after she retired from being an exotic dancer. She has breast implants and suffers from [[postpartum depression]] following the birth of Cotton's third son \"G.H.\" She is generally depicted as docile and ditzy, although she is a certified optometry assistant. She was absent at the time of Cotton's death and was only seen once more, where she says she is engaged and will remarry a wealthy professional wrestler. Didi was in the same Kindergarten class as Hank, putting her birthdate in 1954 (specifically December 17).\n* '''Good Hank Jeffrey \"G.H.\" Hill''' \u2013 G.H. is Cotton's and Didi's infant son, and the younger of Hank's two half-brothers. G.H. is an abbreviation for \"Good Hank,\" implying that the original Hank was unsatisfactory to his father. Cotton treats G.H. much better than Hank presumably because Cotton sees him as being his second chance of being a better father than he was for Hank. G.H. was key at a time when Hank had to convince Cotton not to end his life as well as to permit Hank to give his father money for the baby's sake (and as payback for the years Cotton raised him). G.H. was absent at the time of his father's death, and is not seen throughout the rest of the series, although it is presumed he is living with his mother and stepfather.\n* '''Matilda \"Tilly\" Mae Garrison (formerly Hill)''' (voiced by [[Tammy Wynette]] in 1997\u20131998, [[Beth Grant]] in 1999, and [[K Callan]] in 2000\u20132009) \u2013 Tilly is Cotton's first wife, Hank's mother, Peggy's mother-in-law and Bobby's grandmother. She divorced Cotton after suffering years of verbal abuse. Tilly is a kind woman who collects miniatures because they made her happy during Cotton's abuse. Hank is often over-protective of her, fearing she is too old and fragile to go out and do things on her own. Tilly lives in Arizona with her husband Chuck. Tilly's legal name varies during the series. She is listed as \"Tilly\" on Hank's birth certificate, but is addressed as Matilda by the clergyman during her wedding to Gary.\n* '''Elroy \"Lucky\" Kleinschmidt''' (voiced by [[Tom Petty]]) \u2013 Lucky is Luanne's itinerant, but generally benign redneck husband, and is the father of Luanne's child. It's often hard for Lucky to hold down a job (he has no credit or [[Social Security number]]). He lives on the remainder of the $53,000 \"[[Financial compensation|settlement monies]]\" he received after \"slipping on pee-pee at the [[Costco]]\" having had a portion of his spine fused. He was nicknamed \"Lucky\" after the settlement windfall. After he spent a majority of his money customizing his truck, his finances dwindled down to nine thousand dollars but regained another $53,000 when an [[ambulance chasing]] lawyer paid off Lucky to avoid a lawsuit. Peggy tried very hard to break him and Luanne apart, but after Luanne's pregnancy was revealed, she and Hank reconciled the two, giving them a [[shotgun wedding]] at Lucky's request. He is also one of the guitarists for John Redcorn's band \"Big Mountain Fudgecake\". Although dimwitted in some aspects, Lucky has learned some facets such as basic math through life experience as opposed to formal education, and was astute enough to deduce that his father-in-law spent time in prison whereas Luanne believed the story that he works on an oil rig. He yearned to receive his GED but only to prove he was good enough to marry Luanne. He was born July 10, 1967.\n* '''Gracie Margaret Kleinschmidt''' \u2013 Daughter of Lucky and Luanne. She was born in the [[List of King of the Hill episodes#Season 13|season 13]] episode \"Lucky See, Monkey Do\". Luanne originally wanted to name her Lasagna (stating that [[Lasagne|lasagna]] was their favorite food) while under the influence of hospital analgesics, but choosing a more conventional name after she had recovered.\n* '''Myrna Kleinschmidt''' (voiced by [[Paget Brewster]]) \u2013 Myrna is Lucky's sister, Luanne's sister-in-law, Gracie's aunt and the main antagonist in \"[[Lucky See, Monkey Do]]\". She is an intelligent, modern mother who only appears in the episode \"Lucky See, Monkey Do\". She has two children, one son and one daughter (Gracie's paternal first cousins) and raises them in [[Strict father model|strict accordance]] with [[contemporary]] [[parenting practices]], something which leads her into a rivalry with Peggy, whose parenting skills are from older schools of thought, over how to assist Luanne as her pregnancy due date approaches. When Luanne goes into labor, Myrna commandeers the situation and insists that Luanne have a natural, drug-free [[water birth]], but under Hank's encouragement to think for themselves about how to raise their child, Luanne and Lucky opt for a hospital birth instead.\n* '''Leanne Platter''' (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 Leanne, Luanne's violent alcoholic mother, Gracie's grandmother, Bobby's aunt and Lucky's mother-in-law she was imprisoned for \"second-degree assaulting\" her husband in the back with a fork. Though she is often mentioned during the course of the series, she appears only in the episode \"Leanne's Saga,\" visiting Luanne in Arlen after her release from prison and briefly being courted by Bill Dauterive.\n* '''Hoyt Platter''' (voiced by [[Johnny Knoxville]]) \u2013 Hoyt is Luanne's father, Peggy's twin brother, Hank's brother-in-law, Bobby's uncle, Lucky's father-in-law, Gracie's grandfather and Leanne's ex-husband. Despite Luanne's beliefs, he never worked on an [[Oil platform|oil rig]], but was in jail for most of Luanne's life, with the oil rig story acting as a cover so Luanne wouldn't know her father was a convict. He appears in only one episode: \"Life: A Loser's Manual\". After being released from jail, Hoyt commits a robbery and tricks Lucky into taking the blame, but he eventually confesses and is sentenced to life in prison under a [[three-strikes law]]. The episode \"Leanne's Saga\" reveals that Hoyt was planning on marrying a pharmacist girl before Leanne, then working as a stripper, entertained at his bachelor party.\n* '''Maddy Platter''' (voiced by [[Joanna Gleason]]) \u2013 Maddy Platter is Peggy's and Hoyt's mother, Hank's mother-in-law and Bobby's and Luanne's grandmother. Mother Platter lives in [[Montana]] with her son Hoyt. She's an old-fashioned, tough-as-nails rancher type and loathes Peggy for deserting the family ranch and not marrying a local neighbor boy. Strangely, earlier episode flashbacks feature a totally different \"Peggy's mother\" character, who is essentially an older version of Peggy\u2014it's not made clear if one is her real mother and one is her stepmother, or if the \"Maddy\" mother character [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] the older version completely.\n* '''Doc Platter''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Doc is Peggy's and Hoyt's father, Hank's father-in-law and Bobby's and Luanne's grandfather. He makes only a single major appearance when Peggy, Bobby and Hank visit the family ranch. He seems to be going somewhat senile and preachy, only talking in rural old-west metaphors which Hank interprets as old-fashion Western-style wisdom.\n* '''Junichiro''' (voiced by [[David Carradine]]) \u2013 Junichiro is Hank's elder half-brother, Peggy's half-brother-in-law and Bobby's half-uncle who has lived in [[Japan]] all his life. Junichiro is Cotton's son with a Japanese nurse, Michiko, from an affair in Japan during World War II. Hank and Junichiro share many similarities in appearance and mannerisms (this in spite of the fact that Hank actually shares more of his mother's features); one of these is that when he is shocked, like Hank, he yells \"BWAH!\" Like Hank, Junichiro also has a narrow [[urethra]] and is an assistant manager at the company for which he works, making robots and robot accessories. At first, he renounces the Hill blood in him. But eventually calls Cotton \"Father\".\n* '''[[Dusty Hill]]''' (Himself) \u2013 The bassist/vocalist for the band [[ZZ Top]] and Hank's cousin. In the episode \"[[Hank Gets Dusted]],\" Cotton gives his prized [[Cadillac]] to Dusty without allowing Hank a chance to buy it. Dusty enters the car in a [[demolition derby]] in which it is badly damaged. Hank and Dusty make their peace after Dusty has the car repaired and installed at the [[Cadillac Ranch]].\n\n==Other Gribbles==\n* '''Nancy Hicks-Gribble''' (voiced by [[Ashley Gardner]]) \u2013 Nancy (''n\u00e9e'' Hicks) is Dale's wife, Joseph's mother and weather-girl-turned-anchor for local news station Channel 84. She had a fourteen-year affair with John Redcorn, which produced her son, Joseph, although the affair ended when John Redcorn befriends Dale. Nancy finally becomes a faithful wife to Dale. Nancy refused to come back to her out of respect for Dale. Her mother Bunny was similarly unfaithful to Nancy's father, but did not reveal her own long-term affair until Nancy began suffering from stress-induced hair loss over her unresolved feelings for John Redcorn. Nancy is a former beauty queen, a fact which helped her get her job as a news weather-girl. She was born April 7, 1955.\n* '''Joseph John Gribble''' (voiced by [[Brittany Murphy]] in 1997\u20132000, [[Breckin Meyer]] in 2000\u20132009) \u2013 Dale and Nancy's 13-year-old son and one of Bobby's best friends. Despite Joseph's obvious Native American features, his similarity in appearance to John Redcorn, and the fact that his middle name is \"John,\" neither he nor Dale is aware that Redcorn is his biological father (Nancy refers to Dale having a \"Jamaican grandmother\" to explain Joseph's dark complexion). Redcorn's occasional and awkward attempts to get closer to Joseph (against Nancy's wishes) lead Joseph to regard him as strange and creepy. Joseph starts out as an ordinary teen, but eventually grows weird and creepy\u2014not to mention dim-witted. Joseph begins to take after Dale more than John, Nancy or even any of his friends. Joseph has a half-sister named Kate (by John Redcorn having another affair), who is very similar to Joseph in personality and interests but likewise does not realize that Redcorn is their father. Joseph is the only character of the series shown to physically mature, having grown six inches in height over the course of a summer, a more built physique, athletic prowess and having a deeper voice and a wispy mustache upon his reappearance. He was born September 29, 1986.\n* '''Bug Gribble''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Bug is Dale's father, Nancy's father-in-law and Joseph's grandfather, who had been estranged from Dale for many years for kissing Nancy at her and Dale's wedding reception. Bug is actually [[gay]] and had been flirting with a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[caterer]] instead, and, upon sensing Dale's imminent entry into the room, attempted to hide his orientation from his son by grabbing and kissing 'the nearest thing in a dress'. This misunderstanding, and Bug's inability to reveal his true sexuality to Dale, resulted in their estrangement. When Dale and Nancy renew their wedding vows 20 years afterward, Nancy arranges to invite Bug, and Dale initially suspects his odd behavior and his having a \"partner\" of meaning that Bug is an undercover government agent, but finally accepts the truth upon seeing Bug and his partner share a devoted kiss. Bug's appearance in \"[[My Own Private Rodeo]]\" retcons his appearance in earlier episodes, where he bears a near-identicality to present-day Dale.\n\n==Other Dauterives==\n* '''Gilbert Fontaine Dauterive''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Gilbert (pronounced \"zhil-BEAR\") is Bill's cousin. Though at one point shown to live on the family estate with his aunt and cousin in a [[Louisiana]] [[bayou]] in \"A Beer Can Named Desire\", he and Bill eventually wind up as the last two living Dauterives. It is strongly implied that he is [[homosexuality|gay]], and he even hits on Buck Strickland when Buck attempts to capitalize on the Dauterive family's traditional barbecue sauce recipe in \"[[Blood and Sauce]]\".\n* '''Esm\u00e9 Dauterive''' (voiced by [[Meryl Streep]]) \u2013 Esm\u00e9 was Bill and Gilbert's aunt, and [[matriarch]] of the Dauterive clan. She expressed deep concern over the family's ever-shrinking headcount, lamenting that \"the Dauterive blood is down to a trickle\". She happily received Bill upon his return for a visit and was not displeased to see him and his cousins' widows taking mutual interest. She is only seen in \"A Beer Can Named Desire\"; it is later revealed that she had died after a fever.\n* '''Violetta Dauterive''' (voiced by [[Natalie Maines]]) \u2013 Violetta was Bill and Gilbert's cousin. She lived on the family estate in Louisiana with Esm\u00e9, Gilbert, and Rose and Lily, the widows of two other Dauterive cousins. Upon Bill's visit she, Rose, and Lily, all having been without male companionship for too long, vied for Bill's affections and attempted to seduce him, even despite Violetta's own blood relation to him. Like Esm\u00e9, she is only seen in \"A Beer Can Named Desire\"; it is later revealed that she had died in her sleep.\n* '''Lenore Dauterive''' (voiced by [[Ellen Barkin]]) \u2013 Lenore is Bill's [[mean]]-spirited ex-wife. She is mentioned frequently throughout the course of the series, but only appears twice \u2013 once being when Bill and Bobby watch Bill's wedding video. She appears when Bill begins dating former Texas Governor [[Ann Richards]] to meddle with their relationship in \"[[Hank and the Great Glass Elevator]]\", but with help from Richards, Bill is finally able to tell her off and move past her toxic influence.\n* '''Eric Dauterive''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Bill's implicitly-deceased father, who was said to be an [[abusive]] man and a heavy drinker, and is largely responsible for Bill's [[emotional instability]]. Among the abuses Bill recalls from his father are having been spanked every day between the ages of 9 and 16, being called a girl and made to wear \"pretty, pretty dresses\", and being locked in a [[Hutch (animal cage)|rabbit hutch]].\n\n==Other Boomhauers==\n* '''Patch Boomhauer''' (voiced by [[Brad Pitt]]) \u2013 Patch is Boomhauer's sleazy, womanizing younger brother. He appears in \"[[Patch Boomhauer]]\", apparently engaged to marry Boomhauer's old flame, Katherine\u2014much to Boomhauer's mounting displeasure, as he himself has unresolved feelings for Katherine, and Patch's continued philandering angers him for her sake. The wedding is later called off after Patch hires strippers for his bachelor party and frames Boomhauer for trying to break up the engagement. Patch makes a final cameo in \"[[Lucky's Wedding Suit]]\" as one of the guests at Luanne and Lucky's wedding. Patch, like Boomhauer, speaks in a fast-paced Southern gibberish.\n* '''Dr. and Mrs. Boomhauer''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]]) \u2013 Boomhauer's parents. Mrs. Boomhauer is shown to speak like Boomhauer in \"Peggy's Turtle Song\". In \"Three Coaches and a Bobby\", Boomhauer mentions that his parents had won the lottery and moved to Florida.\n* '''\"Mee-Maw\" Boomhauer''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]]) \u2013 Boomhauer's elderly grandmother. She is seen in \"Dang Ol' Love\", when Boomhauer, infatuated with Marlene, goes to Mee-Maw to ask for a family-heirloom wedding ring as well as \"[[Lucky's Wedding Suit]]\", where she is seen sitting with the other guests as well as dancing with Patch for a brief moment. Mee-Maw speaks in the same characteristic gibberish that the rest of the Boomhauers share.\n\n==Souphanousinphones==\n* '''Kohng Koy \"Kahn\" Souphanousinphone''' (voiced by [[Toby Huss]]) \u2013 Kahn is Hank's [[materialistic]], [[Lao people|Laotian]] next-door neighbor, Minh's husband, Connie's father and main antagonist. He believes he's better than his neighbors, often referring to them as \"[[hillbillies]]\" or \"[[redneck]]s\" (despite evidence to the contrary). He frequently boasts of his superiority to the others and dreams of being far more successful than Ted Wassanasong. Despite his arrogant attitude, Kahn seeks approval and friendship from his down-to-earth neighbors, who are accepting and tolerant of his ways. He previously worked for a defense contractor that manufactured composite ceramic armor, but was fired for spilling company secrets. After a string of job failures (due to his attitude) he found a new job forcing him to commute. Upon recollection of the story of how Minh and Kahn met, it is revealed that he was a former rebel and playboy whom Minh chose over the straight-laced intellectual her father set her up with. In one episode, Kahn shows that he is a trained [[martial artist]] while getting into a fight with a few [[rednecks]]. In the episode \"Just Another Manic Kahn-Day\", it is revealed that Kahn has [[bipolar disorder]] (which was also mentioned in the earlier episode \"Lost in Myspace\"). It is revealed in the episode \"Three Days of the Kahndo\" that Kahn has a brother also living in the US with a family of his own. He was born September 15, 1958.\n* '''Minh Souphanousinphone''' (voiced by [[Lauren Tom]]) \u2013 Kahn's wife and Connie's mother. Minh is a [[housewife]] who enjoys making rude comments about the neighbors, particularly Peggy. She sometimes has a snobbish attitude toward the neighbors, literally also referring to them as \"[[hillbillies]]\" or \"[[redneck]]s\" or \"dumb monkeys\" (despite evidence to the contrary). But is overall a more understanding parent and better neighbor/parent than Kahn. She is a crack-shot, with championship-level skills, and at one point joined Dale's gun club, exerting a positive effect on its members. She is highly competitive, going so far as to cheat on ''The New York Times'' crossword puzzle. Like her husband, Minh grew up in Laos, where her father was a powerful general in the army who was not happy with her decision to marry Kahn. She once told Nancy Gribble that she didn't grow up oppressed, rather because of her father's high ranking position in the army, she \"was peasants' worse nightmare\", pointing to being a bully in her youth. She once taught Bobby some of the [[Laotian language]]. She was born November 11, 1960.\n* '''Kahn \"Connie\"  Souphanousinphone Junior''' (voiced by [[Lauren Tom]]) \u2013 Connie is the American-born daughter of Kahn and Minh. She is one of Bobby's best friends and for a time his girlfriend. She is a violin player, \"A\" student, and general overachiever pressured by her mother and father, who hold her to very high standards. Though it is implied that she works hard because of her overbearing parents, in reality, she does it for herself. Connie is named after her ego-maniacal father because he wanted a son. She was born September 1, 1986.\n* '''Doggie Kahn''' \u2013 Doggie Kahn (often referred to simply as \"Doggie\") is their [[West Highland White Terrier]].\n* '''Tid Pao Souphanousinphone''' (voiced by [[Lucy Liu]]) \u2013 Tid Pao is Connie's criminally-inclined cousin and Kahn and Minh's niece from [[Los Angeles]] and the main antagonist in \"Bad Girls, Bad Girls, Whatcha Gonna Do\", who was sent to stay at Kahn's for a semester because she stole drugs from a street gang. She attended [[Tom Landry Middle School]] in the meantime. She seduced Bobby and tricked him into creating a [[meth lab]] by pretending to help him with building a candy machine for his group science project, and persuaded him to steal [[propane]] tanks from Strickland Propane to complete it. Tid Pao was caught by Connie and she was sent away by Kahn to [[Wisconsin]] to work on her last uncle's dairy farm at the end of the episode because of her criminally-inclined nature. There her uncle told her she was on her last chance as he was the last relative left in America. Any more trouble would see her shipped off to live with her grandmother in Laos.\n* '''Laoma Souphanousinphone''' (voiced by [[Amy Hill]]) \u2013 Laoma is Kahn's mother, Minh's mother-in-law and Connie's grandmother she's the only person on the show who addresses him by his full name. She's kind and hardworking and enjoys [[housekeeping]]. She is disliked by Minh because of her criticism of Minh's housework skills. The status-conscious Kahn is horrified when Laoma, bored and unwanted by her daughter-in-law, becomes the Hills' housekeeper, and even more horrified when she begins a love affair with Bill Dauterive. Laoma has not been seen since her first episode (with only a mention of her being made in its succeeding episode), mainly because the creators nixed the original plan for her and Bill to become a regular couple, preferring for Bill to remain his usual single and miserable self.\n* '''General Gum''' (voiced by [[James Sie]]) \u2013 Usually referred to as \"The General,\" (his full name is '''Gum Nga Hexumalayasabrath''') he appeared only in the episodes \"Pour Some Sugar on Kahn\" (in which he visits the family) and \"Father of the Bribe\" (in which Minh recalls her courtship by Kahn). While shows great affection towards Minh and Connie, he dislikes Kahn. He served under several Laotian dictators and was put on trial for war crimes at [[The Hague]].\n\n==Strickland Propane==\n* '''Buck Strickland''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Buck is the slightly [[overweight]], balding, over-the-hill owner of [[Strickland Propane]], and Hank's boss. His physical appearance and attitude greatly resembles [[Lyndon Johnson]], particularly his hairline, and he has a habit of hosting employee discussions in his [[bathroom]]\u2014a habit of Johnson. A picture of Buck seen in \"Pregnant Paws\" also shows him picking up one of his bloodhounds by the ears, much like a similar famous photograph of Johnson doing the same. Originally hailing from [[Arkansas]], Buck was historically known for his modest start in business and general business smarts. These attributes have since been worn away by life and been replaced with many habits which often come in the way of his business decisions. Buck is a compulsive gambler to the point where he will use company profits to continue gaming, even betting in underground events. Also like LBJ, Buck is a chauvinist, alcoholic, and adulterer. It is often implied that Hank reveres Buck and that, in Hank's eyes, the two have a close relationship. Compared to Hank who is the ultimate model of a good employee, Buck's vices require Hank to keep an extremely close eye. Buck refers to Hank as his \"[[Golden Goose]]\" implying Hank is the only reason his business remains afloat and thus he would never fire him. Hank has used the threat of quitting to capitulate Buck's transition from things Hank found unsavory. His health is questionable as he has suffered numerous [[infarction]]s and has had several cardiovascular surgeries including valve replacements. Despite his less than desirable traits, he has an ethical side although he planted evidence on Hank for [[murder]] rather than let his wife be arrested.\n* '''Joe Jack''' (voiced by [[Toby Huss]]) \u2013 Joe Jack is a fuel-truck driver and co-worker with Hank at Strickland Propane. He has a drinking and gambling problem, as seen when he is a member of the Propaniacs. Joe Jack has a habit of calling people he speaks to \"honey\", regardless of their gender or level of familiarity with him.\n* '''Enrique''' (voiced by [[Eloy Casados]] from 1997\u20131998, [[Danny Trejo]] from 2002\u20132009) \u2013 Enrique is a good-natured Mexican-American truck driver at Strickland Propane. Originally he spoke with a very weak accent. In the episode \"[[Enrique-cilable Differences]],\" Enrique forcibly befriends Hank after a nasty fight with his wife. Enrique ends up moving in with the Hills for a short time eventually developing a pathological attachment to the Hill family, but quickly patches things up with his wife after a fed-up Hank kicks him out. Enrique nearly lost his house due to rent increases when property values in his neighborhood skyrocket when Peggy began selling working class housing to upper-middle class [[Snake People]]. To solve the problem, Peggy helped the neighborhood value decline when she fabricated the area as uncool by making it appear as if typical middle-class families were moving in prompting the snake people to leave. Afterwards he applied and became a homeowner. While a hard worker, he has poor fiscal habits, often spending money on lavish outdoor parties to celebrate any seemingly significant event such as his daughter's [[Quincea\u00f1era]] or becoming a homeowner.\n* '''Donna''' (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 There are actually two separate Donnas who have both worked as Strickland accountants, and are often referred to as \"Donna from Accounting\". The first Donna appears, albeit infrequently, as an overweight, dark-skinned woman, most notably in \"[[Meet the Propaniacs]]\". In \"[[Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret Hill]]\", Buck mentions having discovered stolen office supplies in her bedroom (presumably during an extramarital encounter), and orders Hank to \"find us a new Donna\". The \"new Donna\" is a tall, curvy white woman who first appears in \"[[The Miseducation of Bobby Hill]]\". In \"[[24 Hour Propane People]]\" she mentions a husband; in \"[[You Gotta Believe (In Moderation)]]\", Dale notes her \"recent divorce\". In \"[[Lost in MySpace]]\", her most significant episode, she is briefly promoted to assistant manager alongside Hank, which didn't settle in well with him. She often uses MySpace during work hours and ignored Hank when he asked her for a down to business approach. In turn, Donna is briefly fired when some of her MySpace friends mistook Buck for Hank and brutally beat him up. She sought revenge against Hank by making rude comments about him and Strickland. After sifting through the blogs, he confronts Donna for her behavior at Goobersmooches and eventually makes amends with her. After being rehired as an accountant, Donna takes down the blogs and rearranges it to a down to business approach like Hank wanted.\n* '''Roger \"Buddha\" Sack''' (voiced by [[Chris Rock]] in the first appearance, [[Phil LaMarr]] in later appearances) \u2013 He first appeared in \"Traffic Jam\" as a comedian and traffic school instructor. Despite having a rising TV career some years prior, his career stalled following an unfortunate encounter with [[Moesha]]. His abrasive and insulting style of humor infuriates Hank, as well as the dean of the traffic school, who terminates his employment at the traffic school for not teaching traffic safety as he was hired to do. Hank later gets Roger a job at Strickland Propane. Grateful to Hank for saving him from unemployment, Roger's attitude mellows afterward.\n* '''Elizabeth \"Miz Liz\" Strickland''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Turner]]) \u2013 Elizabeth is the deep-voiced, long suffering wife of Buck Strickland, first seen in \"[[Hanky Panky (King of the Hill)|Hanky Panky]]\". In \"Hanky Panky\", the first half of a two-part episode, Miz Liz confronts Buck at an awards dinner while he is there with his mistress. She files for divorce from Buck and subsequently takes control of Strickland Propane. This forces Buck to move in with Debbie. She promotes Hank to manager and attempts to seduce Hank in a propane-powered hot tub. However, the interest was not reciprocated. She brags to Buck about this, Buck, in turn, surprises Hank with a loaded shotgun expressing his jealousy. She and Buck reconcile in the second half \"[[High Anxiety (King of the Hill)|High Anxiety]]\", but later on, in \"[[The Good Buck]]\", Buck claims that Miz Liz has left for good, stating that \"she could handle my drinkin' binges, and my gamblin', and even turn a blind eye to my extramarital escapades, but not when they happen all once! ...and on her birthday!\"\n* '''Debbie Grund''' (voiced by [[Reese Witherspoon]]) \u2013 Debbie was an employee of Strickland Propane and was Buck Strickland's [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] and the main antagonist in the episode \"Hanky Panky\". As revenge for Buck ending their relationship, she plotted to murder Buck and his wife, but accidentally killed herself with Buck's shotgun while attempting to climb into the dumpster she was using as a hiding place.\n\n==Tom Landry Middle School==\n* '''Carl Moss''' (voiced by [[Dennis Burkley]]) \u2013 Carl is the [[school principal|principal]] of Tom Landry Middle School. Moss is one of Hank's high school classmates; he played [[center (football)|center]] for their [[American football|football]] team. His primary concerns are tight budgets, maintaining discipline and the schools zero tolerance policy for \"everything\". He tends to follow procedure to avoid trouble, even when it conflicts with his friendship with Hank. A highly changed person, Hank will often remind Carl of how he used to be and insinuate that Carl sold out for a position of power. He frequently rejects staff demands for better teaching aids, citing budget cuts; he once referred to wood being used in shop class as a \"fancy teaching aid\". Often the center of various scandals at the school, he permitted installation of soda dispensing vending machines solely for raising funds for staff vacations and purposely placed lazy students into [[special education]] classes to avoid state-mandated exams (whose grades would heavily affect school funding). Once, when one of Dale's plots to get rid of Moss came to nothing before they got started, Bill mentioned that Moss couldn't hide behind inflated test scores forever.\n* '''Coach Kleehammer''' (voiced by [[Toby Huss]]) \u2013 Coach Kleehammer is the football coach at Tom Landry Middle School. He has a difficult time relating to things outside of football and often uses football-related expressions in everyday speech. Kleehammer is portrayed as being sexist, having displayed a very negative attitude towards women's sports. \n*'''Stuart Dooley''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]]) \u2013 Often referred to by his surname, he is Bobby's deep-voiced, laconic classmate. He always sardonically intones something obvious after witnessing an event (for example, to Bobby after witnessing Mega Lo Mart exploding, \"Your Dad got blown up.\"). He also is something of a rebel \u2014 he pulled down Peggy's pants, and he is seen smoking. His style of speech is similar to [[Butt-Head]] from Mike Judge's previous show, ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', albeit without Butt-Head's trademark laughter.\n* '''Clark Peters''' (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 The [[overweight]] bully at Tom Landry Middle School. He has a [[blond]] [[ponytail]] and speaks as though he has a perpetual head cold (Minh once referred to him as \"that creepy booger-nosed kid\"). He often targets Bobby and sometimes forces him to do homework for him.\n* '''Randy Miller''' (voiced by Cheryl Holliday in 1997\u20131999, [[David Herman]] in 2000\u20132009) \u2013 Randy is the quintessential \"nerd\" who loves to tattle on people and then see them being punished. Bobby, Connie, and Joseph do not like him very much, though Bobby once stopped Dooley from beating him up. He is very proud of his father being a successful patent lawyer. Although once a somewhat prominent character, he largely vanished after the fifth season. \n* '''Chane Wassonasong''' (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 Chane is a smart but obnoxious and rude classmate of Bobby and Connie. Connie's parents are constantly trying to fix her up with Chane, also Laotian-American, as they see him as a very preferable alternative to Bobby (and because Chane is the son of prominent Laotian-American Ted Wassonasong, with whom they are constantly trying to curry favor)\n* '''Emily''' (voiced by [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]]) \u2013 She is a sixth grade blonde pony-tailed hall monitor who takes her position quite seriously.

Very late into the series, Lori insisted that she and Joseph go \"all the way\" in their relationship, but Joseph broke up with her before it could happen.*\n* '''Eugene Grandy''' (voiced by [[John Ritter]])--Music Teacher seen in four episodes.  Stressed for Success (2004) - Witches of East Arlen (2003)- What Makes Bobby Run?(2000) - The Son That Got Away (1997)\n\n==Arlen VFW==\n* '''Sgt. \"Topsy\" Toppington''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Toppington (nearly always referred to as \"Topsy\") is an old wartime buddy of Cotton Hill. He often acts as an accomplice to Cotton's schemes. He could inflate his cheeks in a manner similar to [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and according to Cotton, he was legally blind and had to have all his teeth pulled out because they were badly decayed. In \"[[Death Buys a Timeshare]],\" his death is confirmed as Cotton is left his [[Estate (law)|estate]]. Topsy was apparently cremated and his remains flushed down a toilet once used by General [[George S. Patton]], as his name can be seen along with all of Cotton's war buddies above the toilet.\n* '''Stinkey''' (voiced by [[Edward Asner]]) \u2013 Stinkey is one of Cotton Hill's wartime friends who was overweight and had suffered from diabetes, he died at some point later in the series as it is mentioned by Cotton and his name is among the veterans' ashes flushed down the toilet that General Patton used. Cotton spoke his name as he lay dying in the VA hospital.\n* '''Irwin Linker''' (voiced by [[Jack Carter (comedian)|Jack Carter]]) \u2013 Irwin is one of Cotton Hill's wartime friends who is often seen with an oxygen tank. He was one of the few to not be named Stinky, Fatty, or [[Brooklyn]].\n* '''Ted \"Pops\" Popazito''' (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) \u2013 One of Cotton's war buddies who lived next to Bill for eighteen years. He often criticized Hank and his friends for using modern tools for housework. In \"Movin' On Up,\" he died of a heart attack on his lawn mower and his house was rented by Luanne and some college friends.\n\n==Other recurring characters==\n* '''[[John Redcorn]]''' (voiced by [[Victor Aaron]] in 1997, [[Jonathan Joss]] in 1998\u20132009) \u2013 John is Nancy's [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|Native American]] former \"healer\" and adulterous lover, and the biological father of Joseph. He is a former roadie for [[Winger (band)|Winger]] and lead singer of Big Mountain Fudgecake. In Season 9, he began writing and performing his own children's music. He works out of his trailer as a masseur, though his clients are generally only women. It is implied that he has a history of having sex with them, as Hank is horrified when Peggy goes to see him, and John Redcorn even states to him, \"Hank, I consider you a friend. I would never heal your wife the way I heal the wives of others.\" He is also active in American Indian rights campaigns, and Dale once helped him with a lawsuit that netted him twelve acres of land from the Federal government. However he was manipulated into building a [[Indian gaming|casino]] on the property which was later found to be prohibited in Texas whose tribes forfeit gaming rights for federal recognition and his property was permitted for hazardous dumping to pay the debt. Because Dale had been so helpful, Redcorn felt extremely guilty over what he did with Nancy, and ended his affair by encouraging Nancy and Dale to strengthen their marriage. Dale re-tailored Redcorn's status as a musician from a mediocre rock singer to a successful children's performer. He eventually got back together with an ex-lover and became a dedicated husband and father to the children he had with her.\n* '''Ted Wassonasong and Cindy Wassonasong''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]] and [[Lauren Tom]] respectively) \u2013 Ted and Cindy are affluent Laotian-American acquaintances of the Souphanousinphones. Kahn and Minh envy and resent them, but go to great lengths to gain their favor, such as inviting them over for dinner. They live in the upscale, gated community of Arlen Heights, and are prominent members of Nine Rivers Country Club. Ted and Cindy tolerate the Souphanousinphones but, in reality, look down upon them. They joined the Episcopal Church despite being Buddhist because it was \"good for business.\" Ted is also blatantly hypocritical. He referred to Kahn as a \"Banana\" (an ethnic slur to identify an Asian American apparently lost in touch with their ethnic identity; more comfortable with Western society) even though Ted possesses far greater degree of luxury commodities, and lost most of his accent. He also helped pass a city ordinance banning the use of [[trans fats]] only to be immediately found consuming the very foods he helped prohibit.\n* '''Octavio''' (voiced by [[Danny Trejo]] in \"Hank's Back\", [[Mike Judge]] in later appearances) \u2013 Octavio is a Hispanic [[quasi]]-[[mercenary]] who does various bizarre favors for Dale when paid enough money, such as breaking into the Hill's home in the middle of the night to look for Dale's kidney (earlier in the episode, Hank, who was legally Dale for three days while Dale was in hospital to give his kidney to [[NHRA]] drag racer [[John Force]], was forced to help Octavio bash his own car with [[rebar]] to try and claim motor accident insurance, a scheme he had cook up with Dale). On his chest is a large [[Rob Zombie]] tattoo which he once tried to pass off as a tattoo of Jesus in order to join Luanne's Bible study group because she was conducting lessons in her pool while wearing a two piece bikini. His appearance was modelled after actor [[Danny Trejo]] (who actually voices [[List of King of the Hill characters#Strickland Propane|Enrique]] on the show and Octavio as well). His last appearance was a non-speaking cameo in ''Just Another Manic-Kahn Day''.\n* '''M.F. (Milton Farnsworth) Thatherton''' (voiced by [[Burt Reynolds]] in the first appearance, [[Toby Huss]] in later appearances) \u2013 M.F. is a former employee of Strickland Propane and another antagonist who strikes out on his own and opens up the crooked Thatherton Fuels company across the street from Strickland. He dresses like an old school rich cowboy with a ten-gallon hat and cowboy boots. An untrustworthy type, Thatherton is a sometime [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Hank Hill and/or Buck. His sins are similar to Buck Strickland's (womanizing, gambling, using people), but more pronounced. Thatherton openly considers customers as little more than moneymakers and hires centerfold models or [[Hooters]] girls to bait potential propane customers. Hank, who also despises him, was forced to work for Thatherton for a week due to Buck losing at a game of cards. Whenever his name is mentioned, any of the Hills remark angrily, \"Thatherton!\"\n* '''Reverend Thomason''' (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) \u2013 A minister at Arlen First Methodist Church. He was replaced by Reverend Karen Stroup upon retiring to start an online ministry.\n* '''Reverend Karen Stroup''' (voiced by [[Mary Tyler Moore]] in 1999, [[Ashley Gardner]] in 2000\u20132010) \u2013 The first female minister of Arlen First Methodist Church. She is originally from [[Minnesota]], but is assigned to Arlen after Reverend Thomason left to start an online ministry. She and Bill finally become a couple, yet he broke up with her when she moved in and it felt like everything was moving too fast. The congregation also objected to the relationship. She didn't take it well but there has been no talk about their relationship since that episode.\n* '''Jimmy Whichard''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Jimmy is the town imbecile, and the main antagonist in \"Life in the Fast Lane - Bobby's Saga\". He has had several jobs, including concession manager at the racetrack and [[outsider artist]]. Dale notes that he may have given himself brain damage from staring into the sun for too long, although \"he can't have been too bright to do it in the first place.\" When Peggy was scammed by an internet test that \"proved\" she was a genius, she only believed it to be a scam upon learning that Jimmy was also proclaimed a genius.\n* '''[[Chuck Mangione]]''' (voiced by Himself) \u2013 Chuck is a famous jazz trumpeter and flugelhorn player, and his hit song \"Feels So Good\" is played frequently on the show. He shamelessly promotes Mega-Lo Mart until he grows tired of going to every new store opening (he told Dale that he didn't read the contract properly, stating that Mega-Lo Mart opened 400 new stores per year and it left him no time to tour, record or be with his family). This forced him to disappear where Dale discovers he has become a hermit, living within the Arlen Mega-Lo Mart in a \"Toilet Paper Castle\" and stealing stocked items at night when the store is closed. When he tells Dale that he disappeared to \"stick it to the man\", Dale decides to keep his secret and Mangione goes on living in the store undetected.\n* '''Monsignor Martinez''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]]) \u2013 The Monsignor is the gun-toting priest hero of the fictional [[TV series]] ''Los Dias y Las Noches de Monsignor Martinez,'' a favorite of many of the principal characters. Clips of his program are often inserted into episodes as part of a running gag. In one of the episodes, Hank mentions that Martinez is an undercover cop. The clips of his episodes which appear on the series usually feature him just about to kill one of his nemeses while solemnly uttering his catchphrase, \"''Vaya con Dios\"; ''often preceding a melodramatic explosion. In the 8th-season episode \"Flirting with the Master,\" the actor who plays Martinez invites Peggy to Mexico City to tutor his children, and she mistakes his interest for romantic passion. A live-action pilot was filmed featuring the character, but never aired because FOX didn't think it would have been a good idea to have a show about a Catholic priest shooting people.\n* '''Lane Pratley''' (voiced by [[Dwight Yoakam]] in the first appearance, [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] in later appearances) \u2013 Lane is a sleazy car dealer who owns \"Pratley [[Ford]]\" and \"Pratley [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]],\" and as he says, \"I got my eye on Pratley [[Cadillac]]\u2014my daddy ain't doing so good.\" Lane once owned a women's roller derby team that Peggy and Luanne skated for, before Peggy organized the skaters into a buyout and quit.\n* '''Mark Buckley''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Buckley was the [[slacker]] boyfriend of Luanne. He was killed in a propane explosion by his own negligence while working at [[Mega-Lo Mart]] in the second [[season finale]], having dragged a propane tank by the valve instead of its handles resulting in leak. The character did return once (as an angel) on the episode \"Wings of the Dope,\" where Kahn buys Buckley's trampoline for his backyard and Luanne (who has been stressed over beauty school finals) begins seeing Buckley's angel.\n* '''Officer Brown''' (voiced by [[Fred Willard]]) \u2013 Officer Brown is a local police officer in Arlen who is not averse to tampering with evidence and taking bribes from illegal food operations, as explained in episodes 20 and 11 (respectively) of season 12. In the episode \"Cops and Roberts,\" Principal Moss states that \"Officer Brown may be a disgraced cop who tampered with evidence . . . but this here used to be a man\". His appearance is modeled after his voice actor. Brown (as well as other Arlen police officers) were seen to be 'starstruck' by fictional ex-[[Dallas Cowboy]] player Willie Lane (and his [[Super Bowl XII|1978 Super Bowl]] ring) and refused to arrest him for felonies against Hank and Kahn after finding out who he was in the episode \"New Cowboy on the Block\".\n* '''Jack''' (voiced by [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]) \u2013 Jack is Hank's mentally unstable barber. Eventually, his distress affects his ability to style hair, causing Hank great embarrassment. Jack was almost forced out of business when a trendy salon named Hottyz opened across the street, but he was able to secure Luanne and Bill's services after Hottyz fired them when they learned Bill was not the homosexual hairstylist he'd been posing as.\n* '''Eustace Miller''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Eustace is a wimpy, mustachioed patent lawyer and father of Bobby's classmate Randy.\n* '''Bob Jenkins''' (voiced by [[Henry Gibson]]) \u2013 Bob is a veteran reporter for ''[[The Arlen Bystander]]'' and is Peggy's main rival there. His left eye was scraped out of his skull because he had a [[brain tumor]]. When Peggy thinks the \"[[Waffle House]] beat\" is beneath her, Bob takes it over and breaks the story of Dale as \"The Smoking Bandit.\" In \"Bystand Me\" (his debut episode), he tells Peggy that whenever he gets [[writer's block]], he hires a [[prostitute]].\n* '''Miss Kremzer''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Coolidge]]) \u2013 The teacher at the beauty school Luanne went to. She is very condescending towards Luanne in her first appearance. After Hank's speech that gets Kremzer to change her grade for Luanne, she acts sympathetic along with the other students, but is right back to her previously-displayed bad attitude in subsequent episodes.\n* '''Sharona Johnson''' (voiced by [[Dawnn Lewis]]) \u2013 A girl that goes to the same beauty school that Luanne went to, Sharona is hardworking and intelligent but is also very arrogant and puts down Luanne constantly.\n* '''Chris Sizemore''' (voiced by [[Chris Elliott]]) \u2013 A real estate agent that Peggy once worked for after she wrote a scathing article about him in the Bystander for which she was consequently fired.\n* '''Gary Kasner''' (voiced by [[Carl Reiner]]) \u2013 An elderly Jewish man who serves as Tilly Hill's new love interest following her separation from Cotton. He served on a submarine during Korea, but tells Bobby he didn't see any action during the conflict. Hank was initially not happy with his mother's decision to pursue a relationship again, but Hank changed his mind when Gary threatened to kick Cotton's ass if he kept talking bad about Tilly.\n* '''Tom Chick''' (voiced by [[Phil Hendrie]]) \u2013 The manager of the Channel 84 news division.\n* '''Nguc Phong''' (voiced by [[James Sie]]) \u2013 A Laotian who is one of Ted Wassonasong's friends.\n* '''David \"The Flyin' Hawaiian\" Kalaiki-Ali'i''' (voiced by [[Brendan Fraser]]) \u2013 David is the star football player for Arlen High School in the episode \"Peggy Makes The Big Leagues.\" He has a carefree attitude towards school, figuring he can coast by on his football skills (as most of the Arlen High teachers cut him slack due to his importance on the team), but he runs afoul of Peggy. Due to the [[No Pass No Play]] policy, David is prevented from playing football until he raises his grades, earning Peggy the ire of the local booster club. The club and school employees fabricate evidence that David was [[mental retardation|Learning disabled]] which he admitted was untrue although his grammar, handwriting and mathematical reasoning are poor. Realizing his chances for playing in professional sports are statistically low, he agrees to be tutored by Peggy to have something to fall back on.\n* '''Mrs. Kalaiki-Ali'i''' (voiced by [[Amy Hill]]) \u2013 A Hawaiian insurance agent Hank visits when Kahn backs into Hank's truck with his van. A later episode revolved around her son David who was a star football player at Arlen High and was doing poorly in his classes.\n* '''Fred Ebberd''' (voiced by [[Chelcie Ross]]) \u2013 A member of the city council who also works at a movie theater. He appeared in only two episodes, but is mentioned by Hank in several others. Hank mentions voting for him and having no regrets about it even though he has expressed disappointment with his performance.\n* '''Anthony Page''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 An ultra-liberal social worker from Los Angeles. Physically frail, as he considers carpal tunnel a disability (nicknamed \"Twig Boy\"). In the pilot episode, he is assigned to investigate the allegation that Hank is beating Bobby. He appears in a later episode as Leon's advocate when Hank fired him for drug-abuse.\n* '''Carl the Restaurateur''' (voiced by [[Dennis Burkley]]) \u2013 Owns and operates the Showbiz Deli in the episode ''Love Hurts and So Does Art''. He indicates in this episode that before switching the menu to New York style deli food, his restaurant had served Italian food. Carl is not a stickler for quality in his cuisine, noting that he orders chopped chicken liver in a large drum. His restaurant is not popular and often Bobby Hill is the only customer. He also seems to be a lazy cook, noting, \"Did you know you have to heat up Italian food?\". After the apparent failure of the Showbiz Deli, we encounter Carl again in ''Bad Girls, Bad Girls, Whatcha Gonna Do?'', again having switched his menu, this time to sushi, another food that can be served raw. In this later episode, it appears that Carl's business is doing much better, as the scenes of the sushi restaurant show many customers inside. He is not to be confused with the similarly named school principal Carl Moss, who was also voiced by Burkley.\n\n==Other characters==\n* '''Jody \"Ray Roy\" Strickland''' (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) \u2013 Jody, the illegitimate son of Buck Strickland, lives in [[Tennessee]]. Buck meets him at the National Propane Gas Convention. Affectionately dubbed \"Ray Roy\" by Buck when he cannot remember his real name, he gladly accepts the nickname. Like his father, Jody also runs a propane company named Strickland Propane that's based in [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]]. Also like Buck, Jody is a compulsive gambler, chauvinist, alcoholic, cheat, and womanizer.\n* '''Wesley Cherish''' (voiced by [[Andy Richter]]) \u2013 Wesley is a new neighbor that moved to Arlen from Fort Worth in the episode [[Straight as an Arrow]]. Wesley's wife is Annette. They have six children (only two of which have been named, boys Robin and Carey, one of which has [[ADHD]], and the other [[hyperglycemia]]). The children are home schooled by Annette. Wesley does not allow his children to play video games or watch TV (although they do have a TV, which is mainly used as an end table) and are not allowed to participate in \"predatory sports\" such as [[American football|football]], [[basketball]] and [[tag (game)|tag]].\n*'''Tammi Duvall''' (voiced by [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]]) \u2013 Tammi is a [[prostitute]] who was from [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] (referred to as The \"OKC\") in the episode \"[[Ho Yeah!]]\". She was hired at Strickland Propane and went to lunch with Peggy. The pair become fast friends, and Tammi has expressed her desire to get her [[GED]]. Peggy decided to tutor Tammi, and because Tammi does not have a place to live, she is welcomed to stay in the den, much to Hank's objections. Tammi has gone out with Barry, Lane Pratley, and Miles Burton, all the while getting Peggy to dress like a prostitute also. She has read ''[[Congo (novel)|Congo]]'', the book that Peggy has given her, and she has been giving Hank money, and has given him a cowboy-style hat with a big feather. When she was arguing with a man named Donald, Hank decides to intervene and Tammi explains that Donald took her money, making Hank demand that Donald returns the money. Frightened, Donald surrenders the cash back to Tammi. Later, a man named Alabaster Jones, the \"main mack\" of Oklahoma City, confronts Hank and introduces himself as Tammi's [[pimp]]. Alabaster accuses Hank of \"trickin' Tammi out all over town.\u201d Hank denies it but remembers all of the things Tammi has been doing and realizes that Tammi is a prostitute and Alabaster, thinking Hank has been acting as Tammi's pimp, tells Hank that either Tammi goes back to being his [[Prostitution|ho]], or Hank becomes his new ho. As Hank has confronted her in the [[public library]], Tammi tells the truth, and Hank has told Tammi that she has to leave. In the car on the way home, Tammi thanked Hank and Peggy for all they have done for her. But, unfortunately, Hank is rear-ended by Alabaster, who wanted Tammi. Hank tries to outrun him, to no avail. When Tammi requests that Hank stops the car so she can exit and return with Alabaster to Oklahoma City, Hank slams on the brakes. He steps out of the car and tells Alabaster to do likewise. Hank then hands Alabaster all of the cash Tammi gave him and states that Tammi is now his \u201cho.\u201d Alabaster takes the money and tries to buy Peggy, but Hank refused and after Alabaster drives off, Tammi decides to go straight.\n*'''Alabaster Jones''' (voiced by [[Snoop Dogg]]) \u2013 Alabaster is a [[pimp]] and the main antagonist in \"[[Ho Yeah!]]\". He came from [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] (referred to as The \"OKC\") in the episode and confronted Hank, accusing Hank of \"trickin' Tammi out all over town.\u201d Hank denies it but remembers all of the things Tammi has been doing and realizes that Tammi is a prostitute and Alabaster, thinking Hank has been acting as Tammi's pimp, tells Hank that either Tammi goes back to being his [[Prostitution|ho]], or Hank becomes his new ho. Alabaster deliberately rear-ended Hank, wanting Tammi. Hank tries to outrun him, to no avail. When Tammi requests that Hank stops the car so she can exit and return with Alabaster to Oklahoma City, Hank slams on the brakes. He steps out of the car and tells Alabaster to do likewise. Hank then hands Alabaster all of the cash Tammi gave him and states that Tammi is now his \u201cho\u201d, making Alabaster nervous as Hank is bigger than Alabaster. Alabaster takes the money and tries to get Peggy, but Hank refused, telling Alabaster that Peggy is his wife, and Alabaster drives off.\n*'''Cane Skretteburg''' (voiced by [[Tr\u00e9 Cool]]) \u2013 Cane Skretteburg is the lead singer of a [[punk rock]] garage band and one of the main antagonists in the episode \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteburg\".

Cane and his band later appear in the episode \"Master of Puppets\". \n*'''Spongy'''- Real name unknown. He is a homeless panhandler first seen in \"The Texas Panhandler\".

The episodes \"Movin' On Up\" and \"Chasing Bobby\" show Hank escaping from his troubled home life by working on his lawn and truck when times are tough.<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=king-of-the-hill&episode=s04e16|title=King of the Hill s04e16 Episode Script |website= Springfield!

Springfield!|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref> Hank resembles\u2014in both voice and appearance\u2014the [[Mr. Anderson (Beavis and Butt-head)|Tom Anderson]] character from ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', a character also voiced by Judge. Hank is usually a well-meaning father, but is often confused and anxious towards modern trends and the antics of his friends and family members. He suffers from a narrow [[urethra]], which made Bobby's conception difficult. Hank is uncomfortable with public displays of intimacy with his wife and son. He has a very difficult time saying \"I love you\" to any member of his family, as he thinks it is unmanly. Hank's trademark exclamation when surprised or angered or in times of discomfort (sounding like \"Bwaaa!\") and his phrase \"I tell you what\" (\"what\" in his dialect being pronounced {{IPA-all|\u028d\u028ct|}}) are [[running gag]]s on the series. Hank is a byproduct of a bygone era - always faithful, friendly, firm, reasonable, well-read and hard-working. Much of the series revolves around Hank's desire to do the right thing compared to much of the rest of the people around him who would rather cheat, lie or exploit. Hank is a proud Texan, having grown up there. He was, however, born in a ladies room at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], and spent the first three days of his life in [[New York City]]. \n* '''[[Peggy Hill|Margaret J. \"Peggy\" Platter Hill]]''' (voiced by [[Kathy Najimy]]) \u2013 Hank's wife, Peggy (''n\u00e9e'' Platter), was born in [[Montana]] and raised on her family's cattle ranch. Her strained relationship with her mother is a source of drama for her. Peggy is a substitute teacher in Arlen, Texas, specializing in teaching [[Spanish language|Spanish]] despite having a terrible grasp of the language. Peggy is also a freelance newspaper columnist, [[notary public]], an exemplary [[softball]] pitcher and a [[Boggle]] champion and has started a career in [[Real Estate|real estate]]. She has a habit of adding or changing ingredients to ordinary dishes then naming them after herself. \"Spa-Peggy & Meatballs\" and \"Apple Brown Peggy\" are examples. Peggy is very self-conscious about her larger-than-normal feet (size 16 \u00bd on the left, 16 on the right). Despite boasting of her intelligence, she has been the victim of manipulation, such as being conned out of $2,500 for a [[Diploma mill|phony degree]], indoctrinated into a homogenous [[cult]], and tricked into a [[pyramid scheme]] selling [[Herbalife]] inspired products. She has brown hair and typically wears glasses, an [[aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]] sleeveless shirt, and [[denim]] [[culottes]], but often wears different outfits. \n* '''[[Bobby Hill (King of the Hill)|Robert Jeffrey \"Bobby\" Hill]]''' (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 Hank and Peggy's husky 12, later 13-year-old son and best friend to Joseph and Connie. Although friendly, gentle, lovable, and generally well-liked, he is not very bright and often prone to making bad decisions. He wants to seek fame as a [[prop comic]] and move to New York when he is older. Bobby displays little interest in gender roles and, although superb at golf and target shooting, dislikes team sports, often taking such classes as Home Economics and Peer Counseling, instead of more traditionally \"masculine classes\". Although many (including Hank) tend to typify him as \"not right\", he is romantically successful, dating Connie and other girls throughout the series.\n* '''[[Dale Gribble|Dale Alvin Gribble A.K.A. \"Rusty Shackleford\"]]''' (voiced by [[Johnny Hardwick]]) \u2013 Dale is the Hills' chain-smoking neighbor who is also an insect exterminator among various self-appointed occupations. His physical appearance was modeled after [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. Hank considers Dale a close friend, but he often gets annoyed with his schemes and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. Dale is paranoid about any government activity and frequently uses the alias of \"Rusty Shackleford\" to operate without revealing his true identity, including receiving unemployment compensation payments as Rusty. Dale is the president of the Arlen gun club and is a licensed [[bounty hunter]]. He possesses a vast collection of guns from pistols to automatic weapons and is an ardent defender of Second Amendment rights. Despite being a firearms aficionado, his aim is relatively poor and despite being knowledgeable in military matters, he is physically the weakest of the main cast and is an abject physical coward. He is an avid UFOlogist. Dale remains oblivious to the fact that his wife, Nancy, has cheated on him with John Redcorn for fourteen years and his son Joseph, who strongly resembles John Redcorn, is not his biological son. Everyone else knows of Joseph\u2019s paternity but chooses not to tell Dale because of his total obliviousness, the loving, trusting relationship he has with Joseph and Nancy, and the fact that Dale is more of a father to Joseph than John Redcorn. In the final scene in the final episode of the series, it is implied that Dale is aware that Joseph is not his biological son (how he came to learn the information is not revealed) and is rather unconcerned by it. \n* '''[[Bill Dauterive|Sgt. William \"Bill\" Fontaine de La Tour Dauterive]]''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Bill is the Hills' overweight, divorced, [[clinically depressed]] neighbor. He grew up in [[Louisiana]] with his cousin Gilbert and speaks French and English. He was formerly a rugged and attractive star fullback on Arlen High's football team where he set the school record for touchdowns and was nicknamed the \"Billdozer\", and is now a sergeant barber in the [[United States Army]]. While his job mostly consists of shaving recruits, he is in fact an extremely talented barber who is able to replicate Hank's signature flattop when Hank\u2019s longtime barber became senile. Bill once had a bright future in the Army wanting to be a [[M60 Patton|tanker]], but ended up ruining his life after marrying the promiscuous Lenore. Bill is something of a [[Sadomasochism|masochist]] and is often attracted to people who abuse him; after suffering under his father and Lenore, Bill has an almost complete lack of self-worth. He obsesses about his ex-wife, and his loneliness is a running gag on the series. He frequently tries to flirt with and win over Peggy. Despite coming across as a loser, however, Bill has enjoyed several romantic successes (or near-successes), including romances with Kahn and Luanne's mothers, former Texas governor [[Ann Richards]], and the young widows of two of his dead cousins. He is named after executive producer and writer Jim Dauterive.\n* '''[[Boomhauer|Jeffrey Dexter \"Jeff\" Boomhauer III]]''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]]) \u2013 Often referred to as his surname, Boomhauer is a slim womanizer whose mutterings are hard to understand to the audience but easily understood by his friends. A running joke is when his friends fail to understand him for some reason ''other'' than his incoherence. His speech is usually heavily littered with the phrases, \"dang\" and \"dang ol'\". Boomhauer can mumble his words, but he sings clearly and speaks other languages clearly (mainly French and Spanish). Boomhauer is a classic-car aficionado and owns a [[Dodge Super Bee|1969 Dodge Coronet Super Bee]] (in high school he owned a late 1960s [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]] nicknamed \"Ms. Sally\"), and, despite his incoherent ramblings and womanizing, often displays himself to be more intelligent and philosophical than his three friends. Although hinted at previously, in episode 18 of season 13, his first name is finally revealed when a Canadian woman who lives next door to the family that trades houses with him for the summer calls him \"Jeff\", and the driver's license shown in the series finale reads \"Boomhauer, Jeff\". Throughout the series it is never known what he does for a living, although it was revealed in an early episode that he was an electrical engineer but was on workers compensation. At the end of the series finale, a badge seen in his open wallet reveals that he is a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]].\n* {{anchor|Luanne Platter}}'''Luanne Leanne Platter Kleinschmidt''' (voiced by [[Brittany Murphy]]) \u2013 Luanne (''n\u00e9e'' Platter) is the Hills' college-age niece, daughter of Peggy's scheming [[Twin|fraternal twin]] brother Hoyt and his alcoholic former wife Leanne. Luanne moves in with the Hills after her mother Leanne stabs Hoyt with a fork during a drunken fight which tips over their trailer. Hank initially makes frequent attempts to encourage Luanne to move out on her own, but later more or less accepts her as a member of the family. She was a student at the beauty academy and later at Arlen Community College. She was often portrayed as an [[wikt:airhead|airhead]], but was shown to be an expert mechanic in the first two seasons and is good at logic puzzles. Luanne also has something of a vindictive streak, especially when she feels she has been slighted; she was once shown to have tried flushing Hank's keys down the toilet after being passed over for a propane sales position he was hired for instead (though it is revealed she actually flushed Peggy's by mistake), and later tried putting Peggy's shoes and glasses down the garbage disposal and intentionally dyed Peggy's hair green after being fired as her stylist for a local beauty pageant. Luanne was promiscuous, but she settles down after being visited by the spirit of her first boyfriend, the slacker Buckley, whom she calls \"Buckley's angel\"; and then attending a church-sponsored \"[[born-again virgin]]\" program and starts a [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] class. Luanne created a puppet show entitled \"The Manger Babies\" for a [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] station, featuring the barnyard animals who witnessed Christ's birth (though they included a penguin and an octopus). In the 10th-season finale, Luanne revealed that she was pregnant with the child of Lucky, whom she married in the 11th-season finale. In the 13th and final season, she has a baby girl named Gracie Margaret Kleinschmidt. She wears a green sleeveless crop top and red capris (or in some early episodes, a red-orange T-shirt and blue jeans) and was born on March 9, 1980.\n\n== Other Hill, Platter, and Kleinschmidt relatives ==\n\n* '''Ladybird Hill''' \u2013 The Hills' thirteen-year-old [[purebred]] [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[Bloodhound]] named after [[Lady Bird Johnson]]. It's said that her mother helped track down [[James Earl Ray]], as revealed by Hank in episode 7 of season 1 titled \"Westie Side Story\". Her companionship temporarily relieved Hank's stress (and narrow urethra), allowing him to impregnate Peggy. Later on in the series Ladybird would become deaf and despite much effort on Hank's part, would never bear puppies because of her narrow uterus. She was born on November 5, 1985.\n* '''[[Cotton Hill|Col. Cotton Lyndal Hill]]''' (voiced by [[Toby Huss]]) \u2013 Hank's cantankerous father, Peggy's father-in-law and Bobby's grandfather. He has a hair-trigger temper. Despite his many shortcomings, he occasionally showed a softer side, for example in the episode \"Cotton's Plot\" where he helped Peggy learn to walk again after her parachuting accident. His shins were blown off in [[World War II]] by a \"Japan man's machine gun\" and his feet were reattached to his knees, resulting in a short height and stilted gait. Despite his disability, he eventually reached the rank of [[colonel]] in the [[State Defense Forces|state militia]]. After Cotton and his first wife Tilly, Hank's mother, divorced, he married a much younger, soft-spoken, busty blonde [[Hospital volunteer|candy striper]] named Didi who gave birth to his youngest son \"G.H.\" (\"Good Hank\"). He was immensely proud of his military service. Though his claim of fighting \"[[Nazism|nazzies]]\" (Nazis) was proven false and his claim of killing \"fitty [fifty] men\" was dubious, his participation in several of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific Theater was confirmed and his uniform was shown to be decorated with the [[Medal of Honor]] and the [[Purple Heart]]. Cotton himself died in episode #1218, \"Death Picks Cotton\", after suffering severe burns and an allergic reaction to shrimp during a flashback at a Japanese restaurant. Instead of addressing Peggy by her name he calls her \"Hank's wife\".\n* '''Didi Hill''' (voiced by [[Ashley Gardner]]) \u2013 Didi is Cotton's second wife, Hank's stepmother, Peggy's stepmother-in-law and Bobby's stepgrandmother she's a [[Hospital volunteer|candy striper]] after she retired from being an exotic dancer. She has breast implants and suffers from [[postpartum depression]] following the birth of Cotton's third son \"G.H.\" She is generally depicted as docile and ditzy, although she is a certified optometry assistant. She was absent at the time of Cotton's death and was only seen once more, where she says she is engaged and will remarry a wealthy professional wrestler. Didi was in the same Kindergarten class as Hank, putting her birthdate in 1954 (specifically December 17).\n* '''Good Hank Jeffrey \"G.H.\" Hill''' \u2013 G.H. is Cotton's and Didi's infant son, and the younger of Hank's two half-brothers. G.H. is an abbreviation for \"Good Hank,\" implying that the original Hank was unsatisfactory to his father. Cotton treats G.H. much better than Hank presumably because Cotton sees him as being his second chance of being a better father than he was for Hank. G.H. was key at a time when Hank had to convince Cotton not to end his life as well as to permit Hank to give his father money for the baby's sake (and as payback for the years Cotton raised him). G.H. was absent at the time of his father's death, and is not seen throughout the rest of the series, although it is presumed he is living with his mother and stepfather.\n* '''Matilda \"Tilly\" Mae Garrison (formerly Hill)''' (voiced by [[Tammy Wynette]] in 1997\u20131998, [[Beth Grant]] in 1999, and [[K Callan]] in 2000\u20132009) \u2013 Tilly is Cotton's first wife, Hank's mother, Peggy's mother-in-law and Bobby's grandmother. She divorced Cotton after suffering years of verbal abuse. Tilly is a kind woman who collects miniatures because they made her happy during Cotton's abuse. Hank is often over-protective of her, fearing she is too old and fragile to go out and do things on her own. Tilly lives in Arizona with her husband Chuck. Tilly's legal name varies during the series. She is listed as \"Tilly\" on Hank's birth certificate, but is addressed as Matilda by the clergyman during her wedding to Gary.\n* '''Elroy \"Lucky\" Kleinschmidt''' (voiced by [[Tom Petty]]) \u2013 Lucky is Luanne's itinerant, but generally benign redneck husband, and is the father of Luanne's child. It's often hard for Lucky to hold down a job (he has no credit or [[Social Security number]]). He lives on the remainder of the $53,000 \"[[Financial compensation|settlement monies]]\" he received after \"slipping on pee-pee at the [[Costco]]\" having had a portion of his spine fused. He was nicknamed \"Lucky\" after the settlement windfall. After he spent a majority of his money customizing his truck, his finances dwindled down to nine thousand dollars but regained another $53,000 when an [[ambulance chasing]] lawyer paid off Lucky to avoid a lawsuit. Peggy tried very hard to break him and Luanne apart, but after Luanne's pregnancy was revealed, she and Hank reconciled the two, giving them a [[shotgun wedding]] at Lucky's request. He is also one of the guitarists for John Redcorn's band \"Big Mountain Fudgecake\". Although dimwitted in some aspects, Lucky has learned some facets such as basic math through life experience as opposed to formal education, and was astute enough to deduce that his father-in-law spent time in prison whereas Luanne believed the story that he works on an oil rig. He yearned to receive his GED but only to prove he was good enough to marry Luanne. He was born July 10, 1967.\n* '''Gracie Margaret Kleinschmidt''' \u2013 Daughter of Lucky and Luanne. She was born in the [[List of King of the Hill episodes#Season 13|season 13]] episode \"Lucky See, Monkey Do\". Luanne originally wanted to name her Lasagna (stating that [[Lasagne|lasagna]] was their favorite food) while under the influence of hospital analgesics, but choosing a more conventional name after she had recovered.\n* '''Myrna Kleinschmidt''' (voiced by [[Paget Brewster]]) \u2013 Myrna is Lucky's sister, Luanne's sister-in-law, Gracie's aunt and the main antagonist in \"[[Lucky See, Monkey Do]]\". She is an intelligent, modern mother who only appears in the episode \"Lucky See, Monkey Do\". She has two children, one son and one daughter (Gracie's paternal first cousins) and raises them in [[Strict father model|strict accordance]] with [[contemporary]] [[parenting practices]], something which leads her into a rivalry with Peggy, whose parenting skills are from older schools of thought, over how to assist Luanne as her pregnancy due date approaches. When Luanne goes into labor, Myrna commandeers the situation and insists that Luanne have a natural, drug-free [[water birth]], but under Hank's encouragement to think for themselves about how to raise their child, Luanne and Lucky opt for a hospital birth instead.\n* '''Leanne Platter''' (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 Leanne, Luanne's violent alcoholic mother, Gracie's grandmother, Bobby's aunt and Lucky's mother-in-law she was imprisoned for \"second-degree assaulting\" her husband in the back with a fork. Though she is often mentioned during the course of the series, she appears only in the episode \"Leanne's Saga,\" visiting Luanne in Arlen after her release from prison and briefly being courted by Bill Dauterive.\n* '''Hoyt Platter''' (voiced by [[Johnny Knoxville]]) \u2013 Hoyt is Luanne's father, Peggy's twin brother, Hank's brother-in-law, Bobby's uncle, Lucky's father-in-law, Gracie's grandfather and Leanne's ex-husband. Despite Luanne's beliefs, he never worked on an [[Oil platform|oil rig]], but was in jail for most of Luanne's life, with the oil rig story acting as a cover so Luanne wouldn't know her father was a convict. He appears in only one episode: \"Life: A Loser's Manual\". After being released from jail, Hoyt commits a robbery and tricks Lucky into taking the blame, but he eventually confesses and is sentenced to life in prison under a [[three-strikes law]]. The episode \"Leanne's Saga\" reveals that Hoyt was planning on marrying a pharmacist girl before Leanne, then working as a stripper, entertained at his bachelor party.\n* '''Maddy Platter''' (voiced by [[Joanna Gleason]]) \u2013 Maddy Platter is Peggy's and Hoyt's mother, Hank's mother-in-law and Bobby's and Luanne's grandmother. Mother Platter lives in [[Montana]] with her son Hoyt. She's an old-fashioned, tough-as-nails rancher type and loathes Peggy for deserting the family ranch and not marrying a local neighbor boy. Strangely, earlier episode flashbacks feature a totally different \"Peggy's mother\" character, who is essentially an older version of Peggy\u2014it's not made clear if one is her real mother and one is her stepmother, or if the \"Maddy\" mother character [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] the older version completely.\n* '''Doc Platter''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Doc is Peggy's and Hoyt's father, Hank's father-in-law and Bobby's and Luanne's grandfather. He makes only a single major appearance when Peggy, Bobby and Hank visit the family ranch. He seems to be going somewhat senile and preachy, only talking in rural old-west metaphors which Hank interprets as old-fashion Western-style wisdom.\n* '''Junichiro''' (voiced by [[David Carradine]]) \u2013 Junichiro is Hank's elder half-brother, Peggy's half-brother-in-law and Bobby's half-uncle who has lived in [[Japan]] all his life. Junichiro is Cotton's son with a Japanese nurse, Michiko, from an affair in Japan during World War II. Hank and Junichiro share many similarities in appearance and mannerisms (this in spite of the fact that Hank actually shares more of his mother's features); one of these is that when he is shocked, like Hank, he yells \"BWAH!\" Like Hank, Junichiro also has a narrow [[urethra]] and is an assistant manager at the company for which he works, making robots and robot accessories. At first, he renounces the Hill blood in him. But eventually calls Cotton \"Father\".\n* '''[[Dusty Hill]]''' (Himself) \u2013 The bassist/vocalist for the band [[ZZ Top]] and Hank's cousin. In the episode \"[[Hank Gets Dusted]],\" Cotton gives his prized [[Cadillac]] to Dusty without allowing Hank a chance to buy it. Dusty enters the car in a [[demolition derby]] in which it is badly damaged. Hank and Dusty make their peace after Dusty has the car repaired and installed at the [[Cadillac Ranch]].\n\n==Other Gribbles==\n* '''Nancy Hicks-Gribble''' (voiced by [[Ashley Gardner]]) \u2013 Nancy (''n\u00e9e'' Hicks) is Dale's wife, Joseph's mother and weather-girl-turned-anchor for local news station Channel 84. She had a fourteen-year affair with John Redcorn, which produced her son, Joseph, although the affair ended when John Redcorn befriends Dale. Nancy finally becomes a faithful wife to Dale. Nancy refused to come back to her out of respect for Dale. Her mother Bunny was similarly unfaithful to Nancy's father, but did not reveal her own long-term affair until Nancy began suffering from stress-induced hair loss over her unresolved feelings for John Redcorn. Nancy is a former beauty queen, a fact which helped her get her job as a news weather-girl. She was born April 7, 1955.\n* '''Joseph John Gribble''' (voiced by [[Brittany Murphy]] in 1997\u20132000, [[Breckin Meyer]] in 2000\u20132009) \u2013 Dale and Nancy's 13-year-old son and one of Bobby's best friends. Despite Joseph's obvious Native American features, his similarity in appearance to John Redcorn, and the fact that his middle name is \"John,\" neither he nor Dale is aware that Redcorn is his biological father (Nancy refers to Dale having a \"Jamaican grandmother\" to explain Joseph's dark complexion). Redcorn's occasional and awkward attempts to get closer to Joseph (against Nancy's wishes) lead Joseph to regard him as strange and creepy. Joseph starts out as an ordinary teen, but eventually grows weird and creepy\u2014not to mention dim-witted. Joseph begins to take after Dale more than John, Nancy or even any of his friends. Joseph has a half-sister named Kate (by John Redcorn having another affair), who is very similar to Joseph in personality and interests but likewise does not realize that Redcorn is their father. Joseph is the only character of the series shown to physically mature, having grown six inches in height over the course of a summer, a more built physique, athletic prowess and having a deeper voice and a wispy mustache upon his reappearance. He was born September 29, 1986.\n* '''Bug Gribble''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Bug is Dale's father, Nancy's father-in-law and Joseph's grandfather, who had been estranged from Dale for many years for kissing Nancy at her and Dale's wedding reception. Bug is actually [[gay]] and had been flirting with a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[caterer]] instead, and, upon sensing Dale's imminent entry into the room, attempted to hide his orientation from his son by grabbing and kissing 'the nearest thing in a dress'. This misunderstanding, and Bug's inability to reveal his true sexuality to Dale, resulted in their estrangement. When Dale and Nancy renew their wedding vows 20 years afterward, Nancy arranges to invite Bug, and Dale initially suspects his odd behavior and his having a \"partner\" of meaning that Bug is an undercover government agent, but finally accepts the truth upon seeing Bug and his partner share a devoted kiss. Bug's appearance in \"[[My Own Private Rodeo]]\" retcons his appearance in earlier episodes, where he bears a near-identicality to present-day Dale.\n\n==Other Dauterives==\n* '''Gilbert Fontaine Dauterive''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Gilbert (pronounced \"zhil-BEAR\") is Bill's cousin. Though at one point shown to live on the family estate with his aunt and cousin in a [[Louisiana]] [[bayou]] in \"A Beer Can Named Desire\", he and Bill eventually wind up as the last two living Dauterives. It is strongly implied that he is [[homosexuality|gay]], and he even hits on Buck Strickland when Buck attempts to capitalize on the Dauterive family's traditional barbecue sauce recipe in \"[[Blood and Sauce]]\".\n* '''Esm\u00e9 Dauterive''' (voiced by [[Meryl Streep]]) \u2013 Esm\u00e9 was Bill and Gilbert's aunt, and [[matriarch]] of the Dauterive clan. She expressed deep concern over the family's ever-shrinking headcount, lamenting that \"the Dauterive blood is down to a trickle\". She happily received Bill upon his return for a visit and was not displeased to see him and his cousins' widows taking mutual interest. She is only seen in \"A Beer Can Named Desire\"; it is later revealed that she had died after a fever.\n* '''Violetta Dauterive''' (voiced by [[Natalie Maines]]) \u2013 Violetta was Bill and Gilbert's cousin. She lived on the family estate in Louisiana with Esm\u00e9, Gilbert, and Rose and Lily, the widows of two other Dauterive cousins. Upon Bill's visit she, Rose, and Lily, all having been without male companionship for too long, vied for Bill's affections and attempted to seduce him, even despite Violetta's own blood relation to him. Like Esm\u00e9, she is only seen in \"A Beer Can Named Desire\"; it is later revealed that she had died in her sleep.\n* '''Lenore Dauterive''' (voiced by [[Ellen Barkin]]) \u2013 Lenore is Bill's [[mean]]-spirited ex-wife. She is mentioned frequently throughout the course of the series, but only appears twice \u2013 once being when Bill and Bobby watch Bill's wedding video. She appears when Bill begins dating former Texas Governor [[Ann Richards]] to meddle with their relationship in \"[[Hank and the Great Glass Elevator]]\", but with help from Richards, Bill is finally able to tell her off and move past her toxic influence.\n* '''Eric Dauterive''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Bill's implicitly-deceased father, who was said to be an [[abusive]] man and a heavy drinker, and is largely responsible for Bill's [[emotional instability]]. Among the abuses Bill recalls from his father are having been spanked every day between the ages of 9 and 16, being called a girl and made to wear \"pretty, pretty dresses\", and being locked in a [[Hutch (animal cage)|rabbit hutch]].\n\n==Other Boomhauers==\n* '''Patch Boomhauer''' (voiced by [[Brad Pitt]]) \u2013 Patch is Boomhauer's sleazy, womanizing younger brother. He appears in \"[[Patch Boomhauer]]\", apparently engaged to marry Boomhauer's old flame, Katherine\u2014much to Boomhauer's mounting displeasure, as he himself has unresolved feelings for Katherine, and Patch's continued philandering angers him for her sake. The wedding is later called off after Patch hires strippers for his bachelor party and frames Boomhauer for trying to break up the engagement. Patch makes a final cameo in \"[[Lucky's Wedding Suit]]\" as one of the guests at Luanne and Lucky's wedding. Patch, like Boomhauer, speaks in a fast-paced Southern gibberish.\n* '''Dr. and Mrs. Boomhauer''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]]) \u2013 Boomhauer's parents. Mrs. Boomhauer is shown to speak like Boomhauer in \"Peggy's Turtle Song\". In \"Three Coaches and a Bobby\", Boomhauer mentions that his parents had won the lottery and moved to Florida.\n* '''\"Mee-Maw\" Boomhauer''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]]) \u2013 Boomhauer's elderly grandmother. She is seen in \"Dang Ol' Love\", when Boomhauer, infatuated with Marlene, goes to Mee-Maw to ask for a family-heirloom wedding ring as well as \"[[Lucky's Wedding Suit]]\", where she is seen sitting with the other guests as well as dancing with Patch for a brief moment. Mee-Maw speaks in the same characteristic gibberish that the rest of the Boomhauers share.\n\n==Souphanousinphones==\n* '''Kohng Koy \"Kahn\" Souphanousinphone''' (voiced by [[Toby Huss]]) \u2013 Kahn is Hank's [[materialistic]], [[Lao people|Laotian]] next-door neighbor, Minh's husband, Connie's father and main antagonist. He believes he's better than his neighbors, often referring to them as \"[[hillbillies]]\" or \"[[redneck]]s\" (despite evidence to the contrary). He frequently boasts of his superiority to the others and dreams of being far more successful than Ted Wassanasong. Despite his arrogant attitude, Kahn seeks approval and friendship from his down-to-earth neighbors, who are accepting and tolerant of his ways. He previously worked for a defense contractor that manufactured composite ceramic armor, but was fired for spilling company secrets. After a string of job failures (due to his attitude) he found a new job forcing him to commute. Upon recollection of the story of how Minh and Kahn met, it is revealed that he was a former rebel and playboy whom Minh chose over the straight-laced intellectual her father set her up with. In one episode, Kahn shows that he is a trained [[martial artist]] while getting into a fight with a few [[rednecks]]. In the episode \"Just Another Manic Kahn-Day\", it is revealed that Kahn has [[bipolar disorder]] (which was also mentioned in the earlier episode \"Lost in Myspace\"). It is revealed in the episode \"Three Days of the Kahndo\" that Kahn has a brother also living in the US with a family of his own. He was born September 15, 1958.\n* '''Minh Souphanousinphone''' (voiced by [[Lauren Tom]]) \u2013 Kahn's wife and Connie's mother. Minh is a [[housewife]] who enjoys making rude comments about the neighbors, particularly Peggy. She sometimes has a snobbish attitude toward the neighbors, literally also referring to them as \"[[hillbillies]]\" or \"[[redneck]]s\" or \"dumb monkeys\" (despite evidence to the contrary). But is overall a more understanding parent and better neighbor/parent than Kahn. She is a crack-shot, with championship-level skills, and at one point joined Dale's gun club, exerting a positive effect on its members. She is highly competitive, going so far as to cheat on ''The New York Times'' crossword puzzle. Like her husband, Minh grew up in Laos, where her father was a powerful general in the army who was not happy with her decision to marry Kahn. She once told Nancy Gribble that she didn't grow up oppressed, rather because of her father's high ranking position in the army, she \"was peasants' worse nightmare\", pointing to being a bully in her youth. She once taught Bobby some of the [[Laotian language]]. She was born November 11, 1960.\n* '''Kahn \"Connie\"  Souphanousinphone Junior''' (voiced by [[Lauren Tom]]) \u2013 Connie is the American-born daughter of Kahn and Minh. She is one of Bobby's best friends and for a time his girlfriend. She is a violin player, \"A\" student, and general overachiever pressured by her mother and father, who hold her to very high standards. Though it is implied that she works hard because of her overbearing parents, in reality, she does it for herself. Connie is named after her ego-maniacal father because he wanted a son. She was born September 1, 1986.\n* '''Doggie Kahn''' \u2013 Doggie Kahn (often referred to simply as \"Doggie\") is their [[West Highland White Terrier]].\n* '''Tid Pao Souphanousinphone''' (voiced by [[Lucy Liu]]) \u2013 Tid Pao is Connie's criminally-inclined cousin and Kahn and Minh's niece from [[Los Angeles]] and the main antagonist in \"Bad Girls, Bad Girls, Whatcha Gonna Do\", who was sent to stay at Kahn's for a semester because she stole drugs from a street gang. She attended [[Tom Landry Middle School]] in the meantime. She seduced Bobby and tricked him into creating a [[meth lab]] by pretending to help him with building a candy machine for his group science project, and persuaded him to steal [[propane]] tanks from Strickland Propane to complete it. Tid Pao was caught by Connie and she was sent away by Kahn to [[Wisconsin]] to work on her last uncle's dairy farm at the end of the episode because of her criminally-inclined nature. There her uncle told her she was on her last chance as he was the last relative left in America. Any more trouble would see her shipped off to live with her grandmother in Laos.\n* '''Laoma Souphanousinphone''' (voiced by [[Amy Hill]]) \u2013 Laoma is Kahn's mother, Minh's mother-in-law and Connie's grandmother she's the only person on the show who addresses him by his full name. She's kind and hardworking and enjoys [[housekeeping]]. She is disliked by Minh because of her criticism of Minh's housework skills. The status-conscious Kahn is horrified when Laoma, bored and unwanted by her daughter-in-law, becomes the Hills' housekeeper, and even more horrified when she begins a love affair with Bill Dauterive. Laoma has not been seen since her first episode (with only a mention of her being made in its succeeding episode), mainly because the creators nixed the original plan for her and Bill to become a regular couple, preferring for Bill to remain his usual single and miserable self.\n* '''General Gum''' (voiced by [[James Sie]]) \u2013 Usually referred to as \"The General,\" (his full name is '''Gum Nga Hexumalayasabrath''') he appeared only in the episodes \"Pour Some Sugar on Kahn\" (in which he visits the family) and \"Father of the Bribe\" (in which Minh recalls her courtship by Kahn). While shows great affection towards Minh and Connie, he dislikes Kahn. He served under several Laotian dictators and was put on trial for war crimes at [[The Hague]].\n\n==Strickland Propane==\n* '''Buck Strickland''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Buck is the slightly [[overweight]], balding, over-the-hill owner of [[Strickland Propane]], and Hank's boss. His physical appearance and attitude greatly resembles [[Lyndon Johnson]], particularly his hairline, and he has a habit of hosting employee discussions in his [[bathroom]]\u2014a habit of Johnson. A picture of Buck seen in \"Pregnant Paws\" also shows him picking up one of his bloodhounds by the ears, much like a similar famous photograph of Johnson doing the same. Originally hailing from [[Arkansas]], Buck was historically known for his modest start in business and general business smarts. These attributes have since been worn away by life and been replaced with many habits which often come in the way of his business decisions. Buck is a compulsive gambler to the point where he will use company profits to continue gaming, even betting in underground events. Also like LBJ, Buck is a chauvinist, alcoholic, and adulterer. It is often implied that Hank reveres Buck and that, in Hank's eyes, the two have a close relationship. Compared to Hank who is the ultimate model of a good employee, Buck's vices require Hank to keep an extremely close eye. Buck refers to Hank as his \"[[Golden Goose]]\" implying Hank is the only reason his business remains afloat and thus he would never fire him. Hank has used the threat of quitting to capitulate Buck's transition from things Hank found unsavory. His health is questionable as he has suffered numerous [[infarction]]s and has had several cardiovascular surgeries including valve replacements. Despite his less than desirable traits, he has an ethical side although he planted evidence on Hank for [[murder]] rather than let his wife be arrested.\n* '''Joe Jack''' (voiced by [[Toby Huss]]) \u2013 Joe Jack is a fuel-truck driver and co-worker with Hank at Strickland Propane. He has a drinking and gambling problem, as seen when he is a member of the Propaniacs. Joe Jack has a habit of calling people he speaks to \"honey\", regardless of their gender or level of familiarity with him.\n* '''Enrique''' (voiced by [[Eloy Casados]] from 1997\u20131998, [[Danny Trejo]] from 2002\u20132009) \u2013 Enrique is a good-natured Mexican-American truck driver at Strickland Propane. Originally he spoke with a very weak accent. In the episode \"[[Enrique-cilable Differences]],\" Enrique forcibly befriends Hank after a nasty fight with his wife. Enrique ends up moving in with the Hills for a short time eventually developing a pathological attachment to the Hill family, but quickly patches things up with his wife after a fed-up Hank kicks him out. Enrique nearly lost his house due to rent increases when property values in his neighborhood skyrocket when Peggy began selling working class housing to upper-middle class [[Snake People]]. To solve the problem, Peggy helped the neighborhood value decline when she fabricated the area as uncool by making it appear as if typical middle-class families were moving in prompting the snake people to leave. Afterwards he applied and became a homeowner. While a hard worker, he has poor fiscal habits, often spending money on lavish outdoor parties to celebrate any seemingly significant event such as his daughter's [[Quincea\u00f1era]] or becoming a homeowner.\n* '''Donna''' (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 There are actually two separate Donnas who have both worked as Strickland accountants, and are often referred to as \"Donna from Accounting\". The first Donna appears, albeit infrequently, as an overweight, dark-skinned woman, most notably in \"[[Meet the Propaniacs]]\". In \"[[Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret Hill]]\", Buck mentions having discovered stolen office supplies in her bedroom (presumably during an extramarital encounter), and orders Hank to \"find us a new Donna\". The \"new Donna\" is a tall, curvy white woman who first appears in \"[[The Miseducation of Bobby Hill]]\". In \"[[24 Hour Propane People]]\" she mentions a husband; in \"[[You Gotta Believe (In Moderation)]]\", Dale notes her \"recent divorce\". In \"[[Lost in MySpace]]\", her most significant episode, she is briefly promoted to assistant manager alongside Hank, which didn't settle in well with him. She often uses MySpace during work hours and ignored Hank when he asked her for a down to business approach. In turn, Donna is briefly fired when some of her MySpace friends mistook Buck for Hank and brutally beat him up. She sought revenge against Hank by making rude comments about him and Strickland. After sifting through the blogs, he confronts Donna for her behavior at Goobersmooches and eventually makes amends with her. After being rehired as an accountant, Donna takes down the blogs and rearranges it to a down to business approach like Hank wanted.\n* '''Roger \"Buddha\" Sack''' (voiced by [[Chris Rock]] in the first appearance, [[Phil LaMarr]] in later appearances) \u2013 He first appeared in \"Traffic Jam\" as a comedian and traffic school instructor. Despite having a rising TV career some years prior, his career stalled following an unfortunate encounter with [[Moesha]]. His abrasive and insulting style of humor infuriates Hank, as well as the dean of the traffic school, who terminates his employment at the traffic school for not teaching traffic safety as he was hired to do. Hank later gets Roger a job at Strickland Propane. Grateful to Hank for saving him from unemployment, Roger's attitude mellows afterward.\n* '''Elizabeth \"Miz Liz\" Strickland''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Turner]]) \u2013 Elizabeth is the deep-voiced, long suffering wife of Buck Strickland, first seen in \"[[Hanky Panky (King of the Hill)|Hanky Panky]]\". In \"Hanky Panky\", the first half of a two-part episode, Miz Liz confronts Buck at an awards dinner while he is there with his mistress. She files for divorce from Buck and subsequently takes control of Strickland Propane. This forces Buck to move in with Debbie. She promotes Hank to manager and attempts to seduce Hank in a propane-powered hot tub. However, the interest was not reciprocated. She brags to Buck about this, Buck, in turn, surprises Hank with a loaded shotgun expressing his jealousy. She and Buck reconcile in the second half \"[[High Anxiety (King of the Hill)|High Anxiety]]\", but later on, in \"[[The Good Buck]]\", Buck claims that Miz Liz has left for good, stating that \"she could handle my drinkin' binges, and my gamblin', and even turn a blind eye to my extramarital escapades, but not when they happen all once! ...and on her birthday!\"\n* '''Debbie Grund''' (voiced by [[Reese Witherspoon]]) \u2013 Debbie was an employee of Strickland Propane and was Buck Strickland's [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] and the main antagonist in the episode \"Hanky Panky\". As revenge for Buck ending their relationship, she plotted to murder Buck and his wife, but accidentally killed herself with Buck's shotgun while attempting to climb into the dumpster she was using as a hiding place.\n\n==Tom Landry Middle School==\n* '''Carl Moss''' (voiced by [[Dennis Burkley]]) \u2013 Carl is the [[school principal|principal]] of Tom Landry Middle School. Moss is one of Hank's high school classmates; he played [[center (football)|center]] for their [[American football|football]] team. His primary concerns are tight budgets, maintaining discipline and the schools zero tolerance policy for \"everything\". He tends to follow procedure to avoid trouble, even when it conflicts with his friendship with Hank. A highly changed person, Hank will often remind Carl of how he used to be and insinuate that Carl sold out for a position of power. He frequently rejects staff demands for better teaching aids, citing budget cuts; he once referred to wood being used in shop class as a \"fancy teaching aid\". Often the center of various scandals at the school, he permitted installation of soda dispensing vending machines solely for raising funds for staff vacations and purposely placed lazy students into [[special education]] classes to avoid state-mandated exams (whose grades would heavily affect school funding). Once, when one of Dale's plots to get rid of Moss came to nothing before they got started, Bill mentioned that Moss couldn't hide behind inflated test scores forever.\n* '''Coach Kleehammer''' (voiced by [[Toby Huss]]) \u2013 Coach Kleehammer is the football coach at Tom Landry Middle School. He has a difficult time relating to things outside of football and often uses football-related expressions in everyday speech. Kleehammer is portrayed as being sexist, having displayed a very negative attitude towards women's sports. \n*'''Stuart Dooley''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]]) \u2013 Often referred to by his surname, he is Bobby's deep-voiced, laconic classmate. He always sardonically intones something obvious after witnessing an event (for example, to Bobby after witnessing Mega Lo Mart exploding, \"Your Dad got blown up.\"). He also is something of a rebel \u2014 he pulled down Peggy's pants, and he is seen smoking. His style of speech is similar to [[Butt-Head]] from Mike Judge's previous show, ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', albeit without Butt-Head's trademark laughter.\n* '''Clark Peters''' (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 The [[overweight]] bully at Tom Landry Middle School. He has a [[blond]] [[ponytail]] and speaks as though he has a perpetual head cold (Minh once referred to him as \"that creepy booger-nosed kid\"). He often targets Bobby and sometimes forces him to do homework for him.\n* '''Randy Miller''' (voiced by Cheryl Holliday in 1997\u20131999, [[David Herman]] in 2000\u20132009) \u2013 Randy is the quintessential \"nerd\" who loves to tattle on people and then see them being punished. Bobby, Connie, and Joseph do not like him very much, though Bobby once stopped Dooley from beating him up. He is very proud of his father being a successful patent lawyer. Although once a somewhat prominent character, he largely vanished after the fifth season. \n* '''Chane Wassonasong''' (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 Chane is a smart but obnoxious and rude classmate of Bobby and Connie. Connie's parents are constantly trying to fix her up with Chane, also Laotian-American, as they see him as a very preferable alternative to Bobby (and because Chane is the son of prominent Laotian-American Ted Wassonasong, with whom they are constantly trying to curry favor)\n* '''Emily''' (voiced by [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]]) \u2013 She is a sixth grade blonde pony-tailed hall monitor who takes her position quite seriously.

Joseph once dated her, having made out in closets throughout the school on several occasions. Very late into the series, Lori insisted that she and Joseph go \"all the way\" in their relationship, but Joseph broke up with her before it could happen.*\n* '''Eugene Grandy''' (voiced by [[John Ritter]])--Music Teacher seen in four episodes.  Stressed for Success (2004) - Witches of East Arlen (2003)- What Makes Bobby Run?(2000) - The Son That Got Away (1997)\n\n==Arlen VFW==\n* '''Sgt. \"Topsy\" Toppington''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Toppington (nearly always referred to as \"Topsy\") is an old wartime buddy of Cotton Hill. He often acts as an accomplice to Cotton's schemes. He could inflate his cheeks in a manner similar to [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and according to Cotton, he was legally blind and had to have all his teeth pulled out because they were badly decayed. In \"[[Death Buys a Timeshare]],\" his death is confirmed as Cotton is left his [[Estate (law)|estate]]. Topsy was apparently cremated and his remains flushed down a toilet once used by General [[George S. Patton]], as his name can be seen along with all of Cotton's war buddies above the toilet.\n* '''Stinkey''' (voiced by [[Edward Asner]]) \u2013 Stinkey is one of Cotton Hill's wartime friends who was overweight and had suffered from diabetes, he died at some point later in the series as it is mentioned by Cotton and his name is among the veterans' ashes flushed down the toilet that General Patton used. Cotton spoke his name as he lay dying in the VA hospital.\n* '''Irwin Linker''' (voiced by [[Jack Carter (comedian)|Jack Carter]]) \u2013 Irwin is one of Cotton Hill's wartime friends who is often seen with an oxygen tank. He was one of the few to not be named Stinky, Fatty, or [[Brooklyn]].\n* '''Ted \"Pops\" Popazito''' (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) \u2013 One of Cotton's war buddies who lived next to Bill for eighteen years. He often criticized Hank and his friends for using modern tools for housework. In \"Movin' On Up,\" he died of a heart attack on his lawn mower and his house was rented by Luanne and some college friends.\n\n==Other recurring characters==\n* '''[[John Redcorn]]''' (voiced by [[Victor Aaron]] in 1997, [[Jonathan Joss]] in 1998\u20132009) \u2013 John is Nancy's [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|Native American]] former \"healer\" and adulterous lover, and the biological father of Joseph. He is a former roadie for [[Winger (band)|Winger]] and lead singer of Big Mountain Fudgecake. In Season 9, he began writing and performing his own children's music. He works out of his trailer as a masseur, though his clients are generally only women. It is implied that he has a history of having sex with them, as Hank is horrified when Peggy goes to see him, and John Redcorn even states to him, \"Hank, I consider you a friend. I would never heal your wife the way I heal the wives of others.\" He is also active in American Indian rights campaigns, and Dale once helped him with a lawsuit that netted him twelve acres of land from the Federal government. However he was manipulated into building a [[Indian gaming|casino]] on the property which was later found to be prohibited in Texas whose tribes forfeit gaming rights for federal recognition and his property was permitted for hazardous dumping to pay the debt. Because Dale had been so helpful, Redcorn felt extremely guilty over what he did with Nancy, and ended his affair by encouraging Nancy and Dale to strengthen their marriage. Dale re-tailored Redcorn's status as a musician from a mediocre rock singer to a successful children's performer. He eventually got back together with an ex-lover and became a dedicated husband and father to the children he had with her.\n* '''Ted Wassonasong and Cindy Wassonasong''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]] and [[Lauren Tom]] respectively) \u2013 Ted and Cindy are affluent Laotian-American acquaintances of the Souphanousinphones. Kahn and Minh envy and resent them, but go to great lengths to gain their favor, such as inviting them over for dinner. They live in the upscale, gated community of Arlen Heights, and are prominent members of Nine Rivers Country Club. Ted and Cindy tolerate the Souphanousinphones but, in reality, look down upon them. They joined the Episcopal Church despite being Buddhist because it was \"good for business.\" Ted is also blatantly hypocritical. He referred to Kahn as a \"Banana\" (an ethnic slur to identify an Asian American apparently lost in touch with their ethnic identity; more comfortable with Western society) even though Ted possesses far greater degree of luxury commodities, and lost most of his accent. He also helped pass a city ordinance banning the use of [[trans fats]] only to be immediately found consuming the very foods he helped prohibit.\n* '''Octavio''' (voiced by [[Danny Trejo]] in \"Hank's Back\", [[Mike Judge]] in later appearances) \u2013 Octavio is a Hispanic [[quasi]]-[[mercenary]] who does various bizarre favors for Dale when paid enough money, such as breaking into the Hill's home in the middle of the night to look for Dale's kidney (earlier in the episode, Hank, who was legally Dale for three days while Dale was in hospital to give his kidney to [[NHRA]] drag racer [[John Force]], was forced to help Octavio bash his own car with [[rebar]] to try and claim motor accident insurance, a scheme he had cook up with Dale). On his chest is a large [[Rob Zombie]] tattoo which he once tried to pass off as a tattoo of Jesus in order to join Luanne's Bible study group because she was conducting lessons in her pool while wearing a two piece bikini. His appearance was modelled after actor [[Danny Trejo]] (who actually voices [[List of King of the Hill characters#Strickland Propane|Enrique]] on the show and Octavio as well). His last appearance was a non-speaking cameo in ''Just Another Manic-Kahn Day''.\n* '''M.F. (Milton Farnsworth) Thatherton''' (voiced by [[Burt Reynolds]] in the first appearance, [[Toby Huss]] in later appearances) \u2013 M.F. is a former employee of Strickland Propane and another antagonist who strikes out on his own and opens up the crooked Thatherton Fuels company across the street from Strickland. He dresses like an old school rich cowboy with a ten-gallon hat and cowboy boots. An untrustworthy type, Thatherton is a sometime [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Hank Hill and/or Buck. His sins are similar to Buck Strickland's (womanizing, gambling, using people), but more pronounced. Thatherton openly considers customers as little more than moneymakers and hires centerfold models or [[Hooters]] girls to bait potential propane customers. Hank, who also despises him, was forced to work for Thatherton for a week due to Buck losing at a game of cards. Whenever his name is mentioned, any of the Hills remark angrily, \"Thatherton!\"\n* '''Reverend Thomason''' (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) \u2013 A minister at Arlen First Methodist Church. He was replaced by Reverend Karen Stroup upon retiring to start an online ministry.\n* '''Reverend Karen Stroup''' (voiced by [[Mary Tyler Moore]] in 1999, [[Ashley Gardner]] in 2000\u20132010) \u2013 The first female minister of Arlen First Methodist Church. She is originally from [[Minnesota]], but is assigned to Arlen after Reverend Thomason left to start an online ministry. She and Bill finally become a couple, yet he broke up with her when she moved in and it felt like everything was moving too fast. The congregation also objected to the relationship. She didn't take it well but there has been no talk about their relationship since that episode.\n* '''Jimmy Whichard''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Jimmy is the town imbecile, and the main antagonist in \"Life in the Fast Lane - Bobby's Saga\". He has had several jobs, including concession manager at the racetrack and [[outsider artist]]. Dale notes that he may have given himself brain damage from staring into the sun for too long, although \"he can't have been too bright to do it in the first place.\" When Peggy was scammed by an internet test that \"proved\" she was a genius, she only believed it to be a scam upon learning that Jimmy was also proclaimed a genius.\n* '''[[Chuck Mangione]]''' (voiced by Himself) \u2013 Chuck is a famous jazz trumpeter and flugelhorn player, and his hit song \"Feels So Good\" is played frequently on the show. He shamelessly promotes Mega-Lo Mart until he grows tired of going to every new store opening (he told Dale that he didn't read the contract properly, stating that Mega-Lo Mart opened 400 new stores per year and it left him no time to tour, record or be with his family). This forced him to disappear where Dale discovers he has become a hermit, living within the Arlen Mega-Lo Mart in a \"Toilet Paper Castle\" and stealing stocked items at night when the store is closed. When he tells Dale that he disappeared to \"stick it to the man\", Dale decides to keep his secret and Mangione goes on living in the store undetected.\n* '''Monsignor Martinez''' (voiced by [[Mike Judge]]) \u2013 The Monsignor is the gun-toting priest hero of the fictional [[TV series]] ''Los Dias y Las Noches de Monsignor Martinez,'' a favorite of many of the principal characters. Clips of his program are often inserted into episodes as part of a running gag. In one of the episodes, Hank mentions that Martinez is an undercover cop. The clips of his episodes which appear on the series usually feature him just about to kill one of his nemeses while solemnly uttering his catchphrase, \"''Vaya con Dios\"; ''often preceding a melodramatic explosion. In the 8th-season episode \"Flirting with the Master,\" the actor who plays Martinez invites Peggy to Mexico City to tutor his children, and she mistakes his interest for romantic passion. A live-action pilot was filmed featuring the character, but never aired because FOX didn't think it would have been a good idea to have a show about a Catholic priest shooting people.\n* '''Lane Pratley''' (voiced by [[Dwight Yoakam]] in the first appearance, [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] in later appearances) \u2013 Lane is a sleazy car dealer who owns \"Pratley [[Ford]]\" and \"Pratley [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]],\" and as he says, \"I got my eye on Pratley [[Cadillac]]\u2014my daddy ain't doing so good.\" Lane once owned a women's roller derby team that Peggy and Luanne skated for, before Peggy organized the skaters into a buyout and quit.\n* '''Mark Buckley''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Buckley was the [[slacker]] boyfriend of Luanne. He was killed in a propane explosion by his own negligence while working at [[Mega-Lo Mart]] in the second [[season finale]], having dragged a propane tank by the valve instead of its handles resulting in leak. The character did return once (as an angel) on the episode \"Wings of the Dope,\" where Kahn buys Buckley's trampoline for his backyard and Luanne (who has been stressed over beauty school finals) begins seeing Buckley's angel.\n* '''Officer Brown''' (voiced by [[Fred Willard]]) \u2013 Officer Brown is a local police officer in Arlen who is not averse to tampering with evidence and taking bribes from illegal food operations, as explained in episodes 20 and 11 (respectively) of season 12. In the episode \"Cops and Roberts,\" Principal Moss states that \"Officer Brown may be a disgraced cop who tampered with evidence . . . but this here used to be a man\". His appearance is modeled after his voice actor. Brown (as well as other Arlen police officers) were seen to be 'starstruck' by fictional ex-[[Dallas Cowboy]] player Willie Lane (and his [[Super Bowl XII|1978 Super Bowl]] ring) and refused to arrest him for felonies against Hank and Kahn after finding out who he was in the episode \"New Cowboy on the Block\".\n* '''Jack''' (voiced by [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]) \u2013 Jack is Hank's mentally unstable barber. Eventually, his distress affects his ability to style hair, causing Hank great embarrassment. Jack was almost forced out of business when a trendy salon named Hottyz opened across the street, but he was able to secure Luanne and Bill's services after Hottyz fired them when they learned Bill was not the homosexual hairstylist he'd been posing as.\n* '''Eustace Miller''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Eustace is a wimpy, mustachioed patent lawyer and father of Bobby's classmate Randy.\n* '''Bob Jenkins''' (voiced by [[Henry Gibson]]) \u2013 Bob is a veteran reporter for ''[[The Arlen Bystander]]'' and is Peggy's main rival there. His left eye was scraped out of his skull because he had a [[brain tumor]]. When Peggy thinks the \"[[Waffle House]] beat\" is beneath her, Bob takes it over and breaks the story of Dale as \"The Smoking Bandit.\" In \"Bystand Me\" (his debut episode), he tells Peggy that whenever he gets [[writer's block]], he hires a [[prostitute]].\n* '''Miss Kremzer''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Coolidge]]) \u2013 The teacher at the beauty school Luanne went to. She is very condescending towards Luanne in her first appearance. After Hank's speech that gets Kremzer to change her grade for Luanne, she acts sympathetic along with the other students, but is right back to her previously-displayed bad attitude in subsequent episodes.\n* '''Sharona Johnson''' (voiced by [[Dawnn Lewis]]) \u2013 A girl that goes to the same beauty school that Luanne went to, Sharona is hardworking and intelligent but is also very arrogant and puts down Luanne constantly.\n* '''Chris Sizemore''' (voiced by [[Chris Elliott]]) \u2013 A real estate agent that Peggy once worked for after she wrote a scathing article about him in the Bystander for which she was consequently fired.\n* '''Gary Kasner''' (voiced by [[Carl Reiner]]) \u2013 An elderly Jewish man who serves as Tilly Hill's new love interest following her separation from Cotton. He served on a submarine during Korea, but tells Bobby he didn't see any action during the conflict. Hank was initially not happy with his mother's decision to pursue a relationship again, but Hank changed his mind when Gary threatened to kick Cotton's ass if he kept talking bad about Tilly.\n* '''Tom Chick''' (voiced by [[Phil Hendrie]]) \u2013 The manager of the Channel 84 news division.\n* '''Nguc Phong''' (voiced by [[James Sie]]) \u2013 A Laotian who is one of Ted Wassonasong's friends.\n* '''David \"The Flyin' Hawaiian\" Kalaiki-Ali'i''' (voiced by [[Brendan Fraser]]) \u2013 David is the star football player for Arlen High School in the episode \"Peggy Makes The Big Leagues.\" He has a carefree attitude towards school, figuring he can coast by on his football skills (as most of the Arlen High teachers cut him slack due to his importance on the team), but he runs afoul of Peggy. Due to the [[No Pass No Play]] policy, David is prevented from playing football until he raises his grades, earning Peggy the ire of the local booster club. The club and school employees fabricate evidence that David was [[mental retardation|Learning disabled]] which he admitted was untrue although his grammar, handwriting and mathematical reasoning are poor. Realizing his chances for playing in professional sports are statistically low, he agrees to be tutored by Peggy to have something to fall back on.\n* '''Mrs. Kalaiki-Ali'i''' (voiced by [[Amy Hill]]) \u2013 A Hawaiian insurance agent Hank visits when Kahn backs into Hank's truck with his van. A later episode revolved around her son David who was a star football player at Arlen High and was doing poorly in his classes.\n* '''Fred Ebberd''' (voiced by [[Chelcie Ross]]) \u2013 A member of the city council who also works at a movie theater. He appeared in only two episodes, but is mentioned by Hank in several others. Hank mentions voting for him and having no regrets about it even though he has expressed disappointment with his performance.\n* '''Anthony Page''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 An ultra-liberal social worker from Los Angeles. Physically frail, as he considers carpal tunnel a disability (nicknamed \"Twig Boy\"). In the pilot episode, he is assigned to investigate the allegation that Hank is beating Bobby. He appears in a later episode as Leon's advocate when Hank fired him for drug-abuse.\n* '''Carl the Restaurateur''' (voiced by [[Dennis Burkley]]) \u2013 Owns and operates the Showbiz Deli in the episode ''Love Hurts and So Does Art''. He indicates in this episode that before switching the menu to New York style deli food, his restaurant had served Italian food. Carl is not a stickler for quality in his cuisine, noting that he orders chopped chicken liver in a large drum. His restaurant is not popular and often Bobby Hill is the only customer. He also seems to be a lazy cook, noting, \"Did you know you have to heat up Italian food?\". After the apparent failure of the Showbiz Deli, we encounter Carl again in ''Bad Girls, Bad Girls, Whatcha Gonna Do?'', again having switched his menu, this time to sushi, another food that can be served raw. In this later episode, it appears that Carl's business is doing much better, as the scenes of the sushi restaurant show many customers inside. He is not to be confused with the similarly named school principal Carl Moss, who was also voiced by Burkley.\n\n==Other characters==\n* '''Jody \"Ray Roy\" Strickland''' (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) \u2013 Jody, the illegitimate son of Buck Strickland, lives in [[Tennessee]]. Buck meets him at the National Propane Gas Convention. Affectionately dubbed \"Ray Roy\" by Buck when he cannot remember his real name, he gladly accepts the nickname. Like his father, Jody also runs a propane company named Strickland Propane that's based in [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]]. Also like Buck, Jody is a compulsive gambler, chauvinist, alcoholic, cheat, and womanizer.\n* '''Wesley Cherish''' (voiced by [[Andy Richter]]) \u2013 Wesley is a new neighbor that moved to Arlen from Fort Worth in the episode [[Straight as an Arrow]]. Wesley's wife is Annette. They have six children (only two of which have been named, boys Robin and Carey, one of which has [[ADHD]], and the other [[hyperglycemia]]). The children are home schooled by Annette. Wesley does not allow his children to play video games or watch TV (although they do have a TV, which is mainly used as an end table) and are not allowed to participate in \"predatory sports\" such as [[American football|football]], [[basketball]] and [[tag (game)|tag]].\n*'''Tammi Duvall''' (voiced by [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]]) \u2013 Tammi is a [[prostitute]] who was from [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] (referred to as The \"OKC\") in the episode \"[[Ho Yeah!]]\". She was hired at Strickland Propane and went to lunch with Peggy. The pair become fast friends, and Tammi has expressed her desire to get her [[GED]]. Peggy decided to tutor Tammi, and because Tammi does not have a place to live, she is welcomed to stay in the den, much to Hank's objections. Tammi has gone out with Barry, Lane Pratley, and Miles Burton, all the while getting Peggy to dress like a prostitute also. She has read ''[[Congo (novel)|Congo]]'', the book that Peggy has given her, and she has been giving Hank money, and has given him a cowboy-style hat with a big feather. When she was arguing with a man named Donald, Hank decides to intervene and Tammi explains that Donald took her money, making Hank demand that Donald returns the money. Frightened, Donald surrenders the cash back to Tammi. Later, a man named Alabaster Jones, the \"main mack\" of Oklahoma City, confronts Hank and introduces himself as Tammi's [[pimp]]. Alabaster accuses Hank of \"trickin' Tammi out all over town.\u201d Hank denies it but remembers all of the things Tammi has been doing and realizes that Tammi is a prostitute and Alabaster, thinking Hank has been acting as Tammi\u2019s pimp, tells Hank that either Tammi goes back to being his [[Prostitution|ho]], or Hank becomes his new ho. As Hank has confronted her in the [[public library]], Tammi tells the truth, and Hank has told Tammi that she has to leave. In the car on the way home, Tammi thanked Hank and Peggy for all they have done for her. But, unfortunately, Hank is rear-ended by Alabaster, who wanted Tammi. Hank tries to outrun him, to no avail. When Tammi requests that Hank stops the car so she can exit and return with Alabaster to Oklahoma City, Hank slams on the brakes. He steps out of the car and tells Alabaster to do likewise. Hank then hands Alabaster all of the cash Tammi gave him and states that Tammi is now his \u201cho.\u201d Alabaster takes the money and tries to buy Peggy, but Hank refused and after Alabaster drives off, Tammi decides to go straight.\n*'''Alabaster Jones''' (voiced by [[Snoop Dogg]]) \u2013 Alabaster is a [[pimp]] and the main antagonist in \"[[Ho Yeah!]]\". He came from [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] (referred to as The \"OKC\") in the episode and confronted Hank, accusing Hank of \"trickin' Tammi out all over town.\u201d Hank denies it but remembers all of the things Tammi has been doing and realizes that Tammi is a prostitute and Alabaster, thinking Hank has been acting as Tammi\u2019s pimp, tells Hank that either Tammi goes back to being his [[Prostitution|ho]], or Hank becomes his new ho. Alabaster deliberately rear-ended Hank, wanting Tammi. Hank tries to outrun him, to no avail. When Tammi requests that Hank stops the car so she can exit and return with Alabaster to Oklahoma City, Hank slams on the brakes. He steps out of the car and tells Alabaster to do likewise. Hank then hands Alabaster all of the cash Tammi gave him and states that Tammi is now his \u201cho\u201d, making Alabaster nervous as Hank is bigger than Alabaster. Alabaster takes the money and tries to get Peggy, but Hank refused, telling Alabaster that Peggy is his wife, and Alabaster drives off.\n*'''Cane Skretteburg''' (voiced by [[Tr\u00e9 Cool]]) \u2013 Cane Skretteburg is the lead singer of a [[punk rock]] garage band and one of the main antagonists in the episode \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteburg\". Hank confronts this character with his band (voiced by [[Green Day]]) because their music was too loud. Later in the episode they have three paintball wars, the first two Hank, Boomhauer, Bill and Dale lose but win the last one. Cane and his band later appear in the episode \"Master of Puppets\". \n*'''Spongy'''- Real name unknown. He is a homeless panhandler first seen in \"The Texas Panhandler\". While he claims he used to live in a facility he hasn't since the 80's \"Ever since Ronald Reagan kicked me out of my mental hospital.\"\n*'''Jane Cooper''' (voiced by [[Kathy Bates]]) \u2013 Jane Cooper is an Arlen Policewoman obsessed with Hank Hill and one of the main antagonists in the episode \"Lupe's Revenge.\" She repeatedly pulls Hank over throughout the episode, makes flirtatious overtures to him, and attempts to dismiss a ticket due to her feelings for him. When Peggy Hill \"accidentally\" picks up a Mexican child as one of the classmates she was taking on school trip across the border, she harasses Peggy Hill during her attempt to return the child.\n*'''Collete Davis''' (voiced by [[Christina Applegate]]) \u2013 Collete is the Owner of Hottyz in the episode \"My Hair Lady\" and a trendsetting hairstylist responsible for bringing the messy ponytail to Arlen. She hired both Luanne Platter and Bill Dauterive to work at her salon shortly after Luanne dropped out of college. Both become popular stylists until Bill admits to not being gay. Collete fires them both despite an impassioned speech by Luanne about acceptance and is not seen again until appearing in a non-speaking role during the episode \"Lucky's Wedding Suit.\" \n*'''[[Henry Winkler]]''' (voiced by and guest starred as [[Henry Winkler|himself]]) \u2013 Henry Winkler is the main antagonist in the episode \"[[A Rover Runs Through It]]\". He bought the land that was next to the ranch, wanting to take over Montana so that he and everyone else in Hollywood can modernize it. Hank tried to reason with Henry to let the cattle through to get to their grazing spot in the mountains, but Henry refused, saying that the cattle will pollute the river where he fishes. When Peggy, Bobby, Hank, and Peggy's two brothers led the cattle through the town, using the main street as a temporary trail for the cattle, Henry gives back the land. At the end of the episode, he revealed his true intentions to let the cattle cruise through to the grazing spot when he and Hank are now fishing in the river.\n\n==Guest Stars==\nThe following is a list of guest stars on ''[[King of the Hill]]''.\n\n===Season 1===\n*[[Pilot (King of the Hill)|Pilot]]\n**[[Gailard Sartain]] as Children's Services Supervisor\n*[[Square Peg]]\n**[[Mary Scheer]] as Gracie\n*[[The Order of the Straight Arrow]]\n**[[Victor Aaron]] as John Redcorn\n*[[Hank's Got the Willies]] \n**[[Dennis Hopper]] as Himself\n**[[Chuck Mangione]] as Himself\n**[[Willie Nelson]] as Himself\n*[[Luanne's Saga]]\n**[[Victor Aaron]] as John Redcorn\n**[[Chuck Mangione]] as Himself\n*[[Hank's Unmentionable Problem]]\n**[[Steven Banks]] as Dr. Morley\n**[[Jim Cummings]] as [[C.
