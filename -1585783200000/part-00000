Because the county court was unwilling to pay for land in Boonsborough, a site was selected one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) west and this would become the new county seat. In 1846, the Post Office required a new name  to be selected for Boonsborough since there was already a Boonsborough in Missouri. The city was renamed '''California''' on January 25, 1847 for the territory on the West Coast that was just then drawing attention due to progress of the overland railroad.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RfAuAAAAYAAJ | title=How Missouri Counties, Towns and Streams Were Named | publisher=The State Historical Society of Missouri | author=Eaton, David Wolfe | year=1917 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RfAuAAAAYAAJ/page/n106 333]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbyjamQWtScC&lpg=PA1&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Our Storehouse of Missouri Place Names | publisher=University of Missouri Press | author=Ramsay, Robert L. | year=1952 | pages=27}}</ref> That same year, a courthouse was erected on the square.\n\nCalifornia was incorporated in 1848 and elected its first city officials in 1858, ten years later.\n\nThe ''Weekly California News'' printed its first edition on September 18, 1858 and has since been Moniteau County's oldest established business still in operation.

Because the county court was unwilling to pay for land in Boonsborough, a site was selected one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) west and this would become the new county seat. In 1846, the Post Office required a new name  to be selected for Boonsborough since there was already a Boonsborough in Missouri. The city was renamed '''California''' on January 25, 1847 for the territory on the West Coast that was just then drawing attention due to progress of the overland railroad.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RfAuAAAAYAAJ | title=How Missouri Counties, Towns and Streams Were Named | publisher=The State Historical Society of Missouri | author=Eaton, David Wolfe | year=1917 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RfAuAAAAYAAJ/page/n106 333]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbyjamQWtScC&lpg=PA1&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Our Storehouse of Missouri Place Names | publisher=University of Missouri Press | author=Ramsay, Robert L. | year=1952 | pages=27}}</ref> That same year, a courthouse was erected on the square.\n\nCalifornia was incorporated in 1848 and elected its first city officials in 1858, ten years later.\n\nThe ''Weekly California News'' printed its first edition on September 18, 1858 and has since been Moniteau County's oldest established business still in operation.

The band consisted of [[Chris Collingwood]], [[Adam Schlesinger]], [[Jody Porter]], and [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]]. The band is best known for its 2003 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated single \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n===1995\u201399===\nAfter [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]]-based [[Adam Schlesinger]] and [[Sellersville, Pennsylvania|Sellersville]]-based [[Chris Collingwood]] first met as freshmen at [[Platos Retreat]], they played music in various bands and eventually went their separate ways, with Collingwood forming the Ass Munchers in Montauk  and Schlesinger forming [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]] in Camden. In the mid-1990s, they came together to form Please Pack my Fudge, named after a [[candy]] store in [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]], [[New Jersey]] that is no longer in business. At first Collingwood hated the name, which was suggested by Schlesinger's mother, but eventually warmed to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/waynes-world-6423163|title=Wayne's World|first=Ted|last=Simons|website=Phoenix New Times|date=1997-05-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref> Previous band names included Woolly Mammoth, Are You My Mother? and Three Men Who When Standing Side by Side Have a Wingspan of Over Twelve Feet. The band cut a demo and signed with [[Atlantic Records]], then recruited guitarist [[Jody Porter]] and still-active Posies drummer [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] after recording their debut album. Young got in touch with a friend who worked at Fountains of Wayne's label to see if there were any job openings, and when he auditioned for the band, they asked him to play the beat of [[Swingtown (song)|\"Swingtown\"]] by [[Steve Miller Band]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/2007/04/brian-young/|title=Brian Young of Fountains of Wayne|first=Waleed|last=Rashidi|magazine=Modern Drummer|date=April 2007|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThough Collingwood and Schlesinger share co-writer credit for all original Fountains of Wayne material, for most of their career together they have written their songs separately. In 2005 Collingwood said, \"We decided early on, it\u2019s better to not have arguments that some bands have where someone might say, \u2018I wrote 15% of that song,\u2019 and try to figure out those numbers. It just seems ridiculous.\" Schlesinger added, \"We just agreed many years ago that if we were to have a band we\u2019d just split the songwriting to avoid having a conversation every time we tried to finish a song. But we really haven\u2019t collaborated as writers in years. And that\u2019s kind of intentional too because we didn\u2019t want it to turn into a thing where people would say, 'Adam\u2019s songs are like this\u2026' We wanted the band to have an identity more than we wanted each of us to have an identity in the band.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2005/07/fountains-of-wayner-bright-future-in-sales/|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Sales|first=John D.|last=Luerssen|magazine=American Songwriter|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, the band released its [[Fountains of Wayne (album)|self-titled debut]], which spawned the singles \"[[Radiation Vibe]]\" and \"[[Sink to the Bottom]]\", and the band toured the world extensively behind its debut album, playing alongside bands including [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]], and [[The Lemonheads]]. That same year, Schlesinger wrote the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated, [[RIAA]] gold certified [[That Thing You Do (song)|title song]] for the film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''.\n\nIn 1999, the band released ''[[Utopia Parkway]]'', an album named after a road in [[Queens]], New York. The album was a concept record that dealt with life in modern suburbia. ''Utopia Parkway'' was received well by critics, garnering many favorable reviews, and was album of the week in [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]]. The group once again toured extensively behind the album, but frustrations grew between the band and the label. The band was later dropped by Atlantic in late 1999.\n\n[[File:Fountains of Wayne.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Fountains of Wayne performing in April 2007]]\n\n===2000\u20132011===\n\nThe band was inactive for a period of time. Collingwood, in particular, had a difficult time coping with the band being dropped by their label. In 2004 he said, \"When we got dropped from Atlantic, it\u2019s my fault that it took so long, because I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to keep doing it.  At the end of four years of the hardest work I\u2019d ever done in my life, more traveling and being away from my wife the whole time, I had nothing to show for it.  I got back home and I had nothing.  I was broke, I was demoralized, I was exhausted.  I think I just needed a year to recharge my batteries.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popentertainment.com/fountains.htm|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Record Sales|first=Jay S.|last=Jacobs|publisher=PopEntertainment.com|date=2004-01-09|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nSchlesinger co-wrote many of the songs for the ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (film)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' film and soundtrack, produced albums for [[Verve Pipe]], [[David Mead (musician)|David Mead]], and [[They Might Be Giants]], and released a third record with his other band, [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]]. Collingwood formed and fronted a [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]-based pop-country band, called [[Chris Collingwood#Gay Potatoes (side project)|Gay Potatoes]], and played a string of solo shows in the Boston and Los Angeles areas. Guitarist Jody Porter worked with his band, The Astrojet, alongside famed producer [[Gordon Raphael]] and keyboardist David Zhang in New York City. Percussionist [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] moved to Los Angeles and did session work for various artists such as producer [[Steve Fisk]], Ivy, [[Heather Duby]], and [[Greg Dulli]]. The band reunited recording a cover of [[The Kinks]]' \"Better Things\" for the tribute album, ''This Is Where I Belong: Songs of Ray Davies and the Kinks'', in 2001.\n \nIn 2003, the band released ''[[Welcome Interstate Managers]]'', a successful album that spawned the Grammy-nominated [[RIAA]] gold-certified hit single, \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\", which Adam Schlesinger says was a tribute to the band, [[The Cars]]; initially, the single stalled at commercial alternative radio in the US, but MTV President [[Judy McGrath]] championed the single's [[music video]], a ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' homage featuring [[Rachel Hunter]]. Another song off the album, \"All Kinds of Time\", was used for [[NFL]] commercial promotions during the 2005 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fountainsofwayne.us/newsarchive.php |title=Fountains of Wayne.us |publisher=Fountains of Wayne.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the band released ''[[Out-of-State Plates]]'', a collection of [[B-side]]s and two new songs, which was supported by the single \"Maureen\" and a limited US tour that included some acoustic-only sets, a set on PBS ''[[Soundstage (TV program)|Soundstage]]'', and American Songbook. Also included on the album is a 1999 cover of the [[Britney Spears]] hit, \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\".\n\nIn 2006, while on tour in Tokyo, Collingwood had a mental breakdown in which he hadn't slept for four days, experienced hallucinations for two days and didn't believe that he was in Tokyo to play in front of 25,000. The show was cancelled and Collingwood was taken to an emergency department,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theywillrockyou.com/2007/06/fountains-of-wayne/|title=Fountains of Wayne|first=Lexi|last=Shapiro|publisher=They Will Rock You|date=2007-06-26|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref> followed by recovery in a mental hospital after returning to the US.<ref name=Myers>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/08/fountains-of-wayne.html|title=Fountains of Wayne: Ironic No More|first=Paul|last=Myers|magazine=Paste|date=2011-08-03|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the band released ''[[Traffic and Weather]]'', an album which included the song \"I-95\", which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named #54 of the year's top 100 songs.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/rolling-stone-top-songs-2008/16472/ |title=Rolling Stone slights Rihanna and embraces Newman on 2007 singles &#124; Prefix |publisher=Prefixmag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref> Collingwood had less involvement during the making of the album due to his struggles with depression and alcoholism, only managing to contribute three songs.<ref name=Myers/>\n\nIn 2008, Porter released his debut solo album ''Close to the Sun'', a collection of songs he had written and recorded over a period of years in between Fountains of Wayne albums and tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fountains-of-wayne-1329689|title=Fountains of Wayne guitarist for solo career|publisher=NME|date=2008-07-23|accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the band released ''No Better Place: Live In Chicago'', a live concert DVD which included newly recorded acoustic songs.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.amazon.com/Fountains-Wayne-Better-Place-Chicago/dp/B001PPLKJ4 |title=Fountains of Wayne: No Better Place - Live in Chicago: Chris Collingwood, Steven M.

According to Porter, \"It\u2019s a little bit more introspective and not as loud of a record as the last two. I think that came from the fact that we started last year doing acoustic-based tours because we didn\u2019t have a record out. We wanted to get back out on tour and did it stripped-down. Overall it\u2019s not as brash or guitar-heavy.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.popmatters.com/130729-out-of-the-shadows-into-the-light-an-interview-with-jody-porter-2496141124.html|title=Out of the Shadows, Into the Light: An Interview with Jody Porter|author=Souleo|magazine=Popmatters|date=2010-09-14|accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the band released ''[[Sky Full of Holes]]'', an album put out in Japan by [[Warner Music Japan]] (with two bonus tracks), Europe by [[Lojinx]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lojinx.com/releases/fountains-of-wayne/sky-full-of-holes |title=Lojinx // Fountains of Wayne / Sky Full of Holes album |publisher=Lojinx.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> and the U.S. by [[Yep Roc Records]]. The now-sober Collingwood once again became more involved, but this turned out to be the hardest album for them to make. According to Collingwood in 2013, \"The most recent record was definitely the hardest that we've ever done. I think I'm partly to blame for that. I checked out on the previous record, so when I came back in, I had to assert myself. Every single thing about that record was a fight. It was not this blissful reconciliation that led to the release; it was a brutal thing right up to the end. We'll see what happens if we end up making another record.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottsmerc.com/arts_and_entertainment/fountains-of-wayne-performs-songs-from-newest-release-at-sellersville/article_d07ddcbc-6d81-5ad1-9140-13b5e2474459.html|title=Fountains of Wayne performs songs from newest release at Sellersville|first=David|last=Kleinman|publisher=The Mercury|date=2013-03-06|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fountains-of-Wayne-acoustic-July-09.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The band playing [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] in July 2009]]\n\n==Future plans==\nThe band has no plans to record new material. Neither Schlesinger nor Collingwood has ruled out a future reunion, but both see the possibility as remote. \"I try never to say never,\" Collingwood has said, \"but it\u2019s staggering to think of everything that would have to happen for me to want to repeat that experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Lambeth, Sam|url=http://louderthanwar.com/interview-fountains-wayne/|title=Interview: Fountains of Wayne|publisher=Louder Than War|date=13 April 2016|accessdate=2016-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 Collingwood elaborated on the band's demise by saying, \"When we were recording the record before the last Fountains of Wayne record, which was called ''Traffic and Weather'', I didn't really have a whole lot to contribute to that album. I was out to lunch a little bit, mentally, and just drinking too much. And I think that the fact that I sort of removed myself from the process at that point made it really easier for Adam to take over. And when I was ready to actually make another album, you know, several years later after I'd sort of cleaned up my act, it was very difficult.

The band consisted of [[Chris Collingwood]], [[Adam Schlesinger]], [[Jody Porter]], and [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]]. The band is best known for its 2003 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated single \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n===1995\u201399===\nAfter [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]]-based [[Adam Schlesinger]] and [[Sellersville, Pennsylvania|Sellersville]]-based [[Chris Collingwood]] first met as freshmen at [[Williams College]], they played music in various bands and eventually went their separate ways, with Collingwood forming the Mercy Buckets in Boston and Schlesinger forming [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]] in New York City. In the mid-1990s, they came together to form Fountains of Wayne, named after a [[lawn ornament]] store in [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]], [[New Jersey]] that is no longer in business. At first Collingwood hated the name, which was suggested by Schlesinger's mother, but eventually warmed to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/waynes-world-6423163|title=Wayne's World|first=Ted|last=Simons|website=Phoenix New Times|date=1997-05-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref> Previous band names included Woolly Mammoth, Are You My Mother? and Three Men Who When Standing Side by Side Have a Wingspan of Over Twelve Feet. The band cut a demo and signed with [[Atlantic Records]], then recruited guitarist [[Jody Porter]] and still-active Posies drummer [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] after recording their debut album. Young got in touch with a friend who worked at Fountains of Wayne's label to see if there were any job openings, and when he auditioned for the band, they asked him to play the beat of [[Swingtown (song)|\"Swingtown\"]] by [[Steve Miller Band]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/2007/04/brian-young/|title=Brian Young of Fountains of Wayne|first=Waleed|last=Rashidi|magazine=Modern Drummer|date=April 2007|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThough Collingwood and Schlesinger share co-writer credit for all original Fountains of Wayne material, for most of their career together they have written their songs separately. In 2005 Collingwood said, \"We decided early on, it\u2019s better to not have arguments that some bands have where someone might say, \u2018I wrote 15% of that song,\u2019 and try to figure out those numbers. It just seems ridiculous.\" Schlesinger added, \"We just agreed many years ago that if we were to have a band we\u2019d just split the songwriting to avoid having a conversation every time we tried to finish a song. But we really haven\u2019t collaborated as writers in years. And that\u2019s kind of intentional too because we didn\u2019t want it to turn into a thing where people would say, 'Adam\u2019s songs are like this\u2026' We wanted the band to have an identity more than we wanted each of us to have an identity in the band.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2005/07/fountains-of-wayner-bright-future-in-sales/|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Sales|first=John D.|last=Luerssen|magazine=American Songwriter|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, the band released its [[Fountains of Wayne (album)|self-titled debut]], which spawned the singles \"[[Radiation Vibe]]\" and \"[[Sink to the Bottom]]\", and the band toured the world extensively behind its debut album, playing alongside bands including [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]], and [[The Lemonheads]]. That same year, Schlesinger wrote the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated, [[RIAA]] gold certified [[That Thing You Do (song)|title song]] for the film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''.\n\nIn 1999, the band released ''[[Utopia Parkway]]'', an album named after a road in [[Queens]], New York. The album was a concept record that dealt with life in modern suburbia. ''Utopia Parkway'' was received well by critics, garnering many favorable reviews, and was album of the week in [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]]. The group once again toured extensively behind the album, but frustrations grew between the band and the label. The band was later dropped by Atlantic in late 1999.\n\n[[File:Fountains of Wayne.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Fountains of Wayne performing in April 2007]]\n\n===2000\u20132011===\n\nThe band was inactive for a period of time. Collingwood, in particular, had a difficult time coping with the band being dropped by their label. In 2004 he said, \"When we got dropped from Atlantic, it\u2019s my fault that it took so long, because I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to keep doing it.  At the end of four years of the hardest work I\u2019d ever done in my life, more traveling and being away from my wife the whole time, I had nothing to show for it.  I got back home and I had nothing.  I was broke, I was demoralized, I was exhausted.  I think I just needed a year to recharge my batteries.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popentertainment.com/fountains.htm|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Record Sales|first=Jay S.|last=Jacobs|publisher=PopEntertainment.com|date=2004-01-09|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nSchlesinger co-wrote many of the songs for the ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (film)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' film and soundtrack, produced albums for [[Verve Pipe]], [[David Mead (musician)|David Mead]], and [[They Might Be Giants]], and released a third record with his other band, [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]]. Collingwood formed and fronted a [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]-based pop-country band, called [[Chris Collingwood#Gay Potatoes (side project)|Gay Potatoes]], and played a string of solo shows in the Boston and Los Angeles areas. Guitarist Jody Porter worked with his band, The Astrojet, alongside famed producer [[Gordon Raphael]] and keyboardist David Zhang in New York City. Percussionist [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] moved to Los Angeles and did session work for various artists such as producer [[Steve Fisk]], Ivy, [[Heather Duby]], and [[Greg Dulli]]. The band reunited recording a cover of [[The Kinks]]' \"Better Things\" for the tribute album, ''This Is Where I Belong: Songs of Ray Davies and the Kinks'', in 2001.\n \nIn 2003, the band released ''[[Welcome Interstate Managers]]'', a successful album that spawned the Grammy-nominated [[RIAA]] gold-certified hit single, \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\", which Adam Schlesinger says was a tribute to the band, [[The Cars]]; initially, the single stalled at commercial alternative radio in the US, but MTV President [[Judy McGrath]] championed the single's [[music video]], a ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' homage featuring [[Rachel Hunter]]. Another song off the album, \"All Kinds of Time\", was used for [[NFL]] commercial promotions during the 2005 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fountainsofwayne.us/newsarchive.php |title=Fountains of Wayne.us |publisher=Fountains of Wayne.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the band released ''[[Out-of-State Plates]]'', a collection of [[B-side]]s and two new songs, which was supported by the single \"Maureen\" and a limited US tour that included some acoustic-only sets, a set on PBS ''[[Soundstage (TV program)|Soundstage]]'', and American Songbook. Also included on the album is a 1999 cover of the [[Britney Spears]] hit, \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\".\n\nIn 2006, while on tour in Tokyo, Collingwood had a mental breakdown in which he hadn't slept for four days, experienced hallucinations for two days and didn't believe that he was in Tokyo to play in front of 25,000. The show was cancelled and Collingwood was taken to an emergency department,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theywillrockyou.com/2007/06/fountains-of-wayne/|title=Fountains of Wayne|first=Lexi|last=Shapiro|publisher=They Will Rock You|date=2007-06-26|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref> followed by recovery in a mental hospital after returning to the US.<ref name=Myers>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/08/fountains-of-wayne.html|title=Fountains of Wayne: Ironic No More|first=Paul|last=Myers|magazine=Paste|date=2011-08-03|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the band released ''[[Traffic and Weather]]'', an album which included the song \"I-95\", which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named #54 of the year's top 100 songs.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/rolling-stone-top-songs-2008/16472/ |title=Rolling Stone slights Rihanna and embraces Newman on 2007 singles &#124; Prefix |publisher=Prefixmag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref> Collingwood had less involvement during the making of the album due to his struggles with depression and alcoholism, only managing to contribute three songs.<ref name=Myers/>\n\nIn 2008, Porter released his debut solo album ''Close to the Sun'', a collection of songs he had written and recorded over a period of years in between Fountains of Wayne albums and tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fountains-of-wayne-1329689|title=Fountains of Wayne guitarist for solo career|publisher=NME|date=2008-07-23|accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the band released ''No Better Place: Live In Chicago'', a live concert DVD which included newly recorded acoustic songs.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.amazon.com/Fountains-Wayne-Better-Place-Chicago/dp/B001PPLKJ4 |title=Fountains of Wayne: No Better Place - Live in Chicago: Chris Collingwood, Steven M.

According to Porter, \"It\u2019s a little bit more introspective and not as loud of a record as the last two. I think that came from the fact that we started last year doing acoustic-based tours because we didn\u2019t have a record out. We wanted to get back out on tour and did it stripped-down. Overall it\u2019s not as brash or guitar-heavy.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.popmatters.com/130729-out-of-the-shadows-into-the-light-an-interview-with-jody-porter-2496141124.html|title=Out of the Shadows, Into the Light: An Interview with Jody Porter|author=Souleo|magazine=Popmatters|date=2010-09-14|accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the band released ''[[Sky Full of Holes]]'', an album put out in Japan by [[Warner Music Japan]] (with two bonus tracks), Europe by [[Lojinx]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lojinx.com/releases/fountains-of-wayne/sky-full-of-holes |title=Lojinx // Fountains of Wayne / Sky Full of Holes album |publisher=Lojinx.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> and the U.S. by [[Yep Roc Records]]. The now-sober Collingwood once again became more involved, but this turned out to be the hardest album for them to make. According to Collingwood in 2013, \"The most recent record was definitely the hardest that we've ever done. I think I'm partly to blame for that. I checked out on the previous record, so when I came back in, I had to assert myself. Every single thing about that record was a fight. It was not this blissful reconciliation that led to the release; it was a brutal thing right up to the end. We'll see what happens if we end up making another record.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottsmerc.com/arts_and_entertainment/fountains-of-wayne-performs-songs-from-newest-release-at-sellersville/article_d07ddcbc-6d81-5ad1-9140-13b5e2474459.html|title=Fountains of Wayne performs songs from newest release at Sellersville|first=David|last=Kleinman|publisher=The Mercury|date=2013-03-06|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fountains-of-Wayne-acoustic-July-09.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The band playing [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] in July 2009]]\n\n==Future plans==\nThe band has no plans to record new material. Neither Schlesinger nor Collingwood has ruled out a future reunion, but both see the possibility as remote. \"I try never to say never,\" Collingwood has said, \"but it\u2019s staggering to think of everything that would have to happen for me to want to repeat that experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Lambeth, Sam|url=http://louderthanwar.com/interview-fountains-wayne/|title=Interview: Fountains of Wayne|publisher=Louder Than War|date=13 April 2016|accessdate=2016-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 Collingwood elaborated on the band's demise by saying, \"When we were recording the record before the last Fountains of Wayne record, which was called ''Traffic and Weather'', I didn't really have a whole lot to contribute to that album. I was out to lunch a little bit, mentally, and just drinking too much. And I think that the fact that I sort of removed myself from the process at that point made it really easier for Adam to take over. And when I was ready to actually make another album, you know, several years later after I'd sort of cleaned up my act, it was very difficult.

Many of the stories used in ''The Cyanide and Happiness Show'' resulted from the team trying to make each other laugh while in a bar. Due to Wilson living in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], numerous plane rides and [[Skype]] calls had taken place during this process. As the show began to take shape, the team drew out management positions for themselves. McElfatrick was put in charge of art, DenBleyker covered animation and Wilson managed sound design and [[voice acting]], but as the project went on, these roles loosened up. The team hired contributors from the United States, [[India]] and [[South Korea]] for various processes.<ref name=Observer />\n\n==Release==\nThe creators originally attempted to negotiate a [[TV series]] deal with [[cable network]]s, but due to \"concerns about artistic compromise\",<ref name=\"Co.Create\" /> their efforts were fruitless.

Each episode consists of a few short stories that have little to no connection to each other (with the exception of six episodes from Season 3, which were a [[story arc]]). The creators described the goal of each episode to be \"to extract the human excretion known as laughter from your face hole via fast-paced weird comedy.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/cyanide-happiness-has-new-show-youtube-211815|title=Cyanide & Happiness has a new show on YouTube|newspaper=[[The A.V.

The first season was initially released on [[YouTube]] from November 12, 2014 to January 21, 2015. The show was later acquired by [[Seeso]], which produced second and third seasons before selling the show to [[VRV (streaming service)|VRV]] in mid-2017. On February 20, 2019, it was announced that VRV had renewed the show for a fourth season, which will comprise 10 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/members/2019/02/20/the-cyanide-happiness-show-picked-up-for-a-fourth-season-on-vrv/|title=\u2018The Cyanide & Happiness Show\u2019 Picked Up for a 4th Season on VRV|website=[[The Wrap]]|last=Lopez|first=Matt|date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe Explosm team has been creating short videos based on ''Cyanide & Happiness'' for years before working on the full show.

Many of the stories used in ''The Cyanide and Happiness Show'' resulted from the team trying to make each other laugh while in a bar. Due to Wilson living in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], numerous plane rides and [[Skype]] calls had taken place during this process. As the show began to take shape, the team drew out management positions for themselves. McElfatrick was put in charge of art, DenBleyker covered animation and Wilson managed sound design and [[voice acting]], but as the project went on, these roles loosened up. The team hired contributors from the United States, [[India]] and [[South Korea]] for various processes.<ref name=Observer />\n\n==Release==\nThe creators originally attempted to negotiate a [[TV series]] deal with [[cable network]]s, but due to \"concerns about artistic compromise\",<ref name=\"Co.Create\" /> their efforts were fruitless. One of the creators wrote:\n{{Quote|text=\"We walked away from the first two [networks] due to rights and creative control issues. We thought that we could settle those issues in the third deal, but things didn\u2019t quite work out as we hoped.

They again finished ahead of Cain-Gribble/LeDuc.<ref name=GS191102/>\n\nDenney/Frazier struggled at the [[2020 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2020 U.S. Championships]], beginning in the short program where Denney fell on their throw and then popped their planned triple jump as well, resulting in them finishing sixth in that segment.<ref name=GS200123/>  Despite further side-by-side jump errors and another throw fall in the free, they rose one ordinal to fifth overall.<ref name=GS200125/>\n\nOn March 25, they announced that they were ending their partnership.<ref name=denney-frazier>{{cite web|url=https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2020/03/25/haven-denney-brandon-frazier-split/|title=Haven Denney, Brandon Frazier mark another U.S. pair split|first=Rachel|last=Lutz|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=March 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== 2020-21 season & New Partnership ===\n\nOn March 30, Frazier announced that he was teaming up with [[Alexa Scimeca Knierim]].<ref name=knierim-frazier>{{cite web | url=https://usfigureskatingfanzone.com/news/2020/3/30/figure-skating-alexa-knierim-and-brandon-frazier-announce-partnership.aspx?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-usfigureskating&utm_content=later-6215670&utm_medium=social&utm_source=instagram | title = Alexa Scimeca Knierim and Brandon Frazier Announce Partnership | date = March 30, 2020 | publisher = USFSA}}</ref>\n\n== Programs ==\n=== With Denney ===\n{|  class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Calhoun County is at the tip of the peninsula formed by the courses of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] rivers above their confluence and is almost completely surrounded by water. Calhoun County is sparsely populated; it has just five municipalities, all of them villages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatriverroad.com/calhounco.htm|title=Visitors Guide to Calhoun County|accessdate=August 11, 2012|publisher=greatriverroad.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707214346/http://www.greatriverroad.com/calhounco.htm|archive-date=July 7, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCalhoun County is part of the [[Metro-East]] portion of the [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri|MO]]-IL [[Greater St. Louis|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n\nCalhoun County was settled by Americans during the very early 19th century, and officially organized in 1825. It was named for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C. Calhoun]], in addition to the Calhoun family that was prominent in the area at the time. The southern side of the county, covered in thick forest, was untouched until the population began to expand in the late 1840s with the arrival of [[German people|German]] immigrants. Land was cleared for farming, exporting lumber, and constructing spacious log barns, typically {{convert|200|sqft|m2}} in size, which were a \"trademark of successful German farmers.\"<ref>{{cite journal | author = Price, H. Wayne | title = The Double-Crib Log Barns of Calhoun County | journal = Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society | volume = 73 | issue = 2 | date = Summer 1980 | pages = 140\u2013160}}</ref>\n\n[[image: Calhoun County Illinois 1825.png|Calhoun County at the time of its creation in 1825.]]\n\nThe territory was originally settled by [[Indigenous people of North America|indigenous people]] who occupied the resource-rich river valleys near waterways.  The remains of their occupation have provided some of the most valuable [[archaeological]] information in the country.  The county's archaeological record chronicles more than 10,000 years of continuous human occupation by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].\n\nIn 1680, French explorer Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle recorded in his diary historic Native American raids by the Iroquois against the Illinois tribes along the Illinois River. La Salle recounts the aftermath of a massacre of the Illinois by the Iroquois in South Calhoun County writing, \"As the French drew near to the mouth of the Illinois, they saw a meadow to the right, and, on the farthest verge, several human figures erect, yet motionless. They landed and cautiously examined the place. The long grass was trampled down and all around were strewn the relics of the hideous orgies which formed the ordinary sequel of an Iroquois victory. The figures they had seen were the half consumed bodies of women still bound to the stakes where they had been tortured. Other sights there were, too revolting for record. All the remains were of women and children; the men, it seems, had fled, and left them to their fate. The French descended the river and soon came to the mouth.\"<ref name=\"archive.org\">https://archive.org/stream/historyofcalhoun00carp/historyofcalhoun00carp_djvu.txt</ref> The massacre is noted as taking place in the last week of November, 1680, about a mile above the  site of the Deer Plain Ferry which is no longer in operation, at a place now known as Marshall's Landing. Many skulls, parts of skeletons, and weapons have still been found near this spot by farmers during plowing.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n \nThe first European settler to make his home in what is now Calhoun County was a man only known today by his last name, O'Neal. He came in the year 1801 and settled in the south part of the county at Point Precinct at what has been called \"Two Branches\". Although his name might have one assume differently, O'Neal was a French trapper and had made his way there from Acadia. O'Neal lived in Point Precinct a number of years before any other European settlers came to that region, and when they did come he refused to mingle with them. He lived in a small cave which he had dug, and which was located about a quarter of a mile from the Mississippi River. He continued to live in this cave until his death in 1842, and after that he was referred to as \"The Hermit\" due to the fact that he would not visit the other settlers or allow them to come to his place. In 1850, Soloman Lammy, who then owned the farm upon which the cave was located.\n\nThe next settlers to come to the area were French trappers and people of mixed ancestry, who started a community about a mile above what was called the Deep Plain Ferry, on the Illinois River, in the southern part of the county. They remained until about 1815 when they were driven out by the very high water. Another French settlement was located at Cap au Gris (which means Cape of Grit or Grindstone). This place was located at the site of what was once the West Point Ferry, in Richwoods Precinct. The French settlers who lived here came sometime after 1800 and by the year 1811 there were 20 families, who had a small village on the bank of the river, and cultivated a common field of about 500 acres. The field was located on the level land about a mile from the site of their town. One writer said that these families were driven away by the Native Americans in 1814, but there is some doubt as to the accuracy of the statement as John Shaw who took part in battles with the natives in the region and was a community leader at the time does not mention in his writings any harm coming to the settlers at Cap au Gris.\n\nAs early pioneers continued to settle in Calhoun County there is evidence of troubled relations between the European settlers and the Native Americans. There are two known cases on kidnapping of settler's children. One being the three-year-old son of Jacob Pruden. Mr. Pruden settled in the county in 1829 near what was called the old Seuier place, about five miles below the present site of Hardin. The boy was recaptured from the Native Americans five days after he had been taken, and had not been harmed. The second case was the kidnapping of Joe DeGerlia, the son of Antoine DeGerlia, Sr., the first settler in the French Hollow area. Mr. DeGerlia had not yet finished building his home, when his small son, Joe, was taken, however the family oral history may suggest Joe was bartered or sold. Nearly thirty years later a man who was acquainted with the history of the DeGerlia family was traveling among the tribes of the Indian Territory, and there he heard the story of a boy that had been kidnapped many years before from a place not far from where the Illinois River flows into the Mississippi. He investigated the story and found that the boy was Joe DeGerlia of a family in Calhoun. Joe had been taught the Native's language and had grown to manhood among the remnants of the tribe that had taken him southwest. Joe returned to Calhoun, married, and lived in the French Hollow area. The descendants of the DeGerlia family are still living on the same land Antoine DeGerlia settled over 200 years ago.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n\nThe most well-known historical event to impact Calhoun County is likely the Great Flood of 1993. Calhoun County is a peninsula nestled between the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, which both saw record flooding during 1993. The Great Flood of 1993, the name it is now known as, impacted several villages in Calhoun and completely destroyed the village of East Hardin which once sat across the Joe Page Bridge when the Nutwood levee broke in August 1993. The flood also closed all crossings over the rivers in the county including the bridge in Hardin and all ferries, leaving residents without access to groceries, gasoline, or other supplies. All supplies needed had to be flown in via helicopter or retrieved on a 2 hour long drive north via the only road existing Calhoun without a water passage or was not covered by flood water. The Great Flood of 1993 was devastating to Calhoun County because it destroyed homes, infrastructure, and caused many residents to leave. The population of the county has yet to recover.\n\n==Marquette and Joliet Exploration==\n\nIn the town of Grafton, IL, downriver from Calhoun County, a statue was placed to mark where Marquette and Joliet are claimed to have landed during their famous exploration. They base their claims upon one of Marquette's diary entries. In the entry Marquette mentions that they entered the mouth of the Illinois River early in the morning, which would mean that the party had camped somewhere below the mouth during the previous evening. The territory about Grafton is high and a desirable place to camp, while the land opposite, on the Missouri side is low and swampy and would have made an undesirable camping place. However, local historians in Calhoun County claim that the true stopping point of the expedition is a place now called \"Perrin's Ledge\", located several miles above Kampsville, IL. Their claims seem to be much better supported by Marquette's diary where he writes, \"We entered the mouth of the Illinois River very early in the morning\", and further on he says: \"We spent the night with some friendly Indians.\" From other parts of the diary we find that the party was traveling about twenty -five miles a day up the Mississippi River, but it is likely that they made better time on the Illinois River because there would be less current. If they were traveling at a rate of slightly better than twenty-five miles a day and entered the river early in the morning (this was the last week in August) they would have been in the Kampsville area by evening. At the place now called \"Perrin's Ledge\" several large Indian mounds are to be found and the first settlers in this part of the county found evidences to show that a small Indian village had been located here. Here at the ledge, the bluff is very near to the water and the rocks project themselves in such a manner that they can be seen for miles down the river. From a distance they have the appearance of the walls of a castle. There can be little doubt that it was at this place that the Marquette-Joliet party stopped for the night.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|284|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|254|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|30|sqmi}} (10.5%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\nCalhoun County is a narrow {{convert|37|mi|km|adj=on}}-long peninsula of mostly high, rolling ground located between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Illinois River]].  The rolling hills escaped the leveling of [[glacier]]s.\n\nCounty transportation is served by two state-operated, free [[ferry|ferries]] crossing the Illinois River (the [[Brussels, Illinois|Brussels]] Ferry in the south and the [[Kampsville, Illinois|Kampsville]] ferry in the north).  ''The Golden Eagle'' ferry, which is privately operated and charges a toll, crosses the Mississippi River to [[St. Charles County, Missouri]].  A bridge spans the Illinois River at [[Hardin, Illinois|Hardin]].  Land routes connect to the north to bordering [[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]].\n\nWhen transportation was mainly by river, the county had many prosperous farms and orchards. It still produces a major portion of the peach crop of Illinois, and farmers raise corn and other commodities.  The hotel in Brussels dates from 1847, when it was a stagecoach stop.\n\nTourists visit the area for the natural environment of the Illinois River valley and for its proximity to the [[Great River Road]] on the Illinois side.  It includes part of the [[Two Rivers National Wildlife Refuge]] and attracts thousands of birds in [[bird migration|migration]] seasons as part of the [[Mississippi Flyway]].

Calhoun County is at the tip of the peninsula formed by the courses of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] rivers above their confluence and is almost completely surrounded by water.

It was named for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C. Calhoun]], in addition to the Calhoun family that was prominent in the area at the time. The southern side of the county, covered in thick forest, was untouched until the population began to expand in the late 1840s with the arrival of [[German people|German]] immigrants. Land was cleared for farming, exporting lumber, and constructing spacious log barns, typically {{convert|200|sqft|m2}} in size, which were a \"trademark of successful German farmers.\"<ref>{{cite journal | author = Price, H. Wayne | title = The Double-Crib Log Barns of Calhoun County | journal = Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society | volume = 73 | issue = 2 | date = Summer 1980 | pages = 140\u2013160}}</ref>\n\n[[image: Calhoun County Illinois 1825.png|Calhoun County at the time of its creation in 1825.]]\n\nThe territory was originally settled by [[Indigenous people of North America|indigenous people]] who occupied the resource-rich river valleys near waterways.  The remains of their occupation have provided some of the most valuable [[archaeological]] information in the country.  The county's archaeological record chronicles more than 10,000 years of continuous human occupation by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].\n\nIn 1680, French explorer Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle recorded in his diary historic Native American raids by the Iroquois against the Illinois tribes along the Illinois River. La Salle recounts the aftermath of a massacre of the Illinois by the Iroquois in South Calhoun County writing, \"As the French drew near to the mouth of the Illinois, they saw a meadow to the right, and, on the farthest verge, several human figures erect, yet motionless. They landed and cautiously examined the place. The long grass was trampled down and all around were strewn the relics of the hideous orgies which formed the ordinary sequel of an Iroquois victory. The figures they had seen were the half consumed bodies of women still bound to the stakes where they had been tortured. Other sights there were, too revolting for record. All the remains were of women and children; the men, it seems, had fled, and left them to their fate. The French descended the river and soon came to the mouth.\"<ref name=\"archive.org\">https://archive.org/stream/historyofcalhoun00carp/historyofcalhoun00carp_djvu.txt</ref> The massacre is noted as taking place in the last week of November, 1680, about a mile above the  site of the Deer Plain Ferry which is no longer in operation, at a place now known as Marshall's Landing. Many skulls, parts of skeletons, and weapons have still been found near this spot by farmers during plowing.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n \nThe first European settler to make his home in what is now Calhoun County was a man only known today by his last name, O'Neal. He came in the year 1801 and settled in the south part of the county at Point Precinct at what has been called \"Two Branches\". Although his name might have one assume differently, O'Neal was a French trapper and had made his way there from Acadia. O'Neal lived in Point Precinct a number of years before any other European settlers came to that region, and when they did come he refused to mingle with them. He lived in a small cave which he had dug, and which was located about a quarter of a mile from the Mississippi River. He continued to live in this cave until his death in 1842, and after that he was referred to as \"The Hermit\" due to the fact that he would not visit the other settlers or allow them to come to his place. In 1850, Soloman Lammy, who then owned the farm upon which the cave was located.\n\nThe next settlers to come to the area were French trappers and people of mixed ancestry, who started a community about a mile above what was called the Deep Plain Ferry, on the Illinois River, in the southern part of the county. They remained until about 1815 when they were driven out by the very high water. Another French settlement was located at Cap au Gris (which means Cape of Grit or Grindstone). This place was located at the site of what was once the West Point Ferry, in Richwoods Precinct. The French settlers who lived here came sometime after 1800 and by the year 1811 there were 20 families, who had a small village on the bank of the river, and cultivated a common field of about 500 acres. The field was located on the level land about a mile from the site of their town. One writer said that these families were driven away by the Native Americans in 1814, but there is some doubt as to the accuracy of the statement as John Shaw who took part in battles with the natives in the region and was a community leader at the time does not mention in his writings any harm coming to the settlers at Cap au Gris.\n\nAs early pioneers continued to settle in Calhoun County there is evidence of troubled relations between the European settlers and the Native Americans. There are two known cases on kidnapping of settler's children. One being the three year old son of Jacob Pruden. Mr. Pruden settled in the county in 1829 near what was called the old Seuier place, about five miles below the present site of Hardin. The boy was recaptured from the Native Americans five days after he had been taken, and had not been harmed. The second case was the kidnapping of Joe DeGerlia, the son of Antoine DeGerlia, Sr., the first settler in the French Hollow area. Mr. DeGerlia had not yet finished building his home, when his small son, Joe, was taken, however the family oral history may suggest Joe was bartered or sold. Nearly thirty years later a man who was acquainted with the history of the DeGerlia family was traveling among the tribes of the Indian Territory, and there he heard the story of a boy that had been kidnapped many years before from a place not far from where the Illinois River flows into the Mississippi. He investigated the story and found that the boy was Joe DeGerlia of a family in Calhoun. Joe had been taught the Native's language and had grown to manhood among the remnants of the tribe that had taken him southwest. Joe returned to Calhoun, married, and lived in the French Hollow area. The descendants of the DeGerlia family are still living on the same land Antoine DeGerlia settled over 200 years ago.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n\nThe most well-known historical event to impact Calhoun County is likely the Great Flood of 1993. Calhoun County is a peninsula nestled between the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, which both saw record flooding during 1993. The Great Flood of 1993, the name it is now known as, impacted several villages in Calhoun and completely destroyed the village of East Hardin which once sat across the Joe Page Bridge when the Nutwood levee broke in August 1993. The flood also closed all crossings over the rivers in the county including the bridge in Hardin and all ferries, leaving residents without access to groceries, gasoline, or other supplies. All supplies needed had to be flown in via helicopter or retrieved on a 2 hour long drive north via the only road existing Calhoun without a water passage or was not covered by flood water. The Great Flood of 1993 was devastating to Calhoun County because it destroyed homes, infrastructure, and caused many residents to leave. The population of the county has yet to recover.\n\n==Marquette and Joliet Exploration==\n\nIn the town of Grafton, IL, downriver from Calhoun County, a statue was placed to mark where Marquette and Joliet are claimed to have landed during their famous exploration. They base their claims upon one of Marquette's diary entries. In the entry Marquette mentions that they entered the mouth of the Illinois River early in the morning, which would mean that the party had camped somewhere below the mouth during the previous evening. The territory about Grafton is high and a desirable place to camp, while the land opposite, on the Missouri side is low and swampy and would have made an undesirable camping place. However, local historians in Calhoun County claim that the true stopping point of the expedition is a place now called \"Perrin's Ledge\", located several miles above Kampsville, IL. Their claims seem to be much better supported by Marquette's diary where he writes, \"We entered the mouth of the Illinois River very early in the morning\", and further on he says: \"We spent the night with some friendly Indians.\" From other parts of the diary we find that the party was traveling about twenty -five miles a day up the Mississippi River, but it is likely that they made better time on the Illinois River because there would be less current. If they were traveling at a rate of slightly better than twenty-five miles a day and entered the river early in the morning (this was the last week in August) they would have been in the Kampsville area by evening. At the place now called \"Perrin's Ledge\" several large Indian mounds are to be found and the first settlers in this part of the county found evidences to show that a small Indian village had been located here. Here at the ledge, the bluff is very near to the water and the rocks project themselves in such a manner that they can be seen for miles down the river. From a distance they have the appearance of the walls of a castle. There can be little doubt that it was at this place that the Marquette-Joliet party stopped for the night.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|284|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|254|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|30|sqmi}} (10.5%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\nCalhoun County is a narrow {{convert|37|mi|km|adj=on}}-long peninsula of mostly high, rolling ground located between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Illinois River]].  The rolling hills escaped the leveling of [[glacier]]s.\n\nCounty transportation is served by two state-operated, free [[ferry|ferries]] crossing the Illinois River (the [[Brussels, Illinois|Brussels]] Ferry in the south and the [[Kampsville, Illinois|Kampsville]] ferry in the north).  ''The Golden Eagle'' ferry, which is privately operated and charges a toll, crosses the Mississippi River to [[St. Charles County, Missouri]].  A bridge spans the Illinois River at [[Hardin, Illinois|Hardin]].  Land routes connect to the north to bordering [[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]].\n\nWhen transportation was mainly by river, the county had many prosperous farms and orchards. It still produces a major portion of the peach crop of Illinois, and farmers raise corn and other commodities.  The hotel in Brussels dates from 1847, when it was a stagecoach stop.\n\nTourists visit the area for the natural environment of the Illinois River valley and for its proximity to the [[Great River Road]] on the Illinois side.  It includes part of the [[Two Rivers National Wildlife Refuge]] and attracts thousands of birds in [[bird migration|migration]] seasons as part of the [[Mississippi Flyway]].  The county has several designated historic districts in the villages and properties listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nCalhoun County was added to the [[Greater St. Louis|St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area]] in 2003, along with [[Bond County, Illinois|Bond]] and [[Macoupin County, Illinois|Macoupin]] counties in Illinois, and [[Washington County, Missouri]].\n\nThe [[Center for American Archeology]] is located in [[Kampsville, Illinois|Kampsville]] in the northern part of the county.  It has been the center for study of [[prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] culture in the area.  It has created educational opportunities for children and adults to participate in its archaeological digs.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Greene County, Illinois|Greene County]] &ndash; northeast\n*[[Jersey County, Illinois|Jersey County]] &ndash; east\n*[[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles County]], [[Missouri]] &ndash; south\n*[[Lincoln County, Missouri|Lincoln County]], [[Missouri]] &ndash; west\n*[[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]], [[Illinois]] &ndash; north\n*[[Pike County, Missouri|Pike County]], [[Missouri]] &ndash; northwest\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Two Rivers National Wildlife Refuge]] (part)\n\n===Major highways===\n* [[Image:Illinois 16.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 16]]\n* [[Image:Illinois 96.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 96]]\n* [[Image:Illinois 100.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 100]]\n* [[Image:Illinois 108.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 108]]\n\n==Climate and weather==\n{{climate chart\n|[[Hardin, Illinois]]\n|19|39|2.01\n|24|46|2.02\n|33|58|3.54\n|43|70|3.84\n|52|78|4.10\n|61|86|3.45\n|66|90|3.43\n|63|88|3.20\n|55|81|3.30\n|44|70|2.84\n|35|56|3.53\n|24|43|2.99\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0512\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Hardin, Illinois\n  |accessdate=January 27, 2011\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Hardin have ranged from a low of {{convert|19|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|90|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-24|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1979 and a record high of {{convert|116|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1954.

Cherokee leaders such as [[Major Ridge|The Ridge]] and [[William Hicks (Cherokee chief)|William Hicks]] had developed numerous productive farms in the fertile [[Oothkalooga Creek|Oothcaloga Valley]]. When the Cherokee refused to give up the remainder of their lands under the [[Indian Removal Act]], after years of land cessions to the United States for white settlers in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, President [[Andrew Jackson]] sent US troops to the northern region of Georgia to force most of the tribe to move to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River, most notably present-day [[Oklahoma]]. (See more information on [[Trail of Tears]].)\n\nIn December 1827, Georgia had already claimed the Cherokee lands that became Gordon County and other counties. A small town called \"Dawsonville\" was created and founded in the Gordon County, named for the owner of an early general store.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.kenkrakow.com/gpn/c.pdf | title=Georgia Place-Names: Their History and Origins | publisher=Winship Press | author=Krakow, Kenneth K. | year=1975 | location=Macon, GA | pages=31 | isbn=0-915430-00-2}}</ref> Dawsonville was later renamed \"Calhoun\" to honor [[U.S. Senator]] [[John C.

Voters chose a site along the railroad, so the inferior court designated Calhoun as county seat in 1851. The legislature incorporated Calhoun in an act approved on January 12, 1852.<ref>Ga. Laws 1851-52, page 419</ref>\n\nOn January 5, 1861, Georgia seceded from the Union as a prelude to the [[American Civil War]]. Calhounians joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Most warfare took place elsewhere, but on May 16, 1864, Calhoun was near where the [[Union Army|Union]] General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and Confederate General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] postured before the [[Battle of Adairsville]] during Sherman's [[Atlanta Campaign]]. Oakleigh, the home of Dr. Wall, was used by Sherman as his headquarters at that time.\n\nA tornado on March 20, 1888, leveled much of Calhoun. A devastating fire on October 23 of that year destroyed most of what remained.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REtEXQNWq6MC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA222#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Historical Gazetteer of the United States | publisher=Routledge | date=May 13, 2013 | accessdate=30 November 2013 | author=Hellmann, Paul T. | pages=222}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCalhoun is located west of the center of Gordon County at {{coord|34|30|0|N|84|56|33|W| region:US-GA_type:city}} (34.499898, -84.942584),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> along the [[Oostanaula River]] where it is joined by [[Oothkalooga Creek]].

Cherokee leaders such as [[Major Ridge|The Ridge]] and [[William Hicks (Cherokee chief)|William Hicks]] had developed numerous productive farms in the fertile [[Oothkalooga Creek|Oothcaloga Valley]]. When the Cherokee refused to give up the remainder of their lands under the [[Indian Removal Act]], after years of land cessions to the United States for white settlers in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, President [[Andrew Jackson]] sent US troops to the northern region of Georgia to force most of the tribe to move to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River, most notably present-day [[Oklahoma]]. (See more information on [[Trail of Tears]].)\n\nIn December 1827, Georgia had already claimed the Cherokee lands that became Gordon County and other counties. A small town called \"Dawsonville\" was created and founded in the Gordon County, named for the owner of an early general store.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.kenkrakow.com/gpn/c.pdf | title=Georgia Place-Names: Their History and Origins | publisher=Winship Press | author=Krakow, Kenneth K. | year=1975 | location=Macon, GA | pages=31 | isbn=0-915430-00-2}}</ref> Dawsonville was later renamed \"Calhoun\" to honor [[U.S. Senator]] [[John C.

Voters chose a site along the railroad, so the inferior court designated Calhoun as county seat in 1851. The legislature incorporated Calhoun in an act approved on January 12, 1852.<ref>Ga. Laws 1851-52, page 419</ref>\n\nOn January 5, 1861, Georgia seceded from the Union as a prelude to the [[American Civil War]]. Calhounians joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Most warfare took place elsewhere, but on May 16, 1864, Calhoun was near where the [[Union Army|Union]] General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and Confederate General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] postured before the [[Battle of Adairsville]] during Sherman's [[Atlanta Campaign]]. Oakleigh, the home of Dr. Wall, was used by Sherman as his headquarters at that time.\n\nA tornado on March 20, 1888, leveled much of Calhoun. A devastating fire on October 23 of that year destroyed most of what remained.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REtEXQNWq6MC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA222#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Historical Gazetteer of the United States | publisher=Routledge | date=May 13, 2013 | accessdate=30 November 2013 | author=Hellmann, Paul T. | pages=222}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCalhoun is located west of the center of Gordon County at {{coord|34|30|0|N|84|56|33|W| region:US-GA_type:city}} (34.499898, -84.942584),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> along the [[Oostanaula River]] where it is joined by [[Oothkalooga Creek]].
