He was educated at [[Bishop Gore School|Swansea Grammar School]], where he achieved State Scholar in 1948, and at [[King's College London]], where he earned a 1st Class Honours degree as well as a PhD, and was awarded the Millar Thomson Medal, and the Samuel Smiles Prize.<ref name=\"Who's Who 2008\">''Who's Who 2008'', p.354</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Academia===\nAfter his National Service years as a senior research fellow at the Chemical Defence Establishment Porton Down, he returned to King's College as a lecturer in Chemistry. At age 32, he became Purdie Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of St Andrews]] and, six years later, became Forbes Professor of Organic Chemistry at the [[University of Edinburgh]].\n\n===British Petroleum===\nIn 1979, Cadogan joined the former British Petroleum Company as Chief Scientist, BP Research Centre. He became its first worldwide Director of Research in 1981 and held the post until 1992. During his time at BP, he oversaw the growth in research from $60 million to $450 million. Long before global warming/CO<sub>2</sub> attained its current high profile, Cadogan initiated a $50 million programme devoted to green issues, reducing BP's huge energy usage in its production processes, including championship and chair of BP's solar photovoltaic sector. He also served as a Director of BP Chemicals International, BP Gas International, BP Venezuela; Chairman of BP Solar International, Kaldair International, BP Advanced Composites, BP Vencap; and chief executive of BP Ventures and the BP Innovation Centre.\n\nThroughout his time at BP he maintained, with generous BP support, an independent research group in the Department of Chemistry at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. The most recent publication from this team was in 2010. Parts of his research are about organic reaction mechanisms, short contact time reactions, reactive intermediates (free radicals, nitrenes and arynes), organophosphorus chemistry, and heterocyclic synthesis.\n\n==Interests==\nCadogan was particularly interested in the popularisation of science. He calculated that he has given live lecture demonstrations to over 10,000 school children and to many more via television. He took part in the first live satellite telecast from London to New Zealand, at which time he treasured the sight of more TV vans outside the Royal Institution than even outside the Arms Park for a Wales-England match. He was a Liveryman of the Salters' Company and a director of the Salters' Institute whose considerable charitable works are dedicated to the improvement of teaching of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. He was a [[Freeman of the City of London]].<ref name=\"burke\"/>\n\n==Positions and memberships==\nHe was a member of the Higher Education Funding Councils for England and was the UK Member of the Board of Governors of the European Union Joint Research Centre 1993\u20132000. He was also a member of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice (1991\u20131993) and led on scientific issues. A major change in the law enabling widespread, as opposed to very limited, use of DNA analysis ensued and was seen as the most important step forward in crime detection since the introduction of fingerprinting.\n\nCadogan served as Vice-President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and of the Royal Institution and has twice been a member of the Council of the Royal Society. He was Chairman of the Science Research Council's Chemistry Committee, a member of the Science and Engineering Research Council, and Chairman of its Science Board. He was a founding member of the Higher Education Council for Wales and was Chairman of its Research Committee. He was a Past-President of the Royal Society of Chemistry. He chaired the Defence Scientific Advisory Council for eight years and subsequently chaired the Defence Nuclear Safety Committee, also for eight years. He was a member of the Board of the Royal College of Defence Studies and the Council of the Royal College of Military Science.\n\nFrom 1979 to 2002, he was Visiting Professor of Chemistry at Imperial College, London, and from 1979 to 2007, he was Honorary Professorial Fellow in Chemistry at the University of Wales, Swansea. He was Science Policy Advisor to the Science Foundation, Ireland, from its inception until 2006.<ref name=\"Who's Who 2008\"/>\n\nHe was the first Director General of Research Councils at the Office of Science and Technology from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1998. His budget in 1998 was \u00a31.33 billion.

He was educated at [[Bishop Gore School|Swansea Grammar School]], where he achieved State Scholar in 1948, and at [[King's College London]], where he earned a 1st Class Honours degree as well as a PhD, and was awarded the Millar Thomson Medal, and the Samuel Smiles Prize.<ref name=\"Who's Who 2008\">''Who's Who 2008'', p.354</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Academia===\nAfter his National Service years as a senior research fellow at the Chemical Defence Establishment Porton Down, he returned to King's College as a lecturer in Chemistry. At age 32, he became Purdie Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of St Andrews]] and, six years later, became Forbes Professor of Organic Chemistry at the [[University of Edinburgh]].\n\n===British Petroleum===\nIn 1979, Cadogan joined the former British Petroleum Company as Chief Scientist, BP Research Centre. He became its first worldwide Director of Research in 1981 and held the post until 1992. During his time at BP, he oversaw the growth in research from $60 million to $450 million. Long before global warming/CO<sub>2</sub> attained its current high profile, Cadogan initiated a $50 million programme devoted to green issues, reducing BP's huge energy usage in its production processes, including championship and chair of BP's solar photovoltaic sector. He also served as a Director of BP Chemicals International, BP Gas International, BP Venezuela; Chairman of BP Solar International, Kaldair International, BP Advanced Composites, BP Vencap; and chief executive of BP Ventures and the BP Innovation Centre.\n\nThroughout his time at BP he maintained, with generous BP support, an independent research group in the Department of Chemistry at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. The most recent publication from this team was in 2010. Parts of his research are about organic reaction mechanisms, short contact time reactions, reactive intermediates (free radicals, nitrenes and arynes), organophosphorus chemistry, and heterocyclic synthesis.\n\n==Interests==\nCadogan was particularly interested in the popularisation of science. He calculated that he has given live lecture demonstrations to over 10,000 school children and to many more via television. He took part in the first live satellite telecast from London to New Zealand, at which time he treasured the sight of more TV vans outside the Royal Institution than even outside the Arms Park for a Wales-England match. He was a Liveryman of the Salters' Company and a director of the Salters' Institute whose considerable charitable works are dedicated to the improvement of teaching of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. He was a [[Freeman of the City of London]].<ref name=\"burke\"/>\n\n==Positions and memberships==\nHe was a member of the Higher Education Funding Councils for England and was the UK Member of the Board of Governors of the European Union Joint Research Centre 1993\u20132000. He was also a member of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice (1991\u20131993) and led on scientific issues. A major change in the law enabling widespread, as opposed to very limited, use of DNA analysis ensued and was seen as the most important step forward in crime detection since the introduction of fingerprinting.\n\nCadogan served as Vice-President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and of the Royal Institution and has twice been a member of the Council of the Royal Society. He was Chairman of the Science Research Council's Chemistry Committee, a member of the Science and Engineering Research Council, and Chairman of its Science Board. He was a founding member of the Higher Education Council for Wales and was Chairman of its Research Committee. He was a Past-President of the Royal Society of Chemistry. He chaired the Defence Scientific Advisory Council for eight years and subsequently chaired the Defence Nuclear Safety Committee, also for eight years. He was a member of the Board of the Royal College of Defence Studies and the Council of the Royal College of Military Science.\n\nFrom 1979 to 2002, he was Visiting Professor of Chemistry at Imperial College, London, and from 1979 to 2007, he was Honorary Professorial Fellow in Chemistry at the University of Wales, Swansea. He was Science Policy Advisor to the Science Foundation, Ireland, from its inception until 2006.<ref name=\"Who's Who 2008\"/>\n\nHe was the first Director General of Research Councils at the Office of Science and Technology from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1998. His budget in 1998 was \u00a31.33 billion. He was the official responsible for making the case for Science receiving the largest percentage increase among all government departments in the first comprehensive Spending Review for 1999\u20132001.
