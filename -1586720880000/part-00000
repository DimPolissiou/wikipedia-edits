Three former employees of Western Stoneware now operate the facility under the name \"WS\", Inc and have leased the building and logo from the city of Monmouth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://westernstoneware.com/about.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207224147/http://westernstoneware.com/about.php |archivedate=2011-02-07 }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nMonmouth is located at {{Coord|40|54|42|N|90|38|40|W|type:city}} (40.911531, -90.644579).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Monmouth is located in Western Illinois where US Route 34, US Route 67, Illinois Route 164, and now the new Chicago to Kansas City Expressway (Illinois Route 110) intersect.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Monmouth has a total area of {{convert|4.231|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|4.21|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 99.5%) is land and {{convert|0.021|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 0.5%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1750010\n  |title=G001 - Geographic Identifiers - 2010 Census Summary File 1\n  |accessdate=2015-12-27\n  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213042006/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1750010\n  |archive-date=2020-02-13\n  |url-status=dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 797\n|1860= 2506\n|1870= 4662\n|1880= 5000\n|1890= 5936\n|1900= 7460\n|1910= 9128\n|1920= 8116\n|1930= 8666\n|1940= 9096\n|1950= 10193\n|1960= 10372\n|1970= 11022\n|1980= 10706\n|1990= 9489\n|2000= 9841\n|2010= 9444\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8998\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 9,841 people, 3,688 households, and 2,323 families residing in the city.

The label commenced its Costello reissue program with the Polygram compilation (see above) released less than two years previously. All were [[compact disc|double-disc]] sets in slim-line [[Jewel case|jewel box]] cases, with the remaining installments in the series comprising the original studio albums on disc one, with disc two containing [[B-sides]], [[outtakes]], demo recordings, concert tracks, and previously unreleased material. The project featured the direct participation and guidance of Costello, who wrote new [[liner notes]] for each album consisting of his thoughts on the music as well as anecdotes and reminiscences from the time. Each liner note booklet also included the original lyrics. All are currently out of print.\n\nThey were released in batches of three, with the exception of ''King of America'', ''The Juliet Letters'', and ''[[The Very Best of Elvis Costello]]'', the last being an unaltered re-release of the Polygram compilation of 1999, which arrived in the stores singularly. The reissue dates are as follows:\n# 17 April 2001: ''[[The Very Best of Elvis Costello]]''\n# 11 August 2001: ''[[My Aim Is True]]'', ''[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]'', ''[[All This Useless Beauty]]''\n# 19 February 2002: ''[[This Year's Model]]'', ''[[Blood & Chocolate]]'', ''[[Brutal Youth]]''\n# 19 November 2002: ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]'', ''[[Imperial Bedroom]]'', ''[[Mighty Like a Rose]]''\n# 9 September 2003: ''[[Get Happy!! (Elvis Costello album)|Get Happy!!]]'', ''[[Trust (Elvis Costello album)|Trust]]'', ''[[Punch the Clock]]''\n# 3 August 2004: ''[[Almost Blue]]'', ''[[Goodbye Cruel World (Elvis Costello album)|Goodbye Cruel World]]'', ''[[Kojak Variety]]''\n# 26 April 2005: ''[[King of America]]''\n# 21 March 2006: ''[[The Juliet Letters]]''\n\nThe ''Almost Blue'' and ''Kojak Variety'' bonus discs were particularly notable as each contained, essentially, an entire new album's worth of material also performed but either not issued, or released as B-sides on singles originally. The ''Kojak'' bonus disc also included ten songs of the '[[George Jones]]' tape, cover songs Costello intended to induce the famed country singer to perform on a subsequent album. The ''Get Happy'' bonus disc was also of note, with 30 additional tracks, bringing the total for the two disc set to 50 songs.\n\nAt the conclusion of Rhino's reissue series (''My Aim Is True'' through ''All This Useless Beauty''), [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music Enterprises]] announced their purchase of the early Costello catalogue. This licensing acquisition covers from ''My Aim Is True'' through ''[[Blood & Chocolate]]'', excluding the [[Warner Bros.]] albums (''Spike'' through ''All This Useless Beauty''). These albums had all been re-released on Rhino, a [[Warner Music Group]] subsidiary. The press release said: \"[l]eading the industry in online marketing with a dedicated department that manages its digital and mobile business, UMe also expects to mine Costello's catalogue for ringtones, digital box sets, and more.\"<ref>[http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=149784 Press release on Marketwire].</ref> UMe announced that they would be reissuing the albums on their [[Hip-O|Hip-O Select]] label. Costello is quoted in the press release as saying, \"[I]t's great to be able to do this through a company that has not only enjoyed major success with reissues but has done them with a genuine emphasis on quality.\"<ref>Press release on Marketwire.</ref> This reissue series will mark the fourth release of his Stiff/Radar/Demon catalogue (released by [[Columbia Records]] in the US) on compact disc.\n\n==Singles==\nThe following is a list of all Costello's commercially available singles.

The label commenced its Costello reissue program with the Polygram compilation (see above) released less than two years previously. All were [[compact disc|double-disc]] sets in slim-line [[Jewel case|jewel box]] cases, with the remaining installments in the series comprising the original studio albums on disc one, with disc two containing [[B-sides]], [[outtakes]], demo recordings, concert tracks, and previously unreleased material. The project featured the direct participation and guidance of Costello, who wrote new [[liner notes]] for each album consisting of his thoughts on the music as well as anecdotes and reminiscences from the time. Each liner note booklet also included the original lyrics. All are currently out of print.\n\nThey were released in batches of three, with the exception of ''King of America'', ''The Juliet Letters'', and ''[[The Very Best of Elvis Costello]]'', the last being an unaltered re-release of the Polygram compilation of 1999, which arrived in the stores singularly. The reissue dates are as follows:\n# 17 April 2001: ''[[The Very Best of Elvis Costello]]''\n# 11 August 2001: ''[[My Aim Is True]]'', ''[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]'', ''[[All This Useless Beauty]]''\n# 19 February 2002: ''[[This Year's Model]]'', ''[[Blood & Chocolate]]'', ''[[Brutal Youth]]''\n# 19 November 2002: ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]'', ''[[Imperial Bedroom]]'', ''[[Mighty Like a Rose]]''\n# 9 September 2003: ''[[Get Happy!! (Elvis Costello album)|Get Happy!!]]'', ''[[Trust (Elvis Costello album)|Trust]]'', ''[[Punch the Clock]]''\n# 3 August 2004: ''[[Almost Blue]]'', ''[[Goodbye Cruel World (Elvis Costello album)|Goodbye Cruel World]]'', ''[[Kojak Variety]]''\n# 26 April 2005: ''[[King of America]]''\n# 21 March 2006: ''[[The Juliet Letters]]''\n\nThe ''Almost Blue'' and ''Kojak Variety'' bonus discs were particularly notable as each contained, essentially, an entire new album's worth of material also performed but either not issued, or released as B-sides on singles originally. The ''Kojak'' bonus disc also included ten songs of the '[[George Jones]]' tape, cover songs Costello intended to induce the famed country singer to perform on a subsequent album. The ''Get Happy'' bonus disc was also of note, with 30 additional tracks, bringing the total for the two disc set to 50 songs.\n\nAt the conclusion of Rhino's reissue series (''My Aim Is True'' through ''All This Useless Beauty''), [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music Enterprises]] announced their purchase of the early Costello catalogue. This licensing acquisition covers from ''My Aim Is True'' through ''[[Blood & Chocolate]]'', excluding the [[Warner Bros.]] albums (''Spike'' through ''All This Useless Beauty''). These albums had all been re-released on Rhino, a [[Warner Music Group]] subsidiary. The press release said: \"[l]eading the industry in online marketing with a dedicated department that manages its digital and mobile business, UMe also expects to mine Costello's catalogue for ringtones, digital box sets, and more.\"<ref>[http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=149784 Press release on Marketwire].</ref> UMe announced that they would be reissuing the albums on their [[Hip-O|Hip-O Select]] label. Costello is quoted in the press release as saying, \"[I]t's great to be able to do this through a company that has not only enjoyed major success with reissues but has done them with a genuine emphasis on quality.\"<ref>Press release on Marketwire.</ref> This reissue series will mark the fourth release of his Stiff/Radar/Demon catalogue (released by [[Columbia Records]] in the US) on compact disc.\n\n==Singles==\nThe following is a list of all Costello's commercially available singles.

{"title_page": "\u00c9mile Henry (anarchist)", "text_new": "{{short description|French anarchist}}\n[[Image:henry-emile.jpg|thumb|\u00c9mile Henry]]\n'''\u00c9mile Henry''' (26 September 1872 in [[Barcelona]] \u2013 21 May 1894 in [[Paris]], [[French Third Republic|France]]) was a French [[anarchist]], who on 12 February 1894 detonated a bomb at the [[Caf\u00e9 Terminus]] in the Parisian [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] killing one person and wounding twenty.  \n\nThough his activity in the anarchist movement was limited, he garnered much attention as a result of his crimes and of his age. He was also seen as one of the first people of a growing group of [[revolutionaries]] (largely anarchist) who subscribed to the doctrine of the \"[[propaganda of the deed]]\", which would later take the life of many [[governmental]] figures.  \n\nHenry grew up in a [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family with anarchist sympathies. They were exiled to Spain for a time because his father, Fortune Henry, was a [[communard]] (a supporter of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]]). As a result, Henry was born in Barcelona and regaled from an early age with stories of state oppression. These anti-state attitudes were confirmed when the Spanish authorities confiscated the Henry family's property due to their political beliefs. Henry's father was forced to take a miserable factory job and died of mercury poisoning when Henry was only 10 years old. The family returned to France and Henry's brother, an anarchist, eventually helped him establish connections with [[France|French]] revolutionary circles. Henry passed the writing portion of the entrance exam for the prestigious [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]], but he failed his oral exams and went on to find work as a trainee for an engineering firm.\n\nHenry was furious over the state execution of fellow anarchist [[Auguste Vaillant]]. Motivated by the [[French Third Republic]]'s endemic [[political corruption]], Vaillant carried out a bomb attack on the French [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]] on 9 December 1893. Although there were no fatalities, twenty deputies were injured. Henry took it upon himself to avenge Vaillant's death.\n\n[[Image:Attentat de l'h\u00f4tel Terminus.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry's capture]]  \nHe saw the [[caf\u00e9]] as a representation of the [[bourgeoisie]] itself and his intent was to kill as many people as possible in the bombing. When brought to trial for these acts, he was asked by the courts why he had needlessly harmed so many innocent people, to which he replied, \"\u2026there are no innocent bourgeois\", adding that his acts caused the \"insolent triumphs\" of the bourgeoisie to be shattered, and \"its golden calf would shake violently on its pedestal, until the final blow knocks it into the gutter and pools of blood.\"\n\nThis was not Henry's first terrorist act; already on November 8, 1892, he had placed a time bomb at the offices of the [[Carmaux Mining Company]], which had exploded when the police removed it, killing five officers in the commissariat on the rue des Bons-enfants. Indeed, after his arrest for the Terminus bombing, Henry took credit for a series of other bombings in Paris, and in his apartment was found material to make many more explosive devices.\n\nHenry was executed by [[guillotine]] on 21 May 1894.<ref>{{Cite news\n  |title=The guillotine's sure work; Emile Henry's head severed from his body\n  |journal=[[The New York Times]]\n  |date=21 May 1894\n  |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A13F9345D15738DDDA80A94DD405B8485F0D3\n}}</ref> His last words were reputed to be \"''Courage, camarades! Vive l'anarchie!''\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/henry/biography.htm | title=Emile Henry: Biography | publisher=[[marxists.org]] | author=Mitch Abidor}}</ref>\n\n==Excerpts of Henry's address to the jury==\n<blockquote>I became an anarchist only recently. It was no longer ago than around mid-1891 that I threw myself into the revolutionary movement. Previously, I had lived in [[Social circle|circles]] wholly permeated with the established morality. I had been accustomed to respecting and even cherishing the principles of the nation, family, authority and property.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>But those educating the present generation all too often forget one thing \u2013 that life, indiscreet with its struggles and setbacks, its injustices and iniquities, sees to it that the scales are removed from the eyes of the ignorant and that they are opened to reality. Which was the case with me, as it is with everyone. I had been told that this life was easy and largely open to intelligent, vagarious people, and experience showed me that only cynics and lackeys can get a good seat at the banquet.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>I had been told that society\u2019s institutions were founded on justice and equality, and all around me I could see nothing but lies and treachery. Everyday I was disabused further. Everywhere I went, I witnessed the same pain in some, the same delights in others. It did not take me long to realize that the same great words that I had been raised to venerate: honor, devotion, duty were merely a mask hiding the most shameful turpitude.</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote>The factory-owner amassing a huge fortune on the back of the labor of his workers who lacked everything was an upright gentleman. The deputy, the minister whose hands were forever outstretched for bribes were committed to the public good. The officer testing his new model rifle on seven-year-old children had done his duty well, and in open parliament the premier offered him his congratulation. Everything I could see turned my stomach and my mind fastened on criticism of social organization. The criticism has been voiced too often to need rehearsing by me. Suffice it say that I turned into an enemy of a society which I held to be criminal.</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote>Momentarily attracted by socialism, I wasted no time in distancing myself from that party. My love of liberty was too great, my regard for individual initiative too great, my repudiation for feathering one\u2019s nest too definite for me to enlist in the numbered army of the fourth estate. Also, I saw that, essentially, socialism changes the established order not one jot. It retains the authoritarian principle, and this principle, despite what supposed free-thinkers may say about it, is nothing but an ancient relic of the belief in a higher power.</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote>(...)In the merciless war that we have declared on the bourgeoisie, we ask no mercy. We mete out death and we must face it. For that reason I await your verdict with indifference. I know that mine  will not be the last head you will sever (...)

He was also seen as one of the first people of a growing group of [[revolutionaries]] (largely anarchist) who subscribed to the doctrine of the \"[[propaganda of the deed]]\", which would later take the life of many [[governmental]] figures.  \n\nHenry grew up in a [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family with anarchist sympathies. They were exiled to Spain for a time because his father, Fortune Henry, was a [[communard]] (a supporter of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]]). As a result, Henry was born in Barcelona and regaled from an early age with stories of state oppression. These anti-state attitudes were confirmed when the Spanish authorities confiscated the Henry family's property due to their political beliefs. Henry's father was forced to take a miserable factory job and died of mercury poisoning when Henry was only 10 years old. The family returned to France and Henry's brother, an anarchist, eventually helped him establish connections with [[France|French]] revolutionary circles. Henry passed the writing portion of the entrance exam for the prestigious [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]], but he failed his oral exams and went on to find work as a trainee for an engineering firm.\n\nHenry was furious over the state execution of fellow anarchist [[Auguste Vaillant]]. Motivated by the [[French Third Republic]]'s endemic [[political corruption]], Vaillant carried out a bomb attack on the French [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]] on 9 December 1893. Although there were no fatalities, twenty deputies were injured. Henry took it upon himself to avenge Vaillant's death.\n\n[[Image:Attentat de l'h\u00f4tel Terminus.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry's capture]]  \nHe saw the [[caf\u00e9]] as a representation of the [[bourgeoisie]] itself and his intent was to kill as many people as possible in the bombing. When brought to trial for these acts, he was asked by the courts why he had needlessly harmed so many innocent people, to which he replied, \"\u2026there are no innocent bourgeois\", adding that his acts caused the \"insolent triumphs\" of the bourgeoisie to be shattered, and \"its golden calf would shake violently on its pedestal, until the final blow knocks it into the gutter and pools of blood.\"\n\nThis was not Henry's first terrorist act; already on November 8, 1892, he had placed a time bomb at the offices of the [[Carmaux Mining Company]], which had exploded when the police removed it, killing five officers in the commissariat on the rue des Bons-enfants. Indeed, after his arrest for the Terminus bombing, Henry took credit for a series of other bombings in Paris, and in his apartment was found material to make many more explosive devices.\n\nHenry was executed by [[guillotine]] on 21 May 1894.<ref>{{Cite news\n  |title=The guillotine's sure work; Emile Henry's head severed from his body\n  |journal=[[New York Times]]\n  |date=21 May 1894\n  |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A13F9345D15738DDDA80A94DD405B8485F0D3\n}}</ref> His last words were reputed to be \"''Courage, camarades!

It was no longer ago than around mid-1891 that I threw myself into the revolutionary movement. Previously, I had lived in [[Social circle|circles]] wholly permeated with the established morality. I had been accustomed to respecting and even cherishing the principles of the nation, family, authority and property.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>But those educating the present generation all too often forget one thing \u2013 that life, indiscreet with its struggles and setbacks, its injustices and iniquities, sees to it that the scales are removed from the eyes of the ignorant and that they are opened to reality. Which was the case with me, as it is with everyone. I had been told that this life was easy and largely open to intelligent, vagarious people, and experience showed me that only cynics and lackeys can get a good seat at the banquet.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>I had been told that society\u2019s institutions were founded on justice and equality, and all around me I could see nothing but lies and treachery. Everyday I was disabused further. Everywhere I went, I witnessed the same pain in some, the same delights in others. It did not take me long to realize that the same great words that I had been raised to venerate: honor, devotion, duty were merely a mask hiding the most shameful turpitude.</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote>The factory-owner amassing a huge fortune on the back of the labor of his workers who lacked everything was an upright gentleman. The deputy, the minister whose hands were forever outstretched for bribes were committed to the public good. The officer testing his new model rifle on seven-year-old children had done his duty well, and in open parliament the premier offered him his congratulation. Everything I could see turned my stomach and my mind fastened on criticism of social organization. The criticism has been voiced too often to need rehearsing by me. Suffice it say that I turned into an enemy of a society which I held to be criminal.</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote>Momentarily attracted by socialism, I wasted no time in distancing myself from that party. My love of liberty was too great, my regard for individual initiative too great, my repudiation for feathering one\u2019s nest too definite for me to enlist in the numbered army of the fourth estate. Also, I saw that, essentially, socialism changes the established order not one jot. It retains the authoritarian principle, and this principle, despite what supposed free-thinkers may say about it, is nothing but an ancient relic of the belief in a higher power.</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote>(...)In the merciless war that we have declared on the bourgeoisie, we ask no mercy. We mete out death and we must face it. For that reason I await your verdict with indifference. I know that mine  will not be the last head you will sever (...) You will add more names to the bloody roll call of our dead.</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote>[[Haymarket affair|Hanged in Chicago]], [[Max H\u00f6del|beheaded in Germany]], garroted in Xerez, [[Anarchism in Spain#Early_turmoil.2C_1873_to_1900|shot in Barcelona]], [[Ravachol|guillotined in Montbrison]] and in [[Paris Commune|Paris]], our dead are many; but you have not been able to destroy anarchy.

The park sits directly adjacent to [[Riverbend Music Center]] and [[Belterra Park Gaming & Entertainment Center|Belterra Park]]. Beginning in 1870, the original owner called the area '''Parker's Grove''', which was later renamed '''Ohio Grove, The Coney Island of the West''' after the Ohio Grove Corporation purchased the park in 1886. The name was shortened to Coney Island the following season. Growth over the years spawned dozens of rides and attractions which led to its popularity as an amusement destination. \n\nConey Island was sold to [[Taft Broadcasting]] in 1969 with intentions to move the park to a new, larger destination away from frequent flooding. The new park opened as [[Kings Island]] in 1972, although Coney Island's Sunlite Pool remained opened. Rides eventually returned, and additional investments and improvements were made to the Sunlite Pool area. These changes, along with the opening of the nearby Riverbend Music Center in 1984, allowed the park's attendance and profitability to recover. In 2019, Coney Island focused its operations exclusively on its water park amenities and removed other amusement rides.\n\n== History ==\nConey Island's founding dates back to 1867 when apple-farmer James Parker purchased {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of land along the shores of the [[Ohio River]]. Parker soon realized the popularity of the farm's location, and that renting it out was more profitable than his apple orchard. He named it Parker's Grove and eventually added a dining hall, dancing hall, and bowling alley. He later sold the land in 1886 for $17,500 to a company called Ohio Grove Corporation headed by two steamboat captains. For the opening on June 21, 1886, the name was officially changed to \"Ohio Grove, The Coney Island of the West\" in an effort to link the park with the famous [[Coney Island|New York destination]]. With its riverfront location, the riverboat became the most popular method of transportation for park visitors. In 1887, \"Ohio Grove\" was completely dropped from the name as the park became known simply as \"Coney Island\".<ref name=\"CIhistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.coneyislandpark.com/history.php |title=Coney Island History |accessdate=2010-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806064523/http://www.coneyislandpark.com/history.php |archive-date=2012-08-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Moonlite Gardens.jpg|thumb|left|Moonlite Gardens at Coney Island]]\nOver the years, Coney Island became a full-fledged amusement park, complete with rides and [[carnival]] games. In that capacity, Coney Island was a Cincinnati institution. However, the park's proximity to the river made it prone to frequent flooding. In 1968, park management entered into talks with [[Taft Broadcasting]] for the purpose of developing a new park on higher ground. Taft responded by buying Coney Island outright in 1969, and construction began the following year on a new site located in [[Deerfield Township, Warren County, Ohio|Deerfield Township]] of [[Warren County, Ohio|Warren County]] {{convert|25|mi|km}} north of Cincinnati along Interstate 71. Coney Island closed its amusements on September 6, 1971, as most of its rides were moved to the newly completed [[Kings Island]] theme park.\n\nAfter Kings Island opened in 1972, Taft Broadcasting intended to sell Coney Island's land for redevelopment. However, with the company's decision to open another theme park in Virginia ([[Kings Dominion]]) and its acquisition of [[Carowinds]] on the North Carolina-South Carolina border, the property's redevelopment became a low priority. Less than two years after closing, Coney Island reopened permanently in 1973. The park was only a shadow of its former self but still featured several popular attractions. The Sunlite Pool \u2014 still the largest recirculating swimming pool in the world<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8S1LFG_KAEC&lpg=PA384&dq=insider%20cincinnati&pg=PA166#v=onepage&q=insider%20cincinnati&f=false | title=Insiders' Guide to Cincinnati | publisher=Globe Pequot | date=2007 | accessdate=2013-05-08 | author=Felix Winternitz & Sacha DeVroomen Bellman | pages=166}}</ref> \u2014 was one of those attractions that helped Coney Island remain a popular summertime destination.\n\nThe park donated {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of land for the construction of [[Riverbend Music Center]] which opened in 1984. The land was the former location of the Wildcat and Shooting Star roller coasters. The Riverbend amphitheater serves as the summer home of the Cincinnati [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra|Symphony]] and [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra|Pops]] Orchestras, as well as a concert venue for other musical acts. In 1991, Coney Island was purchased by Cincinnati businessman Ronald Walker. No longer held back by a corporate entity, management has been able to restore Coney Island as a traditional amusement park with familiar rides such as the \"[[Tilt-A-Whirl]]\", [[bumper cars]], carnival games and musical shows.<ref>Jacques, Jr., Charles J., ''Cincinnati's Coney Island: America's Finest Amusement Park'', 2002, Amusement Park Journal ({{ISBN|0-9614392-7-0}})</ref>\n\nConey Island announced plans to remove all amusement rides from the park on September 21, 2019, but will continue to operate as a water park featuring the Sunlite Pool and other water-related attractions.<ref name=\"Shutting Down\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.whio.com/news/local/just-amusement-park-shutting-down-all-rides-for-good/GXZuNhpT67F5VpgfbyZAGP/|title=JUST IN: Amusement park shutting down all rides for good|publisher=WHIO-TV via WCPO|date=September 9, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> The decision was based on attendance, consumer feedback, and rising costs associated with maintaining ride operation.<ref name=\"Shutdown Explanation - WKRC\">{{cite web |last1=Underwood |first1=Brad |title=Here's why Coney Island is getting rid of all of its rides |url=https://local12.com/news/local/coney-island-is-getting-rid-of-all-of-its-rides-heres-why |publisher=WKRC |accessdate=September 10, 2019 |date=September 9, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Shutdown Explanation - CB Courier\">{{cite news |last1=Caproni |first1=Erin |title=EXCLUSIVE: Here\u2019s why Coney Island\u2019s rides are going away and what\u2019s next for the historic park |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2019/09/09/exclusive-here-s-why-coney-island-s-rides-are.html |accessdate=September 10, 2019 |work=Cincinnati Business Courier |date=September 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Sunlite Water Adventure Slides and Attractions===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Ride\n!Year Opened\n\n!Description\n|-\n|The Twister\n|2009\n|The Twister is the replacement of the Zoom Flume.

Beginning in 1870, the original owner called the area '''Parker's Grove''', which was later renamed '''Ohio Grove, The Coney Island of the West''' after the Ohio Grove Corporation purchased the park in 1886. The name was shortened to Coney Island the following season. Growth over the years spawned dozens of rides and attractions which led to its popularity as an amusement destination. \n\nConey Island was sold to [[Taft Broadcasting]] in 1969 with intentions to move the park to a new, larger destination away from frequent flooding. The new park opened as [[Kings Island]] in 1972, although Coney Island's Sunlite Pool remained opened. Rides eventually returned, and additional investments and improvements were made to the Sunlite Pool area. These changes, along with the opening of the nearby Riverbend Music Center in 1984, allowed the park's attendance and profitability to recover. In 2019, Coney Island announced plans to remove all amusement rides with intentions to focus exclusively on its water park amenities.\n\n== History ==\nConey Island's founding dates back to 1867 when apple-farmer James Parker purchased {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of land along the shores of the [[Ohio River]]. Parker soon realized the popularity of the farm's location, and that renting it out was more profitable than his apple orchard. He named it Parker's Grove and eventually added a dining hall, dancing hall, and bowling alley. He later sold the land in 1886 for $17,500 to a company called Ohio Grove Corporation headed by two steamboat captains. For the opening on June 21, 1886, the name was officially changed to \"Ohio Grove, The Coney Island of the West\" in an effort to link the park with the famous [[Coney Island|New York destination]]. With its riverfront location, the riverboat became the most popular method of transportation for park visitors. In 1887, \"Ohio Grove\" was completely dropped from the name as the park became known simply as \"Coney Island\".<ref name=\"CIhistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.coneyislandpark.com/history.php |title=Coney Island History |accessdate=2010-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806064523/http://www.coneyislandpark.com/history.php |archive-date=2012-08-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Moonlite Gardens.jpg|thumb|left|Moonlite Gardens at Coney Island]]\nOver the years, Coney Island became a full-fledged amusement park, complete with rides and [[carnival]] games. In that capacity, Coney Island was a Cincinnati institution. However, the park's proximity to the river made it prone to frequent flooding. In 1968, park management entered into talks with [[Taft Broadcasting]] for the purpose of developing a new park on higher ground. Taft responded by buying Coney Island outright in 1969, and construction began the following year on a new site located in [[Deerfield Township, Warren County, Ohio|Deerfield Township]] of [[Warren County, Ohio|Warren County]] {{convert|25|mi|km}} north of Cincinnati along Interstate 71. Coney Island closed its amusements on September 6, 1971, as most of its rides were moved to the newly completed [[Kings Island]] theme park.\n\nAfter Kings Island opened in 1972, Taft Broadcasting intended to sell Coney Island's land for redevelopment. However, with the company's decision to open another theme park in Virginia ([[Kings Dominion]]) and its acquisition of [[Carowinds]] on the North Carolina-South Carolina border, the property's redevelopment became a low priority. Less than two years after closing, Coney Island reopened permanently in 1973. The park was only a shadow of its former self but still featured several popular attractions. The Sunlite Pool \u2014 still the largest recirculating swimming pool in the world<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8S1LFG_KAEC&lpg=PA384&dq=insider%20cincinnati&pg=PA166#v=onepage&q=insider%20cincinnati&f=false | title=Insiders' Guide to Cincinnati | publisher=Globe Pequot | date=2007 | accessdate=2013-05-08 | author=Felix Winternitz & Sacha DeVroomen Bellman | pages=166}}</ref> \u2014 was one of those attractions that helped Coney Island remain a popular summertime destination.\n\nThe park donated {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of land for the construction of [[Riverbend Music Center]] which opened in 1984. The land was the former location of the Wildcat and Shooting Star roller coasters. The Riverbend amphitheater serves as the summer home of the Cincinnati [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra|Symphony]] and [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra|Pops]] Orchestras, as well as a concert venue for other musical acts. In 1991, Coney Island was purchased by Cincinnati businessman Ronald Walker. No longer held back by a corporate entity, management has been able to restore Coney Island as a traditional amusement park with familiar rides such as the \"[[Tilt-A-Whirl]]\", [[bumper cars]], carnival games and musical shows.<ref>Jacques, Jr., Charles J., ''Cincinnati's Coney Island: America's Finest Amusement Park'', 2002, Amusement Park Journal ({{ISBN|0-9614392-7-0}})</ref>\n\nConey Island announced plans to remove all amusement rides from the park on September 21, 2019, but will continue to operate as a water park featuring the Sunlite Pool and other water-related attractions.<ref name=\"Shutting Down\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.whio.com/news/local/just-amusement-park-shutting-down-all-rides-for-good/GXZuNhpT67F5VpgfbyZAGP/|title=JUST IN: Amusement park shutting down all rides for good|publisher=WHIO-TV via WCPO|date=September 9, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> The decision was based on attendance, consumer feedback, and rising costs associated with maintaining ride operation.<ref name=\"Shutdown Explanation - WKRC\">{{cite web |last1=Underwood |first1=Brad |title=Here's why Coney Island is getting rid of all of its rides |url=https://local12.com/news/local/coney-island-is-getting-rid-of-all-of-its-rides-heres-why |publisher=WKRC |accessdate=September 10, 2019 |date=September 9, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Shutdown Explanation - CB Courier\">{{cite news |last1=Caproni |first1=Erin |title=EXCLUSIVE: Here\u2019s why Coney Island\u2019s rides are going away and what\u2019s next for the historic park |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2019/09/09/exclusive-here-s-why-coney-island-s-rides-are.html |accessdate=September 10, 2019 |work=Cincinnati Business Courier |date=September 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Sunlite Water Adventure Slides and Attractions===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Ride\n!Year Opened\n\n!Description\n|-\n|The Twister\n|2009\n|The Twister is the replacement of the Zoom Flume.

They are three seductive female [[vampire]] \"sisters\" who reside with [[Count Dracula]] in his castle in [[Transylvania]], where they entrance men with their beauty and charm, and then proceed to feed upon them. Dracula provides them with victims to devour, mainly implied to be infants.\n\nLike Dracula, they are the [[undead|living dead]], repulsed by sunlight, garlic and religious objects. In chapter three of the novel, two are described as having dark hair and eyes, and the other as being fair, with blonde hair and blue eyes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pagebypagebooks.com/Bram_Stoker/Dracula/CHAPTER_3_p8.html|title=Dracula, by Bram Stoker; CHAPTER 3 Page 8|last=Stoker|first=Bram|date=|website=pagebypagebooks.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n\nIn the novel the three vampire women are not individually named. Collectively, they are known as the \"sisters\", and are at one point described as the \"[[Three Witches|weird sisters]]\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Bram|last=Stoker|authorlink=Bram Stoker|title=Dracula|date=1897|publisher=[[Constable & Robinson]]|location=London, England|isbn=978-1503261389|page=47|quote=I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters.}}</ref>\n\nThe origin and identity of the Sisters, as well as the true nature of their relationship with Count Dracula, is never revealed. One of the three may have been identified in the short story \"[[Dracula's Guest]]\", as the vampire named [[Countess Dolengen]] of [[Graz|Gratz]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Bram|last=Stoker|authorlink=Bram Stoker|title=Dracula's Guest|pages=7\u20138|url=http://www.bramstoker.org/pdf/stories/03guest/01guest.pdf}}</ref> [[Jonathan Harker]], the protagonist of the story, encounters her at her tomb in [[Munich]]. Just as she is about to bite him, Dracula intervenes and destroys her. Then, in the form of a great wolf, he keeps Harker warm from the cold and yelps for nearby soldiers to come to their location. In the novel, Harker writes about one of the female vampires in the moment he is with them, stating, \"I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where.\" <ref>Stoker, pgs. 54\u201355}}</ref>\n        \nAlthough the three vampire women in ''Dracula'' are popularly referred to as the \"Brides of Dracula\", they are never referred to as such in the novel, instead referred to as the 'sisters'. Whether they are married to Dracula or not is never mentioned, nor are they described as having any other relation to him.\n\nThe two dark-haired vampire women are described as facially resembling the Count, in that the three have [[Aquiline nose|aquiline]] noses. It has been suggested{{By whom|date=January 2020}} from this that it may have been Stoker's intent that these two are Dracula's daughters, extending the [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] metaphor of [[vampirism]] to [[incest]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Jan B.|last=Gordon|chapter=The Transparency of Dracula|title=Bram Stoker's Dracula: Sucking Through the Century, 1897-1997|editor-first=Carol Margaret|editor-last=Davison|publisher=[[Dundurn Press]]|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|date=1997|asin=B00CMP4NA4}}</ref> When the brides first discover Harker, the blonde vampire is encouraged to feed on him first, with one of the others stating, \"Yours is the right to begin,\" signifying that she has some status over the others. This could imply that the blonde vampire is Dracula's wife or consort, and the mother of the two dark-haired women, if they are indeed his daughters. When Van Helsing discovers the sisters' tombs, the blonde's is far more opulent than the others', as if for a loved one or one of high status. Harker describes the women as \"ladies by their dress and manner\", indicating that the vampires are of high lineage, further suggesting the idea that they are Dracula's family. The blonde vampire is shown to act in a mildly rebellious manner toward Dracula, when he scolds her for attempting to feed on Harker; Dracula's reaction upon discovering the sisters with Harker is both that of a jealous husband and an angry father. The vampire women claim that Dracula does not love them, nor has he ever loved them, but Dracula insists he does love them, and shows he cares for them by providing them with victims to feed upon. However, it is not explained why he left them behind in [[Transylvania]] rather than taking them to London with him.\n\nEven though it is never specified, it is possible that the term \"sister\" wasn't meant in the literal sense and is, instead, more comparable to the relationship of the '''women''' and not as they are to Dracula. They are also depicted in the novel calling [[Mina Harker]] their sister after she is forced to drink Dracula's blood, afflicting her with vampirism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoker|first1=Bram|title=Dracula|location=Ch 27, MEMORANDUM BY ABRAHAM VAN HELSING 4 November|url=http://www.planetebook.com/ebooks/Dracula.pdf|quote=They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina. And as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and  pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water glasses, \u2018Come, sister. Come to us. Come!\u2019}}</ref> Mina and her best friend (and Dracula's future victim) [[Lucy Westenra]] also call each other sisters in the novel despite not having any blood relation. The vampire women may be his wives throughout his lifetime, descendants of his whom he turned into vampires, or simply nonspecific women he killed and turned into vampires to create more of his kind.\n\nAs vampires, the sisters are powerful in their own right; their beauty and seductive charm belie lethal, predatory interiors. Their beauty and flirtatious manner appears to be their greatest power when it comes to bewitching their victims into a trance-like state. Harker and Van Helsing are both attracted to, and yet repulsed by them. They can seemingly appear out of nowhere and are inhumanly strong, as shown when they kill Van Helsing's horses. They also have the power of flight, as seen when they fly in the air with their dresses trailing behind them.\n\nThe vampires serve as foreshadowing for the threat of vampirism in the story which, as seen with Lucy later on, includes Dracula's power of corruption over his victims once he has drained their blood and made them into vampires.\n\n==Novel==\nSometime near the beginning of the novel, after Jonathan Harker arrives in Dracula's castle, he warns Harker that if he leaves his room to never sleep in any room in the castle other than his own bedroom, but does not tell him why, clearly aware that the sisters will kill him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoker|first1=Bram|title=Dracula|location=Ch 3, Jonathan Harker's Journal|page=43|url=http://www.planetebook.com/ebooks/Dracula.pdf|quote=Let me advise you, my dear young friend. Nay, let me warn you with all seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle.}}</ref> Late one night Jonathan explores the castle and ventures to see which rooms are open to him. He finds many of the doors in the castle are locked but one room in particular he forced open, noticing that the door wasn't locked but the hinges were fallen. He enters into the furthest right wing of the castle with views from the windows overlooking the countryside and rooms with comfortable furniture. He sits at a table writing in his journal and as he felt sleepy, he remembered Dracula's warning but felt satisfied disobeying it and lays in a great couch in the corner of the room. As he believes he is sleeping he sees three women standing in the moonlight which was shining throughout the room but not casting any shadows upon the floor. More than delighted that fresh prey has entered their domain, they proceed to seduce him. Harker feels a burning desire for their lips to kiss his. As one of them begins to kiss his neck, he feels her sharp teeth barely scrape against his flesh. At that precise moment Dracula is seen grabbing her neck and hurling her away from him. Driving them back and chastising them for trying to feed on Harker when he wasn't done with him, he promises to give Harker to them after his business deal is concluded and gives them a \"wiggling bag\" (highly presumed by Harker to be a human child) to appease them. Harker soon fears for his life after this encounter, at one point thinking he sees them dancing in the sky outside his bedroom when he nearly nods off, which strengthens his resolve to escape. Dracula makes good on his word and leaves Harker to the sisters when he heads for England.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoker|first1=Bram|title=Dracula|location=Chapter 3, Jonathan Harker's Journal, 16 May|pages=51\u201358|url=http://www.planetebook.com/ebooks/Dracula.pdf}}</ref> Though Harker manages to escape the castle shortly after, he is badly traumatized by the encounter and is diagnosed with [[brain fever]]. Though they lose their victim, the brides continue to haunt the castle and terrorize the nearby village.\n\nThe sisters are seen again near the end of the novel as the protagonists pursue Count Dracula to Transylvania. The sisters suddenly appear at a camp consisting of Van Helsing and [[Mina Harker]]. Sensing that Mina is cursed with vampirism, they beckon her to join them, referring to her as their \"sister\" and promising not to harm her. However, Van Helsing had previously crushed a [[sacramental bread|Sacred wafer]] and scattered it in a circle around the campsite. Due to this protective barrier both Mina and the sisters are unable to cross its border. Although the Vampires kept away from the camp they remained in the darkness until sunrise upon which they fled back to the castle. At the coming of daylight, Van Helsing finds that their horses are dead (He speculates that they had died of fright in the sisters' supernatural presence, though some adaptations likewise have the sisters kill the horses directly. Either to slow down Van Helsing or simply feed before they flee back to the castle). After Van Helsing binds Mina in another ring of sacramental bread, he subsequently goes to Dracula's castle alone to destroy the vampires and sterilize Dracula's tomb, keeping him from ever being able to enter it again. After locating the vampires' graves, he finds them asleep 'open eyed'. He attempts to kill the first but almost fails as his eyes befall her beauty. Caught in an enchantment, he becomes entranced and lost in a state of uncertainty. Becoming overwhelmed with emotions, he feels compelled to protect her instead and even contemplates love for her. He suddenly hears a 'Soul Wail' from Mina which breaks the enchantment allowing him to finish his work. First using a blacksmith hammer, he strikes a stake into her, then proceeds to operate on her, detaching the head from the body then filling the mouth with garlic. He repeats this process with the other two as well, taking him an entire day to complete. Dracula's reaction to their deaths is not known.\n\n==Screen adaptations==\nCommonly all three brides appear in film adaptations of the novel, though some film adaptations depict them as a blonde, a brunette and a redhead. They are typically depicted as enchantingly beautiful young women, coquettish and seductive in manner, often appearing like [[Succubus|succubi]] in the night, dressed in flowing silk nightgowns and behaving in a wild and sexually aggressive manner.\n\n* Three brides made silent appearances in the 1931 film ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' and the [[Spanish language]] version of ''[[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dr\u00e1cula]]''. (The latter film, shot simultaneously on the same sets at night with a separate cast and crew, depicts the brides as more obviously sexual than in the more chaste [[English-language]] version.) In English language film they are played by Geraldine Dvorak, Cornelia Thaw and [[Dorothy Tree]]. \n*In both ''[[Drakula \u0130stanbul'da]]'' (1953) and ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Horror of Dracula]]'' (1958) only a single bride appears. In 1958 film bride is played by [[Valerie Gaunt]], who tricks and attacks Jonathan Harker and later is staked by him. \n*The three brides appear but are silent in the 1968 television adaptation ''[[Dracula (1968)|Dracula]]''. Although they have no dialogue, the Brides are considerably feral in their behaviour, snarling, screeching and clawing at their victim. They are also depicted as being somewhat dishevelled instead of beautiful, with ragged clothing and filthy, matted hair. Notably, one of the brides is a black woman (played by [[Nina Baden-Semper]]) which appears to be unique amongst [[Dracula]] adaptions.\n* The three brides appear and have lines in Czechoslovakian TV film ''Hrabe Drakula'' (1971). The brides in this version wear elaborate gowns befitting their status as noblewomen and have personal titles: Madame, Marquise and Countess respectively.\n*The three brides are present but silent in the 1973 television adaptation ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1973 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (starring [[Jack Palance]]). They are played by [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]], [[Virginia Wetherell]] and Barbara Lindley. In this version they kill Jonathan Harker and turn him into vampire.\n* All three appear and have lines in the 1977 [[BBC]] production entitled ''[[Count Dracula (1977)|Count Dracula]]''. One of the brides in this adaption is a [[French people|French]] woman.\n* In [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1992 film ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'', the brides were played by [[Monica Bellucci]], [[Michaela Bercu]] and [[Florina Kendrick]]. Bellucci, Bercu and Kendrick's dialogue was entirely in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and Kendrick reportedly helped her co-stars to speak her native tongue correctly. In this adaptation the vampire portrayed by Kendrick is clearly modelled on [[Medusa]] the [[Gorgon]], and has living snakes coiled through her hair; another appears to be based upon an [[Arabian]] princess due to her attire. It is the brunette vampire (portrayed by Kendrick) that is the leader, rather than the blonde (portrayed by Bercu). All three brides have speaking lines - the one played by Bellucci is the bride who calls Jonathan into their chamber, the bride played by Bercu is the one, who tells Dracula he never loved himself and the bride played by Kendrick taunts Van Helsing.\n* In the 1995 spoof ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]'' only two Brides appear, where they are depicted as heavily sexualized when they first arrive in the room where [[Renfield]] is staying as they attempt to seduce him. Dracula saves him from the Brides, sending them away, before convincing the simple minded Renfield he had simply had a strange dream. The Brides are neither named nor have any spoken dialogue in this film.\n* Three brides appear in the 2002 Italian TV mini-series ''[[Dracula (2002 film)|Dracula]]'' (known as ''Dracula's Curse'' in foreign markets). As in the 1992 version, they speak in their native tongue and play up their supernatural nature by being able to fly and phase through objects.\n* While the Brides usually remain nameless, they are called '''Verona''', '''Aleera''' and '''Marishka''' in the 2004 film ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'', respectively portrayed by [[Silvia Colloca]], [[Elena Anaya]] and [[Josie Maran]]. Verona is the oldest of the brides and Dracula's consort, whereas Aleera and Marishka are his concubines. Aleera, the youngest of the trio, is portrayed as the most vicious. Their roles are greatly expanded into those of secondary antagonists, motivated by a need to find a way for their offspring to live, as vampire children are born dead. They are also given the ability to transform into harpy-like creatures and fly.\n* At the beginning of the 2012 film ''[[Dracula 3D]]'', Dracula attacks a young woman named Tania (portrayed by [[Miriam Giovanelli]]) after she secretly meets a lover, making her a vampire and his minion. He later passes her off as his niece to Harker, whom she tries to seduce. Tania is eventually dispatched by Van Helsing.\n* In 2020 [[Dracula (2020 TV series)|''Dracula TV series'']] Lujza Richter plays one of the vampire brides, named Elena. In this version Dracula keeps all his brides locked up in big boxes, conducting experiments on them and not permitting them to move freely around the castle. He also seems to refer to anyone that he turns into a full vampire as a \"bride\" (as he also uses the term to refer to Jonathan Harker, who is killed and turned into undead in this version).\n\n==TV series==\nIn 2015, NBC was developing a TV series about the Brides of Dracula characters titled ''Brides'', with [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] writing, and executive producing with [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Sarah Schechter]]. The series were supposed to be built on premise \"What if Van Helsing did NOT kill the three brides of Dracula? What if they survived for centuries and are now living in New York City?\", with series being described as a sexy re-imagining of Dracula as a family drama with a trio of strong, diverse female leads, a show about empowered women and the things they do to maintain wealth, prestige, legacy \u2014 and their non-traditional family.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/brides-of-dracula-tv-series-roberto-aguirre-sacasa-greg-berlanti-nbc-1201507368/|title=Brides of Dracula Drama From Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa & Greg Berlanti Lands At NBC With Pilot Production Commitment|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=September 1, 2015}}</ref> In October 2019, the series was still being developed with the intention to sell it to a streaming service.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|url=https://deadline.com/2019/10/roberto-aguirre-sacasa-hbo-max-pilot-order-the-shelley-society-gothic-drama-mary-shelley-berlanti-prods-the-brides-dracula-reimagining-1202764121/|title=Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa Gets HBO Max Pilot Order For 'The Shelley Society' Gothic Drama, Teams With Berlanti Prods.

Television<ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/brides-dracula-drama-riverdale-bosses-nabs-abc-pilot-order-1267998</ref>\n\n==On stage==\n\n*They appear in ''[[Dracula, the musical]]'' by [[Frank Wildhorn]] and have their own song \"Forever Young\".\n*In the [[Dracula (Czech musical)|Czech Musical Dracula]], the brides are called \"nymphs\". They are the victims of Dracula, slightly resentful but still devoted to him. They are jealous, mischievous and enjoy troubles and gossiping. They serve as a comical relief but at the same time they represent Dracula's dark, vampiric side.\n*They also appear in the French Canadian musical ''[[Dracula - Entre l'amour et la mort]]''.\n\n==Characters based on the original Brides==\n\n*In the 1960 Hammer film ''[[The Brides of Dracula]]'', the Baron Meinster (David Peel) is a vampire who attacks an unnamed local village girl (played by [[Marie Devereux]]) and the heroine Marianne's friend Gina ([[Andr\u00e9e Melly]]), turning them into vampires and his \"brides\". Although he actually proposes to Marianne ([[Yvonne Monlaur]]), his plan to turn her is thwarted by Professor Van Helsing ([[Peter Cushing]]), who kills the Baron while the two vampire brides seemingly escape. Despite the film's title, Dracula never appears in it.\n* In ''[[Count Yorga, Vampire]]'' (1970), which is a modern-day re-telling of Dracula, Yorga likewise has his own set of Brides, first starting out with two: a red-haired Bride and a blonde (who is later revealed to be Donna's deceased mother), then later adding the protagonist's brunette friend, Erica to the ranks. The sequel, ''[[The Return of Count Yorga]]'' increases the number of Brides to a least a dozen, with the protagonist's sister, Ellen and a friend, Mitzi, joining them.\n*The Brides of Dracula concept was also present in the 1987 horror comedy ''[[The Monster Squad]]'', in which Dracula abducts three young women and turns them into his vampire brides.\n*In ''[[Dracula 2000]]'', the brides are turned at different times throughout the movie. [[Jennifer Esposito]], [[Jeri Ryan]] and [[Colleen Ann Fitzpatrick]] portray the brides, Solina, Valerie and Lucy respectively.\n* The brides also appear in the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy The Vampire Slayer]]'' in the season 5 premier \"[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]\"(2001). They are referred to as \"The Three Sisters\" and are credited as \"Vampire Girls\". They are portrayed by Marita Schaub, Lesli Jean Matta, and Jennifer Slimko.\n*In ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'' (2012), Dracula's wife Martha (voiced by [[Jackie Sandler]]) is an homage to the Brides of Dracula.\n\n==In literature==\n*In ''The Dracula Tape'' (1975) they are seen not long after Harker comes into the castle with Dracula warning them to leave him be. In this story, the brides are disrespectful to Dracula and try to undermine him where they can. Dracula later reveals that he has tired of them and does not even remember why he turned them in the first place. It is implied that unlike Dracula (who did not want to scare or harm anyone), the women let the power go to their heads once they became vampires and he had more or less planned to abandon them in the castle. But while Dracula was trying to make friends with Harker, their visit as depicted in the novel only make the situation and misunderstanding worse. In this adaptation they are named '''Melisse''', the tall, dark-haired bride. '''Wanda''', the second dark-haired one and described as full-breasted as well as mentioned to be Melisse's younger sister. And '''Anna''', the blonde bride who is noted to be the senior of the three and the one who is most outspoken and rebellious against Dracula. Later in the story when Dracula returns back to the castle, he finds that the three have terrorized the village Dracula was friends with and promptly confronts them. Anna attempts an assassination by controlling a partially turned farmhand to attack him, but Dracula easily thwarts the attempt, reprimands them and sends them away. When they're killed by Van Helsing, Dracula does mention that, while he was glad that their deaths prevented jealously with Mina, that he didn't wish that fate on them as well.\n* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[Anno Dracula (novel)|Anno Dracula]]'' (1992), Dracula becomes dominant in Britain and eventually weds [[Queen Victoria]], becoming [[Prince consort]] and [[Lord Protector]]. Despite being married to Victoria he keeps his retinue of Brides.

Curiously despite the Brides being centuries older, Dracula gave Lucy command over them, likely because of her resistance to religious symbols due to being turned in a modern era.\n*In the mini-series ''[[Grimm Fairy Tales (comics)|Grimm Fairy Tales]] present Helsing'', three of the Brides track down the protagonist and try to kill her. She kills two of them before the third retreats. Near the end of the story, when the heroes track Dracula to his mansion during a party, we see he has amassed a large group of women as his Brides though orders them to let the protagonist pass so she may confront him. They show up briefly in first issue of the sequel mini-series \"Helsing vs Dracula\".\n*In ''Dracula: Ruler of the Night'', which re-tells the story, the Brides are eventually summoned to London once Dracula has landed in the city and has the Brides infiltrate the Westerna household as maids after Helsing is summoned to cure Lucy to spy on their actions. It is from them that Dracula is able to enter the household and continue feeding on Lucy. When Lucy's mother is sent a telegraph about her deteriorating condition. Dracula sends the Brides to intercept her carriage and kidnap her. The mother, along with Lucy, later are turned into two new vampire Brides. Dracula grains a third bride in Milly Van Helsing, Helsing's wife, who he learns about from Lucy, absconds her from the mental institution holding her and restoring her sanity via the vampirism, albeit under his commands. And later Mrs. Petri, a socialite friend of the Westerna whom Lucy's mother leads Dracula to usurp her manor after Carfax Abby is destroyed Thus making a total of seven Brides in this story\u2014three from the olden times and four from the current era.\n*In the original English language manga, ''Dracula Everlasting'', Dracula decides to start creating Brides again in the third volume to give him an edge against the protagonists. He starts with three: Vanessa, a classmate of the boy he was possessing and initially has a crush on who rejected him, the mother of the protagonist who studied wiccan magic when she human who he kills to stop her from stopping him, and a hooker brought to him by the Reinfields to feed on. Dracula had especially hope to use the mother's powers against her daughter. After he loses her, he creates six more Brides in preparation for the final battle, one of whom was a reporter seen in an earlier volume covering the mysterious murders whom Dracula turns when she does a report outside his manor.\n*In the ''Alucard'' novel by Matthew Scott, Dracula has three vampire brides: '''Illyana''', '''Camilla''' and '''Silvia'''. Each is described respectfully as blonde, raven-haired and a redhead and are highly sexual vampires and enjoy inflicting chaos and bloodshed whenever the opportunity presents itself. There is also a fourth bride mentioned in the novel, Jana, but who is ultimately killed by her and Dracula's son Alucard shortly after her resurrection as a vampire.\n*In the novel ''The Third Bride'' by Todd Davis, the Dracula story is told from the perspective of the youngest bride, '''Serephine de Bachaumont''', a minor French noble who flees France during the Revolution.

They are three seductive female [[vampire]] \"sisters\" who reside with [[Count Dracula]] in his castle in [[Transylvania]], where they entrance men with their beauty and charm, and then proceed to feed upon them. Dracula provides them with victims to devour, mainly implied to be infants.\n\nLike Dracula, they are the [[undead|living dead]], repulsed by sunlight, garlic and religious objects. In chapter three of the novel, two are described as having dark hair and eyes, and the other as being fair, with blonde hair and blue eyes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pagebypagebooks.com/Bram_Stoker/Dracula/CHAPTER_3_p8.html|title=Dracula, by Bram Stoker; CHAPTER 3 Page 8|last=Stoker|first=Bram|date=|website=pagebypagebooks.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n\nIn the novel the three vampire women are not individually named. Collectively, they are known as the \"sisters\", and are at one point described as the \"[[Three Witches|weird sisters]]\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Bram|last=Stoker|authorlink=Bram Stoker|title=Dracula|date=1897|publisher=[[Constable & Robinson]]|location=London, England|isbn=978-1503261389|page=47|quote=I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters.}}</ref>\n\nThe origin and identity of the Sisters, as well as the true nature of their relationship with Count Dracula, is never revealed. One of the three may have been identified in the short story \"[[Dracula's Guest]]\", as the vampire named [[Countess Dolengen]] of [[Graz|Gratz]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Bram|last=Stoker|authorlink=Bram Stoker|title=Dracula's Guest|pages=7\u20138|url=http://www.bramstoker.org/pdf/stories/03guest/01guest.pdf}}</ref> [[Jonathan Harker]], the protagonist of the story, encounters her at her tomb in [[Munich]]. Just as she is about to bite him, Dracula intervenes and destroys her. Then, in the form of a great wolf, he keeps Harker warm from the cold and yelps for nearby soldiers to come to their location. In the novel, Harker writes about one of the female vampires in the moment he is with them, stating, \"I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where.\" <ref>Stoker, pgs. 54\u201355}}</ref>\n        \nAlthough the three vampire women in ''Dracula'' are popularly referred to as the \"Brides of Dracula\", they are never referred to as such in the novel, instead referred to as the 'sisters'. Whether they are married to Dracula or not is never mentioned, nor are they described as having any other relation to him.\n\nThe two dark-haired vampire women are described as facially resembling the Count, in that the three have [[Aquiline nose|aquiline]] noses. It has been suggested{{By whom|date=January 2020}} from this that it may have been Stoker's intent that these two are Dracula's daughters, extending the [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] metaphor of [[vampirism]] to [[incest]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Jan B.|last=Gordon|chapter=The Transparency of Dracula|title=Bram Stoker's Dracula: Sucking Through the Century, 1897-1997|editor-first=Carol Margaret|editor-last=Davison|publisher=[[Dundurn Press]]|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|date=1997|asin=B00CMP4NA4}}</ref> When the brides first discover Harker, the blonde vampire is encouraged to feed on him first, with one of the others stating, \"Yours is the right to begin,\" signifying that she has some status over the others. This could imply that the blonde vampire is Dracula's wife or consort, and the mother of the two dark-haired women, if they are indeed his daughters. When Van Helsing discovers the sisters' tombs, the blonde's is far more opulent than the others', as if for a loved one or one of high status. Harker describes the women as \"ladies by their dress and manner\", indicating that the vampires are of high lineage, further suggesting the idea that they are Dracula's family. The blonde vampire is shown to act in a mildly rebellious manner toward Dracula, when he scolds her for attempting to feed on Harker; Dracula's reaction upon discovering the sisters with Harker is both that of a jealous husband and an angry father. The vampire women claim that Dracula does not love them, nor has he ever loved them, but Dracula insists he does love them, and shows he cares for them by providing them with victims to feed upon. However, it is not explained why he left them behind in [[Transylvania]] rather than taking them to London with him.\n\nEven though it is never specified, it is possible that the term \"sister\" wasn't meant in the literal sense and is, instead, more comparable to the relationship of the '''women''' and not as they are to Dracula. They are also depicted in the novel calling [[Mina Harker]] their sister after she is forced to drink Dracula's blood, afflicting her with vampirism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoker|first1=Bram|title=Dracula|location=Ch 27, MEMORANDUM BY ABRAHAM VAN HELSING 4 November|url=http://www.planetebook.com/ebooks/Dracula.pdf|quote=They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina. And as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and  pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water glasses, \u2018Come, sister. Come to us. Come!\u2019}}</ref> Mina and her best friend (and Dracula's future victim) [[Lucy Westenra]] also call each other sisters in the novel despite not having any blood relation. The vampire women may be his wives throughout his lifetime, descendants of his whom he turned into vampires, or simply nonspecific women he killed and turned into vampires to create more of his kind.\n\nAs vampires, the sisters are powerful in their own right; their beauty and seductive charm belie lethal, predatory interiors. Their beauty and flirtatious manner appears to be their greatest power when it comes to bewitching their victims into a trance-like state. Harker and Van Helsing are both attracted to, and yet repulsed by them. They can seemingly appear out of nowhere and are inhumanly strong, as shown when they kill Van Helsing's horses. They also have the power of flight, as seen when they fly in the air with their dresses trailing behind them.\n\nThe vampires serve as foreshadowing for the threat of vampirism in the story which, as seen with Lucy later on, includes Dracula's power of corruption over his victims once he has drained their blood and made them into vampires.\n\n==Novel==\nSometime near the beginning of the novel, after Jonathan Harker arrives in Dracula's castle, he warns Harker that if he leaves his room to never sleep in any room in the castle other than his own bedroom, but does not tell him why, clearly aware that the sisters will kill him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoker|first1=Bram|title=Dracula|location=Ch 3, Jonathan Harker's Journal|page=43|url=http://www.planetebook.com/ebooks/Dracula.pdf|quote=Let me advise you, my dear young friend. Nay, let me warn you with all seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle.}}</ref> Late one night Jonathan explores the castle and ventures to see which rooms are open to him. He finds many of the doors in the castle are locked but one room in particular he forced open, noticing that the door wasn't locked but the hinges were fallen. He enters into the furthest right wing of the castle with views from the windows overlooking the countryside and rooms with comfortable furniture. He sits at a table writing in his journal and as he felt sleepy, he remembered Dracula's warning but felt satisfied disobeying it and lays in a great couch in the corner of the room. As he believes he is sleeping he sees three women standing in the moonlight which was shining throughout the room but not casting any shadows upon the floor. More than delighted that fresh prey has entered their domain, they proceed to seduce him. Harker feels a burning desire for their lips to kiss his. As one of them begins to kiss his neck, he feels her sharp teeth barely scrape against his flesh. At that precise moment Dracula is seen grabbing her neck and hurling her away from him. Driving them back and chastising them for trying to feed on Harker when he wasn't done with him, he promises to give Harker to them after his business deal is concluded and gives them a \"wiggling bag\" (highly presumed by Harker to be a human child) to appease them. Harker soon fears for his life after this encounter, at one point thinking he sees them dancing in the sky outside his bedroom when he nearly nods off, which strengthens his resolve to escape. Dracula makes good on his word and leaves Harker to the sisters when he heads for England.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoker|first1=Bram|title=Dracula|location=Chapter 3, Jonathan Harker's Journal, 16 May|pages=51\u201358|url=http://www.planetebook.com/ebooks/Dracula.pdf}}</ref> Though Harker manages to escape the castle shortly after, he is badly traumatized by the encounter and is diagnosed with [[brain fever]]. Though they lose their victim, the brides continue to haunt the castle and terrorize the nearby village.\n\nThe sisters are seen again near the end of the novel as the protagonists pursue Count Dracula to Transylvania. The sisters suddenly appear at a camp consisting of Van Helsing and [[Mina Harker]]. Sensing that Mina is cursed with vampirism, they beckon her to join them, referring to her as their \"sister\" and promising not to harm her. However, Van Helsing had previously crushed a [[sacramental bread|Sacred wafer]] and scattered it in a circle around the campsite. Due to this protective barrier both Mina and the sisters are unable to cross its border. Although the Vampires kept away from the camp they remained in the darkness until sunrise upon which they fled back to the castle. At the coming of daylight, Van Helsing finds that their horses are dead (He speculates that they had died of fright in the sisters' supernatural presence, though some adaptations likewise have the sisters kill the horses directly. Either to slow down Van Helsing or simply feed before they flee back to the castle). After Van Helsing binds Mina in another ring of sacramental bread, he subsequently goes to Dracula's castle alone to destroy the vampires and sterilize Dracula's tomb, keeping him from ever being able to enter it again. After locating the vampires' graves, he finds them asleep 'open eyed'. He attempts to kill the first but almost fails as his eyes befall her beauty. Caught in an enchantment, he becomes entranced and lost in a state of uncertainty. Becoming overwhelmed with emotions, he feels compelled to protect her instead and even contemplates love for her. He suddenly hears a 'Soul Wail' from Mina which breaks the enchantment allowing him to finish his work. First using a blacksmith hammer, he strikes a stake into her, then proceeds to operate on her, detaching the head from the body then filling the mouth with garlic. He repeats this process with the other two as well, taking him an entire day to complete. Dracula's reaction to their deaths is not known.\n\n==Screen adaptations==\nCommonly all three brides appear in film adaptations of the novel, though some film adaptations depict them as a blonde, a brunette and a redhead. They are typically depicted as enchantingly beautiful young women, coquettish and seductive in manner, often appearing like [[Succubus|succubi]] in the night, dressed in flowing silk nightgowns and behaving in a wild and sexually aggressive manner.\n\n* Three brides made silent appearances in the 1931 film ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' and the [[Spanish language]] version of ''[[Dr\u00e1cula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dr\u00e1cula]]''. (The latter film, shot simultaneously on the same sets at night with a separate cast and crew, depicts the brides as more obviously sexual than in the more chaste [[English-language]] version.) In English language film they are played by Geraldine Dvorak, Cornelia Thaw and [[Dorothy Tree]]. \n*In both ''[[Drakula \u0130stanbul'da]]'' (1953) and ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Horror of Dracula]]'' (1958) only a single bride appears. In 1958 film bride is played by [[Valerie Gaunt]], who tricks and attacks Jonathan Harker and later is staked by him. \n*The three brides appear but are silent in the 1968 television adaptation ''[[Dracula (1968)|Dracula]]''. Although they have no dialogue, the Brides are considerably feral in their behaviour, snarling, screeching and clawing at their victim. They are also depicted as being somewhat dishevelled instead of beautiful, with ragged clothing and filthy, matted hair. Notably, one of the brides is a black woman (played by [[Nina Baden-Semper]]) which appears to be unique amongst [[Dracula]] adaptions.\n* The three brides appear and have lines in Czechoslovakian TV film ''Hrabe Drakula'' (1971). The brides in this version wear elaborate gowns befitting their status as noblewomen and have personal titles: Madame, Marquise and Countess respectively.\n*The three brides are present but silent in the 1973 television adaptation ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1973 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (starring [[Jack Palance]]). They are played by [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]], [[Virginia Wetherell]] and Barbara Lindley. In this version they kill Jonathan Harker and turn him into vampire.\n* All three appear and have lines in the 1977 [[BBC]] production entitled ''[[Count Dracula (1977)|Count Dracula]]''. One of the brides in this adaption is a [[French people|French]] woman.\n* In [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1992 film ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'', the brides were played by [[Monica Bellucci]], [[Michaela Bercu]] and [[Florina Kendrick]]. Bellucci, Bercu and Kendrick's dialogue was entirely in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and Kendrick reportedly helped her co-stars to speak her native tongue correctly. In this adaptation the vampire portrayed by Kendrick is clearly modelled on [[Medusa]] the [[Gorgon]], and has living snakes coiled through her hair; another appears to be based upon an [[Arabian]] princess due to her attire. It is the brunette vampire (portrayed by Kendrick) that is the leader, rather than the blonde (portrayed by Bercu). All three brides have speaking lines - the one played by Bellucci is the bride who calls Jonathan into their chamber, the bride played by Bercu is the one, who tells Dracula he never loved himself and the bride played by Kendrick taunts Van Helsing.\n* In the 1995 spoof ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]'' only two Brides appear, where they are depicted as heavily sexualized when they first arrive in the room where [[Renfield]] is staying as they attempt to seduce him. Dracula saves him from the Brides, sending them away, before convincing the simple minded Renfield he had simply had a strange dream. The Brides are neither named nor have any spoken dialogue in this film.\n* Three brides appear in the 2002 Italian TV mini-series ''[[Dracula (2002 film)|Dracula]]'' (known as ''Dracula's Curse'' in foreign markets). As in the 1992 version, they speak in their native tongue and play up their supernatural nature by being able to fly and phase through objects.\n* While the Brides usually remain nameless, they are called '''Verona''', '''Aleera''' and '''Marishka''' in the 2004 film ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'', respectively portrayed by [[Silvia Colloca]], [[Elena Anaya]] and [[Josie Maran]]. Verona is the oldest of the brides and Dracula's consort, whereas Aleera and Marishka are his concubines. Aleera, the youngest of the trio, is portrayed as the most vicious. Their roles are greatly expanded into those of secondary antagonists, motivated by a need to find a way for their offspring to live, as vampire children are born dead. They are also given the ability to transform into harpy-like creatures and fly.\n* At the beginning of the 2012 film ''[[Dracula 3D]]'', Dracula attacks a young woman named Tania (portrayed by [[Miriam Giovanelli]]) after she secretly meets a lover, making her a vampire and his minion. He later passes her off as his niece to Harker, whom she tries to seduce. Tania is eventually dispatched by Van Helsing.\n* In 2020 [[Dracula (2020 TV series)|''Dracula TV series'']] Lujza Richter plays one of the vampire brides, named Elena. In this version Dracula keeps all his brides locked up in big boxes, conducting experiments on them and not permitting them to move freely around the castle. He also seems to refer to anyone that he turns into a full vampire as a \"bride\" (as he also uses the term to refer to Jonathan Harker, who is killed and turned into undead in this version).\n\n==TV series==\nIn 2015, NBC was developing a TV series about the Brides of Dracula characters titled ''Brides'', with [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] writing, and executive producing with [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Sarah Schechter]]. The series were supposed to be built on premise \"What if Van Helsing did NOT kill the three brides of Dracula? What if they survived for centuries and are now living in New York City?\", with series being described as a sexy re-imagining of Dracula as a family drama with a trio of strong, diverse female leads, a show about empowered women and the things they do to maintain wealth, prestige, legacy \u2014 and their non-traditional family.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/brides-of-dracula-tv-series-roberto-aguirre-sacasa-greg-berlanti-nbc-1201507368/|title=Brides of Dracula Drama From Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa & Greg Berlanti Lands At NBC With Pilot Production Commitment|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=September 1, 2015}}</ref> In October 2019, the series was still being developed with the intention to sell it to a streaming service.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|url=https://deadline.com/2019/10/roberto-aguirre-sacasa-hbo-max-pilot-order-the-shelley-society-gothic-drama-mary-shelley-berlanti-prods-the-brides-dracula-reimagining-1202764121/|title=Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa Gets HBO Max Pilot Order For 'The Shelley Society' Gothic Drama, Teams With Berlanti Prods.

They are the victims of Dracula, slightly resentful but still devoted to him. They are jealous, mischievous and enjoy troubles and gossiping. They serve as a comical relief but at the same time they represent Dracula's dark, vampiric side.\n*They also appear in the French Canadian musical ''[[Dracula - Entre l'amour et la mort]]''.\n\n==Characters based on the original Brides==\n\n*In the 1960 Hammer film ''[[The Brides of Dracula]]'', the Baron Meinster (David Peel) is a vampire who attacks an unnamed local village girl (played by [[Marie Devereux]]) and the heroine Marianne's friend Gina ([[Andr\u00e9e Melly]]), turning them into vampires and his \"brides\". Although he actually proposes to Marianne ([[Yvonne Monlaur]]), his plan to turn her is thwarted by Professor Van Helsing ([[Peter Cushing]]), who kills the Baron while the two vampire brides seemingly escape. Despite the film's title, Dracula never appears in it.\n* In ''[[Count Yorga, Vampire]]'' (1970), which is a modern-day re-telling of Dracula, Yorga likewise has his own set of Brides, first starting out with two: a red-haired Bride and a blonde (who is later revealed to be Donna's deceased mother), then later adding the protagonist's brunette friend, Erica to the ranks. The sequel, ''[[The Return of Count Yorga]]'' increases the number of Brides to a least a dozen, with the protagonist's sister, Ellen and a friend, Mitzi, joining them.\n*The Brides of Dracula concept was also present in the 1987 horror comedy ''[[The Monster Squad]]'', in which Dracula abducts three young women and turns them into his vampire brides.\n*In ''[[Dracula 2000]]'', the brides are turned at different times throughout the movie.

They are referred to as \"The Three Sisters\" and are credited as \"Vampire Girls\". They are portrayed by Marita Schaub, Lesli Jean Matta, and Jennifer Slimko.\n*In ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'' (2012), Dracula's wife Martha (voiced by [[Jackie Sandler]]) is an homage to the Brides of Dracula.\n\n==In literature==\n*In ''The Dracula Tape'' (1975) they are seen not long after Harker comes into the castle with Dracula warning them to leave him be. In this story, the brides are disrespectful to Dracula and try to undermine him where they can. Dracula later reveals that he has tired of them and does not even remember why he turned them in the first place. It is implied that unlike Dracula (who did not want to scare or harm anyone), the women let the power go to their heads once they became vampires and he had more or less planned to abandon them in the castle. But while Dracula was trying to make friends with Harker, their visit as depicted in the novel only make the situation and misunderstanding worse. In this adaptation they are named '''Melisse''', the tall, dark-haired bride. '''Wanda''', the second dark-haired one and described as full-breasted as well as mentioned to be Melisse's younger sister. And '''Anna''', the blonde bride who is noted to be the senior of the three and the one who is most outspoken and rebellious against Dracula. Later in the story when Dracula returns back to the castle, he finds that the three have terrorized the village Dracula was friends with and promptly confronts them. Anna attempts an assassination by controlling a partially turned farmhand to attack him, but Dracula easily thwarts the attempt, reprimands them and sends them away. When they're killed by Van Helsing, Dracula does mention that, while he was glad that their deaths prevented jealously with Mina, that he didn't wish that fate on them as well.\n* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[Anno Dracula (novel)|Anno Dracula]]'' (1992), Dracula becomes dominant in Britain and eventually weds [[Queen Victoria]], becoming [[Prince consort]] and [[Lord Protector]].

Curiously despite the Brides being centuries older, Dracula gave Lucy command over them, likely because of her resistance to religious symbols due to being turned in a modern era.\n*In the mini-series ''[[Grimm Fairy Tales (comics)|Grimm Fairy Tales]] present Helsing'', three of the Brides track down the protagonist and try to kill her. She kills two of them before the third retreats.

Dracula had especially hope to use the mother's powers against her daughter. After he loses her, he creates six more Brides in preparation for the final battle, one of whom was a reporter seen in an earlier volume covering the mysterious murders whom Dracula turns when she does a report outside his manor.\n*In the ''Alucard'' novel by Matthew Scott, Dracula has three vampire brides: '''Illyana''', '''Camilla''' and '''Silvia'''. Each is described respectfully as blonde, raven-haired and a redhead and are highly sexual vampires and enjoy inflicting chaos and bloodshed whenever the opportunity presents itself. There is also a fourth bride mentioned in the novel, Jana, but who is ultimately killed by her and Dracula's son Alucard shortly after her resurrection as a vampire.\n*In the novel ''The Third Bride'' by Todd Davis, the Dracula story is told from the perspective of the youngest bride, '''Serephine de Bachaumont''', a minor French noble who flees France during the Revolution.

It was believed that he was an honorary police officer in a town in Alabama, and showed his honorary badge to gain the sympathy of the officer citing him.\n\nAfter determining that the home was unoccupied, the deputies drove away and were shortly passed by a black Mercedes headed for the home. Kinchen (the more senior deputy) noted the suspect vehicle, turned the patrol car around, and drove up to the Mercedes, stopping nose to nose. English approached the Mercedes and told the single occupant to show his hands. The occupant opened fire with a [[.223 Remington|.223]] rifle. English ran between the two cars while returning fire from his handgun, but was hit four times. Kinchen was shot with the rifle and a [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9&nbsp;mm]] handgun.\n\nThe next day, Kinchen died of his wounds at [[Grady Memorial Hospital]]. English survived his wounds, and identified al-Amin as the shooter from six photos he was shown while recovering in the hospital.

He became known as H. Rap Brown during the early 1960s. His activism in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] included involvement with the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), of which he was named chairman in 1967. That same year, he was arrested in [[Cambridge, Maryland]], and charged with inciting to riot after he gave a speech there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) Actions 1960\u20131970|url=http://depts.washington.edu/moves/SNCC_map-events.shtml|website=Mapping American Social Movements}}</ref>\n\nBrown was introduced into SNCC by his older brother Ed. Rap first visited Cambridge with [[Cleveland Sellers]] in the summer of 1963 during the period of [[Gloria Richardson]]'s leadership in the local movement. He witnessed the [[Cambridge riot of 1963|first riot between blacks and whites in the city]], and was impressed by the local civil rights movement's willingness to use armed self-defense against racial attacks.\n\nHe later organized for SNCC during Mississippi [[Freedom Summer]], while transferring his studies to [[Howard University]]. Representing Howard's SNCC chapter, Brown attended a contentious civil rights meeting at the White House with President Lyndon Johnson during the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma crisis]] of 1965.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZ0fBgAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA306&dq=rap+brown.+white+house.+1965&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCkd-urdvdAhUCrFMKHTLTC8UQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=rap%20brown.%20white%20house.%201965&f=false|title=Civil Rights Crossroads: Nation, Community, and the Black Freedom Struggle|last=Lawson|first=Steven F.|date=January 13, 2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=|isbn=9780813157122|pages=306|language=en}}</ref> In 1966, he organized for black voter registration and enforcement of the recently passed [[Voting Rights Act]] in [[Greene County, Alabama]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://snccdigital.org/people/h-rap-brown/|title=H.

He was arrested after a reported shootout with officers after what was said to be an attempted robbery of a bar in [[New York City]]. He spent five years (1971\u201376) in [[Attica Correctional Facility|Attica Prison]] after a robbery conviction. While in prison, Brown converted to [[Islam]] and changed his name from Hubert Gerold Brown to Jamil Abdullah al-Amin.\n\nAfter his release, he opened a grocery store in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and became a Muslim spiritual leader and community activist preaching against drugs and gambling in [[West End, Atlanta|Atlanta's West End]] neighborhood. It has since been alleged that al-Amin's life changed again when he allegedly became affiliated with the \"[[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam|Dar ul-Islam Movement]]\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Black America, Prisons, and Radical Islam |publisher=Center for Islamic Pluralism |date=September 2008 |url=http://www.islamicpluralism.org/documents/black-america-prisons-radical-islam.pdf |format=PDF |isbn=978-0-9558779-1-9 |accessdate=2010-02-14}}</ref>\n\n==2000 arrest and conviction==\nOn March 16, 2000, in [[Fulton County, Georgia]], Sheriff's deputies Ricky Kinchen and Aldranon English went to al-Amin's home to execute an [[arrest warrant]] for his failure to appear in court after a citation for speeding and [[police impersonation|impersonating a police officer]]. It was believed that he was an honorary police officer in a town in Alabama, and showed his honorary badge to gain the sympathy of the officer citing him.\n\nAfter determining that the home was unoccupied, the deputies drove away and were shortly passed by a black Mercedes headed for the home. Kinchen (the more senior deputy) noted the suspect vehicle, turned the patrol car around, and drove up to the Mercedes, stopping nose to nose. English approached the Mercedes and told the single occupant to show his hands. The occupant opened fire with a [[.223 Remington|.223]] rifle. English ran between the two cars while returning fire from his handgun, but was hit four times. Kinchen was shot with the rifle and a [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9&nbsp;mm]] handgun.\n\nThe next day, Kinchen died of his wounds at [[Grady Memorial Hospital]]. English survived his wounds, and identified al-Amin as the shooter from six photos he was shown while recovering in the hospital. Both of the Sheriff's deputies al-Amin was convicted of shooting were black, which undermined al-Amin's racial conspiracy theory defense at trial.<ref>Hart, Ariel, \"Court in Georgia Upholds Former Militant's Conviction\", ''The New York Times'', May 25, 2004</ref>\n\nShortly after the shootout, al-Amin fled to [[White Hall, Alabama]], where he was tracked down by [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] and arrested by law enforcement officers after a four-day manhunt. Al-Amin was wearing [[body armor]] at the time of his arrest, and officers found a 9&nbsp;mm handgun and .223 rifle near his arrest location.
