It was formed from the merger of two smaller municipalities, [[Barnesboro, Pennsylvania|Barnesboro]] and [[Spangler, Pennsylvania|Spangler]]. The area was first settled by Europeans in the early-to-middle 19th century. The presence of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River|West Branch of the Susquehanna River]] allowed loggers to move their harvest downstream. Small farms developed, but the area changed in the 1890s when mining of the extensive [[bituminous coal]] fields in the area became the dominant industry. The mining companies required skilled workers, and many came from [[Great Britain]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. Railroads were built to transport the coal out, and the town flourished with the influx of money. In the 1980s, the coal industry began a decline, and there has been a subsequent decline in the population of the area. In November 1922, the Reilly Shaft No. 1 mine explosion occurred, killing 78 coal miners.<ref>[http://www3.gendisasters.com/pennsylvania/5779/spangler-pa-reilly-shaft-no-1-mine-explosion-nov-1922 Reilly Shaft Explosion], retrieved on December 11, 2008</ref>\n\nA pumpkin weighing {{convert|1469|lb}} was grown by resident Larry Checkon in 2005 (a world record at that time).<ref>[http://www.bigpumpkins.com/ViewArticle.asp?id=137&gid=47 Big Pumpkins.com], retrieved on November 15, 2008</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nNorthern Cambria is located near the northwest corner of Cambria County at {{coord|40|39|21|N|78|46|46|W|type:city}} (40.655813, -78.779472),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> in the valley of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River|West Branch]] of the [[Susquehanna River]], near its headwaters.

It was formed from the merger of two smaller municipalities, [[Barnesboro, Pennsylvania|Barnesboro]] and [[Spangler, Pennsylvania|Spangler]]. The area was first settled by Europeans in the early-to-middle 19th century. The presence of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River|West Branch of the Susquehanna River]] allowed loggers to move their harvest downstream. Small farms developed, but the area changed in the 1890s when mining of the extensive [[bituminous coal]] fields in the area became the dominant industry. The mining companies required skilled workers, and many came from [[Great Britain]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. Railroads were built to transport the coal out, and the town flourished with the influx of money. In the 1980s, the coal industry began a decline, and there has been a subsequent decline in the population of the area. In November 1922, the Reilly Shaft No. 1 mine explosion occurred, killing 78 coal miners.<ref>[http://www3.gendisasters.com/pennsylvania/5779/spangler-pa-reilly-shaft-no-1-mine-explosion-nov-1922 Reilly Shaft Explosion], retrieved on December 11, 2008</ref>\n\nA pumpkin weighing {{convert|1469|lb}} was grown by resident Larry Checkon in 2005 (a world record at that time).<ref>[http://www.bigpumpkins.com/ViewArticle.asp?id=137&gid=47 Big Pumpkins.com], retrieved on November 15, 2008</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nNorthern Cambria is located near the northwest corner of Cambria County at {{coord|40|39|21|N|78|46|46|W|type:city}} (40.655813, -78.779472),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> in the valley of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River|West Branch]] of the [[Susquehanna River]], near its headwaters.

The borough is located in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of eastern Pennsylvania. As of the 2010 census, Northampton's population was 9,926.\n\nIt was known as a center of cement manufacturing. [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], the world's largest at one time, was among the local companies for nearly 100 years before it closed in 1982. The county was also a center of heavy industry, dominated by [[Bethlehem Steel]].\n\n==History==\nNorthampton and surrounding areas of the [[Lehigh Valley]] are rich in [[limestone]], which is commonly used in the production of [[cement]]. The [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], based here from 1895 to 1982, was the world's largest cement company at one time, and one of dozens in the area. It produced some 8 million barrels of cement for construction of the [[Panama Canal]], most of what was used on the project. Atlas was bought by another company in 1980 and ceased operation here in 1982; its last smokestack here was demolished in 1993. Today technology and automation mean that the cement industry can manufacture a great amount of product with 150-200 workers, rather than the thousands who worked in these plants earlier in the 20th century.<ref name=\"atlasMus\"/>\n\nThe Atlas Memorial Cement Museum, which was opened in 1997 here, was founded by Edward Pany, who worked at the company in summers during the 1950s. His father, an immigrant from [[Austria]], worked all his life at Atlas. Immigrant workers from Poland, Ukraine, and other eastern European nations also worked here. The museum commemorates the importance of this industry and Atlas Cement in the area.<ref name=\"atlasMus\">{{cite web|title=Cement museum nurtures nostalgia in Pennsylvania|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-05-20/news/0605200196_1_cement-dust-largest-cement-producer-atlas-plant|last=Duck|first=Michael|publisher=Chicago Tribune| date=20 May 2006|website=tribunedigital-chicagotribune}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nNorthampton is located {{convert|8|mi|km}} north of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] at {{Coord|40|41|2|N|75|29|29|W|type:city}} (40.683896, -75.491353).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer |quote= 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough/city has a total area of {{convert|2.7|sqmi|km2}}; {{convert|2.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (3.70%), water.

The [[population density]] was 3,619.1 people per square mile (1,396.7/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 4,023 housing units at an average density of 1,548.1 per square mile (597.4/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial makeup of the borough was 98.21% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.35% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.05% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.44% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.39% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.55% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.74% of the population.\n\nThere were 3,869 households, out of which 30.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 10.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.9% were non-families. 27.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size was 2.92.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 22.4% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 32.2% from 25 to 44, 21.0% from 45 to 64, and 18.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 91.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.1 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $40,982, and the median income for a family was $49,482. Males had a median income of $37,033 versus $26,422 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $19,516. About 1.3% of families and 3.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 1.4% of those under age 18 and 5.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==History==\nNorthampton was created from the villages of Siegfried, Newport and Stemton, which together were formed into an alliance in 1902.\n\nDue to the limestone formations in the region, Northampton became a global center for the manufacturing of [[cement]]. [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], the largest such company in the world at one time, operated here from 1895 to 1982. It supplied most of the cement used in the construction of the [[Panama Canal]].<ref name=\"atlasMus\" />\n\nIn 1909, Atlas petitioned county courts to change the alliance into a borough, reportedly because the change would make it easier for the company to send and receive mail. The Atlas Portland Cement Company plant closed in 1982. Borough residents, many of them former Atlas employees or their descendants, still identify strongly with the company and its history. For example, the [[Northampton Area School District]] mascot is the \"Konkrete Kid.\"<ref name=\"nasd\">http://www.nasdschools.org/high-school.cfm?subpage=9</ref> In addition, in 1996 the Atlas Memorial Cement Museum was opened in the borough\n\nHistorical community events included the Northampton Jack Frost Parade every October before Halloween, celebrating the onset of winter. It includes marching bands and floats.\n\nAnother event that occurred during the 1940s and 1950s was the Northampton County Fair, which was held every year and was spread out across the Lappawinzo Fish & Game Club property North of Northampton (off Kreidersville Road). There were huge numbers of vendor stands, fair rides, animals, shows/performances, 4-H Club judgings, as well as Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey shows. Visitors came from all over the East Coast during the two-week event and hourly buses ran from downtown Northampton and nearby cities to the Fair.\n\nPart of the opening sequence of the 1992 film ''[[School Ties]]'' was filmed in downtown Northampton due to the town's preservation of older buildings, which fit with the 1950s setting of the film.\n\n==Public education==\nThe borough is served by the [[Northampton Area School District]]. There are 4 elementary schools, a middle school and one high school.\n\nThe Borough is also home to Good Shepherd Catholic School in the 4th Ward. It serves grades Pre-K to 8th grade. It is part of the [[Diocese of Allentown]]. There was St. John's school but it closed in 2003.\n\n==Museums==\n*The Atlas Cement Memorial Museum, based in Northampton\n\n==Sister city==\n*{{flagicon|AUT}} [[Stegersbach]],

[[borough]] in [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States]].  The borough is located in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of eastern Pennsylvania. As of the 2010 census, Northampton's population was 9,926. \n\nIt was known as a center of cement manufacturing. [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], the world's largest at one time, was among the local companies for nearly 100 years before it closed in 1982. The county was also a center of heavy industry, dominated by [[Bethlehem Steel]].\n\n==History==\nNorthampton and surrounding areas of the [[Lehigh Valley]] are rich in [[limestone]], which is commonly used in the production of [[cement]]. The [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], based here from 1895 to 1982, was the world's largest cement company at one time, and one of dozens in the area. It produced some 8 million barrels of cement for construction of the [[Panama Canal]], most of what was used on the project. Atlas was bought by another company in 1980 and ceased operation here in 1982; its last smokestack here was demolished in 1993. Today technology and automation mean that the cement industry can manufacture a great amount of product with 150-200 workers, rather than the thousands who worked in these plants earlier in the 20th century.<ref name=\"atlasMus\"/> \n\nThe Atlas Memorial Cement Museum, which was opened in 1997 here, was founded by Edward Pany, who worked at the company in summers during the 1950s. His father, an immigrant from [[Austria]], worked all his life at Atlas. Immigrant workers from Poland, Ukraine, and other eastern European nations also worked here. The museum commemorates the importance of this industry and Atlas Cement in the area.<ref name=\"atlasMus\">{{cite web|title=Cement museum nurtures nostalgia in Pennsylvania|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-05-20/news/0605200196_1_cement-dust-largest-cement-producer-atlas-plant|last=Duck|first=Michael|publisher=Chicago Tribune| date=20 May 2006|website=tribunedigital-chicagotribune}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nNorthampton is located {{convert|8|mi|km}} north of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] at {{Coord|40|41|2|N|75|29|29|W|type:city}} (40.683896, -75.491353).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer |quote= 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough/city has a total area of {{convert|2.7|sqmi|km2}}; {{convert|2.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (3.70%), water.

The [[population density]] was 3,619.1 people per square mile (1,396.7/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 4,023 housing units at an average density of 1,548.1 per square mile (597.4/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial makeup of the borough was 98.21% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.35% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.05% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.44% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.39% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.55% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.74% of the population.\n\nThere were 3,869 households, out of which 30.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 10.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.9% were non-families. 27.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size was 2.92.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 22.4% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 32.2% from 25 to 44, 21.0% from 45 to 64, and 18.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 91.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.1 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $40,982, and the median income for a family was $49,482. Males had a median income of $37,033 versus $26,422 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $19,516. About 1.3% of families and 3.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 1.4% of those under age 18 and 5.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==History==\nNorthampton was created from the villages of Siegfried, Newport and Stemton, which together were formed into an alliance in 1902. \n\nDue to the limestone formations in the region, Northampton became a global center for the manufacturing of [[cement]]. [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], the largest such company in the world at one time, operated here from 1895 to 1982. It supplied most of the cement used in the construction of the [[Panama Canal]].<ref name=\"atlasMus\" />\n\n\nIn 1909, Atlas petitioned county courts to change the alliance into a borough, reportedly because the change would make it easier for the company to send and receive mail. The Atlas Portland Cement Company plant closed in 1982. Borough residents, many of them former Atlas employees or their descendants, still identify strongly with the company and its history. For example, the [[Northampton Area School District]] mascot is the \"Konkrete Kid.\"<ref name=\"nasd\">http://www.nasdschools.org/high-school.cfm?subpage=9</ref> In addition, in 1996 the Atlas Memorial Cement Museum was opened in the borough\n\nHistorical community events included the Northampton Jack Frost Parade every October before Halloween, celebrating the onset of winter. It includes marching bands and floats.\n\nAnother event that occurred during the 1940s and 1950s was the Northampton County Fair, which was held every year and was spread out across the Lappawinzo Fish & Game Club property North of Northampton (off Kreidersville Road). There were huge numbers of vendor stands, fair rides, animals, shows/performances, 4-H Club judgings, as well as Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey shows. Visitors came from all over the East Coast during the two-week event and hourly buses ran from downtown Northampton and nearby cities to the Fair.\n\nPart of the opening sequence of the 1992 film ''[[School Ties]]'' was filmed in downtown Northampton due to the town's preservation of older buildings, which fit with the 1950s setting of the film.\n\n==Public education==\nThe borough is served by the [[Northampton Area School District]]. There are 4 elementary schools, a middle school and one high school.\n\nThe Borough is also home to Good Shepherd Catholic School in the 4th Ward. It serves grades Pre-K to 8th grade. It is part of the [[Diocese of Allentown]].

Part of a 1702 William Penn land grant, this rich farming country was given the name \"Gwynedd\" for the homeland of the earliest settlers and it began as a pastoral village in agricultural Gwynedd Township.\n\nBefore 1850, a number of farms, plus a 1776 church, shared by the Lutheran and Reformed congregations, dotted the present borough's landscape. What is now Main Street was originally an old Indian trail, and was laid out as the Great Road in 1728. By 1828, it had become today's Sumneytown Pike, and was a toll road until 1914.  It had always been an important route to Philadelphia, and continues to serve as a connection to Routes 202 and 309 to the east and the Northeastern Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the west.\n\nIts rural character was abruptly disrupted by the building of the [[North Pennsylvania Railroad]] starting in 1852. Service from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] through North Wales began in 1857. The town quickly grew around the railroad station, with hotels and restaurants lining Walnut Street and Main Street within walking distance. North Wales is the oldest of the North Penn boroughs, incorporated in 1869, by taking land from today's [[Upper Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Gwynedd Township]], then the northern portion of Gwynedd Township.\n\nSome of the large homes at the start of the 20th century were opened to summer guests from the city. \"Idlewilde\", still present on Main Street, hosted the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II, when he was visiting Philadelphia to open the 1876 U.S. Centennial Exhibition with President Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, much of North Wales borough's housing was built. Most houses along South Main Street between Montgomery and Prospects Streets remain much as they were when built and are lovingly maintained.  The borough also features a variety of single family homes, as well as twins, and rowhomes.\n\nBetween 1900 and 1926, [[Lehigh Valley Transit Company]] operated its Chestnut Hill Branch trolley line, which connected North Wales to surrounding towns through service to either [[Philadelphia]] or [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]. The trolley ran down Main Street through the borough, but detoured onto Pennsylvania Avenue for two blocks to enable it to cross the [[North Pennsylvania Railroad|North Penn Railroad]] on a bridge.  The bridge was required because the railroad, citing safety concerns, refused to allow the trolleys to cross at the Main Street grade crossing.  [[Lehigh Valley Transit Company]]'s combined passenger/freight station was located on the north (east) side of Pennsylvania Avenue between Shearer Street and Montgomery Avenue.  After Main Street trolley service ended in 1926, Lehigh Valley Transit high-speed trolleys continued to serve the Wales Junction station, located on Sumneytown Pike three-quarters of a mile west of town.  High-speed trolley serviced ended in September 1951.\n\nIn 2000, the North Wales Historic Preservation District was established by Borough Council and the Pennsylvania Historic and Museum Commission to protect the architecture that is a visual reminder of the borough's past. It is the first Historic District in the North Penn boroughs.\n\n==Business District==\nNorth Wales' Main and Walnut Streets have been home to many businesses over the town's history and these two thoroughfares still serve the community today by providing a number of services such as a variety of hair salons and beauty parlors, a pharmacy, doctors' offices, a dry cleaner, a running and walking shoe specialty store, a yoga studio, two auto repair facilities, two auto body shops, two laundromats, a post office, convenience store, and a recording studio, among many others.  Eateries and bars include two pizza parlors, a Tex-Mex restaurant, two cafes, two bakeries, a juice bar and a vegan restaurant.\n\n==Community Outreach==\nThe borough houses the headquarters for the [[Montgomery County Association for the Blind]], as well as the non-profit organization The Lamb Foundation, which provides housing and life skills support to the area's mentally-challenged residents.  The Lamb Foundation also runs a consignment/secondhand shop, Sweet Repeats, located on South 5th St. near the North Wales train station.  The borough is also home to the Boy Scouts of America Pack/Troop 84, whose meeting place is located at Second and Church Streets.\n\n==Education==\n* North Wales Elementary School is part of the [[North Penn School District]]. The building was North Wales High School from 1927 until North Penn High School was built in the 1950s; it then became an elementary school. The original elementary school from the 1900s was located at the current site of Borough Hall.\n* St. Rose of Lima Catholic School of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]]. In January 2012, the archdiocese announced that St. Rose of Lima would merge with St. Stanislaus Parish School in [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]], with students attending classes in Lansdale.<ref>Di Domizio, Tony. \"[http://lansdale.patch.com/articles/st-rose-goes-and-goretti-gone St. Rose Goes and Goretti, Gone].\" ''[[Montgomeryville-Lansdale Patch]]''. January 6, 2012. Retrieved on January 7, 2012.</ref>\n\n==Library==\n\nNorth Wales Elementary School formerly housed the North Wales Memorial Free Library from 1927 to 2009.  Due to the growing number of students at school, as well as the library's need for more space, the library purchased and relocated to a much larger (10,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>, over 900 m<sup>2</sup>) building at 233 South Swartley Street. They began operating with limited hours at the new location on January 4, 2010, and had their grand opening in April 2010 with full hours, including Saturday. The library has also changed its name to \"North Wales Area Library\" upon its move. It is part of the Montgomery County Library System.\n\n==Parks and recreation==\nWeingartner Park is located at Second and Summit Streets with a large variety of trees.  There are many pathways and benches to enjoy and the park is particularly shady and breezy during the spring and summer months.<ref>[http://northwalesborough.org/parks-recreation/] Weingartner Park \"A 3 acre recreation area located at Second and Summit Streets, Weingartner Park is a passive area with a variety of Black Walnut, Norway Maple, White Pine, Dogwood, Beech, Sweetgum, Hemlock and Cherry trees, as well as pathways and benches to enjoy.\"</ref>\n\nThe Wee Wallers park is on Shearer St. and is a playground developed for children ages 2 to 10.\n\nSecond Street Park, located at Second Street and Prospect Avenue, is a tennis court area open to the public seven days a week, closing at dusk.\n\nNinth Street Park, located at Ninth and Church Streets is a watershed runoff area designed to attract birds.  There is a trail that goes through park with footbridge over the drainage area and is a natural-feeling area.\n\nThe Fourth Street Park is an approximately {{convert|11000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} open area used for various sporting activities. The clay totem poles were made by residents.\n\nEighth Street Park, also known as \"A Child's Garden,\" was developed by local children.  It has a brick walking path, plantings and benches.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 407\n|1880= 673\n|1890= 1060\n|1900= 1287\n|1910= 1710\n|1920= 2041\n|1930= 2393\n|1940= 2450\n|1950= 2998\n|1960= 3673\n|1970= 3911\n|1980= 3391\n|1990= 3802\n|2000= 3342\n|2010= 3229\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=3266\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n|2017=3,250}}\nAs of the 2017 census, the borough was 87.1% White, 5.1% Black or African American, 0% Native American, 5.02% Asian, and 4.92% were two or more races. 1.66% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/profile/PA#locality-tab</ref>\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2017, there were 3,250 people, 1,320 households, and 869 families residing in the borough.

North Wales is in the [[North Penn School District]].\n\n==Location==\nNorth Wales is located at {{Coord|40|12|39|N|75|16|30|W|type:city}} (40.210703, -75.274994).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==History==\nAs its name suggests, North Wales was settled by [[Welsh people|Welsh]] immigrants who named it after [[North Wales]] in [[Wales]] (for more on Welsh settlements in colonial Pennsylvania, see \"[[Welsh Tract]]\"). Part of a 1702 William Penn land grant, this rich farming country was given the name \"Gwynedd\" for the homeland of the earliest settlers and it began as a pastoral village in agricultural Gwynedd Township.\n\nBefore 1850, a number of farms, plus a 1776 church, shared by the Lutheran and Reformed congregations, dotted the present borough's landscape. What is now Main Street was originally an old Indian trail, and was laid out as the Great Road in 1728. By 1828, it had become today's Sumneytown Pike, and was a toll road until 1914.  It had always been an important route to Philadelphia, and continues to serve as a connection to Routes 202 and 309 to the east and the Northeastern Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the west.\n\nIts rural character was abruptly disrupted by the building of the [[North Pennsylvania Railroad]] starting in 1852. Service from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] through North Wales began in 1857. The town quickly grew around the railroad station, with hotels and restaurants lining Walnut Street and Main Street within walking distance. North Wales is the oldest of the North Penn boroughs, incorporated in 1869, by taking land from today's [[Upper Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Gwynedd Township]], then the northern portion of Gwynedd Township.\n\nSome of the large homes at the start of the 20th century were opened to summer guests from the city. \"Idlewilde\", still present on Main Street, hosted the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II, when he was visiting Philadelphia to open the 1876 U.S. Centennial Exhibition with President Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, much of North Wales borough's housing was built. Most houses along South Main Street between Montgomery and Prospects Streets remain much as they were when built and are lovingly maintained.  The borough also features a variety of single family homes, as well as twins, and rowhomes.\n\nBetween 1900 and 1926, [[Lehigh Valley Transit Company]] operated its Chestnut Hill Branch trolley line, which connected North Wales to surrounding towns through service to either [[Philadelphia]] or [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]. The trolley ran down Main Street through the borough, but detoured onto Pennsylvania Avenue for two blocks to enable it to cross the [[North Pennsylvania Railroad|North Penn Railroad]] on a bridge.  The bridge was required because the railroad, citing safety concerns, refused to allow the trolleys to cross at the Main Street grade crossing.  [[Lehigh Valley Transit Company]]'s combined passenger/freight station was located on the north (east) side of Pennsylvania Avenue between Shearer Street and Montgomery Avenue.  After Main Street trolley service ended in 1926, Lehigh Valley Transit high-speed trolleys continued to serve the Wales Junction station, located on Sumneytown Pike three-quarters of a mile west of town.  High-speed trolley serviced ended in September 1951.\n\nIn 2000, the North Wales Historic Preservation District was established by Borough Council and the Pennsylvania Historic and Museum Commission to protect the architecture that is a visual reminder of the borough's past. It is the first Historic District in the North Penn boroughs.\n\n==Business District==\nNorth Wales' Main and Walnut Streets have been home to many businesses over the town's history and these two thoroughfares still serve the community today by providing a number of services such as a variety of hair salons and beauty parlors, a pharmacy, doctors' offices, a dry cleaner, a running and walking shoe specialty store, a yoga studio, two auto repair facilities, two auto body shops, two laundromats, a post office, convenience store, and a recording studio, among many others.  Eateries and bars include two pizza parlors, a Tex-Mex restaurant, two cafes, two bakeries, a juice bar and a vegan restaurant.\n\n==Community Outreach==\nThe borough houses the headquarters for the [[Montgomery County Association for the Blind]], as well as the non-profit organization The Lamb Foundation, which provides housing and life skills support to the area's mentally-challenged residents.  The Lamb Foundation also runs a consignment/secondhand shop, Sweet Repeats, located on South 5th St. near the North Wales train station.  The borough is also home to the Boy Scouts of America Pack/Troop 84, whose meeting place is located at Second and Church Streets.\n\n==Education==\n* North Wales Elementary School is part of the [[North Penn School District]]. The building was North Wales High School from 1927 until North Penn High School was built in the 1950s; it then became an elementary school. The original elementary school from the 1900s was located at the current site of Borough Hall.\n* St. Rose of Lima Catholic School of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]]. In January 2012, the archdiocese announced that St. Rose of Lima would merge with St. Stanislaus Parish School in [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]], with students attending classes in Lansdale.<ref>Di Domizio, Tony. \"[http://lansdale.patch.com/articles/st-rose-goes-and-goretti-gone St. Rose Goes and Goretti, Gone].\" ''[[Montgomeryville-Lansdale Patch]]''. January 6, 2012. Retrieved on January 7, 2012.</ref>\n\n==Library==\n\nNorth Wales Elementary School formerly housed the North Wales Memorial Free Library from 1927 to 2009.  Due to the growing number of students at school, as well as the library's need for more space, the library purchased and relocated to a much larger (10,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>, over 900 m<sup>2</sup>) building at 233 South Swartley Street. They began operating with limited hours at the new location on January 4, 2010, and had their grand opening in April 2010 with full hours, including Saturday. The library has also changed its name to \"North Wales Area Library\" upon its move. It is part of the Montgomery County Library System.\n\n==Parks and recreation==\nWeingartner Park is located at Second and Summit Streets with a large variety of trees.  There are many pathways and benches to enjoy and the park is particularly shady and breezy during the spring and summer months.<ref>[http://northwalesborough.org/parks-recreation/] Weingartner Park \"A 3 acre recreation area located at Second and Summit Streets, Weingartner Park is a passive area with a variety of Black Walnut, Norway Maple, White Pine, Dogwood, Beech, Sweetgum, Hemlock and Cherry trees, as well as pathways and benches to enjoy.\"</ref>\n\nThe Wee Wallers park is on Shearer St. and is a playground developed for children ages 2 to 10.\n\nSecond Street Park, located at Second Street and Prospect Avenue, is a tennis court area open to the public seven days a week, closing at dusk.\n\nNinth Street Park, located at Ninth and Church Streets is a watershed runoff area designed to attract birds.  There is a trail that goes through park with footbridge over the drainage area and is a natural-feeling area.\n\nThe Fourth Street Park is an approximately {{convert|11000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} open area used for various sporting activities. The clay totem poles were made by residents.\n\nEighth Street Park, also known as \"A Child's Garden,\" was developed by local children.  It has a brick walking path, plantings and benches.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 407\n|1880= 673\n|1890= 1060\n|1900= 1287\n|1910= 1710\n|1920= 2041\n|1930= 2393\n|1940= 2450\n|1950= 2998\n|1960= 3673\n|1970= 3911\n|1980= 3391\n|1990= 3802\n|2000= 3342\n|2010= 3229\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=3266\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n|2017=3,250}}\nAs of the 2017 census, the borough was 87.1% White, 5.1% Black or African American, 0% Native American, 5.02% Asian, and 4.92% were two or more races. 1.66% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/profile/PA#locality-tab</ref>\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2017, there were 3,250 people, 1,320 households, and 869 families residing in the borough.
