The zig zag line operated between 1869 and 1910, to overcome an otherwise insurmountable climb and descent on the western side of the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. It was designed by [[John Whitton]] and built from 1863 to 1869 by Patrick Higgins as contractor. It is also known as the '''Great Zig Zag Railway and Reserves''' and '''Zig Zag Railway'''. The property is owned by Department of Planning and Infrastructure (State Government). It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-542>{{cite NSW SHR|5045513|Great Zig Zag Railway and Reserves|hr=00542|fn=S90/04091 & HC 31135|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nPart of the railway line is now used by the [[Zig Zag Railway]], a narrow gauge tourist railway.\n\n== History ==\n=== Construction ===\nThe original plan by the Engineer-in-Charge of [[New South Wales Government Railways]], [[John Whitton]], had been to build a {{convert|2|mi|adj=on}} tunnel. However, this was beyond the resources of the [[Government of New South Wales|Colonial Government]] at the time. The [[Zig Zag (railway)|zig zag]] alternative still required several short tunnels and some viaducts.<ref name=nswshr-542/> After consideration of several alternate routes the Great Western Railway was extended along the high ridge of the Darling Causeway from {{NSWcity|Mount Victoria}}. The descent to the Lithgow Valley was originally proposed by means of a tunnel. In 1866 the tunnel was estimated to be about two miles in length and a figure of $800,000 was set down as the cost of its construction. However, due to the enormous cost, construction time and, as John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief of the NSW Railways reported at the time, it would have been difficult to get a contractor to undertake such difficult work. As a result, John Whitton selected the zig zag method of ascent and descent.<ref name=nswshr-542/><ref name=Fookes/>\n\nOn the eastern side of the range, the [[Lapstone Zig Zag]], also designed under the supervision of John Whitton, opened near [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in 1867. The Lapstone Zig Zag ascended Lapstone Hill on a [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] of 1:30 to 1:33 (~ 3 - 3.3%), which contoured up the side of the range with comparatively light earthworks.<ref name=Lapstone>{{cite NSW SHR|1170821|G024 : Lapstone Zig Zag|accessdate=19 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, the Lithgow Zig Zag railway, built between 1866 and 1869, required much heavier engineering, including four large rock cuttings, three fine stone viaducts with {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} semi-circular arches (originally four were planned, but one was built as an embankment instead) and a short tunnel (three tunnels were planned, but two were [[Daylighting (tunnels)|daylighted]] during construction due to leaks, becoming two of the four cuttings mentioned above). In the descent of the middle road, the line dropped {{convert|101|ft}} between the reversing points, being part of the {{convert|550|ft}} descent from [[Clarence, New South Wales|Clarence]]. The whole route had a [[ruling grade]] of 1:42 (~2.38%).<ref name=nswshr-542/>\n\nJohn Whitton and his work have been underrated in Australian history, although they provided the operational foundation of the main railway lines in New South Wales. In international references Whitton is recognised as one of approximately twenty of the greatest railway civil engineers in the first century of world railway construction. The achievement of his crossings of the Great Divide was superlative at the time and in terms of British railway civil engineering was only exceeded by the difficult crossing of the Indian Ghats.<ref name=nswshr-542-124>Department of Planning 1987</ref><ref name=nswshr-542/>\n\nThe contract to build the Great Zig Zag was awarded to Mr [[Patrick Higgins (politician)|Patrick Higgins]] in May 1866. It was for the [[Clarence, New South Wales|Clarence]] to [[Wallerawang]] section of railway which consisted of seven stone viaducts, varying in height from {{convert|10|to|70|ft|m|order=flip}}, three tunnels and nearly one and a quarter million cubic yards of excavations, two-thirds through rock.<ref name=nswshr-542/><ref name=Fookes/>\n\n==== George Donald ====\n{{main|George Donald}}\n[[George Donald|George McGarvie Donald]] of Lithgow was a master stonemason and builder who helped create the city of Lithgow. Born in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] in 1846, he was son of a Scottish stonemason, George Donald, senior. George senior had been encouraged to migrate to New South Wales by [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]] who wished him to assist with government building works. George junior did an apprenticeship as a stonemason under his father and uncle. After this he was engaged on railway construction projects in the {{NSWcity|Bowenfels}} district in the late 1860s. He worked on stone railway bridges at the Great Zig Zag and [[Marrangaroo, New South Wales|Marrangaroo]], and married Marion Miles, daughter of one of the construction foremen. Following completion of the railway he moved to [[Hill End, New South Wales|Hill End]] and worked on a range of construction projects. Among these was Hill End Methodist church, built of basalt rubble from the gold mines. It is now used as an Anglican church. After the failure of the deep lead gold boom of the 1870s George returned to the Lithgow valley and established a construction business with Thomas Crowe. In the early 1880s he constructed St.Mary's Presbyterian church for Thomas Brown, built as a memorial to Brown's wife, Mary. He also built [[Cooerwull Academy]] for Brown, and the Church of St. John the Evangelist at Wallerawang. Other projects included Lithgow Town Hall, Wallerawang Public School the Lithgow Oddfellows Hall and many residences. Donald and Crowe also built Mort's freezing works. George Donald was extremely active in community affairs and had a great sense of social justice. He was founding member of the GUIOOF Lily of the Valley Lodge and the Good Templars Lodge. Popular among citizens he was elected the first mayor of Lithgow after establishment of the Municipality of Lithgow in 1889. He held the seat of [[Hartley, New South Wales|Hartley]] in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|NSW Legislative Assembly]] jointly with [[Joseph Cook]] from 1891.<ref name=nswshr-542-125>Christison, 2014, 32-33</ref><ref name=nswshr-542/>\n\n===Commercial operation and closure===\n{{Self-contradictory|section|about=the year of a goods engine's bursting through the buffer stops|date=May 2019}}\nOn 19 October 1869 the first official train ran across the Lithgow Zig Zag to [[Bowenfels railway station]], completing the route over the Blue Mountains. This event was heralded worldwide as an engineering marvel resulting in many organised sight-seeing parties from overseas to view it.<ref name=nswshr-542/> According to NSW Planning Department documents, in international references, John Whitton is recognised as one of approximately twenty of the greatest railway civil engineers in the first century of world railway construction. The achievement of his crossings of the Great Divide was superlative at the time and in terms of British railway civil engineering was only exceeded by the difficult crossing of the [[Himalayas|Indian Ghats]].<ref name=nswshr-542/>\n\nBetween 1869 and 1910 the railway was a major force in the development of western New South Wales. Eventually traffic became so dense, due to the growth of the railway system through the spread of settlement, together with the loss of time in working over the Great Zig Zag, that alternatives were considered. From the 1880s many inquiries and investigations were held including consideration of John Whitton's original proposal for a two-mile tunnel.<ref name=nswshr-542/>\n\nThe Lithgow Zig Zag operated between 1869 and 1910. By then it had become an increasingly inefficient bottleneck owing to the growing traffic on the line between Lithgow and Sydney. The Top Points were also too short. In 1901 a goods engine burst through the buffer stops located at the top 'wing' and almost fell into the valley below. To alleviate the congestion until a new deviation opened the 'top' and 'bottom' wings were improved. The 'top' wing was abandoned and a new line constructed which involved a sharp curve, heavy rock excavations and earth filings to a depth of {{convert|60|ft}}. The 'bottom' wing was lengthened without any re-location. However, accidents still continued to occur, as was seen on 8 December 1908 when a Sydney bound goods train stalled just beyond [[Clarence Tunnel]]. The train was divided into two but the bottom portion accidentally became a runaway and eventually crashed into the rock cutting of Top Points.<ref name=SHR2>{{cite NSW SHR|5012082|Great Zig Zag Railway deviation tunnels|fn=H98/00287/03|accessdate=4 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1904 a goods engine burst through the buffer stops located at the top \"wing\" and almost fell into the valley below. To alleviate the congestion until a new deviation opened the \"top\" and \"bottom\" wings were improved. The \"top\" wing was abandoned and a new line constructed which involved a sharp curve, heavy rock excavations and earth filings to a depth of {{convert|60|ft|m|order=flip}}. The \"bottom\" wing was lengthened without any re-location.<ref name=nswshr-542/>\n\nIn 1908, the top points dead end was extended for longer trains, only to be replaced in 1910.<ref name=SHR2/><ref name=\"THE ZIG-ZAG DEVIATION\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article76953033 |title=THE ZIG-ZAG DEVIATION. |newspaper=[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate (NSW : 1892 - 1927)]] |location=NSW |date=5 December 1908 |accessdate=17 February 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> There were plans to replace the section of 1 in 42 from Lithgow to Bottom points with a second horseshoe curve-like longer deviation, or with a spiral, but as this section in the open air could be operated with [[bank engine]]s, this second stage deviation was never carried out.<ref name=\"THE ZIG-ZAG DEVIATION\"/>\n\nIn 1908, work began on the [[Ten Tunnels Deviation]], a double tracked route with a [[ruling grade]] of 1:42 as far as the start of the ten tunnels and 1 in 90 through the ten tunnels. The Lithgow Zig Zag was eventually abandoned in 1910, replaced by the Ten-Tunnels Deviation which is still in heavy use as the [[Main Western railway line, New South Wales|Main West line]] to the central-west of NSW and ultimately the [[East\u2013west rail corridor, Australia|trans-Australia line]] between Sydney and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].<ref name=nswshr-542/><ref name=SHR2/> On 16 October 1910 the new deviation was opened for traffic and the Great Zig Zag closed.<ref name=nswshr-542/><ref name=Fookes/>\n\n===Use following commercial operation===\nDuring [[World War II]], the Clarence Tunnel on the Lithgow Zig Zag (along with other tunnels on various lines) were used to store chemical weapons for the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. Principally [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]], the chemical agents were housed in a variety of weapons from bombs to cylinders. The cache was disposed of after the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mustardgas.org/depots.htm |title=Australian supervised |work=Chemical Warfare in Australia |publisher=Geoff Plunkett |year=2011 |accessdate=5 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128073457/http://www.mustardgas.org/depots.htm |archive-date=28 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Preservation===\n{{main|Zig Zag Railway}}\nIn 1972 a cooperative formed to re-use the line using rolling stock sourced from inter-state. In 1975 the line re-opened as a tourist attraction, operating between Top and Bottom Points. The re-development extended to Mt Sinai halt in 1987 and on to Clarence in 1988.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Great Zig Zag Railway consists of three sections: the \"top road\", the \"middle road\" and the \"bottom road\". Located on the \"top road\" is number one viaduct. The top points are located where \"top road\" and \"middle road\" join. Beyond this two \"T\" bridges and a stone arch are located at the entrance to the \"wing\" where the train terminated before proceeding to the \"middle road\" Located on the \"middle road\" is number one and number two viaduct and number one tunnel and a cutting which was originally proposed to be number two tunnel. At the end of \"middle road\" is the bottom \"wing\".

It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-542>{{cite NSW SHR|5045513|Great Zig Zag Railway and Reserves|hr=00542|fn=S90/04091 & HC 31135|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nPart of the railway line is now used by the [[Zig Zag Railway]], a narrow gauge tourist railway.\n\n== History ==\n=== Construction ===\nThe original plan by the Engineer-in-Charge of [[New South Wales Government Railways]], [[John Whitton]], had been to build a {{convert|2|mi|adj=on}} tunnel. However, this was beyond the resources of the [[Government of New South Wales|Colonial Government]] at the time. The [[Zig Zag (railway)|zig zag]] alternative still required several short tunnels and some viaducts.<ref name=nswshr-542/> After consideration of several alternate routes the Great Western Railway was extended along the high ridge of the Darling Causeway from {{NSWcity|Mount Victoria}}. The descent to the Lithgow Valley was originally proposed by means of a tunnel. In 1866 the tunnel was estimated to be about two miles in length and a figure of $800,000 was set down as the cost of its construction. However, due to the enormous cost, construction time and, as John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief of the NSW Railways reported at the time, it would have been difficult to get a contractor to undertake such difficult work. As a result, John Whitton selected the zig zag method of ascent and descent.<ref name=nswshr-542/><ref name=Fookes/>\n\nOn the eastern side of the range, the [[Lapstone Zig Zag]], also designed under the supervision of John Whitton, opened near [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in 1867. The Lapstone Zig Zag ascended Lapstone Hill on a [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] of 1:30 to 1:33 (~ 3 - 3.3%), which contoured up the side of the range with comparatively light earthworks.<ref name=Lapstone>{{cite NSW SHR|1170821|G024 : Lapstone Zig Zag|accessdate=19 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, the Lithgow Zig Zag railway, built between 1866 and 1869, required much heavier engineering, including four large rock cuttings, three fine stone viaducts with {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} semi-circular arches (originally four were planned, but one was built as an embankment instead) and a short tunnel (three tunnels were planned, but two were [[Daylighting (tunnels)|daylighted]] during construction due to leaks, becoming two of the four cuttings mentioned above). In the descent of the middle road, the line dropped {{convert|101|ft}} between the reversing points, being part of the {{convert|550|ft}} descent from [[Clarence, New South Wales|Clarence]]. The whole route had a [[ruling grade]] of 1:42 (~2.38%).<ref name=nswshr-542/>\n\nJohn Whitton and his work have been underrated in Australian history, although they provided the operational foundation of the main railway lines in New South Wales. In international references Whitton is recognised as one of approximately twenty of the greatest railway civil engineers in the first century of world railway construction. The achievement of his crossings of the Great Divide was superlative at the time and in terms of British railway civil engineering was only exceeded by the difficult crossing of the Indian Ghats.<ref name=nswshr-542-124>Department of Planning 1987</ref><ref name=nswshr-542/>\n\nThe contract to build the Great Zig Zag was awarded to Mr [[Patrick Higgins (politician)|Patrick Higgins]] in May 1866. It was for the [[Clarence, New South Wales|Clarence]] to [[Wallerawang]] section of railway which consisted of seven stone viaducts, varying in height from {{convert|10|to|70|ft|m|order=flip}}, three tunnels and nearly one and a quarter million cubic yards of excavations, two-thirds through rock.<ref name=nswshr-542/><ref name=Fookes/>\n\nGeorge McGarvie Donald of Lithgow was a master stonemason and builder who helped create the city of Lithgow. Born in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] in 1846, he was son of a Scottish stonemason [[George Donald]]. George senior had been encouraged to migrate to New South Wales by [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]] who wished him to assist with government building works. George junior did an apprenticeship as a stonemason under his father and uncle. After this he was engaged on railway construction projects in the Bowenfles district in the late 1860s. He worked on stone railway bridges at the Great Zig Zag and [[Marrangaroo, New South Wales|Marrangaroo]], and married Marion Miles, daughter of one of the construction foremen. Following completion of the railway he moved to [[Hill End, New South Wales|Hill End]] and worked on a range of construction projects. Among these was Hill End Methodist church, built of basalt rubble from the gold mines. It is now used as an Anglican church. After the failure of the deep lead gold boom of the 1870s George returned to the Lithgow valley and established a construction business with Thomas Crowe. In the early 1880s he constructed St.Mary's Presbyterian church for Thomas Brown, built as a memorial to Brown's wife, Mary. He also built [[Cooerwull Academy]] for Brown, and the Church of St. John the Evangelist at Wallerawang. Other projects included Lithgow Town Hall, Wallerawang Public School the Lithgow Oddfellows Hall and many residences. Donald and Crowe also built Mort's freezing works. George Donald was extremely active in community affairs and had a great sense of social justice. He was founding member of the GUIOOF Lily of the Valley Lodge and the Good Templars Lodge. Popular among citizens he was elected the first mayor of Lithgow after establishment of the Municipality of Lithgow in 1889. He held the seat of [[Hartley, New South Wales|Hartley]] in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|NSW Legislative Assembly]] jointly with [[Joseph Cook]] from 1891.<ref name=nswshr-542-125>Christison, 2014, 32-33</ref><ref name=nswshr-542/>\n\n===Commercial operation and closure===\n{{Self-contradictory|section|about=the year of a goods engine's bursting through the buffer stops|date=May 2019}}\nOn 19 October 1869 the first official train ran across the Lithgow Zig Zag to [[Bowenfels railway station]], completing the route over the Blue Mountains. This event was heralded worldwide as an engineering marvel resulting in many organised sight-seeing parties from overseas to view it.<ref name=nswshr-542/> According to NSW Planning Department documents, in international references, John Whitton is recognised as one of approximately twenty of the greatest railway civil engineers in the first century of world railway construction. The achievement of his crossings of the Great Divide was superlative at the time and in terms of British railway civil engineering was only exceeded by the difficult crossing of the [[Himalayas|Indian Ghats]].<ref name=nswshr-542/>\n\nBetween 1869 and 1910 the railway was a major force in the development of western New South Wales. Eventually traffic became so dense, due to the growth of the railway system through the spread of settlement, together with the loss of time in working over the Great Zig Zag, that alternatives were considered. From the 1880s many inquiries and investigations were held including consideration of John Whitton's original proposal for a two-mile tunnel.<ref name=nswshr-542/>\n\nThe Lithgow Zig Zag operated between 1869 and 1910. By then it had become an increasingly inefficient bottleneck owing to the growing traffic on the line between Lithgow and Sydney. The Top Points were also too short. In 1901 a goods engine burst through the buffer stops located at the top 'wing' and almost fell into the valley below. To alleviate the congestion until a new deviation opened the 'top' and 'bottom' wings were improved. The 'top' wing was abandoned and a new line constructed which involved a sharp curve, heavy rock excavations and earth filings to a depth of {{convert|60|ft}}. The 'bottom' wing was lengthened without any re-location. However, accidents still continued to occur, as was seen on 8 December 1908 when a Sydney bound goods train stalled just beyond [[Clarence Tunnel]]. The train was divided into two but the bottom portion accidentally became a runaway and eventually crashed into the rock cutting of Top Points.<ref name=SHR2>{{cite NSW SHR|5012082|Great Zig Zag Railway deviation tunnels|fn=H98/00287/03|accessdate=4 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1904 a goods engine burst through the buffer stops located at the top \"wing\" and almost fell into the valley below.

The Lithgow Zig Zag was eventually abandoned in 1910, replaced by the Ten-Tunnels Deviation which is still in heavy use as the [[Main Western railway line, New South Wales|Main West line]] to the central-west of NSW and ultimately the [[East\u2013west rail corridor, Australia|trans-Australia line]] between Sydney and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].<ref name=nswshr-542/><ref name=SHR2/> On 16 October 1910 the new deviation was opened for traffic and the Great Zig Zag closed.<ref name=nswshr-542/><ref name=Fookes/>\n\n===Use following commercial operation===\nDuring [[World War II]], the Clarence Tunnel on the Lithgow Zig Zag (along with other tunnels on various lines) were used to store chemical weapons for the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. Principally [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]], the chemical agents were housed in a variety of weapons from bombs to cylinders.

In 1975 the line re-opened as a tourist attraction, operating between Top and Bottom Points. The re-development extended to Mt Sinai halt in 1987 and on to Clarence in 1988.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Great Zig Zag Railway consists of three sections: the \"top road\", the \"middle road\" and the \"bottom road\". Located on the \"top road\" is number one viaduct. The top points are located where \"top road\" and \"middle road\" join.

North Floridians considered their area to be part of the [[Southern United States|South]] and \"[[Dixie]]\"; while Floridians from all parts of the state considered their area to be part of the South, people in more southern areas typically did not identify with Dixie.

In the late republic and much of the imperial period (from about 100 BC), a legion was divided into ten [[cohort (Roman military unit)|cohorts]], each of six (or five) centuries. Legions also included a small ''[[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|ala]]'', or cavalry, unit. By the third century AD, the legion was a much smaller unit of about 1,000 to 1,500 men, and there were more of them. In the fourth century AD, [[East Roman army|East Roman]] [[border guard]] legions (''[[limitanei]]'') may have become even smaller. In terms of organisation and function, the republican era legion may have been influenced by the ancient Greek and Macedonian [[phalanx]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite journal|last=Manousos Kambouris|first=Spyros Bakas|date=2016|title=Greco-Macedonian influences in the manipular Legion system|url=https://www.academia.edu/31286327|journal=Archaeology and Science|volume=11 2015|pages=145\u2013154|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Function and constitution ==\nFor most of the Roman Imperial period, the legions formed the Roman army's elite [[heavy infantry]], recruited exclusively from Roman citizens, while the remainder of the army consisted of [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]], who provided additional infantry and the vast majority of the Roman army's cavalry. (Provincials who aspired to [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]] gained it when [[Honesta missio|honourably discharged]] from the [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]].) The Roman army, for most of the Imperial period, consisted mostly of auxiliaries rather than legions.<ref>Data in: Goldsworthy, Adrian (2003). Complete Roman Army. pp. 95\u201395; Holder, Paul (1980). Studies in the Auxilia of the Roman Army. pp. 86\u201396; Elton, Hugh (1996). Frontiers of the Roman empire. pp 123. See table in article \"Auxiliaries (Roman military)\" for compilation of this data.</ref>\n\n==Longevity ==\nMany of the legions founded before 40 BC were still active until at least the fifth century, notably [[Legio V Macedonica]], which was founded by [[Augustus]] in 43 BC and was in Egypt in the seventh century during the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt]].\n\n==Overview of typical organization and strength==\n\n{{Main|Structural history of the Roman military}}\n[[File:Roman Legionaries-MGR Lyon-IMG 1050.JPG|thumb|Imperial Roman legionaries in tight formation, a relief from [[Glanum]], a Roman town in what is now [[southern France]] that was inhabited from 27 BC to 260 AD (when it was sacked by invading [[Alemanni]])]]\nBecause legions were not permanent units until the [[Marian reforms]] (c. 107 BC), and were instead created, used, and disbanded again, several hundred legions were named and numbered throughout Roman history. To date, about 50 have been identified. The republican legions were composed of levied men that paid for their own equipment and thus the structure of the Roman army at this time reflected the society, and at any time there would be four consular legions (with command divided between the two ruling consuls) and in time of war extra legions could be levied. Toward the end of the 2nd century BC, Rome started to experience manpower shortages brought about by property and financial qualifications to join the army. This prompted consul [[Gaius Marius]] to remove property qualifications and decree that all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for service in the Roman army with equipment and rewards for fulfilling years of service provided by the state. The Roman army became a volunteer, professional and standing army which extended service beyond Roman citizens but also to non-citizens who could sign on as [[Auxilia|''auxillia'']] (auxiliaries) and were rewarded [[Roman citizenship]] upon completion of service and all the rights and privileges that entailed. In the time of [[Augustus]], there were nearly 50 upon his succession but this was reduced to about 25\u201335 permanent standing legions and this remained the figure for most of the empire's history.\n\n==Evolution ==\nThe legion evolved from 3,000 men in the [[Roman Republic]] to over 5,200 men in the [[Roman Empire]], consisting of [[centuria|centuries]] as the basic units. Until the middle of the first century, ten [[Cohort (Roman military unit)|cohorts]] (about 500 men) made up a Roman legion. This was later changed to nine cohorts of standard size (with six centuries at 80 men each) with the first cohort being of double strength (five double-strength centuries with 160 men each). By the fourth century AD, the legion was a much smaller unit of about 1,000 to 1,500 men, and there were more of them. This had come about as the large formation legion and auxiliary unit, 10,000 men, was broken down into smaller units - originally temporary detachments - to cover more territory.  In the fourth century AD, [[East Roman army|East Roman]] [[border guard]] legions (''[[limitanei]]'') may have become even smaller. In terms of organisation and function, the Republican era legion may have been influenced by the ancient Greek and Macedonian [[phalanx]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Size==\nThe size of a typical legion varied throughout the history of ancient Rome, with complements of 4,200 legionaries and 300 [[equites]] (drawn from the wealthier classes&nbsp;\u2013 in early Rome all troops provided their own equipment) in the republican period of Rome (the infantry were split into 10 [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] each of four [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]] of 120 legionaries), to 5,200 men plus 120 auxiliaries in the imperial period (split into 10 cohorts, nine of 480 men each, plus the first cohort holding 800 men).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Roman army|Military history of ancient Rome|Structural history of the Roman military}}\n\n=== Roman kings (to c. 500 BC) ===\n{{Main|Early Roman army}}\n\nIn the period before the raising of the ''legio'' and the early years of the Roman Kingdom and the Republic, forces are described as being organized into ''[[Centuria|centuries]]'' of roughly one hundred men. These centuries were grouped together as required and answered to the leader who had hired or raised them. Such independent organization persisted until the 2nd century BC amongst light infantry and cavalry, but was discarded completely in later periods with the supporting role taken instead by allied troops. The roles of century leader (later formalized as a [[centurion]]), [[Optio|second in command]] and [[Aquilifer|standard bearer]] are referenced in this early period.\n\nRome's early period is undocumented and shrouded in myths, but those myths tell that during the rule of [[Servius Tullius]], the [[census]] (from [[Latin]]: ''cense\u014d'' \u2013 accounting of the people) was introduced. With this all Roman able-bodied, property-owning male citizens were divided into five classes for military service based on their wealth and then organized into centuries as sub-units of the greater Roman army or ''legio'' (multitude). Joining the army was both a duty and a distinguishing mark of Roman citizenship; during the entire pre-Marian period the wealthiest land owners performed the most years of military service. These individuals would have had the most to lose should the state have fallen.\n\n=== Roman Republic (509\u2013107 BC) ===\n{{Main|Roman army of the mid-Republic}}\n\nAt some point, possibly in the beginning of the [[Roman Republic]] after the [[Roman Republic#Overthrow of the kings|kings were overthrown]], the ''legio'' was subdivided into two separate legions, each one ascribed to one of the two [[Roman consul|consuls]]. In the first years of the Republic, when warfare was mostly concentrated on raiding, it is uncertain if the full manpower of the legions was summoned at any one time. In 494 BC, when three foreign threats emerged, the dictator [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] raised ten legions which [[Livy]] says was a greater number than had been raised previously at any one time.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.30</ref>\n\nAlso, some warfare was still conducted by Roman forces outside the legionary structure, the most famous example being the campaign in 479 BC by the clan army of gens Fabia against the Etruscan city of Veii (in which the clan was annihilated). Legions became more formally organized in the 4th century BC, as Roman warfare evolved to more frequent and planned operations, and the consular army was raised to two legions each.\n\nIn the Republic, legions had an ephemeral existence. Except for Legio I to IV, which were the consular armies (two per consul), other units were levied by campaign. Rome's Italian allies were required to provide approximately ten cohorts (auxilia were not organized into legions) to support each Roman Legion.\n\nIn the middle of the Republic, legions were composed of the following units:\n* ''[[Equites]]'' (cavalry): The [[cavalry]] was originally the most prestigious unit, where wealthy young Roman men displayed their skill and prowess, laying the foundation for an eventual political career. Cavalry equipment was purchased by each of the cavalrymen and consisted of a round shield, helmet, body armour, sword and one or more [[lance]]s. The cavalry was outnumbered in the legion. In a total of ''circa'' 3,000 men, (plus the velites that normally enlarged the number to about 4,200), the legion only had around 300 horsemen, divided into 10 units (''[[turma]]e'') of 30 men. These men were commanded by [[Decurion (military)|decurions]]. In addition to heavy cavalry, there would be the light cavalry levied from poor citizens and wealthy young citizens not old enough to be in the ''hastati'' or the ''equites''. In battle, they were used to disrupt and [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] enemy infantry formations and to fight off enemy cavalry. In the latter type of engagement, they would often (though not always) dismount some or all of the horsemen to fight a stationary battle on foot, an unusual tactic for the time, but one that offered significant advantages in stability and agility in a time before [[stirrup]]s.<ref>Mccall, Jeremiah B. ''The Cavalry of the Roman Republic: Cavalry Combat and Elite Reputations in the Middle and Late Republic.'' (New York, Routledge, 2002) pp. 53ff</ref>\n* ''[[Velites]]'' ([[light infantry]]): The ''velites'' were mainly poorer citizens who could not afford to equip themselves properly. Their primary function was to act as [[skirmishers]] \u2013 javelin-throwers, who would engage the enemy early in order either to harass them or to cover the movement of troops behind them. After throwing their javelins, they would retreat through the gaps between the maniples, screened from the attack of the enemy by the heavy infantry lines. With the shortage of cavalry in the army of the early to mid Republican army, the [[velites]] were also used as scouts. They did not have a precise formal organization or formation.\n* [[Heavy infantry]]: This was the principal unit of the legion. The heavy infantry was composed of citizen legionaries that could afford the equipment composed of an iron helmet, shield, armour and [[pilum]], a heavy javelin whose range was about 30 meters. After 387 BC, the preferred weapon for the hastati and principes was the [[gladius]], a short sword. Their hobnailed sandals (''[[caligae]]'') were also an effective weapon against a fallen enemy. Prior to the Marian reforms (see below), the heavy infantry was subdivided, according to experience, into three separate lines of troops:\n** The ''[[hastati]]'' (sing. ''hastatus'') consisted of raw or inexperienced soldiers, considered to be less reliable than legionaries of several years' service. The Hastati were placed at the front for several reasons. One reason is the city of Rome could ill-afford to lose experienced soldiers, so they put the greenest soldiers at the front. If they survived, the Hastati/tus would gain invaluable experience. Another reason is if the newest soldiers succumbed to battle nerves and broke and tried to run, then there were experienced soldiers behind them to stiffen their resolve.\n** The ''[[principes]]'' (sing. ''princeps'') These were the more experienced soldiers, often better equipped than the Hastati, and having more experience on the battlefield, they would take up the second line in the battle in the event the Hastati failed or fled. They were the second wave in an early Republican Legion before the military reforms of Marius.\n** The ''[[triarii]]'' (sing. ''triarius'') were the veteran soldiers, to be used in battle only in extreme situations; they rested one knee down when not engaged in combat. The ''triarii'' served primarily as reserves or [[barrier troops]] designed to backstop the ''hastati'' and ''principes'', and were equipped with long ''[[Hasta (spear)|hastae]]'' (spears) rather than the ''pilum'' and ''gladius'' (the ''hastati'' and ''principes'' stopped using spears in 387 BC). Thus armed, they fought in a [[phalanx formation]]. The sight of an advancing armored formation of ''triarii'' legionaries frequently discouraged exultant enemies in pursuit of retreating ''hastati'' and ''principes'' troops. ''Ad triarios redisse'' \u2013 ''To fall back upon the triarii'' was a Roman [[idiom]] \u2013 meaning to use one's last resort.\n\nEach of these three lines was subdivided into (usually 10) chief tactical units called [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]. A maniple consisted of two [[Centuria|centuries]] and was commanded by the senior of the two [[centurion]]s. At this time, each century of hastati and principes consisted of 60 men; a century of triarii was 30 men. These 3,000 men (twenty maniples of 120 men, and ten maniples of 60 men), together with about 1,200 velites and 300 cavalry gave the mid Republican (\"manipular\") legion a nominal strength of about 4,500 men.\n\n=== Late Republic (107\u201330 BC) ===\n{{Main|Roman army of the late Republic}}\n[[File:Legion Task ORG.png|thumb|500px|Visual representation of the post Marian Reform Legion showing size and disposition for Infantry formations]]\n''See also [[List of Roman legions]] for details of notable late Republican legions''<br />\n''See also [[List of Roman army unit types#Sub-Units of the Roman legion|Sub-Units of the Roman legion]]''\n\nThe Marian reforms (of Gaius Marius) enlarged the centuries to 80 men, and grouped them into six-century \"cohorts\" (rather than two-century maniples). Each century had its own standard and was made up of ten units (''contubernia'') of eight men who shared a tent, a millstone, a mule and [[cooking pot]].\n\nFollowing the reforms of the general [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] in the 2nd century BC, the legions took on the second, narrower meaning that is familiar in the popular imagination as close-order citizen heavy infantry.\n\nAt the end of the 2nd century BC, [[Gaius Marius]] reformed the previously ephemeral legions as a professional force drawing from the poorest classes, enabling Rome to field larger armies and providing employment for jobless citizens of the city of Rome. However, this put the loyalty of the soldiers in the hands of their general rather than the State of Rome itself. This development ultimately enabled [[Julius Caesar]] to cross the [[Rubicon]] with an army loyal to him personally and effectively end the Republic.\n\nThe legions of the late Republic and early Empire are often called ''Marian'' legions. Following the [[Battle of Vercellae]] in 101 BC, Marius granted all Italian soldiers Roman citizenship. He justified this action to the Senate by saying that in the din of battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally. This effectively eliminated the notion of allied legions; henceforth all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions, and full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. At the same time, the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, standard type based on the ''Principes'': armed with two heavy javelins called ''pila'' (singular ''[[pilum]]''), the short sword called ''gladius'', chain mail (''[[lorica hamata]]''), helmet and rectangular shield (''[[scutum (shield)|scutum]]'').\n\nThe role of allied legions would eventually be taken up by contingents of allied auxiliary troops, called ''Auxilia''. ''Auxilia'' contained specialist units, engineers and pioneers, artillerymen and craftsmen, service and support personnel and irregular units made up of non-citizens, mercenaries and local militia. These were usually formed into complete units such as light cavalry, [[light infantry]] or ''[[velites]]'', and labourers. There was also a [[reconnaissance]] [[squad]] of 10 or more light [[mounted infantry]] called ''[[speculatores]]'' who could also serve as messengers or even as an early form of [[military intelligence]] service.\n\nAs part of the Marian reforms, the legions' internal organization was standardized. Each legion was divided into ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]]''. Prior to this, cohorts had been temporary administrative units or tactical task forces of several maniples, even more transitory than the legions themselves. Now the cohorts were ten permanent units, composed of 6 centuries and in the case of the first cohort 5 double strength centuries each led by a centurion assisted by an ''[[optio]]''. The cohorts came to form the basic tactical unit of the legions. Ranking within the legion was based on length of service, with the senior Centurion commanding the first century of the first cohort; he was called the ''[[primus pilus]]'' (First Spear), and reported directly to the superior officers (legates and tribuni). All career soldiers could be promoted to the higher ranks in recognition of exceptional acts of bravery or valour. A newly promoted junior Centurion would be assigned to the sixth century of the tenth cohort and slowly progressed through the ranks from there.\n\nEvery legion had a large baggage train, which included 640 mules (1 mule for every 8 legionaries) just for the soldiers' equipment. To keep these baggage trains from becoming too large and slow, Marius had each infantryman carry as much of his own equipment as he could, including his own armour, weapons and 15 days' rations, for about 25\u201330&nbsp;kg (50\u201360 pounds) of load total. To make this easier, he issued each legionary a cross stick to carry their loads on their shoulders. The soldiers were nicknamed ''Marius' Mules'' because of the amount of gear they had to carry themselves. This arrangement allowed for the possibility for the supply train to become temporarily detached from the main body of the legion, thus greatly increasing the army's speed when needed.\n\nA typical legion of this period had 5,120 legionaries as well as a large number of camp followers, servants and slaves. Legions could contain as many as 11,000 fighting men when including the auxiliaries. During the Later Roman Empire, the legion was reduced in size to 1,000 to allow for easier provisioning and to expand the regions under surveillance. Numbers would also vary depending on casualties suffered during a campaign; [[Julius Caesar]]'s legions during his campaign in Gaul often only had around 3,500 men.\n\nTactics were not very different from the past, but their effectiveness was largely improved because of the professional training of the soldiers.\n\n[[Image:Centurio 70 aC - cropped.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor as a Roman centurion, ''c.'' 70.]]\n[[Image:Roman legionaire in lorica segmentata.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor, showing a Roman [[Legionary|''miles'']], (2nd century).]]\n\nAfter the Marian reforms and throughout the history of Rome's Late Republic, the legions played an important political role. By the 1st century BC, the threat of the legions under a [[demagogue]] was recognized. [[Roman Governor|Governors]] were not allowed to leave their provinces with their legions. When [[Julius Caesar]] broke this rule, leaving his province of Gaul and crossing the [[Rubicon]] into Italy, he precipitated a [[constitutional crisis]]. This crisis and the [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]] which followed brought an end to the Republic and led to the foundation of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] under [[Augustus]] in 27 BC.\n\n[[Image:Roman Empire 125.png|thumb|left|100px|The Roman empire under [[Hadrian]] (ruled 117\u201338), showing the '''legions''' deployed in 125]]\n\n=== Early Empire (27 BC\u2013AD 284) ===\n{{Main|Imperial Roman army}}\n\n''See  [[List of Roman legions#Early Empire legions|List of Roman legions of the early Empire]]''<br />\n''See also [[List of Roman army unit types#Sub-Units of the Roman legion|Sub-Units of the Roman legion]]''\n\n[[File:Roman-legions-14-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg|thumb|Map of Roman legions by 14 AD.Source: http://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1447/files/2014/05/Roman-legions-14-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg]]\n\nGenerals, during the recent Republican civil wars, had formed their own legions and numbered them as they wished. During this time, there was a high incidence of ''Gemina'' (twin) legions, where two legions were consolidated into a single organization (and was later made official and put under a [[legatus]] and six duces). At the end of the civil war against [[Mark Antony]], Augustus was left with around fifty legions, with several double counts (multiple Legio Xs for instance). For political and economic reasons, Augustus reduced the number of legions to 28 (which diminished to 25 after the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]], in which 3 legions were completely destroyed by the [[Germanics]]).\n\nBeside streamlining the army, Augustus also regulated the soldiers' pay. At the same time, he greatly increased the number of auxiliaries to the point where they were equal in number to the legionaries. He also created the [[Praetorian Guard]] along with a permanent [[Roman Navy|navy]] where served the ''liberti'', or freed slaves.\nThe legions also became permanent at this time, and not recruited for particular campaigns. They were also allocated to static bases with permanent ''[[castra]] legionaria'' (legionary fortresses).\n\nAugustus' military policies proved sound and cost effective, and were generally followed by his successors. These emperors would carefully add new legions, as circumstances required or permitted, until the strength of the standing army stood at around 30 legions (hence the wry remark of the philosopher [[Favorinus]] that ''It is ill arguing with the master of 30 legions''). With each legion having 5,120 legionaries usually supported by an equal number of auxiliary troops (according to Tacitus), the total force available to a legion commander during the [[Pax Romana]] probably ranged from 11,000 downwards, with the more prestigious legions and those stationed on hostile borders or in restive provinces tending to have more auxiliaries. By the time of the emperor [[Septimius Severus|Severus]], 193-211, the auxiliaries may have composed 55 to 60% of the army, 250,000 of 447,000. Some legions may have even been reinforced at times with units making the associated force near 15,000\u201316,000 or about the size of a modern [[Division (military)|division]].\n\nThroughout the [[Roman Empire|imperial]] era, the legions played an important political role. Their actions could secure the empire for a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] or take it away. For example, the defeat of [[Vitellius]] in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] was decided when the [[Danube|Danubian]] legions chose to support [[Vespasian]].\n\nIn the empire, the legion was standardized, with symbols and an individual history where men were proud to serve. The legion was commanded by a ''[[legatus]]'' or ''legate''. Aged around thirty, he would usually be a senator on a three-year appointment. Immediately subordinate to the legate would be six elected ''military tribunes'' \u2013 five would be staff officers and the remaining one would be a noble heading for the Senate (originally this tribune commanded the legion). There would also be a group of officers for the medical staff, the engineers, record-keepers, the ''praefectus castrorum'' (commander of the camp) and other specialists such as priests and musicians.\n\n=== Later Empire (from 284 AD) ===\n{{Main|Late Roman army}}\n{{See also|List of Roman legions}}\n[[File:Roman soldier end of third century northern province - cropped.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor, portraying a legionary at the end of the 3rd century]]\n[[File:Roman-legions-212-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg|thumb|Map of Roman legions by 212 AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1447/files/2014/05/Roman-legions-212-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg |title=Map |website=.hypotheses.org}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the [[Late Antiquity|Later Roman Empire]], the number of legions was increased and the [[Military establishment of the Roman empire|Roman Army]] expanded. There is no evidence to suggest that legions changed in form before the [[Tetrarchy]], although there is evidence that they were smaller than the paper strengths usually quoted. The final form of the legion originated with the elite ''legiones palatinae'' created by [[Diocletian]] and the Tetrarchs. These were infantry units of around 1,000 men rather than the 5,000, including cavalry, of the old Legions. The earliest ''legiones palatinae'' were the ''Lanciarii'', ''Joviani'', ''[[Herculians|Herculiani]]'' and ''Divitenses''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe 4th century saw a very large number of new, small legions created, a process which began under [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]]. In addition to the elite ''[[palatini (Roman military)|palatini]]'', other legions called ''[[comitatenses]]'' and ''[[pseudocomitatenses]]'', along with the ''[[auxilia palatina]]'', provided the infantry of late Roman armies. The [[Notitia Dignitatum]] lists 25 ''legiones palatinae'', 70 ''legiones comitatenses'', 47 ''legiones pseudocomitatenses'' and 111 ''auxilia palatina'' in the field armies, and a further 47 ''legiones'' in the frontier armies.<ref>Totals from summary of Notitia Dignitatum in Richardot, Philippe, ''La fin de l'arm\u00e9e romaine 284\u2013476'' [3rd ed.] Economica, 2005. {{ISBN|2-7178-4861-4}}.</ref> Legion names such as ''[[Honorius (emperor)|Honoriani]]'' and ''[[Gratian]]enses'' found in the Notitia suggest that the process of creating new legions continued through the 4th century rather than being a single event. The names also suggest that many new legions were formed from ''[[vexillatio]]nes'' or from old legions. In addition, there were 24 vexillationes palatini, 73 vexillationes comitatenses; 305 other units in the Eastern limitanei and 181 in the Western limitanei.<ref>Jones, Later Roman Empire, pp. 1449\u201350</ref>\n\nAccording to the late Roman writer [[Vegetius]]' ''[[De Re Militari]]'', each century had a [[ballista]] and each cohort had an [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]], giving the legion a formidable siege train of 59 Ballistae and 10 Onagers, each manned by 10 ''libritors'' (artillerymen) and mounted on wagons drawn by oxen or mules. In addition to attacking cities and fortifications, these would be used to help defend Roman forts and fortified camps ([[castra]]) as well. They would even be employed on occasion, especially in the later Empire, as [[field artillery]] during battles or in support of river crossings.\n\nDespite a number of reforms, the Legion system survived the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and was continued in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] until around 7th century, when reforms begun by Emperor [[Heraclius]] to counter the increasing need for soldiers around the Empire resulted in the [[Theme system]]. Despite this, the Eastern Roman/Byzantine armies continued to be influenced by the earlier Roman legions, and were maintained with similar level of discipline, strategic prowess, and organization.\n\n==Legionary ranks==\nAside from the rank and file [[legionary]] (who received the base wage of 10 [[as (coin)|ass\u0113s]] a day or 225 [[denarius|denarii]] a year), the following list describes the system of officers which developed within the legions from the Marian reforms (104 BC) until the military reforms of [[Diocletian#Economic and military reforms|Diocletian]] (c. 290).\n\n===Senior officers===\n* '''''[[Legatus Augusti pro praetore]]''''', '''Imperial Legate''': The commander of two or more legions. The Imperial Legate also served as the [[Roman governor|governor]] of the province in which the legions he commanded were stationed. Of [[Roman Senate|Senatorial rank]], the Imperial Legate was appointed by the Emperor and usually held command for 3 or 4 years. In the present time, an Imperial Legate would be called a General.\n* '''''[[Legatus legionis]]''''', '''Legion Legate''': The overall legion commander. The post was usually filled by a [[Roman Senate|senator]], appointed by the emperor, who held command for 3 or 4 years, although he could serve for a much longer period. In a [[Roman province]] with only one legion, the legatus was also the provincial [[Roman governor|governor]]. In such circumstances, the Legatus was dual-hatted as both Legion Legate and Imperial Legate. The Legion Legate also served as commander of the [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary units]] attached to the legion though they were not formally a part of the legion's command structure.\n* '''''[[Military tribune|Tribunus laticlavius]]''''', '''Broad Band Tribune''': Named for the broad striped tunic worn by men of senatorial rank, this tribune was appointed by the emperor or the Senate. Though generally young, he was more experienced than the tribuni angusticlavii, he served as second in command of the legion, behind the legate. Because of his age and inexperience he was not the actual second in command in battle, but if the legate died he would take command of the legion.\n* '''''[[Praefectus castrorum]]''''', '''Camp Prefect''': The Camp Prefect was third in command of the legion. Generally he was a long serving veteran from a lower social status than the ''tribunii'' whom he outranked, and who previously had served as ''primus pilus'' and finished his 25 years with the legions. He was used as a senior officer in charge of training a legion, though he could also command a cohort of [[auxilia]]ires.\n* '''''[[Military tribune|Tribuni angusticlavii]]''''', '''Narrow Band Tribunes''': Each legion had five lower ranking tribunes, who were normally from the equestrian class and had at least some years of prior military experience. They often served the role of administrative officers.<ref>Bowman, Garnsey, Rathbone (eds) ''The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 11'' pp. 326\u201327</ref> This tribunate was often a first, but optional, step in a young man's political career (see [[cursus honorum]]).<ref>Birley, Anthony R. ''Septimius Severus: The African Emperor.'' (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1989) p. 40</ref>\n\n===Centurions===\nThe rank of [[centurion]] was an officer grade that included many ranks, meaning centurions had very good prospects for promotion. The most senior centurion in a legion was known as the ''[[primus pilus]]'' (first file or spear), who directly commanded the first century of the first [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] and commanded the whole first cohort when in battle. Within the second to tenth cohorts, the commander of each cohort's first century was known as a ''pilus prior'' and was in command of his entire cohort when in battle. The seniority of the pilus prior centurions was followed by the five other century commanders of the first cohort, who were known as ''primi ordines''.\n\n[[File:Centurion 2 Boulogne Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|160px|A historical reenactor in Roman centurion costume]]\n\nThe six centuries of a normal cohort, were, in order of precedence:\n* The forward hastati (forward spears)\n* The rear hastati (rear spears)\n* The forward principes (forward principal line)\n* The rear principes (rear principal line)\n* The forward triarii (forward third line)\n* The rear triarii (rear third line)\n\nThe centuries took their titles from the old use of the legion drawn up in three lines of battle using three classes of soldier. (Each century would then hold a cross-section of this theoretical line, although these century titles were now essentially nominal.) Each of the three lines is then sub-divided within the century into a more forward and a more rear century.\n* '''''[[Primus pilus]]''''', literally '''First File''': The ''Primus Pilus'' was the commanding centurion of the first century, first cohort and the senior-most centurion of the entire legion. (Unlike other cohorts, the first cohort had only one javelin century, instead of a \"front spear\" and a \"back spear\" century.) The primus pilus had a chance of later becoming a ''Praefectus Castrorum''. When the primus pilus retired, he would most likely gain entry into the equestrian class. He was paid 60 times the base wage. Primus Pilus were also paid more than an average centurion and like a narrowband tribune.\n* ''Pilus prior'': The \"front file\" centurions were the commanders of the 10 1st centuries within the legion, making them senior centurions of their respective cohorts. While the legion was in battle formation, the Pilus Prior was given command of their entire cohort. The Primus Pilus was also a Pilus Prior, and the most senior of all the centurions within the legion. These positions were usually held by experienced veteran soldiers who had been moved up within the ranks. This rank is subordinate to the Primus Pilus.\n* ''Primi ordines'': The \"ranks of the first [cohort]\" were the five centurions of the first cohort, and included the primus pilus. They, excluding the primus pilus, were paid 30 times the base wage. This rank is senior to all other centurions, save the primus pilus and pilus prior.\n* ''Other centurions'': Each legion had 59 or 60 centurions, one to command each century of the 10 cohorts. They were the backbone of the professional army and were the career soldiers who ran the day-to-day life of the soldiers and issued commands in the field. They were generally moved up from the ranks, but in some cases could be direct appointments from the emperor or other higher-ranking officials. The cohorts were ranked from the first to the tenth and the century within each cohort ranked from 1 to 6, with only five centuries in the first cohort (for a total of 59 centurions and the primus pilus). The century that each centurion commanded was a direct reflection of his rank: command of the 1st century of the first cohort was the highest, and the 6th century of the 10th cohort was the lowest. Paid ten times the basic wage''.\n\n===Lower ranks===\n* ''[[Optio]]'': One for each centurion (59\u201360), they were appointed by the centurion from within the ranks to act as his second in command and were paid twice the basic wage. Equivalent to a modern [[First Sergeant]].<ref name=\"CCW20\">Caesar's Civil War, Adrian Goldsworthy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zKTABZiThz4C&pg=PA20 p. 20]</ref>\n* ''[[Tesserarius]]'': (Guard commander) One for each century. They acted as seconds to the Optios and were paid one and a half times the basic wage. Keeper of the watchword, administrative assistant to HQ Staff, third in command of a century. These men fought as normal soldiers when the century they were attached to was not in the vanguard. Equivalent to a modern [[Staff Sergeant]].\n* ''[[Decurion (military)|Decurion]]'': Commanded a cavalry unit (''[[turma]]'') of 10 to 30 ''eques legionis''.<ref name=\"CCW20\"/>\n* ''[[Decanus]]'': Commanded a ''[[contubernium]]'' or ten men tent party, eight soldiers and two non-combatants,  equivalent to a [[Sergeant]] or [[Corporal]].  A group of four soldiers would be referred to as a [[Quaternion (disambiguation)|Quaternion]].\n\n===Special duty posts===\n* ''[[Aquilifer]]'': A single position within the legion. The aquilifer was the legion's [[Heraldic standard|standard]]\u2013 or [[Aquila (Roman)|''Aquila'']] (eagle)\u2013 bearer and was an enormously important and prestigious position. Losing the aquila was considered the greatest dishonor a legion could endure. This post therefore had to be filled with steady veteran soldiers, with an excellent understanding of the tactics of the legion. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Signifer]]'': Each century had a ''signifer'' (thus, there were 59 in a legion) and within each [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]] the 1st century's ''signifer'' would be the senior. He was standard-bearer for the ''centurial signum'', a spear shaft decorated with medallions and topped with an open hand to signify loyalty, which was a rallying point for the soldiers. In addition to carrying the ''signum'', the ''signifer'' also assumed responsibility for the financial administration of the unit and functioned as the legionaries' banker. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Cornicen]]'' (Horn blower): Worked hand in hand with the signifer drawing the attention of the men to the centurial signum and issuing the audible commands of the officers. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Imaginifer]]'': A special position from the time of [[Augustus]] onwards. Carried the standard bearing the image of the Emperor as a constant reminder of the troops' loyalty to him. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Immunes]]'': Immunes were legionary soldiers who possessed specialized skills, qualifying them for better pay and excusing them from labour and guard work. [[Engineer]]s, [[artillerymen]], [[musician]]s, clerks, [[quartermaster]]s, drill and weapons instructors, [[carpenter]]s, [[hunter]]s, medical staff and [[military police]] were all immune soldiers. These men were still fully trained legionaries, however, and were called upon to serve in the battle lines when needed.\n* ''[[Evocatus]]'': A veteran of the Roman army who had earned his [[Roman military diploma|military diploma]] for military service, but had chosen to re-enlist. They received double pay and were excluded from regular duties, such as manual labour.\n* ''[[Duplicarius]]'': A special pay grade that could also be awarded regardless of rank, received double the basic pay.\n\n==Pay==\nFrom the time of [[Gaius Marius]] onwards, legionaries received 225 ''[[Denarius|denarii]]'' a year (equal to 900 [[Sestertius|''Sestertii'']]); this basic rate remained unchanged until [[Domitian]], who increased it to 300 denarii. <!-- need info on how long this timespan was? --> In spite of the steady inflation during the 2nd century, there was no further rise until the time of [[Septimius Severus]], who increased it to 500 denarii a year. However, the soldiers did not receive all the money in cash, as the state deducted a clothing and food tax from their pay. To this wage, a legionary on active campaign would hope to add the booty of war, from the bodies of their enemies and as plunder from enemy settlements. Slaves could also be claimed from the [[P.O.W.|prisoners of war]] and divided amongst the legion for later sale, which would bring in a sizeable supplement to their regular pay.\n\nAll legionary soldiers would also receive a ''praemia'' ([[veterans' benefits]]) on completion of their term of service of 25 years or more: a sizeable sum of money (3,000 ''denarii'' from the time of [[Augustus]]) and/or a plot of good [[Farming in ancient Rome|farmland]] (good land was in much demand); farmland given to veterans often helped in establishing control of the frontier regions and over rebellious provinces. Later, under [[Caracalla]], the ''praemia'' increased to 5,000 ''denarii''.\n\n==Symbols==\nFrom 104 BC onwards, each legion used an [[aquila (Roman)|aquila]] (eagle) as its standard symbol. The symbol was carried by an officer known as [[aquilifer]], and its loss was considered to be a very serious embarrassment, and often led to the disbanding of the legion itself. Normally, this was because any legion incapable of regaining its eagle in battle was so severely mauled that it was no longer effective in combat.<ref name=\"Authors2015\">{{cite book|author=Several Authors|title=History of The Roman Legions: History of Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLQ2CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1069|date=17 December 2015|publisher=Self-Publish|pages=1069\u2013|id=GGKEY:DXPWT430TXP}}</ref>\n[[File:Roman soldiers with aquilifer signifer centurio 70 aC.jpg|thumb|Reenacters portraying Roman legionaries of [[Legio XV Apollinaris]].]]\nIn ''Gallic War'' (Bk IV, Para. 25), Julius Caesar describes an incident at the start of his first invasion of Britain in 55 BC that illustrated how fear for the safety of the eagle could drive Roman soldiers. When Caesar's troops hesitated to leave their ships for fear of the Britons, the aquilifer of the [[Legio X Gemina|tenth legion]] threw himself overboard and, carrying the eagle, advanced alone against the enemy. His comrades, fearing disgrace, 'with one accord, leapt down from the ship' and were followed by troops from the other ships.\n\nWith the birth of the Roman Empire, the legions created a bond with their leader, the emperor himself. Each legion had another officer, called [[imaginifer]], whose role was to carry a pike with the ''imago'' (image, sculpture) of the emperor as ''[[pontifex maximus]]''.\n\nEach legion, furthermore, had a ''[[vexillifer]]'' who carried a ''vexillum'' or ''signum'', with the legion name and emblem depicted on it, unique to the legion. It was common for a legion to detach some sub-units from the main camp to strengthen other corps. In these cases, the detached subunits carried only the vexillum, and not the aquila, and were called, therefore, ''[[vexillatio]]nes''. A miniature vexillum, mounted on a silver base, was sometimes awarded to officers as a recognition of their service upon retirement or reassignment.\n\nCivilians could also be rewarded for their assistance to the Roman legions. In return for outstanding service, a citizen was given an arrow without a head. This was considered a great honour and would bring the recipient much prestige.\n\n==Discipline==\n{{Main|Roman military decorations and punishments}}\n\nThe military discipline of the legions was quite harsh. Regulations were strictly enforced, and a broad array of punishments could be inflicted upon a legionary who broke them. Many legionaries became devotees in the cult of the minor goddess [[Disciplina]], whose virtues of frugality, severity and loyalty were central to their code of conduct and way of life.\n\n===Minor punishments===\n* '''Castigatio''' \u2013 being hit by the centurion with his staff or ''animadversio fustium'' (Tac. Annals I, 23)\n* \u2013 ''Reduction of rations'' or to be forced to eat barley instead of the usual grain ration\n* '''Pecuniaria mulcta''' \u2013 Reduction in pay, fines or deductions from the pay allowance\n*\u2013 ''Flogging'' in front of the century, cohort or legion\n* \u2013 ''Whipping'' with the ''[[flagrum]]'' (''flagellum'', ''flagella''), or \"short whip\" \u2013 a much more brutal punishment than simple flogging. The \"short whip\" was used by slave volunteers, ''volones'', who constituted the majority of the army in the later years of the Roman Empire.\n* '''[[Gradus deiectio]]''' \u2013 Reduction in rank\n* '''[[Missio ignominiosa]]''' \u2013 Dishonourable discharge\n* \u2013 Loss of ''time in service'' advantages\n* '''[[Militiae mutatio]]''' \u2013 Relegation to inferior service or duties.\n* '''[[Munerum indictio]]''' \u2013 Additional duties\n\n===Major punishments===\n* ''[[Fustuarium]]'' \u2013 a sentence for desertion or dereliction of duty. The legionary would be stoned or beaten to death by [[cudgel]]s, in front of the assembled troops, by his fellow soldiers or those whose lives had been put in danger. Soldiers under sentence of ''fustuarium'' who escaped were not pursued but lived under sentence of banishment from Rome. In the event that a group of legionaries are to be subjected to this punishment, the [[Tribune]] would make an alteration in order to spare the majority of the accused. The Tribune would first select a handful of the guilty men, and those selected would be condemned to the original penalty under the [[Fustuarium]]. The remainder of the accused would then be driven out of the camp and forced to live in an undefended location for a chosen period of time; they were also limited to eating only barley. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html|title=The Histories of Polybius: Fragments of Book VI p.357|last=Edwards|first=H.

Carthaginians' [[quinquereme]]), as well as military units, such as [[cataphract|heavy mounted cavalry]] and [[horse archer|mounted archers]] ([[Parthia]]ns and [[Numidians]]).\n* Roman organization was more flexible than those of many opponents.

Soldiers equipped with shields, helmets and highly effective body armor had a major advantage over warriors protected, in many cases, with nothing other than their shields, particularly in a prolonged engagement.\n* Roman engineering skills were second to none in ancient Europe, and their mastery of both offensive and defensive siege warfare, specifically the construction and investiture of fortifications (cf. [[Sudis (stake)|sudis]], [[castra]]), was another major advantage for the Roman legions.\n* Roman military training focused on the more effective thrusting of the sword rather than the slash.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|War}}\n* [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)]]\n* [[Early Roman army]]\n* [[Imperial Roman army]]\n* [[Late Roman army]]\n* [[Legionary]]\n* [[List of Roman wars]]\n* [[List of Roman battles]]\n* [[List of topics related to ancient Rome]]\n* [[List of Roman legions]]\n* [[List of Roman auxiliary regiments]]\n* [[Military history of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Marian Roman army]]\n* [[Roman army]]\n* [[Roman army of the mid-Republic]]\n* [[Roman military personal equipment]]\n* [[Structural history of the Roman military]]\n* For a more detailed analysis, as well as the Romans in battle, see the articles [[Roman infantry tactics]] and [[Roman military personal equipment]].\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah19101/full ''The Encyclopedia of Ancient History'', Legions, history and location of]\n* ''History of the Art of War.

In the late republic and much of the imperial period (from about 100 BC), a legion was divided into ten [[cohort (Roman military unit)|cohorts]], each of six (or five) centuries. Legions also included a small ''[[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|ala]]'', or cavalry, unit. By the third century AD, the legion was a much smaller unit of about 1,000 to 1,500 men, and there were more of them.

(Provincials who aspired to [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]] gained it when [[Honesta missio|honourably discharged]] from the [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]].) The Roman army, for most of the Imperial period, consisted mostly of auxiliaries rather than legions.<ref>Data in: Goldsworthy, Adrian (2003).

See table in article \"Auxiliaries (Roman military)\" for compilation of this data.</ref>\n\n==Longevity ==\nMany of the legions founded before 40 BC were still active until at least the fifth century, notably [[Legio V Macedonica]], which was founded by [[Augustus]] in 43 BC and was in Egypt in the seventh century during the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt]].\n\n==Overview of typical organization and strength==\n\n{{Main|Structural history of the Roman military}}\n[[File:Roman Legionaries-MGR Lyon-IMG 1050.JPG|thumb|Imperial Roman legionaries in tight formation, a relief from [[Glanum]], a Roman town in what is now [[southern France]] that was inhabited from 27 BC to 260 AD (when it was sacked by invading [[Alemanni]])]]\nBecause legions were not permanent units until the [[Marian reforms]] (c. 107 BC), and were instead created, used, and disbanded again, several hundred legions were named and numbered throughout Roman history. To date, about 50 have been identified. The republican legions were composed of levied men that paid for their own equipment and thus the structure of the Roman army at this time reflected the society, and at any time there would be four consular legions (with command divided between the two ruling consuls) and in time of war extra legions could be levied. Toward the end of the 2nd century BC, Rome started to experience manpower shortages brought about by property and financial qualifications to join the army. This prompted consul [[Gaius Marius]] to remove property qualifications and decree that all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for service in the Roman army with equipment and rewards for fulfilling years of service provided by the state. The Roman army became a volunteer, professional and standing army which extended service beyond Roman citizens but also to non-citizens who could sign on as [[Auxilia|''auxillia'']] (auxiliaries) and were rewarded [[Roman citizenship]] upon completion of service and all the rights and privileges that entailed. In the time of [[Augustus]], there were nearly 50 upon his succession but this was reduced to about 25\u201335 permanent standing legions and this remained the figure for most of the empire's history.\n\n==Evolution ==\nThe legion evolved from 3,000 men in the [[Roman Republic]] to over 5,200 men in the [[Roman Empire]], consisting of [[centuria|centuries]] as the basic units. Until the middle of the first century, ten [[Cohort (Roman military unit)|cohorts]] (about 500 men) made up a Roman legion. This was later changed to nine cohorts of standard size (with six centuries at 80 men each) with the first cohort being of double strength (five double-strength centuries with 160 men each). By the fourth century AD, the legion was a much smaller unit of about 1,000 to 1,500 men, and there were more of them. This had come about as the large formation legion and auxiliary unit, 10,000 men, was broken down into smaller units - originally temporary detachments - to cover more territory.  In the fourth century AD, [[East Roman army|East Roman]] [[border guard]] legions (''[[limitanei]]'') may have become even smaller. In terms of organisation and function, the Republican era legion may have been influenced by the ancient Greek and Macedonian [[phalanx]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Size==\nThe size of a typical legion varied throughout the history of ancient Rome, with complements of 4,200 legionaries and 300 [[equites]] (drawn from the wealthier classes&nbsp;\u2013 in early Rome all troops provided their own equipment) in the republican period of Rome (the infantry were split into 10 [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] each of four [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]] of 120 legionaries), to 5,200 men plus 120 auxiliaries in the imperial period (split into 10 cohorts, nine of 480 men each, plus the first cohort holding 800 men).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Roman army|Military history of ancient Rome|Structural history of the Roman military}}\n\n=== Roman kings (to c. 500 BC) ===\n{{Main|Early Roman army}}\n\nIn the period before the raising of the ''legio'' and the early years of the Roman Kingdom and the Republic, forces are described as being organized into ''[[Centuria|centuries]]'' of roughly one hundred men. These centuries were grouped together as required and answered to the leader who had hired or raised them. Such independent organization persisted until the 2nd century BC amongst light infantry and cavalry, but was discarded completely in later periods with the supporting role taken instead by allied troops. The roles of century leader (later formalized as a [[centurion]]), [[Optio|second in command]] and [[Aquilifer|standard bearer]] are referenced in this early period.\n\nRome's early period is undocumented and shrouded in myths, but those myths tell that during the rule of [[Servius Tullius]], the [[census]] (from [[Latin]]: ''cense\u014d'' \u2013 accounting of the people) was introduced. With this all Roman able-bodied, property-owning male citizens were divided into five classes for military service based on their wealth and then organized into centuries as sub-units of the greater Roman army or ''legio'' (multitude). Joining the army was both a duty and a distinguishing mark of Roman citizenship; during the entire pre-Marian period the wealthiest land owners performed the most years of military service. These individuals would have had the most to lose should the state have fallen.\n\n=== Roman Republic (509\u2013107 BC) ===\n{{Main|Roman army of the mid-Republic}}\n\nAt some point, possibly in the beginning of the [[Roman Republic]] after the [[Roman Republic#Overthrow of the kings|kings were overthrown]], the ''legio'' was subdivided into two separate legions, each one ascribed to one of the two [[Roman consul|consuls]]. In the first years of the Republic, when warfare was mostly concentrated on raiding, it is uncertain if the full manpower of the legions was summoned at any one time. In 494 BC, when three foreign threats emerged, the dictator [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] raised ten legions which [[Livy]] says was a greater number than had been raised previously at any one time.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.30</ref>\n\nAlso, some warfare was still conducted by Roman forces outside the legionary structure, the most famous example being the campaign in 479 BC by the clan army of gens Fabia against the Etruscan city of Veii (in which the clan was annihilated). Legions became more formally organized in the 4th century BC, as Roman warfare evolved to more frequent and planned operations, and the consular army was raised to two legions each.\n\nIn the Republic, legions had an ephemeral existence. Except for Legio I to IV, which were the consular armies (two per consul), other units were levied by campaign. Rome's Italian allies were required to provide approximately ten cohorts (auxilia were not organized into legions) to support each Roman Legion.\n\nIn the middle of the Republic, legions were composed of the following units:\n* ''[[Equites]]'' (cavalry): The [[cavalry]] was originally the most prestigious unit, where wealthy young Roman men displayed their skill and prowess, laying the foundation for an eventual political career. Cavalry equipment was purchased by each of the cavalrymen and consisted of a round shield, helmet, body armour, sword and one or more [[lance]]s. The cavalry was outnumbered in the legion. In a total of ''circa'' 3,000 men, (plus the velites that normally enlarged the number to about 4,200), the legion only had around 300 horsemen, divided into 10 units (''[[turma]]e'') of 30 men. These men were commanded by [[Decurion (military)|decurions]]. In addition to heavy cavalry, there would be the light cavalry levied from poor citizens and wealthy young citizens not old enough to be in the ''hastati'' or the ''equites''. In battle, they were used to disrupt and [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] enemy infantry formations and to fight off enemy cavalry. In the latter type of engagement, they would often (though not always) dismount some or all of the horsemen to fight a stationary battle on foot, an unusual tactic for the time, but one that offered significant advantages in stability and agility in a time before [[stirrup]]s.<ref>Mccall, Jeremiah B. ''The Cavalry of the Roman Republic: Cavalry Combat and Elite Reputations in the Middle and Late Republic.'' (New York, Routledge, 2002) pp. 53ff</ref>\n* ''[[Velites]]'' ([[light infantry]]): The ''velites'' were mainly poorer citizens who could not afford to equip themselves properly. Their primary function was to act as [[skirmishers]] \u2013 javelin-throwers, who would engage the enemy early in order either to harass them or to cover the movement of troops behind them. After throwing their javelins, they would retreat through the gaps between the maniples, screened from the attack of the enemy by the heavy infantry lines. With the shortage of cavalry in the army of the early to mid Republican army, the [[velites]] were also used as scouts. They did not have a precise formal organization or formation.\n* [[Heavy infantry]]: This was the principal unit of the legion. The heavy infantry was composed of citizen legionaries that could afford the equipment composed of an iron helmet, shield, armour and [[pilum]], a heavy javelin whose range was about 30 meters. After 387 BC, the preferred weapon for the hastati and principes was the [[gladius]], a short sword. Their hobnailed sandals (''[[caligae]]'') were also an effective weapon against a fallen enemy. Prior to the Marian reforms (see below), the heavy infantry was subdivided, according to experience, into three separate lines of troops:\n** The ''[[hastati]]'' (sing. ''hastatus'') consisted of raw or inexperienced soldiers, considered to be less reliable than legionaries of several years' service. The Hastati were placed at the front for several reasons. One reason is the city of Rome could ill-afford to lose experienced soldiers, so they put the greenest soldiers at the front. If they survived, the Hastati/tus would gain invaluable experience. Another reason is if the newest soldiers succumbed to battle nerves and broke and tried to run, then there were experienced soldiers behind them to stiffen their resolve.\n** The ''[[principes]]'' (sing. ''princeps'') These were the more experienced soldiers, often better equipped than the Hastati, and having more experience on the battlefield, they would take up the second line in the battle in the event the Hastati failed or fled. They were the second wave in an early Republican Legion before the military reforms of Marius.\n** The ''[[triarii]]'' (sing. ''triarius'') were the veteran soldiers, to be used in battle only in extreme situations; they rested one knee down when not engaged in combat. The ''triarii'' served primarily as reserves or [[barrier troops]] designed to backstop the ''hastati'' and ''principes'', and were equipped with long ''[[Hasta (spear)|hastae]]'' (spears) rather than the ''pilum'' and ''gladius'' (the ''hastati'' and ''principes'' stopped using spears in 387 BC). Thus armed, they fought in a [[phalanx formation]]. The sight of an advancing armored formation of ''triarii'' legionaries frequently discouraged exultant enemies in pursuit of retreating ''hastati'' and ''principes'' troops. ''Ad triarios redisse'' \u2013 ''To fall back upon the triarii'' was a Roman [[idiom]] \u2013 meaning to use one's last resort.\n\nEach of these three lines was subdivided into (usually 10) chief tactical units called [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]. A maniple consisted of two [[Centuria|centuries]] and was commanded by the senior of the two [[centurion]]s. At this time, each century of hastati and principes consisted of 60 men; a century of triarii was 30 men. These 3,000 men (twenty maniples of 120 men, and ten maniples of 60 men), together with about 1,200 velites and 300 cavalry gave the mid Republican (\"manipular\") legion a nominal strength of about 4,500 men.\n\n=== Late Republic (107\u201330 BC) ===\n{{Main|Roman army of the late Republic}}\n[[File:Legion Task ORG.png|thumb|500px|Visual representation of the post Marian Reform Legion showing size and disposition for Infantry formations]]\n''See also [[List of Roman legions]] for details of notable late Republican legions''<br />\n''See also [[List of Roman army unit types#Sub-Units of the Roman legion|Sub-Units of the Roman legion]]''\n\nThe Marian reforms (of Gaius Marius) enlarged the centuries to 80 men, and grouped them into six-century \"cohorts\" (rather than two-century maniples). Each century had its own standard and was made up of ten units (''contubernia'') of eight men who shared a tent, a millstone, a mule and [[cooking pot]].\n\nFollowing the reforms of the general [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] in the 2nd century BC, the legions took on the second, narrower meaning that is familiar in the popular imagination as close-order citizen heavy infantry.\n\nAt the end of the 2nd century BC, [[Gaius Marius]] reformed the previously ephemeral legions as a professional force drawing from the poorest classes, enabling Rome to field larger armies and providing employment for jobless citizens of the city of Rome. However, this put the loyalty of the soldiers in the hands of their general rather than the State of Rome itself. This development ultimately enabled [[Julius Caesar]] to cross the [[Rubicon]] with an army loyal to him personally and effectively end the Republic.\n\nThe legions of the late Republic and early Empire are often called ''Marian'' legions. Following the [[Battle of Vercellae]] in 101 BC, Marius granted all Italian soldiers Roman citizenship. He justified this action to the Senate by saying that in the din of battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally. This effectively eliminated the notion of allied legions; henceforth all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions, and full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. At the same time, the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, standard type based on the ''Principes'': armed with two heavy javelins called ''pila'' (singular ''[[pilum]]''), the short sword called ''gladius'', chain mail (''[[lorica hamata]]''), helmet and rectangular shield (''[[scutum (shield)|scutum]]'').\n\nThe role of allied legions would eventually be taken up by contingents of allied auxiliary troops, called ''Auxilia''. ''Auxilia'' contained specialist units, engineers and pioneers, artillerymen and craftsmen, service and support personnel and irregular units made up of non-citizens, mercenaries and local militia. These were usually formed into complete units such as light cavalry, [[light infantry]] or ''[[velites]]'', and labourers. There was also a [[reconnaissance]] [[squad]] of 10 or more light [[mounted infantry]] called ''[[speculatores]]'' who could also serve as messengers or even as an early form of [[military intelligence]] service.\n\nAs part of the Marian reforms, the legions' internal organization was standardized. Each legion was divided into ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]]''. Prior to this, cohorts had been temporary administrative units or tactical task forces of several maniples, even more transitory than the legions themselves. Now the cohorts were ten permanent units, composed of 6 centuries and in the case of the first cohort 5 double strength centuries each led by a centurion assisted by an ''[[optio]]''. The cohorts came to form the basic tactical unit of the legions. Ranking within the legion was based on length of service, with the senior Centurion commanding the first century of the first cohort; he was called the ''[[primus pilus]]'' (First Spear), and reported directly to the superior officers (legates and tribuni). All career soldiers could be promoted to the higher ranks in recognition of exceptional acts of bravery or valour. A newly promoted junior Centurion would be assigned to the sixth century of the tenth cohort and slowly progressed through the ranks from there.\n\nEvery legion had a large baggage train, which included 640 mules (1 mule for every 8 legionaries) just for the soldiers' equipment. To keep these baggage trains from becoming too large and slow, Marius had each infantryman carry as much of his own equipment as he could, including his own armour, weapons and 15 days' rations, for about 25\u201330&nbsp;kg (50\u201360 pounds) of load total. To make this easier, he issued each legionary a cross stick to carry their loads on their shoulders. The soldiers were nicknamed ''Marius' Mules'' because of the amount of gear they had to carry themselves. This arrangement allowed for the possibility for the supply train to become temporarily detached from the main body of the legion, thus greatly increasing the army's speed when needed.\n\nA typical legion of this period had 5,120 legionaries as well as a large number of camp followers, servants and slaves. Legions could contain as many as 11,000 fighting men when including the auxiliaries. During the Later Roman Empire, the legion was reduced in size to 1,000 to allow for easier provisioning and to expand the regions under surveillance. Numbers would also vary depending on casualties suffered during a campaign; [[Julius Caesar]]'s legions during his campaign in Gaul often only had around 3,500 men.\n\nTactics were not very different from the past, but their effectiveness was largely improved because of the professional training of the soldiers.\n\n[[Image:Centurio 70 aC - cropped.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor as a Roman centurion, ''c.'' 70.]]\n[[Image:Roman legionaire in lorica segmentata.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor, showing a Roman [[Legionary|''miles'']], (2nd century).]]\n\nAfter the Marian reforms and throughout the history of Rome's Late Republic, the legions played an important political role. By the 1st century BC, the threat of the legions under a [[demagogue]] was recognized. [[Roman Governor|Governors]] were not allowed to leave their provinces with their legions. When [[Julius Caesar]] broke this rule, leaving his province of Gaul and crossing the [[Rubicon]] into Italy, he precipitated a [[constitutional crisis]]. This crisis and the [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]] which followed brought an end to the Republic and led to the foundation of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] under [[Augustus]] in 27 BC.\n\n[[Image:Roman Empire 125.png|thumb|left|100px|The Roman empire under [[Hadrian]] (ruled 117\u201338), showing the '''legions''' deployed in 125]]\n\n=== Early Empire (27 BC\u2013AD 284) ===\n{{Main|Imperial Roman army}}\n\n''See  [[List of Roman legions#Early Empire legions|List of Roman legions of the early Empire]]''<br />\n''See also [[List of Roman army unit types#Sub-Units of the Roman legion|Sub-Units of the Roman legion]]''\n\n[[File:Roman-legions-14-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg|thumb|Map of Roman legions by 14 AD.Source: http://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1447/files/2014/05/Roman-legions-14-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg]]\n\nGenerals, during the recent Republican civil wars, had formed their own legions and numbered them as they wished. During this time, there was a high incidence of ''Gemina'' (twin) legions, where two legions were consolidated into a single organization (and was later made official and put under a [[legatus]] and six duces). At the end of the civil war against [[Mark Antony]], Augustus was left with around fifty legions, with several double counts (multiple Legio Xs for instance). For political and economic reasons, Augustus reduced the number of legions to 28 (which diminished to 25 after the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]], in which 3 legions were completely destroyed by the [[Germanics]]).\n\nBeside streamlining the army, Augustus also regulated the soldiers' pay. At the same time, he greatly increased the number of auxiliaries to the point where they were equal in number to the legionaries. He also created the [[Praetorian Guard]] along with a permanent [[Roman Navy|navy]] where served the ''liberti'', or freed slaves.\nThe legions also became permanent at this time, and not recruited for particular campaigns. They were also allocated to static bases with permanent ''[[castra]] legionaria'' (legionary fortresses).\n\nAugustus' military policies proved sound and cost effective, and were generally followed by his successors. These emperors would carefully add new legions, as circumstances required or permitted, until the strength of the standing army stood at around 30 legions (hence the wry remark of the philosopher [[Favorinus]] that ''It is ill arguing with the master of 30 legions''). With each legion having 5,120 legionaries usually supported by an equal number of auxiliary troops (according to Tacitus), the total force available to a legion commander during the [[Pax Romana]] probably ranged from 11,000 downwards, with the more prestigious legions and those stationed on hostile borders or in restive provinces tending to have more auxiliaries. By the time of the emperor [[Septimius Severus|Severus]], 193-211, the auxiliaries may have composed 55 to 60% of the army, 250,000 of 447,000. Some legions may have even been reinforced at times with units making the associated force near 15,000\u201316,000 or about the size of a modern [[Division (military)|division]].\n\nThroughout the [[Roman Empire|imperial]] era, the legions played an important political role. Their actions could secure the empire for a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] or take it away. For example, the defeat of [[Vitellius]] in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] was decided when the [[Danube|Danubian]] legions chose to support [[Vespasian]].\n\nIn the empire, the legion was standardized, with symbols and an individual history where men were proud to serve. The legion was commanded by a ''[[legatus]]'' or ''legate''. Aged around thirty, he would usually be a senator on a three-year appointment. Immediately subordinate to the legate would be six elected ''military tribunes'' \u2013 five would be staff officers and the remaining one would be a noble heading for the Senate (originally this tribune commanded the legion). There would also be a group of officers for the medical staff, the engineers, record-keepers, the ''praefectus castrorum'' (commander of the camp) and other specialists such as priests and musicians.\n\n=== Later Empire (from 284 AD) ===\n{{Main|Late Roman army}}\n{{See also|List of Roman legions}}\n[[File:Roman soldier end of third century northern province - cropped.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor, portraying a legionary at the end of the 3rd century]]\n[[File:Roman-legions-212-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg|thumb|Map of Roman legions by 212 AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1447/files/2014/05/Roman-legions-212-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg |title=Map |website=.hypotheses.org}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the [[Late Antiquity|Later Roman Empire]], the number of legions was increased and the [[Military establishment of the Roman empire|Roman Army]] expanded. There is no evidence to suggest that legions changed in form before the [[Tetrarchy]], although there is evidence that they were smaller than the paper strengths usually quoted. The final form of the legion originated with the elite ''legiones palatinae'' created by [[Diocletian]] and the Tetrarchs. These were infantry units of around 1,000 men rather than the 5,000, including cavalry, of the old Legions. The earliest ''legiones palatinae'' were the ''Lanciarii'', ''Joviani'', ''[[Herculians|Herculiani]]'' and ''Divitenses''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe 4th century saw a very large number of new, small legions created, a process which began under [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]]. In addition to the elite ''[[palatini (Roman military)|palatini]]'', other legions called ''[[comitatenses]]'' and ''[[pseudocomitatenses]]'', along with the ''[[auxilia palatina]]'', provided the infantry of late Roman armies. The [[Notitia Dignitatum]] lists 25 ''legiones palatinae'', 70 ''legiones comitatenses'', 47 ''legiones pseudocomitatenses'' and 111 ''auxilia palatina'' in the field armies, and a further 47 ''legiones'' in the frontier armies.<ref>Totals from summary of Notitia Dignitatum in Richardot, Philippe, ''La fin de l'arm\u00e9e romaine 284\u2013476'' [3rd ed.] Economica, 2005. {{ISBN|2-7178-4861-4}}.</ref> Legion names such as ''[[Honorius (emperor)|Honoriani]]'' and ''[[Gratian]]enses'' found in the Notitia suggest that the process of creating new legions continued through the 4th century rather than being a single event. The names also suggest that many new legions were formed from ''[[vexillatio]]nes'' or from old legions. In addition, there were 24 vexillationes palatini, 73 vexillationes comitatenses; 305 other units in the Eastern limitanei and 181 in the Western limitanei.<ref>Jones, Later Roman Empire, pp. 1449\u201350</ref>\n\nAccording to the late Roman writer [[Vegetius]]' ''[[De Re Militari]]'', each century had a [[ballista]] and each cohort had an [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]], giving the legion a formidable siege train of 59 Ballistae and 10 Onagers, each manned by 10 ''libritors'' (artillerymen) and mounted on wagons drawn by oxen or mules. In addition to attacking cities and fortifications, these would be used to help defend Roman forts and fortified camps ([[castra]]) as well. They would even be employed on occasion, especially in the later Empire, as [[field artillery]] during battles or in support of river crossings.\n\nDespite a number of reforms, the Legion system survived the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and was continued in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] until around 7th century, when reforms begun by Emperor [[Heraclius]] to counter the increasing need for soldiers around the Empire resulted in the [[Theme system]]. Despite this, the Eastern Roman/Byzantine armies continued to be influenced by the earlier Roman legions, and were maintained with similar level of discipline, strategic prowess, and organization.\n\n==Legionary ranks==\nAside from the rank and file [[legionary]] (who received the base wage of 10 [[as (coin)|ass\u0113s]] a day or 225 [[denarius|denarii]] a year), the following list describes the system of officers which developed within the legions from the Marian reforms (104 BC) until the military reforms of [[Diocletian#Economic and military reforms|Diocletian]] (c. 290).\n\n===Senior officers===\n* '''''[[Legatus Augusti pro praetore]]''''', '''Imperial Legate''': The commander of two or more legions. The Imperial Legate also served as the [[Roman governor|governor]] of the province in which the legions he commanded were stationed. Of [[Roman Senate|Senatorial rank]], the Imperial Legate was appointed by the Emperor and usually held command for 3 or 4 years. In the present time, an Imperial Legate would be called a General.\n* '''''[[Legatus legionis]]''''', '''Legion Legate''': The overall legion commander. The post was usually filled by a [[Roman Senate|senator]], appointed by the emperor, who held command for 3 or 4 years, although he could serve for a much longer period. In a [[Roman province]] with only one legion, the legatus was also the provincial [[Roman governor|governor]]. In such circumstances, the Legatus was dual-hatted as both Legion Legate and Imperial Legate. The Legion Legate also served as commander of the [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary units]] attached to the legion though they were not formally a part of the legion's command structure.\n* '''''[[Military tribune|Tribunus laticlavius]]''''', '''Broad Band Tribune''': Named for the broad striped tunic worn by men of senatorial rank, this tribune was appointed by the emperor or the Senate. Though generally young, he was more experienced than the tribuni angusticlavii, he served as second in command of the legion, behind the legate. Because of his age and inexperience he was not the actual second in command in battle, but if the legate died he would take command of the legion.\n* '''''[[Praefectus castrorum]]''''', '''Camp Prefect''': The Camp Prefect was third in command of the legion. Generally he was a long serving veteran from a lower social status than the ''tribunii'' whom he outranked, and who previously had served as ''primus pilus'' and finished his 25 years with the legions. He was used as a senior officer in charge of training a legion, though he could also command a cohort of [[auxilia]]ires.\n* '''''[[Military tribune|Tribuni angusticlavii]]''''', '''Narrow Band Tribunes''': Each legion had five lower ranking tribunes, who were normally from the equestrian class and had at least some years of prior military experience. They often served the role of administrative officers.<ref>Bowman, Garnsey, Rathbone (eds) ''The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 11'' pp. 326\u201327</ref> This tribunate was often a first, but optional, step in a young man's political career (see [[cursus honorum]]).<ref>Birley, Anthony R. ''Septimius Severus: The African Emperor.'' (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1989) p. 40</ref>\n\n===Centurions===\nThe rank of [[centurion]] was an officer grade that included many ranks, meaning centurions had very good prospects for promotion. The most senior centurion in a legion was known as the ''[[primus pilus]]'' (first file or spear), who directly commanded the first century of the first [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] and commanded the whole first cohort when in battle. Within the second to tenth cohorts, the commander of each cohort's first century was known as a ''pilus prior'' and was in command of his entire cohort when in battle. The seniority of the pilus prior centurions was followed by the five other century commanders of the first cohort, who were known as ''primi ordines''.\n\n[[File:Centurion 2 Boulogne Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|160px|A historical reenactor in Roman centurion costume]]\n\nThe six centuries of a normal cohort, were, in order of precedence:\n* The forward hastati (forward spears)\n* The rear hastati (rear spears)\n* The forward principes (forward principal line)\n* The rear principes (rear principal line)\n* The forward triarii (forward third line)\n* The rear triarii (rear third line)\n\nThe centuries took their titles from the old use of the legion drawn up in three lines of battle using three classes of soldier. (Each century would then hold a cross-section of this theoretical line, although these century titles were now essentially nominal.) Each of the three lines is then sub-divided within the century into a more forward and a more rear century.\n* '''''[[Primus pilus]]''''', literally '''First File''': The ''Primus Pilus'' was the commanding centurion of the first century, first cohort and the senior-most centurion of the entire legion. (Unlike other cohorts, the first cohort had only one javelin century, instead of a \"front spear\" and a \"back spear\" century.) The primus pilus had a chance of later becoming a ''Praefectus Castrorum''. When the primus pilus retired, he would most likely gain entry into the equestrian class. He was paid 60 times the base wage. Primus Pilus were also paid more than an average centurion and like a narrowband tribune.\n* ''Pilus prior'': The \"front file\" centurions were the commanders of the 10 1st centuries within the legion, making them senior centurions of their respective cohorts. While the legion was in battle formation, the Pilus Prior was given command of their entire cohort. The Primus Pilus was also a Pilus Prior, and the most senior of all the centurions within the legion. These positions were usually held by experienced veteran soldiers who had been moved up within the ranks. This rank is subordinate to the Primus Pilus.\n* ''Primi ordines'': The \"ranks of the first [cohort]\" were the five centurions of the first cohort, and included the primus pilus. They, excluding the primus pilus, were paid 30 times the base wage. This rank is senior to all other centurions, save the primus pilus and pilus prior.\n* ''Other centurions'': Each legion had 59 or 60 centurions, one to command each century of the 10 cohorts. They were the backbone of the professional army and were the career soldiers who ran the day-to-day life of the soldiers and issued commands in the field. They were generally moved up from the ranks, but in some cases could be direct appointments from the emperor or other higher-ranking officials. The cohorts were ranked from the first to the tenth and the century within each cohort ranked from 1 to 6, with only five centuries in the first cohort (for a total of 59 centurions and the primus pilus). The century that each centurion commanded was a direct reflection of his rank: command of the 1st century of the first cohort was the highest, and the 6th century of the 10th cohort was the lowest. Paid ten times the basic wage''.\n\n===Lower ranks===\n* ''[[Optio]]'': One for each centurion (59\u201360), they were appointed by the centurion from within the ranks to act as his second in command and were paid twice the basic wage. Equivalent to a modern [[First Sergeant]].<ref name=\"CCW20\">Caesar's Civil War, Adrian Goldsworthy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zKTABZiThz4C&pg=PA20 p. 20]</ref>\n* ''[[Tesserarius]]'': (Guard commander) One for each century. They acted as seconds to the Optios and were paid one and a half times the basic wage. Keeper of the watchword, administrative assistant to HQ Staff, third in command of a century. These men fought as normal soldiers when the century they were attached to was not in the vanguard. Equivalent to a modern [[Staff Sergeant]].\n* ''[[Decurion (military)|Decurion]]'': Commanded a cavalry unit (''[[turma]]'') of 10 to 30 ''eques legionis''.<ref name=\"CCW20\"/>\n* ''[[Decanus]]'': Commanded a ''[[contubernium]]'' or ten men tent party, eight soldiers and two non-combatants,  equivalent to a [[Sergeant]] or [[Corporal]].  A group of four soldiers would be referred to as a [[Quaternion (disambiguation)|Quaternion]].\n\n===Special duty posts===\n* ''[[Aquilifer]]'': A single position within the legion. The aquilifer was the legion's [[Heraldic standard|standard]]\u2013 or [[Aquila (Roman)|''Aquila'']] (eagle)\u2013 bearer and was an enormously important and prestigious position. Losing the aquila was considered the greatest dishonor a legion could endure. This post therefore had to be filled with steady veteran soldiers, with an excellent understanding of the tactics of the legion. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Signifer]]'': Each century had a ''signifer'' (thus, there were 59 in a legion) and within each [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]] the 1st century's ''signifer'' would be the senior. He was standard-bearer for the ''centurial signum'', a spear shaft decorated with medallions and topped with an open hand to signify loyalty, which was a rallying point for the soldiers. In addition to carrying the ''signum'', the ''signifer'' also assumed responsibility for the financial administration of the unit and functioned as the legionaries' banker. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Cornicen]]'' (Horn blower): Worked hand in hand with the signifer drawing the attention of the men to the centurial signum and issuing the audible commands of the officers. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Imaginifer]]'': A special position from the time of [[Augustus]] onwards. Carried the standard bearing the image of the Emperor as a constant reminder of the troops' loyalty to him. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Immunes]]'': Immunes were legionary soldiers who possessed specialized skills, qualifying them for better pay and excusing them from labour and guard work. [[Engineer]]s, [[artillerymen]], [[musician]]s, clerks, [[quartermaster]]s, drill and weapons instructors, [[carpenter]]s, [[hunter]]s, medical staff and [[military police]] were all immune soldiers. These men were still fully trained legionaries, however, and were called upon to serve in the battle lines when needed.\n* ''[[Evocatus]]'': A veteran of the Roman army who had earned his [[Roman military diploma|military diploma]] for military service, but had chosen to re-enlist. They received double pay and were excluded from regular duties, such as manual labour.\n* ''[[Duplicarius]]'': A special pay grade that could also be awarded regardless of rank, received double the basic pay.\n\n==Pay==\nFrom the time of [[Gaius Marius]] onwards, legionaries received 225 ''[[Denarius|denarii]]'' a year (equal to 900 [[Sestertius|''Sestertii'']]); this basic rate remained unchanged until [[Domitian]], who increased it to 300 denarii. <!-- need info on how long this timespan was? --> In spite of the steady inflation during the 2nd century, there was no further rise until the time of [[Septimius Severus]], who increased it to 500 denarii a year. However, the soldiers did not receive all the money in cash, as the state deducted a clothing and food tax from their pay. To this wage, a legionary on active campaign would hope to add the booty of war, from the bodies of their enemies and as plunder from enemy settlements. Slaves could also be claimed from the [[P.O.W.|prisoners of war]] and divided amongst the legion for later sale, which would bring in a sizeable supplement to their regular pay.\n\nAll legionary soldiers would also receive a ''praemia'' ([[veterans' benefits]]) on completion of their term of service of 25 years or more: a sizeable sum of money (3,000 ''denarii'' from the time of [[Augustus]]) and/or a plot of good [[Farming in ancient Rome|farmland]] (good land was in much demand); farmland given to veterans often helped in establishing control of the frontier regions and over rebellious provinces. Later, under [[Caracalla]], the ''praemia'' increased to 5,000 ''denarii''.\n\n==Symbols==\nFrom 104 BC onwards, each legion used an [[aquila (Roman)|aquila]] (eagle) as its standard symbol. The symbol was carried by an officer known as [[aquilifer]], and its loss was considered to be a very serious embarrassment, and often led to the disbanding of the legion itself. Normally, this was because any legion incapable of regaining its eagle in battle was so severely mauled that it was no longer effective in combat.<ref name=\"Authors2015\">{{cite book|author=Several Authors|title=History of The Roman Legions: History of Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLQ2CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1069|date=17 December 2015|publisher=Self-Publish|pages=1069\u2013|id=GGKEY:DXPWT430TXP}}</ref>\n[[File:Roman soldiers with aquilifer signifer centurio 70 aC.jpg|thumb|Reenacters portraying Roman legionaries of [[Legio XV Apollinaris]].]]\nIn ''Gallic War'' (Bk IV, Para. 25), Julius Caesar describes an incident at the start of his first invasion of Britain in 55 BC that illustrated how fear for the safety of the eagle could drive Roman soldiers. When Caesar's troops hesitated to leave their ships for fear of the Britons, the aquilifer of the [[Legio X Gemina|tenth legion]] threw himself overboard and, carrying the eagle, advanced alone against the enemy. His comrades, fearing disgrace, 'with one accord, leapt down from the ship' and were followed by troops from the other ships.\n\nWith the birth of the Roman Empire, the legions created a bond with their leader, the emperor himself. Each legion had another officer, called [[imaginifer]], whose role was to carry a pike with the ''imago'' (image, sculpture) of the emperor as ''[[pontifex maximus]]''.\n\nEach legion, furthermore, had a ''[[vexillifer]]'' who carried a ''vexillum'' or ''signum'', with the legion name and emblem depicted on it, unique to the legion. It was common for a legion to detach some sub-units from the main camp to strengthen other corps. In these cases, the detached subunits carried only the vexillum, and not the aquila, and were called, therefore, ''[[vexillatio]]nes''. A miniature vexillum, mounted on a silver base, was sometimes awarded to officers as a recognition of their service upon retirement or reassignment.\n\nCivilians could also be rewarded for their assistance to the Roman legions. In return for outstanding service, a citizen was given an arrow without a head. This was considered a great honour and would bring the recipient much prestige.\n\n==Discipline==\n{{Main|Roman military decorations and punishments}}\n\nThe military discipline of the legions was quite harsh. Regulations were strictly enforced, and a broad array of punishments could be inflicted upon a legionary who broke them. Many legionaries became devotees in the cult of the minor goddess [[Disciplina]], whose virtues of frugality, severity and loyalty were central to their code of conduct and way of life.\n\n===Minor punishments===\n* '''Castigatio''' \u2013 being hit by the centurion with his staff or ''animadversio fustium'' (Tac. Annals I, 23)\n* \u2013 ''Reduction of rations'' or to be forced to eat barley instead of the usual grain ration\n* '''Pecuniaria mulcta''' \u2013 Reduction in pay, fines or deductions from the pay allowance\n*\u2013 ''Flogging'' in front of the century, cohort or legion\n* \u2013 ''Whipping'' with the ''[[flagrum]]'' (''flagellum'', ''flagella''), or \"short whip\" \u2013 a much more brutal punishment than simple flogging. The \"short whip\" was used by slave volunteers, ''volones'', who constituted the majority of the army in the later years of the Roman Empire.\n* '''[[Gradus deiectio]]''' \u2013 Reduction in rank\n* '''[[Missio ignominiosa]]''' \u2013 Dishonourable discharge\n* \u2013 Loss of ''time in service'' advantages\n* '''[[Militiae mutatio]]''' \u2013 Relegation to inferior service or duties.\n* '''[[Munerum indictio]]''' \u2013 Additional duties\n\n===Major punishments===\n* ''[[Fustuarium]]'' \u2013 a sentence for desertion or dereliction of duty. The legionary would be stoned or beaten to death by [[cudgel]]s, in front of the assembled troops, by his fellow soldiers or those whose lives had been put in danger. Soldiers under sentence of ''fustuarium'' who escaped were not pursued but lived under sentence of banishment from Rome. In the event that a group of legionaries are to be subjected to this punishment, the [[Tribune]] would make an alteration in order to spare the majority of the accused. The Tribune would first select a handful of the guilty men, and those selected would be condemned to the original penalty under the [[Fustuarium]]. The remainder of the accused would then be driven out of the camp and forced to live in an undefended location for a chosen period of time; they were also limited to eating only barley. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html|title=The Histories of Polybius: Fragments of Book VI p.357|last=Edwards|first=H.

Carthaginians' [[quinquereme]]), as well as military units, such as [[cataphract|heavy mounted cavalry]] and [[horse archer|mounted archers]] ([[Parthia]]ns and [[Numidians]]).\n* Roman organization was more flexible than those of many opponents. Over time, the legions effectively handled challenges ranging from cavalry, to guerrillas, and to siege warfare.\n* Roman discipline (cf. [[decimation (Roman army)]]), organization and systematization sustained combat effectiveness over a longer period. These elements appear throughout the legion in training, logistics, field fortification etc.\n* The Romans were more persistent and more willing to absorb and replace losses over time than their opponents. Wars with Carthage and the Parthians and most notably, the campaigns against [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], illustrate this.\n* Roman leadership was mixed, but over time it was often effective in securing Roman military success.\n* The influence of Roman military and civic culture, as embodied particularly in the heavy infantry legion, gave the Roman military consistent motivation and cohesion.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n* Strict, and more importantly, uniform discipline made commanding, maintaining, and replacing Roman legionaries a much more consistent exercise.\n* Roman military equipment (cf. [[Roman military personal equipment]]), particularly armor, was more withstanding and far more ubiquitous, especially in the late Republican and Early Imperial era, than that of most of their opponents. Soldiers equipped with shields, helmets and highly effective body armor had a major advantage over warriors protected, in many cases, with nothing other than their shields, particularly in a prolonged engagement.\n* Roman engineering skills were second to none in ancient Europe, and their mastery of both offensive and defensive siege warfare, specifically the construction and investiture of fortifications (cf. [[Sudis (stake)|sudis]], [[castra]]), was another major advantage for the Roman legions.\n* Roman military training focused on the more effective thrusting of the sword rather than the slash.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|War}}\n* [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)]]\n* [[Early Roman army]]\n* [[Imperial Roman army]]\n* [[Late Roman army]]\n* [[Legionary]]\n* [[List of Roman wars]]\n* [[List of Roman battles]]\n* [[List of topics related to ancient Rome]]\n* [[List of Roman legions]]\n* [[List of Roman auxiliary regiments]]\n* [[Military history of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Marian Roman army]]\n* [[Roman army]]\n* [[Roman army of the mid-Republic]]\n* [[Roman military personal equipment]]\n* [[Structural history of the Roman military]]\n* For a more detailed analysis, as well as the Romans in battle, see the articles [[Roman infantry tactics]] and [[Roman military personal equipment]].\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah19101/full ''The Encyclopedia of Ancient History'', Legions, history and location of]\n* ''History of the Art of War.

In 14 days, upon reaching mandatory retirement on his 50th birthday, Duncan is set to receive half his pension, amounting to $8 million. Mr. Blut, Damocles\u2019 owner, intends to sell Damocles and is having all assassins approaching retirement killed by other Damocles operators, thus retaining their pension funds and inflating the company's value. Additionally, a Damocles contract clause stipulates that, should employees die without a will or named beneficiary, the company assumes all their assets. Duncan is the latest operative to be hunted down. Blut sends a team of assassins to hunt down Duncan who's starting to get closer to his neighbor Camille. The team raids all of Duncan's residences and kill the people staying there, but to no avail. One day, as Duncan purchases a gift for Camille, he is spotted and the assassins trap him with the help of their member Sindy. Believing her car has actually broken down, Duncan gives her a ride and takes her to his home where they engage in sexual activity as a part of the team's plan. However, as the sniper tries to take the shot, Sindy gets shot and Duncan kills her upon learning of her betrayal. He eliminates the entire team by himself and goes to their motel, where a drugged member reveals the team went to capture Camille. Returning home, Duncan finds her missing and goes to meet his friend at a bar in order to find out why is wanted dead. Duncan is betrayed, tranquilized and captured by Blut who physically tortures him for 3 days and half-blinds him while drugging and assaulting Camille at the same time.\n\nOn the fourth day, Duncan manages to free himself and eliminates Blut's entire gang by himself. He contacts Blut's assistant Vivian to make a deal: his life for Camille's. He is healed by a friend who supplies him guns to deal with Blut's army. Through a phone call, Duncan is traced by Vivian and her team. Duncan gives her a chance to walk away, but she doesn't. Using machine guns armed with lasers, he eliminates the entire team while leaving Vivian for dead. As he goes to kill Blut, the terrified henchmen walk away. He beheads Blut and rescues Camille, keeping her at his house and taking care of her. Later, he wakes up to find clippings of a murder on the bed where Camille was sleeping, and finds himself held on gunpoint by her. It is then revealed he killed her family but left her alive as a child, because he received wrong information. As Camille grew up, he redeemed himself by looking after her and financing her education secretly. As Camille is unable to let go of the pain, Duncan tells her to close her eyes and pull the trigger. The bullet is fired, but it's soon revealed Camille didn't shoot him and instead joins him to find out who ordered the hit on her father. \n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as Duncan Vizla\n* [[Vanessa Hudgens]] as Camille\n* [[Katheryn Winnick]] as Vivian\n* [[Matt Lucas]] as Blut\n* Josh Cruddas as Alexei<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BsT7BoTA0RN/ |title=Jonas Akerlund on Instagram |publisher=[[Instagram]] |language=en |access-date=January 7, 2019}}</ref>\n* Ruby O.

The two traditionally largest parties, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]], arose from a split in the original [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in|Sinn F\u00e9in]], Fine Gael from the faction ([[Cumann na nGaedheal]]) that supported the 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and Fianna F\u00e1il from the anti-Treaty faction. The division on the Treaty had also caused the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922\u201323), leading to the difference between the parties being described as \"Civil War politics\", to distinguish it from a more common [[Left-right politics|left-right political divide]].\n\nAs of the [[2020 Irish general election|2020 general election]], Fianna F\u00e1il and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] are joint first parties in party representation in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], while Fine Gael is a close third behind them. The [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] surpassed the Labour Party in the same general election. The [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] was formed in 1912, and it had usually been the third party in parliamentary strength, though it is currently the joint fifth party with the [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]].\n\nPolitical party registration is governed by the Electoral Acts, 1992 to 2012. The Register of Political Parties is maintained by the [[Oireachtas|Houses of the Oireachtas]].<ref name=register>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/publications/?q=register%20of%20political%20parties|title=Publications|work=Houses of the Oireachtas|accessdate=28 July 2018}}</ref> In order to be registered to contest national elections a party must have either at least one member in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann or the [[European Parliament]], or 300 recorded members aged 18 or over.

It is a member of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]] and is led by former minister [[Miche\u00e1l Martin]]. It was founded in 1926 by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] as a radical anti-Treaty party, drawing support from small farmers and urban workers but has since become a party of the establishment. It was first elected to power in 1932 on a constitutional republican platform, promising to remove constitutional links with Britain and reduce poverty by creating employment. It oversaw much of the industrial development of the Republic and has consequently drawn support from all social classes, making it a classic populist party.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.dit.ie/icr/media/diticr/documents/2%20Curran%20ICR%20Vol%206.pdf | journal = Irish Communications Review | title = Fianna F\u00e1il and the Origins of the Irish Press | volume = 6 | issue = | date = 1996 | page = 7 | last = Curran | first = Catherine }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1=Katy Hayward |editor2=Mary C.

The two traditionally largest parties, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]], arose from a split in the original [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in|Sinn F\u00e9in]], Fine Gael from the faction ([[Cumann na nGaedheal]]) that supported the 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and Fianna F\u00e1il from the anti-Treaty faction. The division on the Treaty had also caused the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922\u201323), leading to the difference between the parties being described as \"Civil War politics\", to distinguish it from a more common [[Left-right politics|left-right political divide]].\n\nAs of the [[2020 Irish general election|2020 general election]], Fianna F\u00e1il and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] are joint first parties in party representation in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], while Fine Gael is a close third behind them. The [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] surpassed the Labour Party in the same general election. The [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] was formed in 1912, and it had usually been the third party in parliamentary strength, though it is currently the joint fifth party with the [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]].\n\nPolitical party registration is governed by the Electoral Acts, 1992 to 2012.

It oversaw much of the industrial development of the Republic and has consequently drawn support from all social classes, making it a classic populist party.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.dit.ie/icr/media/diticr/documents/2%20Curran%20ICR%20Vol%206.pdf | journal = Irish Communications Review | title = Fianna F\u00e1il and the Origins of the Irish Press | volume = 6 | issue = | date = 1996 | page = 7 | last = Curran | first = Catherine }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1=Katy Hayward |editor2=Mary C.
