Located at the head of [[Tokyo Bay]], the prefecture forms part of the [[Kant\u014d region]] on the [[Pacific]] coast of the main island of [[Honshu]]. Tokyo is the political, economic, and cultural center of Japan, as well as the seat of the [[Emperor of Japan]] and the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]]. The [[Greater Tokyo Area]], which includes several neighboring prefectures, is the [[List of cities by GDP|largest urban economy]] and the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|most populous metropolitan area]] in the world, with more than 38.1 million residents {{as of|2017|lc=yes}}.\n\nOriginally a fishing village named {{nihongo|[[Edo]]|\u6c5f\u6238}}, the city became a prominent political center under ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], who made the city his headquarters in 1603. By the end of the 18th century, Edo had become one of the largest cities in the world, with a population exceeding one million. In 1868, the imperial capital in [[Kyoto]] mas moved to the city following the [[Meiji Restoration|end of the shogunate]], and it was renamed Tokyo (literally \"eastern capital\"). The city was devastated by the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake]], and again by [[Bombing of Tokyo|Allied firebombing]] during [[World War II]]. In the 1950s, Tokyo began a period of rapid reconstruction and expansion, going on to lead the country's [[Japanese economic miracle|post-war recovery and economic boom]]. Since 1943, the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] has administered the prefecture's [[special wards of Tokyo|23 special urban wards]], various [[bedroom communities|bed towns]] in the western area, and [[Tokyo Islands|two outlying island chains]].\n\nTokyo is categorized as an [[global city|Alpha+ city]] by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]]. Part of an industrial region that includes the neighboring cities of [[Yokohama]], [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], and [[Chiba (city)|Chiba]], the city is Japan's leading center of manufacturing, business, and finance. {{As of|2019}}, Tokyo hosted 36 of the [[Fortune Global 500]] companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/global500/2019/|title=Global 500|website=Fortune|language=en|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref> In 2020, it ranked third on the [[Global Financial Centres Index]], behind only [[New York City]] and [[London]].<ref name=GFCI>{{cite web|url=https://www.longfinance.net/media/documents/GFCI_27_Full_Report_2020.03.26_v1.1_.pdf|title=The Global Financial Centres Index 27|date=March 2020|publisher=Long Finance|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe city has hosted multiple international events, including the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] and three G7 Summits ([[5th G7 summit|1979]], [[12th G7 summit|1986]], and [[19th G7 summit|1993]]); it will also host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] and [[2020 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]]. Tokyo is a leading center for [[Research and development in Japan|research and development]] and is represented by several major [[List of universities in Tokyo|universities]], notably the [[University of Tokyo]]. The city is the primary hub for Japan's [[Shinkansen]] bullet train system, and is served by an extensive network of rail and subways. Notable districts within Tokyo include [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]] (the site of the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] and [[National Diet Building]]), [[Shinjuku]] (the city's administrative center), and [[Shibuya]] (a commercial and business hub).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{anchor|idEtymology}} Tokyo was originally known as {{Nihongo4|[[Edo]]|\u6c5f\u6238}}, which means \"[[estuary]]\".<ref name=naruto-san>Room, Adrian.

Edo was first fortified by the [[Edo clan]], in the late twelfth century. In 1457, [[\u014cta D\u014dkan]] built [[Edo Castle]]. In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was transferred from [[Mikawa Province]] (his lifelong base) to [[Kant\u014d region]]. When he became ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent [[Edo period]], Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo and Paris: Urban Life and the State in the Early Modern Era |last=McClain, James|first=James |year=1994 |page=13 |isbn=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> But Edo was Tokugawa's home and was not [[capital of Japan]].

According to Around the Rings, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aroundtherings.com//articles/view.aspx?pv=xqv&id=37022 |title=Tokyo Keeps Gymnastics Worlds, Bolsters Olympics Ambitions |publisher=Aroundtherings.com |date=May 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103927/http://www.aroundtherings.com//articles/view.aspx?pv=xqv&id=37022 |archivedate=June 1, 2012 }}</ref> Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]], and to host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2020 Summer Paralympics]] on September 7, 2013.\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Akihabara Night.jpg|thumb|left|[[Akihabara]] is the most popular area for fans of anime, manga, and games.]]\n[[File:Fuji TV headquarters and Aqua City Odaiba - 2006-05-03 edit.jpg|thumb|[[Fuji TV]] headquarters]]\n\nAs the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese movies]], television shows, animated series (''[[anime]]''), [[web comics]], [[light novels]], video games, and comic books (''[[manga]]'').

Located at the head of [[Tokyo Bay]], the prefecture forms part of the [[Kant\u014d region]] on the [[Pacific]] coast of the main island of [[Honshu]]. Tokyo is the political, economic, and cultural center of Japan, as well as the seat of the [[Emperor of Japan]] and the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]]. The [[Greater Tokyo Area]], which includes several neighboring prefectures, is the [[List of cities by GDP|largest urban economy]] and the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|most populous metropolitan area]] in the world, with more than 38.1 million residents {{as of|2017|lc=yes}}.\n\nOriginally a fishing village named {{nihongo|[[Edo]]|\u6c5f\u6238}}, the city became a prominent political center under ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], who made the city his headquarters in 1603. By the end of the 18th century, Edo had become one of the largest cities in the world, with a population exceeding one million. In 1868, the imperial capital in [[Kyoto]] mas moved to the city following the [[Meiji Restoration|end of the shogunate]], and it was renamed Tokyo (literally \"eastern capital\"). The city was devastated by the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake]], and again by [[Bombing of Tokyo|Allied firebombing]] during [[World War II]]. In the 1950s, Tokyo began a period of rapid reconstruction and expansion, going on to lead the country's [[Japanese economic miracle|post-war recovery and economic boom]]. Since 1943, the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] has administered the prefecture's [[special wards of Tokyo|23 special urban wards]], various [[bedroom communities|bed towns]] in the western area, and [[Tokyo Islands|two outlying island chains]].\n\nTokyo is categorized as an [[global city|Alpha+ city]] by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]]. Part of an industrial region that includes the neighboring cities of [[Yokohama]], [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], and [[Chiba (city)|Chiba]], the city is Japan's leading center of manufacturing, business, and finance. {{As of|2019}}, Tokyo hosted 36 of the [[Fortune Global 500]] companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/global500/2019/|title=Global 500|website=Fortune|language=en|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref> In 2020, it ranked third on the [[Global Financial Centres Index]], behind only [[New York City]] and [[London]].<ref name=GFCI>{{cite web|url=https://www.longfinance.net/media/documents/GFCI_27_Full_Report_2020.03.26_v1.1_.pdf|title=The Global Financial Centres Index 27|date=March 2020|publisher=Long Finance|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe city has hosted multiple international events, including the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] and three G7 Summits ([[5th G7 summit|1979]], [[12th G7 summit|1986]], and [[19th G7 summit|1993]]); it will also host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] and [[2020 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]]. Tokyo is a leading center for [[Research and development in Japan|research and development]] and is represented by several major [[List of universities in Tokyo|universities]], notably the [[University of Tokyo]]. The city is the primary hub for Japan's [[Shinkansen]] bullet train system, and is served by an extensive network of rail and subways. Notable districts within Tokyo include [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]] (the site of the [[Imperial Palace]] and [[National Diet Building]]), [[Shinjuku]] (the city's administrative center), and [[Shibuya]] (a commercial and business hub).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{anchor|idEtymology}} Tokyo was originally known as {{Nihongo4|[[Edo]]|\u6c5f\u6238}}, which means \"[[estuary]]\".<ref name=naruto-san>Room, Adrian.

Edo was first fortified by the [[Edo clan]], in the late twelfth century. In 1457, [[\u014cta D\u014dkan]] built [[Edo Castle]]. In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was transferred from [[Mikawa Province]] (his lifelong base) to [[Kant\u014d region]]. When he became ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent [[Edo period]], Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo and Paris: Urban Life and the State in the Early Modern Era |last=McClain, James|first=James |year=1994 |page=13 |isbn=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> But Edo was Tokugawa's home and was not [[capital of Japan]].

During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the ''Pax Tokugawa'', and in the presence of such peace, Edo adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History |last=Nait\u014d |first=Akira |year=2003 |pages=33, 55 |isbn=}}</ref> The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.
