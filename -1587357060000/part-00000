His most important contributions to the [[history of art]] were in his alliance with [[Fauvism]] from 1905, and the role he played in the development of [[Cubism]]. Braque's work between 1908 and 1912 is closely associated with that of his colleague [[Pablo Picasso]]. Their respective Cubist works were indistinguishable for many years, yet the quiet nature of Braque was partially eclipsed by the fame and notoriety of Picasso.<ref name=MoMA>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/artists/744|title=Georges Braque &#124; MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGeorges Braque was born on 13 May 1882 in [[Argenteuil]], [[Val-d'Oise]]. He grew up in [[Le Havre]] and trained to be a [[house painter]] and [[interior decorator|decorator]] like his father and grandfather. However, he also studied artistic painting during evenings at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]], in Le Havre, from about 1897 to 1899. In Paris, he apprenticed with a decorator and was awarded his certificate in 1902. The next year, he attended the Acad\u00e9mie Humbert, also in Paris, and painted there until 1904. It was here that he met [[Marie Laurencin]] and [[Francis Picabia]].<ref name=MoMA />\n\n==Fauvism==\n[[File:Georges Braque, 1906, L'Olivier pr\u00e8s de l'Estaque (The Olive tree near l'Estaque).jpg|thumb|Georges Braque, 1906, ''L'Olivier pr\u00e8s de l'Estaque'' (''The Olive tree near l'Estaque'').

The Fauves, a group that included [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]] among others, used brilliant colors to represent emotional response. Braque worked most closely with the artists [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Othon Friesz]], who shared Braque's hometown of Le Havre, to develop a somewhat more subdued Fauvist style. In 1906, Braque traveled with Friesz to [[L'Estaque]], to [[Antwerp]], and home to Le Havre to paint.<ref name=MoMA />\n\nIn May 1907, he successfully exhibited works of the Fauve style in the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]]. The same year, Braque's style began a slow evolution as he became influenced by [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] who had died in 1906 and whose works were exhibited in Paris for the first time in a large-scale, museum-like retrospective in September 1907. The 1907 C\u00e9zanne retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] greatly affected the [[avant-garde]] artists of Paris, resulting in the advent of Cubism.\n\n==Cubism==\n[[File:Georges Braque, 1909, Still Life with Metronome (Still Life with Mandola and Metronome), oil on canvas, 81 x 54.1 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Georges Braque, late 1909, ''Still Life with Metronome'' (''Still Life with Mandola and Metronome''), oil on canvas, 81 x 54.1 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

He conducted an intense study of the effects of light and perspective and the technical means that painters use to represent these effects, seeming to question the most standard of artistic conventions. In his village scenes, for example, Braque frequently reduced an architectural structure to a geometric form approximating a cube, yet rendered its shading so that it looked both flat and three-dimensional by fragmenting the image. He showed this in the painting ''[[Houses at l'Estaque]]''.\n\nBeginning in 1909, Braque began to work closely with [[Pablo Picasso]] who had been developing a similar [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] style of painting. At the time, Pablo Picasso was influenced by [[Gauguin]], C\u00e9zanne, [[African masks]] and [[Iberian sculpture]] while Braque was interested mainly in developing C\u00e9zanne's ideas of multiple perspectives. \u201cA comparison of the works of Picasso and Braque during 1908 reveals that the effect of his encounter with Picasso was more to accelerate and intensify Braque\u2019s exploration of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s ideas, rather than to divert his thinking in any essential way.\u201d<ref>Fry 1966, p. 71.</ref> Braque's essential subject is the ordinary objects he has known practically forever.

Working alone, he began to moderate the harsh abstraction of cubism. He developed a more personal style characterized by brilliant color, textured surfaces, and\u2014after his relocation to the Normandy seacoast\u2014the reappearance of the human figure. He painted many [[still life]] subjects during this time, maintaining his emphasis on structure. One example of this is his 1943 work ''Blue Guitar'', which hangs in the [[Allen Memorial Art Museum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oberlin.edu/amam/documents/16_Braque_BlueGuitar.pdf|title=Allen Memorial Art Museum}}</ref> During his recovery he became a close friend of the cubist artist [[Juan Gris]].\n\nHe continued to work during the remainder of his life, producing a considerable number of paintings, graphics, and sculptures. Braque, along with Matisse, is credited for introducing Pablo Picasso to [[Fernand Mourlot]], and most of the [[lithography|lithographs]] and book illustrations he himself created during the 1940s and '50s were produced at the [[Mourlot Studios]]. In 1962 Braque worked with master printmaker [[Aldo Crommelynck]] to create his series of etchings and aquatints titled ''L\u2019Ordre des Oiseaux'' (''The Order of Birds''),<ref>{{cite news | first = William | last = Grimes | title = Aldo Crommelynck, Master Printer for Prominent Artists, Is Dead at 77 | date = January 29, 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/arts/design/29crommelynck.html?_r=1 | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2012-05-27}}</ref> which was accompanied by the poet [[Saint-John Perse]]'s text.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.princeton.edu/graphicarts/2011/11/braque.html | title = L'ordre des oiseaux | accessdate = 2012-05-27 | last = Mellby | first = Julie L. | date = November 30, 2011 | work = Highlights from the Graphic Arts Collection, Princeton University Library}}</ref>\n\nBraque died on 31 August 1963 in Paris. He is buried in the cemetery of the Church of St. Valery in [[Varengeville-sur-Mer]], [[Normandy]] whose windows he designed. Braque's work is in most major museums throughout the world.\n\n==Style==\nBraque believed that an artist experienced beauty \"\u2026 in terms of volume, of line, of mass, of weight, and through that beauty [he] interpret[s] [his] subjective impression...\u201d<ref>Mullins 1968, p. 34.</ref> He described \"objects shattered into fragments\u2026 [as] a way of getting closest to the object\u2026Fragmentation helped me to establish space and movement in space\u201d.<ref>Mullins 1968, p. 55.</ref> He adopted a [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and neutral color palette in the belief that such a palette would emphasize the subject matter.\n\nAlthough Braque began his career painting landscapes, during 1908 he, alongside Picasso, discovered the advantages of painting [[still life]]s instead. Braque explained that he\n\u201c\u2026 began to concentrate on still-lifes, because in the still-life you have a tactile, I might almost say a manual space\u2026 This answered to the hankering I have always had to touch things and not merely see them\u2026 In tactile space you measure the distance separating you from the object, whereas in visual space you measure the distance separating things from each other. This is what led me, long ago, from landscape to still-life\u201d<ref>Mullins 1968, p. 41.</ref> A still life was also more accessible, in relation to [[perspective (visual)|perspective]], than landscape, and permitted the artist to see the multiple perspectives of the object. Braque's early interest in still lifes revived during the 1930s.\n\nDuring the period between the wars, Braque exhibited a freer, more relaxed style of Cubism, intensifying his color use and a looser rendering of objects. However, he still remained committed to the cubist method of simultaneous perspective and fragmentation. In contrast to Picasso, who continuously reinvented his style of painting, producing both representational and cubist images, and incorporating [[Surrealism|surrealist]] ideas into his work, Braque continued in the Cubist style, producing luminous, other-worldly still life and figure compositions. By the time of his death in 1963, he was regarded as one of the elder statesmen of the [[School of Paris]], and of [[modern art]].\n\n==2010 theft==\nOn 20 May 2010, the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] reported the overnight theft of five paintings from its collection.

His most important contributions to the [[history of art]] were in his alliance with [[Fauvism]] from 1905, and the role he played in the development of [[Cubism]]. Braque's work between 1908 and 1912 is closely associated with that of his colleague [[Pablo Picasso]].

He grew up in [[Le Havre]] and trained to be a [[house painter]] and [[interior decorator|decorator]] like his father and grandfather. However, he also studied artistic painting during evenings at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]], in Le Havre, from about 1897 to 1899. In Paris, he apprenticed with a decorator and was awarded his certificate in 1902. The next year, he attended the Acad\u00e9mie Humbert, also in Paris, and painted there until 1904. It was here that he met [[Marie Laurencin]] and [[Francis Picabia]].<ref name=MoMA />\n\n==Fauvism==\n[[File:Georges Braque, 1906, L'Olivier pr\u00e8s de l'Estaque (The Olive tree near l'Estaque).jpg|thumb|Georges Braque, 1906, ''L'Olivier pr\u00e8s de l'Estaque'' (''The Olive tree near l'Estaque'').

The Fauves, a group that included [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]] among others, used brilliant colors to represent emotional response. Braque worked most closely with the artists [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Othon Friesz]], who shared Braque's hometown of Le Havre, to develop a somewhat more subdued Fauvist style. In 1906, Braque traveled with Friesz to [[L'Estaque]], to [[Antwerp]], and home to Le Havre to paint.<ref name=MoMA />\n\nIn May 1907, he successfully exhibited works of the Fauve style in the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]]. The same year, Braque's style began a slow evolution as he became influenced by [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] who had died in 1906 and whose works were exhibited in Paris for the first time in a large-scale, museum-like retrospective in September 1907. The 1907 C\u00e9zanne retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] greatly affected the [[avant-garde]] artists of Paris, resulting in the advent of Cubism.\n\n==Cubism==\n[[File:Georges Braque, 1909, Still Life with Metronome (Still Life with Mandola and Metronome), oil on canvas, 81 x 54.1 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Georges Braque, late 1909, ''Still Life with Metronome'' (''Still Life with Mandola and Metronome''), oil on canvas, 81 x 54.1 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

He conducted an intense study of the effects of light and perspective and the technical means that painters use to represent these effects, seeming to question the most standard of artistic conventions. In his village scenes, for example, Braque frequently reduced an architectural structure to a geometric form approximating a cube, yet rendered its shading so that it looked both flat and three-dimensional by fragmenting the image. He showed this in the painting ''[[Houses at l'Estaque]]''.\n\nBeginning in 1909, Braque began to work closely with [[Pablo Picasso]] who had been developing a similar [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] style of painting. At the time, Pablo Picasso was influenced by [[Gauguin]], C\u00e9zanne, [[African masks]] and [[Iberian sculpture]] while Braque was interested mainly in developing C\u00e9zanne's ideas of multiple perspectives. \u201cA comparison of the works of Picasso and Braque during 1908 reveals that the effect of his encounter with Picasso was more to accelerate and intensify Braque\u2019s exploration of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s ideas, rather than to divert his thinking in any essential way.\u201d<ref>Fry 1966, p. 71.</ref> Braque's essential subject is the ordinary objects he has known practically forever.

Working alone, he began to moderate the harsh abstraction of cubism. He developed a more personal style characterized by brilliant color, textured surfaces, and\u2014after his relocation to the Normandy seacoast\u2014the reappearance of the human figure. He painted many [[still life]] subjects during this time, maintaining his emphasis on structure. One example of this is his 1943 work ''Blue Guitar'', which hangs in the [[Allen Memorial Art Museum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oberlin.edu/amam/documents/16_Braque_BlueGuitar.pdf|title=Allen Memorial Art Museum}}</ref> During his recovery he became a close friend of the cubist artist [[Juan Gris]].\n\nHe continued to work during the remainder of his life, producing a considerable number of paintings, graphics, and sculptures. Braque, along with Matisse, is credited for introducing Pablo Picasso to [[Fernand Mourlot]], and most of the [[lithography|lithographs]] and book illustrations he himself created during the 1940s and '50s were produced at the [[Mourlot Studios]]. In 1962 Braque worked with master printmaker [[Aldo Crommelynck]] to create his series of etchings and aquatints titled ''L\u2019Ordre des Oiseaux'' (''The Order of Birds''),<ref>{{cite news | first = William | last = Grimes | title = Aldo Crommelynck, Master Printer for Prominent Artists, Is Dead at 77 | date = January 29, 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/arts/design/29crommelynck.html?_r=1 | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2012-05-27}}</ref> which was accompanied by the poet [[Saint-John Perse]]'s text.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.princeton.edu/graphicarts/2011/11/braque.html | title = L'ordre des oiseaux | accessdate = 2012-05-27 | last = Mellby | first = Julie L. | date = November 30, 2011 | work = Highlights from the Graphic Arts Collection, Princeton University Library}}</ref>\n\nBraque died on 31 August 1963 in Paris. He is buried in the cemetery of the Church of St. Valery in [[Varengeville-sur-Mer]], [[Normandy]] whose windows he designed. Braque's work is in most major museums throughout the world.\n\n==Style==\nBraque believed that an artist experienced beauty \"\u2026 in terms of volume, of line, of mass, of weight, and through that beauty [he] interpret[s] [his] subjective impression...\u201d<ref>Mullins 1968, p. 34.</ref> He described \"objects shattered into fragments\u2026 [as] a way of getting closest to the object\u2026Fragmentation helped me to establish space and movement in space\u201d.<ref>Mullins 1968, p. 55.</ref> He adopted a [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and neutral color palette in the belief that such a palette would emphasize the subject matter.\n\nAlthough Braque began his career painting landscapes, during 1908 he, alongside Picasso, discovered the advantages of painting [[still life]]s instead. Braque explained that he\n\u201c\u2026 began to concentrate on still-lifes, because in the still-life you have a tactile, I might almost say a manual space\u2026 This answered to the hankering I have always had to touch things and not merely see them\u2026 In tactile space you measure the distance separating you from the object, whereas in visual space you measure the distance separating things from each other. This is what led me, long ago, from landscape to still-life\u201d<ref>Mullins 1968, p. 41.</ref> A still life was also more accessible, in relation to [[perspective (visual)|perspective]], than landscape, and permitted the artist to see the multiple perspectives of the object. Braque's early interest in still lifes revived during the 1930s.\n\nDuring the period between the wars, Braque exhibited a freer, more relaxed style of Cubism, intensifying his color use and a looser rendering of objects. However, he still remained committed to the cubist method of simultaneous perspective and fragmentation. In contrast to Picasso, who continuously reinvented his style of painting, producing both representational and cubist images, and incorporating [[Surrealism|surrealist]] ideas into his work, Braque continued in the Cubist style, producing luminous, other-worldly still life and figure compositions. By the time of his death in 1963, he was regarded as one of the elder statesmen of the [[School of Paris]], and of [[modern art]].\n\n==2010 theft==\nOn 20 May 2010, the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] reported the overnight theft of five paintings from its collection.

For instance in ninth-century Spain <saeculum> was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce <knight> as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44-50</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as <viridiarium> 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104-7</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in everyday roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122-32, 143-4</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain <saeculum> was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce <knight> as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44-50</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as <viridiarium> 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104-7</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in everyday roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122-32, 143-4</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the [[Middle Ages]], in which five generations of kings from two rival [[Dynasty|dynasties]] fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in [[Western Europe]]. The war marked both the height of [[chivalry]] and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong [[National identity|national identities]] in both countries.\n\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French ([[Normans|Norman]], and later, [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]]) in origin. English monarchs had therefore historically held [[Angevin Empire|titles and lands within France]], which made them [[vassal]]s to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French [[fief]]s was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], an [[Auld Alliance|ally of France]]. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the [[Crown lands of France|French royal domain]]; by 1337, however, only [[Gascony]] was English.\n\nIn 1328, [[Charles IV of France]] died without sons or brothers and a new principle disallowed female succession. Charles's [[Proximity of blood|closest male relative]] was his nephew [[Edward III of England]], whose mother, [[Isabella of France]], was Charles's sister. Isabella [[English claims to the French throne|claimed the throne of France for her son]], but the French{{who|date=December 2019}} rejected it, maintaining that Isabella [[Nemo dat quod non habet|could not transmit a right she did not possess]]. Political sentiment favoured a Frenchman for the crown rather than a foreign prince. The throne passed instead to Charles's [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cousin, [[Philip VI of France|Philip]], [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]]. The English had not expected their claim to be successful and did not immediately challenge the succession.  French disagreements with Edward, however, induced Philip to confiscate Edward's lands in France, which then prompted Edward to reclaim the French throne.\n\nThe early years of the war saw resounding English successes (notably at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346 and at [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]] in 1356 where King [[John II of France]] was taken prisoner). But by 1378, the French under King [[Charles the Wise]] had reconquered most of the lands they lost in the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] (signed in 1360) leaving the English with only a few cities on the continent. In the following decades, the weakening of royal authority, combined with the loss of a third of the European population to the plague and a major economic crisis, led to a period of civil war in both countries, struggles from which England emerged first. The newly crowned [[Henry V of England]] seized the opportunity presented by the mental illness of [[Charles VI of France]] and the French civil war between Armagnacs and Burgundians to revive the conflict. Overwhelming victories at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] in 1415 and [[Battle of Verneuil|Verneuil]] in 1424 as well as an alliance with the Burgundians raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph and persuaded the English to continue the war over many decades. However, a variety of factors such as the death of both Henry V and the mad king Charles VI in 1422, the emergence of [[Joan of Arc]] which boosted French morale and the loss of [[Burgundian State|Burgundy]] as an ally, marking the end of the civil war in France, prevented it. The [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1429 announced the beginning of the end for English hopes of conquest. Even with the eventual capture of Joan by the Burgundians and her execution in 1431, series of crushing French victories such as those at [[Battle of Patay|Patay]] in 1429, [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]] in 1450 and [[Battle of Castillon|Castillon]] in 1453 concluded the war in favour of the Valois dynasty. England permanently lost most of its continental possessions, with only the [[Pale of Calais]] remaining under its control on the continent until the [[Siege of Calais (1558)|Siege of Calais]] in 1558.\n\nLater historians adopted the term \"Hundred Years' War\" as a historiographical [[periodisation]] to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in [[History of Europe|European history]], but they commonly divide the war into three phases separated by [[Ceasefire|truces]]: the [[Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)|Edwardian War]] (1337\u20131360), the [[Hundred Years' War (1369\u20131389)|Caroline War]] (1369\u20131389), and the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|Lancastrian War]] (1415\u20131453). Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the [[War of the Breton Succession]] (1341\u20131365), the [[Castilian Civil War]] (1366\u20131369), the [[War of the Two Peters]] (1356\u20131369) in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], and the [[1383\u201385 crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], were used by the parties to advance their agendas.\n\nBy the war's end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a [[War of succession|dynastic conflict]], the war inspired [[French nationalism|French]] and [[English nationalism#Medieval|English]] [[nationalism]]. The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the [[feudalism|feudal]] armies where [[heavy cavalry]] had dominated, and [[artillery]] became important. The war precipitated the creation of the first [[standing army|standing armies]] in Western Europe since the [[Western Roman Empire]], and helped change their [[Military science|role in warfare]]. In France, [[civil war]]s, deadly [[epidemic]]s, [[famine]]s, and bandit [[Free company|free-companies]] of [[Routiers|mercenaries]] reduced the population drastically. In England, political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of [[History of the British peerage|English nobles]], resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, as well as the general shock at losing a war in which investment had been so great, helped lead to the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).\n\n==Origin of the conflict==\nThe root causes of the conflict can be traced to the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crises of 14th-century Europe]]. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England involving [[Gascony]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Scotland]]. The question that arose, was the official pretext due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\n\n===Dynastic turmoil in France: 1316\u20131328===\n<!-- This section is linked from Edward III of England -->\n{{Main|English claims to the French throne}}\nThe question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316. Louis X left only [[Joan II of Navarre|one daughter]], and [[John I of France]], who only lived for five days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the [[Tour de Nesle affair]]. Philip, [[Count of Poitiers]], brother of Louis X, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that women should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as [[Philip V of France|Philip V]]. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], in 1322.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}\n\n{{chart/start|align=center|style=font-size:80%| summary=Boxes and lines diagram with 16 boxes}}\n{{chart | | | | | AAA | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA='''[[Philip III of France|Philip III]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1270\u20131285}}\n{{chart | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{chart | EEE | |AAA2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | FFF |EEE=[[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux]]<br />(1276\u20131319)|AAA2='''[[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1285\u20131314|FFF=[[Charles, Count of Valois]]<br />(1270\u20131325)}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{chart | |!| | |AAA3 | | BBB | | CCC | | DDD |y|EEE2 | |FFF2 |AAA3='''[[Louis X of France|Louis X]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1314\u20131316|BBB='''[[Philip V of France|Philip V]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1316\u20131322|CCC='''[[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1322\u20131328|DDD=[[Isabella of France|Isabella]]|EEE2=[[Edward II of England|Edward II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England|FFF2='''[[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1328\u20131350}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | GGG |y|AAA4 | |BBB2 | | | | | | | |EEE3 | | | | | | |GGG=[[Philip III of Navarre|Philip, Count of \u00c9vreux]]|AAA4=[[Joan II of Navarre]]|BBB2=[[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1308)|EEE3=[[Edward III of England|Edward III]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England<br />(born 1312)}}\n{{chart | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | | |AAA5 | | | |BBB3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA5=[[Charles II of Navarre|Charles II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of Navarre (1328-1425).svg|15px]] King of Navarre<br />(born 1332)|BBB3=[[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1323)}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nCharles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans|A girl]], Blanche of France later Duchess of Orleans,[https://books.google.ca/books?id=6VEdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT12&dq=Blanche+of+France,+Duchess+of+Orl%C3%A9ans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj53PSemtDoAhWxTd8KHa2mA7UQ6AEIEDAB#v=onepage&q=Blanche%20of%20France%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans&f=false] ended up being born, therefore rendering the main male line of the [[House of Capet]] extinct.\n\nBy [[proximity of blood]], the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew, [[Edward III of England]]. Edward was the son of [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, baulked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabelle and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the [[University of Paris]] decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest [[Agnatic primogeniture|heir through male ancestry]] was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]], and it was decided that he should be crowned [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]. In 1340 the [[Avignon papacy]] confirmed that under [[Salic law]] males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1978|p=872}}\n\nEventually, Edward III reluctantly recognised Philip VI and paid him [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for his French fiefs. He made concessions in [[Guyenne]], but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made [[Second War of Scottish Independence|war on Scotland]].\n\n===The dispute over Guyenne: a problem of sovereignty===\n{{Main|Capetian-Plantagenet rivalry}}\n{{Further|Peerage of France}}\n\n[[File:Hommage d \u00c9douard Ier \u00e0 Philippe le Bel.jpg|thumb|Homage of [[Edward I of England]] (kneeling) to [[Philip IV of France]] (seated), 1286. As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was also a vassal to the French King. Illumination by [[Jean Fouquet]] from the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'' in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France]], Paris.]]\nTensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 [[Norman conquest of England]], in which the [[Throne of England|English throne]] was seized by the [[Duke of Normandy]], a [[vassal]] of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]]. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French King, as they could now draw upon the economic power of [[England]] to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchs]] would struggle to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies throughout the medieval era.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[House of Normandy|dynasty]] that had ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when [[Henry II of England|Henry]], the son of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] and [[Empress Matilda]] and great-grandson of [[William the Conqueror]], became the first of the [[Angevin kings of England]] in 1154 as Henry II.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=22}} The Angevin kings directly ruled over the [[Angevin Empire]], more French territory than the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. The Angevins still owed [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, neutralising the issue.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=17}}\n\n[[John, King of England|King John of England]] inherited the Angevin domains from his brother [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. However, [[Philip II of France]] acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and [[French invasion of Normandy (1202\u20131204)|by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions]]. Following John's reign, the [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214), the [[Saintonge War]] (1242), and finally the [[War of Saint-Sardos]] (1324), the English king's holdings on the continent, as [[Duke of Aquitaine]] (Guyenne), were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony.{{sfn|Gormley|2007}}\n\nThe dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognise the [[suzerainty]] of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.\n\nDuring the War of Saint-Sardos, [[Charles, Count of Valois|Charles of Valois]], father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by [[Edward II of England]]. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.\n\nThe King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus [[Agenais|Agen]]. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.\n\n===Gascony under the King of England===\n[[File:Guyenne 1328-en.svg|thumb|France in 1330.\n{{Legend|#4682B4|France before 1214}}\n{{Legend|#9370DB|French acquisitions until 1330}}\n{{Legend|#FFB6C1|England and Guyenne/Gascony as of 1330}}\n]]\nIn the 11th century, [[Gascony]] in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as ''Guyenne'' or ''Guienne'') and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: ''Guyenne-et-Gascogne''). The [[Angevin kings of England]] became [[Dukes of Aquitaine]] after [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] married the former Queen of France, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French Crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=8}}{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}} At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin ([[Plantagenet]]) Kings of England in south-west France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nFor the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French [[suzerainty]]. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=194}} Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=394}}\n\nGascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was [[Robert III of Artois]]. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}}\n\n===Franco-Scot alliance===\n{{See also|Auld Alliance}}\nFrance was an ally of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the area. In 1295, [[Auld Alliance|a treaty]] was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Charles IV formally [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|renewed the treaty]] in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland's support if its own kingdom were attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=304\u2013305}}\n\nPhilip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish navy, moved to the [[English Channel]] off Normandy in 1336, threatening England.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}} To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots \"at a suitable time\", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=180}}\n\n==Beginning of the war: 1337\u20131360==\n\n===End of homage===\n\n{{Main|Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)}}\n{{Campaignbox Edwardian War}}\n[[File:Hundred years war.gif|thumb|200px|right|Animated map showing progress of the war (territorial changes and the most important battles between 1337 and 1453).]]\nAt the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The ''[[arri\u00e8re-ban]]'', literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' [[Robert III of Artois|Robert d'Artois]].{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=184}} Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.{{sfn|Prestwich|2003|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nOn 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the [[Count of Flanders]]. The civic authorities of [[Ghent]], [[Ypres]] and [[Bruges]] proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the [[Low Countries]]. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the \"true\" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}}\n\nRelations with Flanders were also tied to the [[Medieval English wool trade|English wool trade]], since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] sit on the [[woolsack]] in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade.{{sfn|Friar|2004|pp=480\u2013481}} At the time there were about 110,000 [[History of Sussex#Wool|sheep in Sussex]] alone.<ref name=\"darby160\">R.E.Glassock.

The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of [[Sluis]]. The English fleet deceived the French into believing they were withdrawing. When the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the [[Battle of Sluys]]. England dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French [[invasions]].{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}} At this point, Edward's funds ran out and the war probably would have ended were it not for the death of the [[John III, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] precipitating a succession dispute between the duke's half-brother [[John of Montfort]] and [[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois]], nephew of Philip VI.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nIn 1341, conflict over the succession to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] began the [[War of the Breton Succession]], in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois.

The English army captured the completely unguarded [[Caen]] in just one day, surprising the French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed.  He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked.\n\nThe [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the [[English longbow|longbowmen]] and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=318\u2013319}} Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King [[David II of Scotland]] responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]], on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=55\u201345}} In France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and besieged the city of [[Calais]] on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347.

The forces of the ruler [[Peter of Castile]] were pitched against those of his half-brother [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]]. The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trast\u00e1mara in his invasion of Castile.{{sfn|Curry|2002|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nPeter appealed to England and Aquitaine's [[Black Prince]] for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castile. Peter was restored to power after Trast\u00e1mara's army was defeated at the [[Battle of N\u00e1jera]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=78}}\n\n[[File:Du Guesclin Dinan.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] in [[Dinan]]]]\nAlthough the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castile campaign, the prince instituted a [[hearth tax]]. [[Arnaud Amanieu, Lord of Albret|Arnaud-Amanieu VIII]], Lord of [[Albret]] had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his High Court in Paris. The Black Prince answered that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again and Edward III resumed the title of King of France.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}} Charles V declared that all the English possessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all of Aquitaine was in full revolt.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nWith the Black Prince gone from Castile, Henry de Trast\u00e1mara led a second invasion that ended with Peter's death at the [[Battle of Montiel]] in March 1369.

While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose them, the English met more resistance as they moved south. French forces began to concentrate around the English force but under orders from [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], the French avoided a set battle. Instead, they fell on forces detached from the main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves trapped against the [[Allier (river)|River Allier]] by four French forces. With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] but lost all their baggage and loot. The English carried on south across the [[Limousin]] plateau but the weather was turning severe. Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded their armour. At the beginning of December, the army entered friendly territory in [[Gascony]]. By the end of December they were in [[Bordeaux]], starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of the 30,000 horses with which they had left Calais.

[[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority.\n\nWith France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the [[Harelle]] and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace.\n\nDifficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through [[proxy war]]s, such as during the [[1383\u20131385 Portuguese interregnum]]. The independence party in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.\n\n==Second peace: 1389\u20131415==\n\n{{See also|Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War}}\n{{Campaignbox Owain Glynd\u0175r's Revolt}}\n[[File:Apanages.svg|thumb|France in 1388, just before signing a truce.

These taxes were seen as one of the reasons for the Peasants' revolt.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=6}} Richard's indifference to the war together with his preferential treatment of a select few close friends and advisors angered an alliance of lords that included [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|one of his uncles]].

The Lords Appellant were able to gain control of the council in 1388 but failed to reignite the war in France. Although the will was there, the funds to pay the troops was lacking, so in the autumn of 1388 the Council agreed to resume negotiations with the French crown, beginning on 18 June 1389 with the signing of the three-year [[Truce of Leulinghem]].{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=6}}{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=182\u2013184}}\n\nIn 1389, Richard's uncle and supporter, [[John of Gaunt]], returned from Spain and Richard was able to rebuild his power gradually until 1397, when he reasserted his authority and destroyed the principal three among the Lords Appellant. In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, Richard II disinherited Gaunt's son, the exiled [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]].

After Philip's death, his son and heir [[John the Fearless]] continued the struggle against Louis but with the disadvantage of having no close relation to the king.

The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September 1415. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, Henry elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of [[Cr\u00e9cy]], he found himself outmanoeuvred and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], north of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]]. Despite the problems and having a smaller force, his victory was near-total; the French defeat was catastrophic, costing the lives of many of the Armagnac leaders. About 40% of the French nobility was killed.{{sfn|Turchin|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} Henry was apparently concerned that the large number of prisoners taken were a security risk (there were more French prisoners than there were soldiers in the entire English army) and he ordered their deaths.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\n====Treaty of Troyes (1420)====\n{{Main|Treaty of Troyes}}\n\n[[File:Agincour.JPG|thumb|Fifteenth-century miniature depicting the [[Battle of Agincourt]] of 1415.]]\nHenry retook much of Normandy, including Caen in 1417, and [[Rouen]] on 19 January 1419, turning Normandy English for the first time in two centuries. A formal alliance was made with Burgundy, which had taken Paris after the assassination of Duke [[John the Fearless]] in 1419. In 1420, Henry met with King Charles VI. They signed the [[Treaty of Troyes]], by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France.

Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]] in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by [[Gilbert Motier de La Fayette]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. He then, during the course of the battle, led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing mel\u00e9e, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence.

From there, he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of [[Meaux]]. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\nAt the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at [[Senlis]].

The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the [[Battle of Verneuil]] (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baug\u00e9, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army.

Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas [[Cardinal Beaufort]] was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]], in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, [[Philip the Good]], [[duke of Burgundy]], deserted to Charles VII, signing the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]].{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\n===French resurgence===\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 32.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Formigny]] (1450)]]\n\nThe allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains in the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in the rest of France.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=562}} The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use.

Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Castillon]] on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordinance officer [[Jean Bureau]] and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}}\n\n===End of the war===\n{{Campaignbox Burgundian Wars}}\nAlthough the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}} England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Bordeaux fell to the French on 19 October 1453; there were no more hostilities afterwards. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]], that started in 1455.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}<ref name=webster39>\"Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France\" {{harv|Webster|1998|pp=39\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke [[Charles the Bold|Charles of Burgundy]], counting on English support, [[Burgundian Wars|took up arms]] against [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying [[Edward IV of England]] off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in the [[Treaty of Picquigny]] (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to [[English claims to the French throne|claim the title]] until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], who was living in England after the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=290\u2013291}}\n\nSome [[historian]]s use the term \"The Second Hundred Years' War\" as a [[periodisation]] to describe the series of [[military conflict]]s between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[France]] that occurred from about 1689 (or some say 1714) to 1815.<ref>Buffinton, Arthur H.

The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, but the [[Anglo-Norman language|French language in England]], which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.{{sfn|Janvrin|Rawlinson|2016|p=16}}\n\nNational feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further. Despite the devastation on its soil, the Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralised state.{{sfn|Holmes Jr.|Schutz|1948|p=61}} In England the political and financial troubles which emerged from the defeat were a major cause of the [[War of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).<ref name=webster39/>\n\n[[File:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|The spread of the [[Black Death]] (with modern borders)]]\nLowe (1997) argued that opposition to the war helped to shape England's early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war \u2013 sales taxes, debasing the coinage \u2013 and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowe|1997|pp=147\u2013195}}</ref>\n\nBubonic [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period. France lost half its population during the Hundred Years' War.{{sfn|Turchin|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} [[Normandy]] lost three-quarters of its population, and Paris two-thirds.{{sfn|Ladurie|1987|p=[{{google books|VT9rIMQFt2MC|pg=PA32|plainurl=yes}} 32]}} The population of England was reduced by 20 to 33 percent due to plague in the same period.{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n===Military significance===\n\nIn 1445 the first regular standing army in Western Europe since Roman times was organised in France partly as a solution to marauding free companies. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as [[compagnies d'ordonnance]] on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors.<ref name=\"RolandPreston1991\">{{harvnb|Preston|Wise|Werner|1991|pp=84\u201391}}</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war's costs, partly through advancement in technology and partly through lessons that [[warfare]] taught. The feudal system was slowly disintegrating throughout the hundred years war.\n\nBy the war's end, although the heavy cavalry was still considered the most powerful unit in an army, the heavily armoured horse had to deal with several tactics developed to deny or mitigate its effective use on a battlefield.{{sfn|Powicke|1962|p=189}} The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as [[hobelar]]s. Hobelars' tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured horses, enabling them to move through difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Rather than fight while seated on the horse, they would dismount to engage the enemy.<ref name=\"RolandPreston1991\" /><ref name=rogers267>Colm McNamee.

Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the [[Middle Ages]], in which five generations of kings from two rival [[Dynasty|dynasties]] fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in [[Western Europe]]. The war marked both the height of [[chivalry]] and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong [[National identity|national identities]] in both countries.\n\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French ([[Normans|Norman]], and later, [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]]) in origin. English monarchs had therefore historically held [[Angevin Empire|titles and lands within France]], which made them [[vassal]]s to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French [[fief]]s was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], an [[Auld Alliance|ally of France]]. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the [[Crown lands of France|French royal domain]]; by 1337, however, only [[Gascony]] was English.\n\nIn 1328, [[Charles IV of France]] died without sons or brothers and a new principle disallowed female succession. Charles's [[Proximity of blood|closest male relative]] was his nephew [[Edward III of England]], whose mother, [[Isabella of France]], was Charles's sister. Isabella [[English claims to the French throne|claimed the throne of France for her son]], but the French{{who|date=December 2019}} rejected it, maintaining that Isabella [[Nemo dat quod non habet|could not transmit a right she did not possess]]. Political sentiment favoured a Frenchman for the crown rather than a foreign prince. The throne passed instead to Charles's [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cousin, [[Philip VI of France|Philip]], [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]]. The English had not expected their claim to be successful and did not immediately challenge the succession.  French disagreements with Edward, however, induced Philip to confiscate Edward's lands in France, which then prompted Edward to reclaim the French throne.\n\nThe early years of the war saw resounding English successes (notably at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346 and at [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]] in 1356 where King [[John II of France]] was taken prisoner). But by 1378, the French under King [[Charles the Wise]] had reconquered most of the lands they lost in the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] (signed in 1360) leaving the English with only a few cities on the continent. In the following decades, the weakening of royal authority, combined with the loss of a third of the European population to the plague and a major economic crisis, led to a period of civil war in both countries, struggles from which England emerged first. The newly crowned [[Henry V of England]] seized the opportunity presented by the mental illness of [[Charles VI of France]] and the French civil war between Armagnacs and Burgundians to revive the conflict. Overwhelming victories at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] in 1415 and [[Battle of Verneuil|Verneuil]] in 1424 as well as an alliance with the Burgundians raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph and persuaded the English to continue the war over many decades. However, a variety of factors such as the death of both Henry V and the mad king Charles VI in 1422, the emergence of [[Joan of Arc]] which boosted French morale and the loss of [[Burgundian State|Burgundy]] as an ally, marking the end of the civil war in France, prevented it. The [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1429 announced the beginning of the end for English hopes of conquest. Even with the eventual capture of Joan by the Burgundians and her execution in 1431, series of crushing French victories such as those at [[Battle of Patay|Patay]] in 1429, [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]] in 1450 and [[Battle of Castillon|Castillon]] in 1453 concluded the war in favour of the Valois dynasty. England permanently lost most of its continental possessions, with only the [[Pale of Calais]] remaining under its control on the continent until the [[Siege of Calais (1558)|Siege of Calais]] in 1558.\n\nLater historians adopted the term \"Hundred Years' War\" as a historiographical [[periodisation]] to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in [[History of Europe|European history]], but they commonly divide the war into three phases separated by [[Ceasefire|truces]]: the [[Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)|Edwardian War]] (1337\u20131360), the [[Hundred Years' War (1369\u20131389)|Caroline War]] (1369\u20131389), and the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|Lancastrian War]] (1415\u20131453). Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the [[War of the Breton Succession]] (1341\u20131365), the [[Castilian Civil War]] (1366\u20131369), the [[War of the Two Peters]] (1356\u20131369) in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], and the [[1383\u201385 crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], were used by the parties to advance their agendas.\n\nBy the war's end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a [[War of succession|dynastic conflict]], the war inspired [[French nationalism|French]] and [[English nationalism#Medieval|English]] [[nationalism]]. The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the [[feudalism|feudal]] armies where [[heavy cavalry]] had dominated, and [[artillery]] became important. The war precipitated the creation of the first [[standing army|standing armies]] in Western Europe since the [[Western Roman Empire]], and helped change their [[Military science|role in warfare]]. In France, [[civil war]]s, deadly [[epidemic]]s, [[famine]]s, and bandit [[Free company|free-companies]] of [[Routiers|mercenaries]] reduced the population drastically. In England, political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of [[History of the British peerage|English nobles]], resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, as well as the general shock at losing a war in which investment had been so great, helped lead to the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).\n\n==Origin of the conflict==\nThe root causes of the conflict can be traced to the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crises of 14th-century Europe]]. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England involving [[Gascony]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Scotland]]. The question that arose, was the official pretext due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\n\n===Dynastic turmoil in France: 1316\u20131328===\n<!-- This section is linked from Edward III of England -->\n{{Main|English claims to the French throne}}\nThe question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316. Louis X left only [[Joan II of Navarre|one daughter]], and [[John I of France]], who only lived for five days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the [[Tour de Nesle affair]]. Philip, [[Count of Poitiers]], brother of Louis X, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that women should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as [[Philip V of France|Philip V]]. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], in 1322.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}\n\n{{chart/start|align=center|style=font-size:80%| summary=Boxes and lines diagram with 16 boxes}}\n{{chart | | | | | AAA | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA='''[[Philip III of France|Philip III]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1270\u20131285}}\n{{chart | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{chart | EEE | |AAA2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | FFF |EEE=[[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux]]<br />(1276\u20131319)|AAA2='''[[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1285\u20131314|FFF=[[Charles, Count of Valois]]<br />(1270\u20131325)}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{chart | |!| | |AAA3 | | BBB | | CCC | | DDD |y|EEE2 | |FFF2 |AAA3='''[[Louis X of France|Louis X]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1314\u20131316|BBB='''[[Philip V of France|Philip V]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1316\u20131322|CCC='''[[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1322\u20131328|DDD=[[Isabella of France|Isabella]]|EEE2=[[Edward II of England|Edward II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England|FFF2='''[[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1328\u20131350}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | GGG |y|AAA4 | |BBB2 | | | | | | | |EEE3 | | | | | | |GGG=[[Philip III of Navarre|Philip, Count of \u00c9vreux]]|AAA4=[[Joan II of Navarre]]|BBB2=[[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1308)|EEE3=[[Edward III of England|Edward III]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England<br />(born 1312)}}\n{{chart | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | | |AAA5 | | | |BBB3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA5=[[Charles II of Navarre|Charles II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of Navarre (1328-1425).svg|15px]] King of Navarre<br />(born 1332)|BBB3=[[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1323)}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nCharles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans|A girl]], Blanche of France later Duchess of Orleans,[https://books.google.ca/books?id=6VEdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT12&dq=Blanche+of+France,+Duchess+of+Orl%C3%A9ans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj53PSemtDoAhWxTd8KHa2mA7UQ6AEIEDAB#v=onepage&q=Blanche%20of%20France%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans&f=false] ended up being born, therefore rendering the main male line of the [[House of Capet]] extinct.\n\nBy [[proximity of blood]], the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew, [[Edward III of England]]. Edward was the son of [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, baulked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabelle and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the [[University of Paris]] decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest [[Agnatic primogeniture|heir through male ancestry]] was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]], and it was decided that he should be crowned [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]. In 1340 the [[Avignon papacy]] confirmed that under [[Salic law]] males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1978|p=872}}\n\nEventually, Edward III reluctantly recognised Philip VI and paid him [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for his French fiefs. He made concessions in [[Guyenne]], but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made [[Second War of Scottish Independence|war on Scotland]].\n\n===The dispute over Guyenne: a problem of sovereignty===\n{{Main|Capetian-Plantagenet rivalry}}\n{{Further|Peerage of France}}\n\n[[File:Hommage d \u00c9douard Ier \u00e0 Philippe le Bel.jpg|thumb|Homage of [[Edward I of England]] (kneeling) to [[Philip IV of France]] (seated), 1286. As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was also a vassal to the French King. Illumination by [[Jean Fouquet]] from the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'' in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France]], Paris.]]\nTensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 [[Norman conquest of England]], in which the [[Throne of England|English throne]] was seized by the [[Duke of Normandy]], a [[vassal]] of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]]. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French King, as they could now draw upon the economic power of [[England]] to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchs]] would struggle to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies throughout the medieval era.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[House of Normandy|dynasty]] that had ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when [[Henry II of England|Henry]], the son of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] and [[Empress Matilda]] and great-grandson of [[William the Conqueror]], became the first of the [[Angevin kings of England]] in 1154 as Henry II.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=22}} The Angevin kings directly ruled over the [[Angevin Empire]], more French territory than the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. The Angevins still owed [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, neutralising the issue.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=17}}\n\n[[John, King of England|King John of England]] inherited the Angevin domains from his brother [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. However, [[Philip II of France]] acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and [[French invasion of Normandy (1202\u20131204)|by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions]]. Following John's reign, the [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214), the [[Saintonge War]] (1242), and finally the [[War of Saint-Sardos]] (1324), the English king's holdings on the continent, as [[Duke of Aquitaine]] (Guyenne), were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony.{{sfn|Gormley|2007}}\n\nThe dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognise the [[suzerainty]] of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.\n\nDuring the War of Saint-Sardos, [[Charles, Count of Valois|Charles of Valois]], father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by [[Edward II of England]]. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.\n\nThe King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus [[Agenais|Agen]]. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.\n\n===Gascony under the King of England===\n[[File:Guyenne 1328-en.svg|thumb|France in 1330.\n{{Legend|#4682B4|France before 1214}}\n{{Legend|#9370DB|French acquisitions until 1330}}\n{{Legend|#FFB6C1|England and Guyenne/Gascony as of 1330}}\n]]\nIn the 11th century, [[Gascony]] in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as ''Guyenne'' or ''Guienne'') and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: ''Guyenne-et-Gascogne''). The [[Angevin kings of England]] became [[Dukes of Aquitaine]] after [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] married the former Queen of France, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French Crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=8}}{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}} At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin ([[Plantagenet]]) Kings of England in south-west France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nFor the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French [[suzerainty]]. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=194}} Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=394}}\n\nGascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was [[Robert III of Artois]]. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}}\n\n===Franco-Scot alliance===\n{{See also|Auld Alliance}}\nFrance was an ally of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the area. In 1295, [[Auld Alliance|a treaty]] was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Charles IV formally [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|renewed the treaty]] in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland's support if its own kingdom were attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=304\u2013305}}\n\nPhilip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish navy, moved to the [[English Channel]] off Normandy in 1336, threatening England.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}} To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots \"at a suitable time\", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=180}}\n\n==Beginning of the war: 1337\u20131360==\n\n===End of homage===\n\n{{Main|Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)}}\n{{Campaignbox Edwardian War}}\n[[File:Hundred years war.gif|thumb|200px|right|Animated map showing progress of the war (territorial changes and the most important battles between 1337 and 1453).]]\nAt the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The ''[[arri\u00e8re-ban]]'', literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' [[Robert III of Artois|Robert d'Artois]].{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=184}} Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.{{sfn|Prestwich|2003|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nOn 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the [[Count of Flanders]]. The civic authorities of [[Ghent]], [[Ypres]] and [[Bruges]] proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the [[Low Countries]]. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the \"true\" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}}\n\nRelations with Flanders were also tied to the [[Medieval English wool trade|English wool trade]], since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] sit on the [[woolsack]] in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade.{{sfn|Friar|2004|pp=480\u2013481}} At the time there were about 110,000 [[History of Sussex#Wool|sheep in Sussex]] alone.<ref name=\"darby160\">R.E.Glassock.

The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of [[Sluis]]. The English fleet deceived the French into believing they were withdrawing. When the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the [[Battle of Sluys]]. England dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French [[invasions]].{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}} At this point, Edward's funds ran out and the war probably would have ended were it not for the death of the [[John III, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] precipitating a succession dispute between the duke's half-brother [[John of Montfort]] and [[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois]], nephew of Philip VI.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nIn 1341, conflict over the succession to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] began the [[War of the Breton Succession]], in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois.

The English army captured the completely unguarded [[Caen]] in just one day, surprising the French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed.  He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked.\n\nThe [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the [[English longbow|longbowmen]] and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=318\u2013319}} Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King [[David II of Scotland]] responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]], on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=55\u201345}} In France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and besieged the city of [[Calais]] on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347.

The forces of the ruler [[Peter of Castile]] were pitched against those of his half-brother [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]]. The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trast\u00e1mara in his invasion of Castile.{{sfn|Curry|2002|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nPeter appealed to England and Aquitaine's [[Black Prince]] for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castile. Peter was restored to power after Trast\u00e1mara's army was defeated at the [[Battle of N\u00e1jera]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=78}}\n\n[[File:Du Guesclin Dinan.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] in [[Dinan]]]]\nAlthough the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castile campaign, the prince instituted a [[hearth tax]]. [[Arnaud Amanieu, Lord of Albret|Arnaud-Amanieu VIII]], Lord of [[Albret]] had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his High Court in Paris. The Black Prince answered that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again and Edward III resumed the title of King of France.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}} Charles V declared that all the English possessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all of Aquitaine was in full revolt.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nWith the Black Prince gone from Castile, Henry de Trast\u00e1mara led a second invasion that ended with Peter's death at the [[Battle of Montiel]] in March 1369.

While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose them, the English met more resistance as they moved south. French forces began to concentrate around the English force but under orders from [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], the French avoided a set battle. Instead, they fell on forces detached from the main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves trapped against the [[Allier (river)|River Allier]] by four French forces. With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] but lost all their baggage and loot. The English carried on south across the [[Limousin]] plateau but the weather was turning severe. Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded their armour. At the beginning of December, the army entered friendly territory in [[Gascony]]. By the end of December they were in [[Bordeaux]], starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of the 30,000 horses with which they had left Calais.

[[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority.\n\nWith France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the [[Harelle]] and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace.\n\nDifficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through [[proxy war]]s, such as during the [[1383\u20131385 Portuguese interregnum]]. The independence party in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.\n\n==Second peace: 1389\u20131415==\n\n{{See also|Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War}}\n{{Campaignbox Owain Glynd\u0175r's Revolt}}\n[[File:Apanages.svg|thumb|France in 1388, just before signing a truce.

These taxes were seen as one of the reasons for the Peasants' revolt.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=6}} Richard's indifference to the war together with his preferential treatment of a select few close friends and advisors angered an alliance of lords that included [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|one of his uncles]]. This group, known as [[Lords Appellant]], managed to press charges of treason against five of Richard's advisors and friends in the [[Merciless Parliament]]. The Lords Appellant were able to gain control of the council in 1388 but failed to reignite the war in France. Although the will was there, the funds to pay the troops was lacking, so in the autumn of 1388 the Council agreed to resume negotiations with the French crown, beginning on 18 June 1389 with the signing of the three-year [[Truce of Leulinghem]].{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=6}}{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=182\u2013184}}\n\nIn 1389, Richard's uncle and supporter, [[John of Gaunt]], returned from Spain and Richard was able to rebuild his power gradually until 1397, when he reasserted his authority and destroyed the principal three among the Lords Appellant. In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, Richard II disinherited Gaunt's son, the exiled [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]].

After Philip's death, his son and heir [[John the Fearless]] continued the struggle against Louis but with the disadvantage of having no close relation to the king.

The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September 1415. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, Henry elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of [[Cr\u00e9cy]], he found himself outmanoeuvred and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], north of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]]. Despite the problems and having a smaller force, his victory was near-total; the French defeat was catastrophic, costing the lives of many of the Armagnac leaders. About 40% of the French nobility was killed.{{sfn|Turchin|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} Henry was apparently concerned that the large number of prisoners taken were a security risk (there were more French prisoners than there were soldiers in the entire English army) and he ordered their deaths.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\n====Treaty of Troyes (1420)====\n{{Main|Treaty of Troyes}}\n\n[[File:Agincour.JPG|thumb|Fifteenth-century miniature depicting the [[Battle of Agincourt]] of 1415.]]\nHenry retook much of Normandy, including Caen in 1417, and [[Rouen]] on 19 January 1419, turning Normandy English for the first time in two centuries. A formal alliance was made with Burgundy, which had taken Paris after the assassination of Duke [[John the Fearless]] in 1419. In 1420, Henry met with King Charles VI. They signed the [[Treaty of Troyes]], by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France.

Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]] in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by [[Gilbert Motier de La Fayette]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. He then, during the course of the battle, led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing mel\u00e9e, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence.

From there, he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of [[Meaux]]. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\nAt the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at [[Senlis]].

The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the [[Battle of Verneuil]] (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baug\u00e9, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army.

Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas [[Cardinal Beaufort]] was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]], in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, [[Philip the Good]], [[duke of Burgundy]], deserted to Charles VII, signing the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]].{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\n===French resurgence===\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 32.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Formigny]] (1450)]]\n\nThe allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains in the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in the rest of France.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=562}} The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use.

Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Castillon]] on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordinance officer [[Jean Bureau]] and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}}\n\n===End of the war===\n{{Campaignbox Burgundian Wars}}\nAlthough the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}} England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Bordeaux fell to the French on 19 October 1453; there were no more hostilities afterwards. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]], that started in 1455.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}<ref name=webster39>\"Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France\" {{harv|Webster|1998|pp=39\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke [[Charles the Bold|Charles of Burgundy]], counting on English support, [[Burgundian Wars|took up arms]] against [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying [[Edward IV of England]] off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in the [[Treaty of Picquigny]] (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to [[English claims to the French throne|claim the title]] until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], who was living in England after the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=290\u2013291}}\n\nSome [[historian]]s use the term \"The Second Hundred Years' War\" as a [[periodisation]] to describe the series of [[military conflict]]s between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[France]] that occurred from about 1689 (or some say 1714) to 1815.<ref>Buffinton, Arthur H.

The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, but the [[Anglo-Norman language|French language in England]], which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.{{sfn|Janvrin|Rawlinson|2016|p=16}}\n\nNational feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further. Despite the devastation on its soil, the Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralised state.{{sfn|Holmes Jr.|Schutz|1948|p=61}} In England the political and financial troubles which emerged from the defeat were a major cause of the [[War of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).<ref name=webster39/>\n\n[[File:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|The spread of the [[Black Death]] (with modern borders)]]\nLowe (1997) argued that opposition to the war helped to shape England's early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war \u2013 sales taxes, debasing the coinage \u2013 and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowe|1997|pp=147\u2013195}}</ref>\n\nBubonic [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period. France lost half its population during the Hundred Years' War.{{sfn|Turchin|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} [[Normandy]] lost three-quarters of its population, and Paris two-thirds.{{sfn|Ladurie|1987|p=[{{google books|VT9rIMQFt2MC|pg=PA32|plainurl=yes}} 32]}} The population of England was reduced by 20 to 33 percent due to plague in the same period.{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n===Military significance===\n\nIn 1445 the first regular standing army in Western Europe since Roman times was organised in France partly as a solution to marauding free companies. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as [[compagnies d'ordonnance]] on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors.<ref name=\"RolandPreston1991\">{{harvnb|Preston|Wise|Werner|1991|pp=84\u201391}}</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war's costs, partly through advancement in technology and partly through lessons that [[warfare]] taught. The feudal system was slowly disintegrating throughout the hundred years war.\n\nBy the war's end, although the heavy cavalry was still considered the most powerful unit in an army, the heavily armoured horse had to deal with several tactics developed to deny or mitigate its effective use on a battlefield.{{sfn|Powicke|1962|p=189}} The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as [[hobelar]]s. Hobelars' tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured horses, enabling them to move through difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Rather than fight while seated on the horse, they would dismount to engage the enemy.<ref name=\"RolandPreston1991\" /><ref name=rogers267>Colm McNamee.
