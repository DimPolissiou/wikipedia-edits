Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called [[Phylum|phyla]]. \n\nTraditionally, some textbooks from the United States and Canada used a system of six kingdoms ([[Animal]]ia, [[Plantae]], [[Fungus|Fungi]], [[Protista]], [[Archaea]]/[[Archaebacteria]], and [[Bacteria]]/[[Eubacteria]]) while textbooks in countries like Great Britain, India, Greece, Brazil and other countries used five kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and [[Monera]]).\n\nSome recent classifications based on modern [[cladistics]] have explicitly abandoned the term \"kingdom\", noting that the traditional kingdoms are not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]], i.e., do not consist of all the descendants of a common ancestor.\n\n== Definition and associated terms ==\nWhen [[Carl Linnaeus]] introduced the rank-based system of [[nomenclature]] into biology in 1735, the highest rank was given the name \"kingdom\" and was followed by four other main or principal ranks: [[class (biology)|class]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[genus]] and [[species]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Linnaeus, C. |title=Systemae Naturae, sive regna tria naturae, systematics proposita per classes, ordines, genera & species |year=1735}}</ref> Later two further main ranks were introduced, making the sequence kingdom, [[phylum|phylum or division]], class, order, [[family (biology)|family]], genus and species.<ref>See e.g. {{cite conference |year=2006 |editor-last=McNeill |editor-first=J. |displayeditors=etal |title=International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Vienna Code) adopted by the Seventeenth International Botanical Congress, Vienna, Austria, July 2005 |edition=electronic |location=Vienna |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy |url=http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/main.htm |accessdate=2011-02-20 |lastauthoramp=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006231936/http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/main.htm |archivedate=6 October 2012}},{{cite web\nurl=http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/no%20frames/0007Ch1Art003.htm |title=article 3.1}}</ref>  In 1990, the rank of [[domain (biology)|domain]] was introduced above kingdom.<ref name=Woese/>\n\nPrefixes can be added so  ''subkingdom'' (''subregnum'') and ''infrakingdom'' (also known as ''infraregnum'') are the two ranks immediately below kingdom.

The two subkingdoms Unibacteria and [[Negibacteria]] of kingdom [[Bacteria]] (sole kingdom of empire [[Prokaryota]]) are distinguished according to their membrane topologies. The bimembranous-unimembranous transition is thought to be far more fundamental than the long branch of genetic distance of [[Archaebacteria]], viewed as having no particular biological significance. Cavalier-Smith does not accept the requirement for taxa to be [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] (\"holophyletic\" in his terminology) to be valid. He defines Prokaryota, Bacteria, Negibacteria, Unibacteria, and Posibacteria as valid [[Paraphyly|paraphyla]] (therefore \"monophyletic\" in the sense he uses this term) taxa, marking important innovations of biological significance (in regard of the concept of biological [[Ecological niche|niche]]).\n\nIn the same way, his [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] kingdom Protozoa includes the ancestors of Animalia, Fungi, Plantae, and Chromista. The advances of phylogenetic studies allowed Cavalier-Smith to realize that all the phyla thought to be [[archezoa]]ns (i.e. primitively amitochondriate eukaryotes) had in fact secondarily lost their mitochondria, typically by transforming them into new organelles: [[Hydrogenosome]]s. This means that all living eukaryotes are in fact [[metakaryote]]s, according to the significance of the term given by Cavalier-Smith. Some of the members of the defunct kingdom [[Archezoa]], like the phylum [[Microsporidia]], were reclassified into kingdom [[Fungi]]. Others were reclassified in kingdom [[Protozoa]] like [[Metamonada]] which is now part of infrakingdom [[Excavata]].\n\nBecause Cavalier-Smith allows [[paraphyly]], the diagram below is an \u2018organization chart\u2019, not an \u2018ancestor chart\u2019, and does not represent evolutionary tree.\n{{clade\n   |1={{clade\n      |label1=Life\n      |1={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |label1=Empire [[Prokaryote|Prokaryota]]\n            |1={{clade\n               |1=Kingdom [[Bacteria]] &mdash; includes Archaebacteria as part of a subkingdom\n               }}\n           }}\n        |2={{clade\n           |label1=Empire [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]]\n           |1={{clade\n              |1=Kingdom [[Protozoa]] &mdash; e.g. [[Amoebozoa]], [[Choanozoa]], [[Excavata]]\n              |2=Kingdom [[Chromista]] &mdash; e.g. [[Alveolata]], [[Cryptomonad|cryptophytes]], [[Heterokonta]] ([[Brown Algae]], [[Diatoms]] etc.), [[Haptophyta]], [[Rhizaria]]\n              |3=Kingdom [[Plant]]ae &mdash; e.g. [[glaucophyte]]s, [[red alga|red]] and [[green alga]]e, [[land plants]]\n              |4=Kingdom [[Fungus|Fungi]]\n              |5=Kingdom [[Animal]]ia\n              }}\n          }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n===Seven kingdoms===\nCavalier-Smith and his collaborators revised their classification in 2015.

He then divided [[Eubacteria]] into two subkingdoms: [[Negibacteria]] ([[Gram negative]] bacteria) and [[Posibacteria]] ([[Gram positive]] bacteria).\n\nTechnological advances in electron microscopy allowed the separation of the [[Chromista]] from the [[Plantae]] kingdom. Indeed, the chloroplast of the chromists is located in the lumen of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] instead of in the [[cytosol]]. Moreover, only chromists contain [[chlorophyll c]]. Since then, many non-photosynthetic phyla of protists, thought to have secondarily lost their chloroplasts, were integrated into the kingdom Chromista.\n\nFinally, some protists lacking mitochondria were discovered.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cavalier-Smith|first=Thomas|date=March 26, 1987|title=Eucaryotes with no mitochondria|journal=Nature|volume=326|issue=6111|pages=332\u2013333|doi=10.1038/326332a0|pmid=3561476|bibcode=1987Natur.326..332C|doi-access=free}}</ref> As mitochondria were known to be the result of the [[endosymbiosis]] of a [[proteobacterium]], it was thought that these amitochondriate eukaryotes were primitively so, marking an important step in [[eukaryogenesis]]. As a result, these amitochondriate protists were separated from the protist kingdom, giving rise to the, at the same time, superkingdom and kingdom [[Archezoa]]. This was known as the [[Archezoa hypothesis]]. This superkingdom was opposed to the [[Metakaryota]] superkingdom, grouping together the five other eukaryotic kingdoms ([[Animalia]], [[Protozoa]], [[Fungi]], [[Plantae]] and [[Chromista]]).\n\n===Summary===\n{{Full biological kingdom classification}}\n\nThe kingdom-level classification of life is still widely employed as a useful way of grouping organisms, notwithstanding some problems with this approach:\n* Kingdoms such as Bacteria represent [[evolutionary grade|grade]]s rather than [[clade]]s, and so are rejected by [[phylogenetic classification]] systems.\n* The most recent research does not support the classification of the eukaryotes into any of the standard systems. {{As of|2010|April}}, no set of kingdoms is sufficiently supported by research to attain widespread acceptance.

The two subkingdoms Unibacteria and [[Negibacteria]] of kingdom [[Bacteria]] (sole kingdom of empire [[Prokaryota]]) are distinguished according to their membrane topologies. The bimembranous-unimembranous transition is thought to be far more fundamental than the long branch of genetic distance of [[Archaebacteria]], viewed as having no particular biological significance. Cavalier-Smith does not accept the requirement for taxa to be [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] (\"holophyletic\" in his terminology) to be valid. He defines Prokaryota, Bacteria, Negibacteria, Unibacteria, and Posibacteria as valid [[Paraphyly|paraphyla]] (therefore \"monophyletic\" in the sense he uses this term) taxa, marking important innovations of biological significance (in regard of the concept of biological [[Ecological niche|niche]]).\n\nIn the same way, his [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] kingdom Protozoa includes the ancestors of Animalia, Fungi, Plantae, and Chromista. The advances of phylogenetic studies allowed Cavalier-Smith to realize that all the phyla thought to be [[archezoa]]ns (i.e. primitively amitochondriate eukaryotes) had in fact secondarily lost their mitochondria, typically by transforming them into new organelles: [[Hydrogenosome]]s. This means that all living eukaryotes are in fact [[metakaryote]]s, according to the significance of the term given by Cavalier-Smith. Some of the members of the defunct kingdom [[Archezoa]], like the phylum [[Microsporidia]], were reclassified into kingdom [[Fungi]]. Others were reclassified in kingdom [[Protozoa]] like [[Metamonada]] which is now part of infrakingdom [[Excavata]].\n\nBecause Cavalier-Smith allows [[paraphyly]], the diagram below is an \u2018organization chart\u2019, not an \u2018ancestor chart\u2019, and does not represent evolutionary tree.\n{{clade\n   |1={{clade\n      |label1=Life\n      |1={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |label1=Empire [[Prokaryote|Prokaryota]]\n            |1={{clade\n               |1=Kingdom [[Bacteria]] &mdash; includes Archaebacteria as part of a subkingdom\n               }}\n           }}\n        |2={{clade\n           |label1=Empire [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]]\n           |1={{clade\n              |1=Kingdom [[Protozoa]] &mdash; e.g. [[Amoebozoa]], [[Choanozoa]], [[Excavata]]\n              |2=Kingdom [[Chromista]] &mdash; e.g. [[Alveolata]], [[Cryptomonad|cryptophytes]], [[Heterokonta]] ([[Brown Algae]], [[Diatoms]] etc.), [[Haptophyta]], [[Rhizaria]]\n              |3=Kingdom [[Plant]]ae &mdash; e.g. [[glaucophyte]]s, [[red alga|red]] and [[green alga]]e, [[land plants]]\n              |4=Kingdom [[Fungus|Fungi]]\n              |5=Kingdom [[Animal]]ia\n              }}\n          }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n===Seven kingdoms===\nCavalier-Smith and his collaborators revised their classification in 2015.

He then divided [[Eubacteria]] into two subkingdoms: [[Negibacteria]] ([[Gram negative]] bacteria) and [[Posibacteria]] ([[Gram positive]] bacteria).\n\nTechnological advances in electron microscopy allowed the separation of the [[Chromista]] from the [[Plantae]] kingdom. Indeed, the chloroplast of the chromists is located in the lumen of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] instead of in the [[cytosol]]. Moreover, only chromists contain [[chlorophyll c]]. Since then, many non-photosynthetic phyla of protists, thought to have secondarily lost their chloroplasts, were integrated into the kingdom Chromista.\n\nFinally, some protists lacking mitochondria were discovered.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cavalier-Smith|first=Thomas|date=March 26, 1987|title=Eucaryotes with no mitochondria|journal=Nature|volume=326|issue=6111|pages=332\u2013333|doi=10.1038/326332a0|pmid=3561476|bibcode=1987Natur.326..332C|doi-access=free}}</ref> As mitochondria were known to be the result of the [[endosymbiosis]] of a [[proteobacterium]], it was thought that these amitochondriate eukaryotes were primitively so, marking an important step in [[eukaryogenesis]]. As a result, these amitochondriate protists were separated from the protist kingdom, giving rise to the, at the same time, superkingdom and kingdom [[Archezoa]]. This was known as the [[Archezoa hypothesis]]. This superkingdom was opposed to the [[Metakaryota]] superkingdom, grouping together the five other eukaryotic kingdoms ([[Animalia]], [[Protozoa]], [[Fungi]], [[Plantae]] and [[Chromista]]).\n\n===Summary===\n{{Full biological kingdom classification}}\n\nThe kingdom-level classification of life is still widely employed as a useful way of grouping organisms, notwithstanding some problems with this approach:\n* Kingdoms such as Bacteria represent [[evolutionary grade|grade]]s rather than [[clade]]s, and so are rejected by [[phylogenetic classification]] systems.\n* The most recent research does not support the classification of the eukaryotes into any of the standard systems. {{As of|2010|April}}, no set of kingdoms is sufficiently supported by research to attain widespread acceptance. In 2009, Andrew Roger and Alastair Simpson emphasized the need for diligence in analyzing new discoveries: \"With the current pace of change in our understanding of the eukaryote tree of life, we should proceed with caution.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Roger |first=A.J. |last2=Simpson |first2=A.G.B. |year=2009 |title=Evolution: Revisiting the Root of the Eukaryote Tree |journal=Current Biology |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=R165\u20137 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.12.032 |pmid=19243692 |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Viruses==\nThere is ongoing debate as to whether [[viruses]] can be included in the tree of life.

{"title_page": "CIA activities in Vietnam", "text_new": "'''CIA activities in Vietnam''' were operations conducted by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in Indochina and then [[Vietnam]] from the 1950s to the late 1960s, before and during the [[Vietnam War]]. Historically, Vietnam became a part of French Indochina in 1887. Although Vietnam became independent after World War II, the French continued to rule the country until 1954, and did not encourage any CIA activity.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vm.html#|title=World FactBook: Vietnam|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Also, the year of 1954 was when Ho Chi Minh was in power and the country started to be separated into two parts. While the north was controlled by the communist forces and under Ho Chi Minh's leadership, the south, with the assistance of the U.S., was anti-communist. The economic and military aid supplied by the U.S. to Vietnam continued until the late 1960s. The Central Intelligence Agency participated in every aspect of the wars in Indochina, political and military.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/|title=The CIA's Vietnam Histories|website=nsarchive2.gwu.edu|access-date=2019-03-09}}</ref> In addition to paramilitary supplies, the U.S. CIA tried to block the Ho Chi Minh Trails, an important activity that strategically prevented the North Vietnamese from using the trail for combat. Further, the CIA provided suggestions for political platforms, supported candidates, used agency resources to refute electoral fraud charges, and manipulated the certification of election results by the South Vietnamese National Assembly. Ethnic minorities who allied with the anti-communist Vietnamese and the U.S. CIA included the Montagnards, Hmong, and Khmer.<ref name=\":1\" /> There are 174 National Intelligence Estimates dealing with Vietnam, issued by the CIA after coordination with the intelligence community of the [[U.S. government]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dni.gov/nic/foia_vietnam_content.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306110446/http://www.dni.gov/nic/foia_vietnam_content.html |archive-date=2008-03-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Vietnam 1945\u20131947==\nPrior to [[World War II]], Vietnam had been part of a larger French colony named Indochina. During the war, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conquered Vietnam and remained there until 1945, when the [[Axis powers]] were defeated. The Japanese were removed from Vietnam with the help of revolutionary leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] and his Vietminh forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA and the Vietnam War Declassified part 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WedksPgYC8o|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> Following the war, France intended to retake the Indochina region and reassert its former dominance. Much of this can be traced back to a desire to restore French glory and national pride after the humiliation the nation suffered during the course of World War II. The French also wished to reclaim the Indochina region to regain control over the vast rubber plantations across the country.\n\nThe people of Vietnam were completely against the return of the French. The Vietnamese experienced a lot of abuses by the French during their colonization in the mid 19th century. The people of [[North Vietnam]] rallied around their recently returned revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh and looked to him to gain at long last, their independence.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA and the Vietnam War Declassified part 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WedksPgYC8o|website=Youtube|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe French spent nine years (1946\u201354) attempting to regain control of Vietnam. France did not realize that the current Vietnamese were much stronger than those that they were familiar with.  They greatly underestimated the strength and capability of the Vietnamese force.  Viet Minh or Vietcong as they came to be called, were not going to let the French take control of their region without a fight.  The men of the Vietcong were communists and did not want to surrender their beliefs to the French. Together with the North Vietnamese army, they would defend their land.  The Vietnamese used military and political tactics to push and expel the French from their lands. Northern Vietnamese troops were prepared to fight the French to the bitter end in order to ensure victory and their freedom. The loss of thousands of French men made it easy for North Vietnam and the Vietcong to win the war.  France lost a lot of their supporters of the war after many of their men were killed.  It was also beneficial to the North Vietnamese efforts when they began to receive outside assistance.  The Soviet Union sent them military hardware that they used in combat against the French.  After suffering a major defeat at the French's jungle fortress of Dein Bein Phu on May 7, 1954, the French military influence in Asia came to an end.  Weapons given to the Vietnamese army played a key role in the defeat of France.\n\nEven before the [[CIA]] was formed, a team from the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], and its successors that would later become the CIA, under Major [[Archimedes Patti]], was in [[French Indochina]], assessing the situation, and discussing alternatives with parties on all sides, including [[Ho Chi Minh]].<ref name=Patti>{{Citation|title=Why Viet Nam?: Prelude to America's albatross|author=Patti, Archimedes L. A|publisher=University of California Press|year=1980|isbn=0520041569}}</ref>\n\n== Vietnam 1950\u20131954 ==\n\nCIA officers moved to French Indochina in 1950 as a part of the legation of the United States in the city of Saigon. After their arrival, CIA involvement expanded to a new large base in Hanoi. The CIA's activities in Vietnam did not grow any further due to the French discouraging CIA activity (the French were still clinging to the idea that they could one day still dominate Vietnam and the U.S. was against this course of action).<ref>Bernstein, Marc D. \"Ed Lansdale's Black Warfare in 1950s Vietnam.\" HistoryNet. World History Group, 26 Apr. 2016. Web. 08 May 2017.</ref>\n\nCIA involvement in Vietnam was discouraged by the French because it was found that the CIA would often reach past them to open channels to Vietnamese nationalists. CIA activity expansion occurred when the Indochina region became three separate states, and grew exponentially during the French War in 1953 to 1954 when France was essentially forced to accept American assistance with unconventional warfare activities.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\" />\n\nDespite this resilience by the French, CIA intelligence perceived a deteriorating situation in Vietnam. A 1950 CIA intelligence report noted that the threat of Communism in Indochina was rising as rebel attacks on French outposts continued and highlighted the weaknesses of the French. An intelligence report on Indochinese Military Developments revealed how vulnerable the French military was due to the fall of the French border holding at Dongkhe, as well as, some attacks they had suffered at Tonkin. The report doubted France's ability to hold Indochina much longer if the Viet Minh continued to attack.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA Indochinese Military Developments|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-01617A002400090001-5.pdf}}</ref> They feared that \"if these attacks [were to] develop into a coordinated, a large-scale Viet Minh offensive, an action which [might] soon be within Viet Minh capabilities, French maintenance of control over Indochina \u2013 by means of their own forces alone \u2013 [would] be seriously threatened.\" This document also noted French hesitancy to bolster the Vietnamese Army, \"apparently fearing that such a step would weaken their ability to contain Vietnamese nationalism.\"<ref>\"Indochinese Military Developments\" https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-01617A002400090001-5.pdf</ref>\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community notes how cautious the French were in arming a Vietnamese army. The report continues to claim, \"French reluctance to expand or strengthen the Vietnam Army is indicated by insistence on allocation and distribution of US military aid under French control, failure to make plans for necessary financing, inability of French officials to agree on a course of action or policy, and refusal to expand the local militia.\" Additionally the French officially refused to accept help from the U.S. in the form of training Vietnamese troops from US military instructors. There is a suggestion at the end of the reports that proposed the French would need to accept American aid to train the Vietnamese army and to supply them if they wanted to change their policy of arming the Vietnamese.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indochinese Military Developments|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-01617A002400090001-5.pdf|website=CIA}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1953\u20131954, the involvement of the CIA had increased when the French finally accepted U.S. assistance with the unconventional (guerrilla) warfare tactics they faced, as the French were facing large and costly losses at the hands of what would become the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese resistance forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA and the Vietnam War Declassified Part 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C80MD08QBkY|website=Youtube|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> The primary aid initially offered by the U.S. was military aid in supplying military hardware and training of the Vietnamese army; the scope of U.S. aid to the French was then greatly expanded following the Eisenhower administration. Without the aid from the United States, there would be little practical effort from this ostensible change in French policy.{{Clarify|date=May 2019}}<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/|title=The CIA's Vietnam Histories|website=nsarchive2.gwu.edu|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThere was a reestablishment of a covert action section in Saigon Station. There was also a unilateral covert action which was suspended in 1953 under State Department pressure. This was due to the French exposing paramilitary operations against the Vietminh in Hanoi that the agency did not previously clear with them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/2-CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdf</ref>\n\nThe CIA's mission in Saigon was to directly assess the nationalist politicians.<ref>Thomas L. Ahern, Jr., CIA and the Generals: Covert Support to Military Government in South Vietnam, Center for the Study of Intelligence, October 1998, 243 pp</ref> The primary cause and motivation behind the intervention of the U.S. and CIA through 1954 was to gather intelligence, and provide interpretations of the events that occurred in Indochina through an American perspective. Outside of North Vietnam, the agency's broad span of activities reached into almost every aspect of the Indochina war. The agency conducted several paramilitary programs and conducted a full-scale war in [[Laos]] and [[South Vietnam]].<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\" />\n\n==Vietnam 1954==\nIn 1954, the CIA would remain consistent in its activities in Vietnam. The CIA's expansion included various stations throughout Vietnam and Laos. A station was also located in Cambodia, but relations were broken in 1963 and reinstated during the 1970s.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\" /> The CIA stations, though initially used solely for gathering intelligence and providing interpretations of events in Indochina, came to gain as much importance as the U.S. embassy in its scale of political relations with the South Vietnamese government due to its broad range of activities. The CIA stations in Vietnam were also responsible for conducting a full-scale war in Laos at that time in addition to South Vietnam paramilitary operations.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\" />\n\nAnother key event that occurred in 1954 was the creation of the Geneva Accords. Signed by France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and three Associated States of Indochina including Ho Chi Minh's Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Accords addressed the issue of what to do with Vietnam since the Viet Minh had destroyed colonial rule. Although the United States had agreed to respect the Accords, it would not sign them because the U.S. government disagreed with the provision that split Vietnam at the 17th parallel.<ref name=\"History 2017\">\"Geneva Conference begins.\" History.com. A&E Television Networks, n.d. Web. 08 May 2017.</ref> These Accords would come to play a major role in the United States' decision to interfere with the situation in Vietnam. The U.S. government had provided the French with logistical support in their mission to defeat the Viet Minh, however it was only a matter of time before the French needed military support as well. Essentially, the Geneva Accords forced the United States to decide if they were willing to provide such assistance. As historian Thomas L. Abern Jr stated, \"In the end, the importance of halting Communism overshadowed the risks, and the United States embarked on its 21-year effort to create in South Vietnam a permanent barrier to Communist expansion in Southeast Asia.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=CIA and the House of NGO: Covert Action in South Vietnam 1954\u20131963 (U)|last=Ahern, Jr.|first=Thomas L.|publisher=|year=June 2000|isbn=|location=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/2-CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdfiipages=231-232}}</ref>\n\n===Covert action===\nThe initial CIA team in Saigon was the Saigon Military Mission, headed by  [[United States Air Force]] Colonel [[Edward Lansdale]], who arrived on June 1, 1954. His diplomatic cover job was Assistant Air Attach\u00e9. The broad mission for the team was to undertake paramilitary operations against the enemy and to train the South Vietnamese in the arts of [[psychological warfare]], just like Landsdale had done in an earlier conflict in the Philippines. Although, Lansdale worked for the OSS briefly in  World War II, he was never a CIA employee.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=PPv1D95>{{citation\n | title = Document 95, Lansdale Team's Report on Covert Saigon Mission in 1954 and 1955\n | work = The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Volume 1\n | pages = 573\u201383\n | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/doc95.htm\n}}</ref>\n\nWorking in close cooperation with the [[U.S. Information Agency]], a new psychological warfare campaign was devised for the Vietnamese Army and for the government in Hanoi. Shortly after, a refresher course in combat psy-war was constructed. \n\nOne such example of psychological warfare dealt directly with misinformation. Lansdale would later recall the event in his memoirs. \"The first idea was used just before the French quit the city of Hanoi and turned over control to the [[Viet Minh|Vietminh]]. At the time, the Communist apparatus inside the city was busy with secret plans to ready the population to welcome the entry of Vietminh troops. I suggested that my nationalist friends issue a fake Community manifesto, ordering everyone in the city except essential hospital employees to be out on the streets not just for a few hours of welcome but for a week-long celebration. In actuality this would mean a seven-day work stoppage. Transportation, electric power, and communication services would be suspended. The simple enlargement of plans already afoot should give the communists an unexpectedly vexing problem as they started their rule.\"<ref name=\"Lansdale, Edward Geary 1972 p.225\">''Lansdale, Edward Geary.'' ''(1972). In the Midst of Wars: An American's Mission to Southeast Asia.'' New York: Harper and Row. p. 225.</ref> The celebration did not last a week. The Communists thought that this manifesto was French [[counterpropaganda]] and attempted to order everyone back to work, which took three days.<ref name=\"Lansdale, Edward Geary 1972 p.225\"/>\n\nThe second SMM member, Major Lucien Conein, arrived on July 1.  A paramilitary specialist, well known to the French for his help with French-operated maquis in Tonkin against the Japanese in 1945, he was the one American guerrilla fighter who had not been a member of the Patti Mission. In August, he went to Hanoi with the assignment of developing a paramilitary organization in the north.... A second paramilitary team for the south was formed, with Army Lieutenant Edward Williams doing double duty as the only experienced counter-espionage officer, working with revolutionary political groups.<ref name=\"History 2017\"/>\n\n===Intelligence analysis===\nWorking with available data, the CIA produced a [[National Intelligence Estimate]] in August 1954. It began by stating that the Communist signing of the Geneva agreements had legitimized them, and they would need to immediately move to control the North while planning for long-term control of the country.\n\nThis National Intelligence Estimate went on to suggest that while the Diem government was in official control of the South (though remained unpopular because of a disconnect of the government from the people), certain pro-French elements may have been planning to overthrow it. CIA experts also noted that Diem would have political problems on top of already sinking popularity.[[Viet Minh|Vietminh]] elements would remain in the South and create an underground resistance force, discredit the government, and undermine French-Vietnamese relations.<ref name=\"NIE 63-5-54\">NIE 63-5-54</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 1954, Lansdale lured two key personnel in a planned coup against South Vietnamese President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] out of the country. Lansdale invited Hinh and staff to visit the Philippines.\n\nU.S. personnel dealing with the Government of Vietnam had difficulties understanding their politics. This can be attributed to the fact that the CIA did not make a concerted effort to gain a better understanding of the history and culture of Vietnam. The CIA instead focused on the military forces occupying the territory instead of the political and economic forces that motivated them.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ahern|first1=Thomas|title=CIA and Rural Pacification in South Vietnam|journal=FOIA|date=August 2001|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/3-CIA_AND_RURAL_PACIFICATION.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> The diplomats were not getting clear information in 1954 and early 1955, but the CIA station \"had ... no mandate or mission to perform systematic intelligence and espionage in friendly countries, and so lacks the resources to gather and evaluate the large amounts of information required on political forces, corruption, connections, and so on.\"<ref name=\"PPv1D95\"/>\n\nIn Thomas Ahern's monograph, he stops short of any admission that the agency was an actor in the coup that overthrew Saigon leader Ngo Dinh Diem. Within the monograph it is noted that on the morning of the coup the U.S. military command in South Vietnam advised the CIA that Saigon was quiet, and that the CIA should stop reporting a coup was imminent or in-progress.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The CIA also reportedly recognized that Diem would have political problems as early as August 1954. It is reported that policy surrounding Diem was set with this in mind. Relations with Diem's brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, began as early as 1952, also signaling that the CIA predicted political problems with Diem. Despite having the benefit of expert warnings, it is clear that the CIA acted beyond the scope of it experts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Vietnam 1955==\nBy 31 January 1955, a paramilitary group had cached its supplies in Haiphong, having had them shipped by [[Civil Air Transport]], a CIA proprietary airline belonging to the Directorate of Support.\n\nNgo Dinh Diem and Ngo Dinh Nhu had been exploited by the help of CIA advisors to help defeat one of the challenges to the new Prime Minister's authority.\n\nLansdale and the South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dienh Diem had been working together, however they did not agree on the government system they wanted in South Vietnam. In August 1955, Lansdale brought Juan Orendain, a Filipino constitutional scholar, to Saigon in order to sway Diem in a direction similar to the American system. Lansdale was hoping he could have the same effect on Diem as he had previously when working with [[Magsaysay]] in the Philippines.  Part of this meant proposing a legislature and a judicial system to signal that Diem was open to checks and balances, and was not trying to be beyond reproach in his position.  By April 1956 Diem had considered and rejected the model proposed by Orendain, and was more concerned about the broad authority he needed that very moment.  All the while Lansdale had little to no real oversight from the rest of the CIA as these actions were taking place.  Though he took advantage of this autonomy to improvise, it also meant he had little to no backup to enforce or further persuade Diem into a governmental separation of powers.<ref>http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/2-CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdf pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nDuring one encounter in early 1955, Diem rejected US ambassadorial representative [[J. Lawton Collins]]'s nominee for commander of the Vietnamese Army. Collins wanted competence, whereas Diem preferred someone loyal.\n\nOn April 27, 1955 the Battle of Saigon had begun.  The private crime syndicate Binh Xuyen and the Vietnamese National Army would wage conflict for around a month in Cholon.  The Binh Xuyen had been influential (as a powerful Saigon gang) in post-colonial Vietnam, and had even stolen arms and fought the French, however they were defeated quickly.<ref>Letwin, Brian. \"Gangsters of Old Saigon: Binh Xuyen.\" Saigoneer. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 May 2017.\n</ref>  Diem had issued the Binh Xuyen an ultimatum to come under control or be eliminated. The damage caused by the fighting resulted in around a thousand casualties, and tens of thousands more homeless.\n\nIn January 1956 Diem promulgated Ordinance 6, which authorized detention and reeducation for anyone considered a danger to the state. This led to a problem of overcrowding as there were already 20,000 communists that had been placed in detention camps since 1954.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/3-CIA_AND_RURAL_PACIFICATION.pdf</ref> Landsdale claimed that there was 7,000 political detainees in Saigon's Chi Hoa prison alone.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nOperation Brotherhood, created by Ramon Magsaysay in the Philippines, had its first medical team beginning in late 1954. By 1955, it had more than 100 doctors and nurses at 10 medical center locations in South Vietnam to treat refugees and to train Vietnamese medical personnel. The second pacification operation was launched late April 1955 in the southern Dinh Dinh and northern Phu Yen portion of [[Central Vietnam]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Vietnam 1959 ==\nNorthern Vietnamese troops needed a way to link themselves with their allies in Southern Vietnam. The Viet Cong and Northern Vietnamese soldiers were able to supply troops and military operations through secret tunnels and the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]].  The Ho Chi Minh trail was an interlocking trail system that was created through the borders of Laos and Cambodia that reach from North Vietnam to South Vietnam. During the construction of this trail, native guides had to be used to guide the Northern Vietnamese troops through the wild countryside. Campsites that were built along the side of the trail grew into way points for troops to gather and rest. The trail stretched 800 miles and could take up to three months to travel by foot.<ref>The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. \"Ho Chi Minh Trail.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc., n.d. Web. 08 May 2017.\n</ref> Laos had been demilitarized during the 1960s.  The North Vietnamese however did not respect the Laos treaty with the U.S,  Instead, the North Vietnamese disregarded the peace treaty and begun their construction of the trail to aid their southern Vietnamese allies.  Pictures revealing the trail's construction were taken by Vietnamese journalists.<ref>{{Citation|last=WarBear|title=U.S Soldiers receive heavy effective fire *Helmet Cam*|date=2014-01-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtaNj5f9oxk|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> However, some of the greatest dangers were not the humans following the trail but rather the mother nature one would encounter along the way.  Guides were needed for groups to navigate the dangerous trail.  Snakes and spiders would flood the clothing of travelers along with dangerous terrain.  For these reasons, travelers needed to practice great precaution along the way.  The trail quickly became on of the secret forces of the war.  Once United States officials gathered intelligence about the trail, they quickly installed motion censors across the trail to catch insurgents.<ref name=\":0\" /> The complexity of the trail grew further during the 1960s.\n\nDetecting Viet Cong movements on the Ho Chi Minh trail was exceedingly difficult. The trail was a complex collection of interconnecting footpaths. The flexibility afforded by its complexity meant multiple routes could be traversed from north to south. As such, it was easy to shift to a different route if the security of one area was compromised. Furthermore, the length of the trail and the small number of persons using it on any given segment, coupled with its flexible nature made detection all but impossible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79S00427A000500040044-3.pdf|title=THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref>\n\nIn attempts to combat troop and supply movement along the trail, the CIA and U.S. military set up heat and movement sensors along the trail to track enemy movement. U.S. forces also attempted to use air dropped listening devices to track enemy troops and pinpoint Viet Cong movements.\n\n1959 also saw the arrival of William Colby in the region, and it became increasingly noticeable throughout 1959 that Diem was becoming paranoid regarding security issues and the military. This time saw a constant back and forth between Diem and Nhu over control of the military in the region. The year 1959 saw Diem's authority quickly being lessened, as Tran Quoc Bhu had insisted upon it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ahern, Jr.|first1=Thomas L.|title=CIA and the House of NGO|url= http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/2-CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdf |website=National Security Archives|accessdate=10 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe CIA had very few contacts in the Viet Cong ranks or Northern Vietnam at the time. Many of the contacts that they had were double agents run by the Viet Cong. Much of the intelligence gathered regarding Northern Vietnam was unreliable.<ref>Weiner, Tim. Legacy of ashes: the history of the CIA. London: Penguin, 2011. Print.\n</ref> U.S. and South Vietnamese military personnel believed that the bulk of North Vietnamese supplies were being shipped over the Ho Chi Minh trail, however, more than 80 percent of Northern supplies were sent by sea.\n\nU.S. Special Forces also began to train some Laotian soldiers in unconventional warfare techniques as early as the fall of 1959 under the code name Erawan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|title=Fighting the war in Southeast Asia|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> This was because after President Kennedy took power who refused to send more American soldiers to battle in Southeast Asia. Instead, he called upon the CIA to use its \"tribal forces\" in Laos and to \"make every possible effort to launch guerrilla operations in North Vietnam with its Asian recruits.\" Hence, under this code name, General [[Vang Pao]], who served the royal Lao family was recruited. He then recruited and trained his Hmong soldiers to ally with the CIA and fight against the communist North.\n\n==Vietnam 1961==\nIn April 1961,  Lansdale, who had been designated the Operations Officer for an interagency Task Force in charge of political, military, economic, psychological, and covert character, was to go to Vietnam. Changes of policy in Washington however, transferred these responsibilities to the military and diplomats, and Lansdale was no longer involved with Vietnam.\n\nOn May 11, 1961, President Kennedy gave the authorization to begin \"a program for covert actions to be carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency which would precede and remain in force after any commitment of U.S. forces to South Vietnam.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Kennedy was giving the CIA the job of preparing for the eventual landing of U.S. troops. Later that year, in October 1961 the Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles approved a massive counterinsurgency program with the goal of launching a \"village defense program in the lightly populated but strategically important Central Highlands.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The involvement of the CIA rose substantially when they were given the task of supporting \"irregular formations\" that did not fall under other agencies\u2019 jurisdictions, which include civil wars, guerrilla wars, and rebellions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> They were given this job because of an interagency task force recommendation in January 1962. Later that year in May 1962, Defense Secretary McNamara promised the Far East Division chief Desmond FitzGerald \"a blank check\u2026in terms of men, money, and material.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This illustrates the important mission given to the CIA by the Department of Defense and the White House.\n\nCIA begins to sponsor and train the [[Civilian Irregular Defense Group]]s (CIDG) in the South Central Highlands.  These were local defense operations with a mobile support component, \"Mike Force\", made up primarily of [[Nung people|Nung]] mercenaries. Most CIDG units eventually became Vietnamese Rangers. These forces were intended to help combat the guerrilla tactics of the Vietcong.The CIDG grew out of a Military Operations Section (MOS) program led by Gilbert Layton. Layton's priority was strengthening the intelligence network in the country, specifically in the border regions with Cambodia and Laos.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Layton sought to find locals that could gather intelligence on Viet Cong installations in the area.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> He proposed a program \"designed to recruit as many as 1,000 tribesmen to operate in the guerrilla-infested high plateau areas bordering on northern Cambodia and South Laos.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> His proposal for a crop station and seed distribution was approved but it suffered many delays and problems.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> CIA Deputy Chief William Colby expanded the intelligence gathering operation into a defense building operation known as the \"Montagnard defense program.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn 1961, the CIA also strengthened contact with then-captain in the Royal Laotian Armed Forces, Vang Pao.<ref>Ahern, Thomas L., Jr. Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos.

First donations of food, blankets, and then by January 24, 1961 300 Hmong received weapons to Vang Pao's troops, the CIA sent men to train Hmong fighters in guerrilla tactics, eventually engaging soon-to-be-General Pao's approximately 10,000 men.<ref>Ahern, Thomas L., Jr. Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos.

It was during 1961 that Vang Pao expressed concerns as to the dedication of the CIA in aiding and remaining supportive of the Hmong after their use in the Vietnam War.<ref>Ahern, Thomas L., Jr. Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos.

Kennedy had organized a meeting with Eisenhower, who was on his way out of the Oval Office, to discuss the strategic importance of Laos. They discussed \"keeping the 'cork in the bottle'...to prevent communist dominion over most of the Far East.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos, 1961\u20131973|last=Ahern|first=Thomas L.|publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=xv}}</ref> Eisenhower saw Laos as so important, that he was worried about all of Thailand, Cambodia, and South Vietnam falling to communism if Laos went that way. The president was concerned that the Royal Laotian Army (RLA) was impotent and mutinous, and did not want to rely on them. He was so concerned, that in this meeting, he said he would \"as a last desperate hope...intervene unilaterally,\" if it were up to him.<ref name=\":2\" /> The interventions, as mentioned in the paragraph above, ended up being the arming and training of paramilitary forces. While preventing a communist Laos remained the objective of the CIA for the next 14 years, the focus of their paramilitary operations changed over time. Until 1964, the Hmong fighters in Laos focused on trying to fight back North Vietnamese fighters and on preventing further encroachment. They were highly important, because the U.S. hadn't begun putting troops on the ground in any great numbers, yet. After that, in 1965, the report describes the Hmong activities in Laos as \"flitt[ing] over mountain trails or mov[ing] by air to occupy key high ground and to harass Hanoi's tanks and artillery,\"<ref name=\":2\" /> meaning that U.S. troops took on a frontline role and asked the paramilitary forces to operate in more difficult terrain and in less standard ways.\n\n'''The Buon Enao Project'''\n\nBuon Enao was a Rhad\u00e9 village that was the location of a CIA experimental program designed to strengthen defenses against the Viet Cong.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> The CIA brought several proposals to the village elders, and almost all were met with protest or skepticism. After satisfying all of their concerns, the Americans were able to build a perimeter border fence as well as dispensary. They also armed the villages and trained them how to shoot. They were named the CIDG so that they did not give the appearance of a \"covert offensive military unity.\" Buon Enao was the \"first CIDG Area Development Center, which controlled social and economic development services as well as the village defense system in the surrounding area.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n=== Tony Po (Anthony Poshepny) ===\nTony Po was recruited into the CIA after he graduated from San Jose State University and finished his training in 1953. Po worked with the Hmong starting in March 1961. He was then transferred to Long Tieng. In Long Tieng Po ran field missions with the Hmong partisans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/the-biography-of-tony-po-aka-anthony-poshepny/|title=The biography of Tony Po|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> After he took an enemy round in the stomach in January 1965, and one-too-many confrontations with Vang Pao, Poshepny was transferred up-country, to the land of Yao tribesmen. The tribesmen thought of him as \"a drinker and an authoritarian commander and a mercurial leader, who could threaten and bribe to get his way\" He died on June 27, 2003.\n\n== Vietnam 1962 ==\nIn February 1962, disgruntled South Vietnamese air force pilots bombed the presidential palace in hopes of killing Diem and forcing new leadership, but it fails as he was in a different part of the palace when this happened. Diem reassigned military officers to improve his security however he still did not undertake political reforms.<ref name=\"Evans\">{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB101/index.htm|title=JFK and the Diem Coup: Declassified Records|last=Evans|first=Michael|website=nsarchive.gwu.edu|access-date=2017-03-05}}</ref>  It was also agreed upon in 1962 to grow the Laotian irregulars despite potential diplomatic consequences.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/6-UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf</ref>\n\nIn the Spring of 1962, the CIA became interested hitting at North Vietnam's navy the agency called it [[Operation Vulcan|Operation VULCAN]]. In order to fulfill this operation, the CIA hired \u201c18 South Vietnamese who had been trained in underwater demolition\u201d to target the port of [[Qu\u1ea3ng Kh\u00ea|Queng Khe]]. which \u201cwas home to several of the DRV's [[Shantou-class gunboat|Swatow-class]] gunboats\u201d.<ref name=\":3\" /> \u00a0In June 1962, the demolition crew, called the \u201cfrogmen\u201d were driven by the ''Nautilus III'' within swimming distance of the North Vietnamese port.

However, \u201chow many of them detonated remained unclear, for one of them went off prematurely, with the swimmer already spotted and trying to escape\u201d.<ref name=\":3\" /> The ''Nautilus III'' was chased down by a Swatow at which point the Swatow collided with the ''Nautilus III'', and all crew, except one, were captured by the North Vietnamese.

The agreement went into place in October 1962. Later the CIA grew afraid that they might demoralize their liaison partners so they did not disclose information pertaining to the policy basis that halted some operations. TARZAN was developed in order to monitor the North Vietnamese road traffic and then the findings would be taken back to the CIA. They were a sabotage team that was released near Route 2. On December 30 a sabotage team that was sponsored by SEPES was called LYRE. This was a part of the 9 teams developed that often did not go into full effect.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/5-THE_WAY_WE_DO_THINGS.pdf|title=The Way We Do Things|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIt wasn't until November 1, 1963 when the rebels killed Colonel Le Quang Tung, who was Diem's right-hand man, as leverage to get Diem and Nhu to surrender. However, both Diem and Nhu managed to escape through a secret cordon within the presidential palace to a refuge at a Catholic church within the Chinese quarter. General Duong Van Minh found this refuge and shot both Diem and Nhu, despite American appeals.\n\nAt this time, the Americans and the generals gave little focus to the next regime that was to follow after the coup. Diem was considered a failure as a leader, but relationships with the generals was secured for mutual desire to eliminate the Communist threat with more American involvement.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ahern|first1=Thomas|date=19 Feb 2009|title=CIA and the Generals|pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n==Vietnam 1963==\n\nThe U.S. supported Diem in hopes to create a nation that was south of the demilitarized zone at the 17th parallel.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">CIA and the Generals.http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/1-CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf</ref>  In August 1963 South Vietnamese military officers initially planned to obtain support from the U.S. for their coup against Ngo Dinh Diem.  State Department official Roger Hilsman originated a cable giving the South Vietnamese generals the green light for a coup against Diem and in October 1963 final plans were made for the coup that was carried out.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> On November 1, 1963 the House of Ngo ended when generals working for President Diem surrounded the Palace. The Palace was surrounded by units that were brought into Saigon from Mekong Delta and Bien Hoa.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Observers of the firefight got close enough to count about 200 rebel troops and there was a report of 35 armored vehicles heading toward the palace.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  With Diem loyalists being detained, political arrangements were of order and they acknowledged that the new government would be a civilian one.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Minh threatened Diem in every way, exerting that he had no patience and would \"blast him off the face of the earth\" if he did not surrender.  After a bombardment of artillery fire to intimidate Diem, Minh ordered an assault on the palace.  The next morning Diem finally called the JGC Headquarters promising to surrender if he had safe passage out of the country.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Americans had ordered that the Diem and Nhu were kept safe but an officer of Minh had placed them into an armored vehicle and shot them to death. The Americans began to focus on fixing the makeup of the coup rather than the policy of the successor's government after they had realized how bad Diem was as a leader.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>  The CIA paid $42,000 in immediate support money to the plotters the morning the coup, given by Lucien Connie an act of prefigured in administration planning.<ref name=\"Evans\"/>\n\nOn July 8, 1963, A CIA officer was told by Major General Tran Van Don(South Vietnam's army commander) that there were plans by the military to overthrow President Diem.<ref>http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB101/vn01.pdf</ref>\n\nIn November 1963, the CIA, or \"the Station\", was relied upon by Vietnamese generals, who had [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|recently staged a coup]], to aid in the set up of a new regime.  The Station was coming out of a U.S. Mission moratorium on contacts with the new leadership imposed by Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge.  A White House tape of President Kennedy and his advisers confirms that top U.S. officials sought the November 1, 1963 coup against South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem without apparently considering the consequences for Diem personally.<ref name=\"Evans\" /> With support of the coup coming from the U.S. it would have the potential of making us responsible for the outcome in South Vietnam.\n\n==Vietnam 1964==\n[[File:Phoenix Program.jpg|thumb|Badge of members of the [[Phoenix Program]]]]\n\n===Intelligence analysis===\nA Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) issued in May theorized that a short but intense air and naval campaign against the DRV would deter an invasion of the South, although not stop activities there. It also estimated that this would be a strong morale boost to the RVN.<ref name=SNIE50-2-64>SNIE50-2-64</ref> The campaign described, however, was different than the actual gradual attacks that resulted from the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] incident in August. This tactic failed spectacularly, as it drove the North Vietnamese and Vietcong to use vicious guerrilla tactics against the U.S.\n\nIn October, another, less optimistic SNIE was issued, limited to the South. It said the situation was deteriorating, and a coup could occur at any time. The Prime Minister of the country, General [[Nguyen Khanh]], stayed in power by placating various groups, while exhibiting little leadership of the country or the military. Defeatism was spreading from Saigon to the countryside, and was aggravated by a [[Degar|Montagnard]] revolt on September 20. No clear leadership was emerging. Much of this turmoil can be traced back to the Diem government and its inability to capture the hearts of the people like Ho Chi Minh had. The South Vietnamese government was completely detached from its people as much of its government was focused in Saigon (though most of the people lived in small villages and Hamlets in the countryside).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ahern|first1=Thomas|title=CIA and the Generals: Covert Support to Military Government in South Vietnam|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/1-CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf|website=The CIA's Vietnam Histories|publisher=FOIA|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Viet Cong|Vietcong]], however, were not seen to be planning an immediate takeover, but are concentrating on psychological operations to increase unrest in the south and among American forces.<ref name=\"SNIE 53-2-64\">{{citation\n |author       = Central Intelligence Agency\n |title        = SNIE 53-2-64 The Situation in South Vietnam\n |date         = 1 October 1964\n |url          = http://www.dni.gov/nic/PDF_GIF_declass_support/vietnam/SNIE_53-2-64.pdf\n |access-date  = 2008-04-25\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227144818/http://www.dni.gov/nic/PDF_GIF_declass_support/vietnam/SNIE_53-2-64.pdf\n |archive-date = 2008-02-27\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n==Vietnam 1965==\n\n===Intelligence analysis===\nSpecial National Intelligence Estimate 10-9-65, was done to assess the reactions, in various parts of the world, to an escalation of U.S. attacks on North Vietnam.

Under Diem religious tensions increased between the Buddhists and minority Roman Catholics. He gave Roman Catholics preference in governmental appointments and in military positions in addition to other actions that benefited Christians disproportionately over Buddhists.  In a special report on The Buddhists in South Vietnam from 1963, the CIA noted that they were tracking the discontent within the Buddhist community and trying to discern if these grievances could lead to political change within the country. In a section concerning political influences they write, \"There seems to be little doubt that the intensity of the Buddhist protests reflected general discontent over the entrenched, autocratic rule of the Diems as well as specific grievances against their religious biases. there have been persistent reports that some extremist Buddhist leaders have been determined to keep up the momentum of demonstrations, not just to secure satisfaction of demands, but in hopes of bringing about the government's overthrow. Available information, however, indicates that most Buddhist leaders hoped to keep the religious issues isolated from broader political discontent and avoided collaboration with political opponents of Diem seeking to use the Buddhist issue to bring down his government\". Diem's fight with the Buddhists lowered morale both within his government and his public support. The CIA feared that the Communists would exploit this in order to expand their influence in the community and made efforts to reduce Buddhist political involvement.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79-00927A004100030002-4.pdf</ref> An Quang Buddhists, led by [[Th\u00edch Tr\u00ed Quang|Tri Quang]], were contacted by the CIA.

The CIA felt that An Quang Buddhists may resume protests against the government because the new Prime Minister, [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u|Thieu-Ky]] was Catholic. The CIA wanted to keep the Buddhists out of conflict with the South Vietnamese during such a delicate time. Through December 1965, the CIA had given the An Quang Buddhists $12,500.  This endeavor was successful in keeping the Buddhists out of the political arena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/1-CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf|title=CIA and the Generals|last=Ahern Jr.|first=Thomas|date=February 19, 2009|website=gwu.edu|access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, the CIA began gathering intelligence on Sihanoukville, a port in Cambodia that the CIA believed had importance to the Viet Cong.

In that the VCI, as opposed to the main force VC/NVA combat forces, used terror against villagers, Phoenix can be considered a [[Counter-terrorism|counterterror]] program using some of the same methods as its opponents. The main targets of this program were taking out the hierarchy of officials, guerrilla leaders,and local organization. The idea behind it was if the villages fell, as well as social order, the North Vietnamese would have to give in to American wills.\n\nThe creation of the Phoenix Program came as a result of a decade-long negligence on the part of the United States to track the activities of the Communist Party's political and administrative structure.  From 1954\u20131964, the only intelligence offered by CIA efforts came in the form of a Hamlet Informant Program, which paid for information from untrained informants. Due to a lack in quality information, the CIA Station joined [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|MACV J-2]] and [[Operation Passage to Freedom|USOM's]] Public Safety Division in emphasizing a restructuring of intelligence. The Station wanted more centralization of intelligence, but US generals initially refused to offer a joint partnership in the efforts. As a result of this chasm in CIA and military intelligence efforts, the FBI broadened the National Interrogation Center for use by all security and intelligence operations. This change in strategy led to early successes, including the arrest of ninety-seven suspects identified under insurgent auspices, thanks in large part to information shared by police forces.<ref>Ahern Jr., Thomas L.

The CIA contribution began with Chief of Station and Deputy Chief of Station membership on Komer's Phoenix Committee. It included, as already noted, Evan Parker as program director, and its Executive Officer, Chief of Operations, an analyst, and two secretaries also came from the Station. For the most part, the Stations participation in Phoenix staffing entailed a second hat for an Agency officer already working against the VCI. As Phoenix Chief of Operations, for example, John Hart was assigned to Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) the chief of his Intelligence. Operations Division (lOD), which conducted joint operations with the Police Special Branch. The entire division adopted CORDS cover under the title.\n\nWhile Phoenix has often been called a CIA program, that is not entirely correct. It was under the direction of [[William Colby]], who had been Saigon Deputy CIA Station Chief, and then Station Chief, between 1959 and 1962. He returned to Vietnam in 1968, as deputy to [[Robert Komer]], the civilian head of the American efforts against the Communists, called CORDS. Shortly after arriving, Colby succeeded Komer as head of CORDS, which drew on a wide range of U.S. and South Vietnamese organizations, including the CIA station's Rural Development cadre.<ref name=andrade>{{citation\n | title = CORDS/Phoenix: Counterinsurgency Lessons from Vietnam for the Future\n | first1 =Dale | last1 = Andrade\n | first2 = James H. | last2 = Willbanks\n | journal = Military Review\n |date=March\u2013April 2006\n | url = http://usacac.army.mil/CAC/milreview/English/MarApr06/Andrade-Willbanks.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\nThere were many allegations of torture among The Phoenix Program. Such tactics included were: rape, gang rape, rape using eels, snakes, or hard objects, and rape followed by murder; electric shock ('the Bell Telephone Hour') rendered by attaching wires to the genitals or other sensitive parts of the body, like the tongue; the 'water treatment'; the 'airplane' in which the prisoner's arms were tied behind the back, and the rope looped over a hook on the ceiling, suspending the prisoner in midair, after which he or she was beaten; beatings with rubber hoses and whips; the use of police dogs to maul prisoners.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoxuDCMmlqoC|title=State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The North in the South|last=Blakeley|first=Ruth|date=2009-04-03|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780203876510|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Phoenix Program can be called a resounding failure. The South Vietnamese had a resounding lack of interest and investment in this part of the conflict. Many of those people who were captured and put into prison or who were executed were indeed not high ranking communists, but were instead average citizens. Numerous neighbors would turn in individuals who were their personal enemies or people who owed them money. American troops would commonly buy into these stories. Many of the victims of The Phoenix Program were indeed innocent.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ahern|first1=Thomas|title=CIA and the Generals: Covert Support to Military Government in South Vietnam|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/1-CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf|publisher=FOIA|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> By 1972, Phoenix operations were responsible for 81,740 Vietcong and 26,369 prisoners 'neutralized'.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVwUYSBwtKcC&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false |title = A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror|isbn = 9780805080414|last1 = McCoy|first1 = Alfred|last2 = McCoy|first2 = Professor Alfred W.|date = 2006-01-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Military action ===\nThe U.S. countered Viet Cong tactics through the use of prison camps, assassinations, and psychological warfare. The CIA planted sabotaged explosive Budweiser cans and poisoned cigarettes along the Ho Chi Minh trail, and The CIA extracted letters from communist bodies and used them as methods to gain intelligence.\n\n==Vietnam 1968==\n\n=== Operation Shock ===\nShortly after the Tet Offensive on February 2, a small group of CIA analysts who called themselves \"brethren,\" lead by George Carver, reacted to the attack by devising a plan they called, Operation Shock. The analysts were worried that the generals in the Vietnamese Government grew too comfortable with the American army helping them which lead to growing support for the Vietcong. Their plan was to have the Vice President Ky \"supervise a purge of all military and civilian officials guilty of corruption or other abuses.\" President Thieu would never have allowed the Vice President, who was his rival at the time, to lead a purging campaign, and as if knowing their plan would fail, the \"brethren\" included alternative solutions to turn the tide of the war including, forcing Thieu to resign and let a war hero come into office, temporarily stop bombardment of Northern Vietnam and initiate talks to try and negotiate surrender, or initiate talks with the National Liberation Front to possibly form a coalition government. The Director of Central Intelligence, Helms, silently handed off the plan to policymakers in Washinton, who then relayed the information to President Johnson. Johnson's response was to talk with the Vietcong, stop bombardments, and announced that he was withdrawing from re-election. Vice President Hubert Humphrey is said to have later thanked Carver for stating that he \"had a profound effect on the course of U.S. policy on Vietnam.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=CIA and the Generals: Covert Support to Military Government in South Vietnam|last=Ahern|first=Thomas L.|publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=73\u201375}}</ref>\n\nAn important part of the CIA's mission in Vietnam was to constantly monitor what was happening in North Vietnam in order to help the war effort. Since the conflict was part of the Cold War, concerns about aid from the communist powers of China and the USSR constantly remained a concern. One 1968 memorandum demonstrates what was discussed. In the document, titled \"Communist Aid to North Vietnam,\" the types of aid being provided by the Chinese and the Russians are described in detail, with sections on economic and military aid.<ref>{{cite web|title= Communist Aid to North Vietnam|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000483828.pdf|website=CIA Reading Room|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> On October 31, 1968 President Johnson announced a suspension of bombing attacks on the North Vietnam.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n==Vietnam 1969==\nIn November 1968 President Johnson had written something pertaining to the bombing of North Vietnam. Kissinger tried to convince the CIA to form a smart plan in order to take action on the military targets on North Vietnam.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">Undercover Armies.http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/6-UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf</ref> They responded to him by using Laotian guerrillas to go through different barracks and storage facilities located at Dien Bien Phu. Though most organizations figured that the costs would outweigh the benefits, Kissinger still convinced them to go through with it.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> In December 1969 Kissinger tried to get more strikes on \"lucrative targets\" in North Vietnam. On March 10 a pipeline located in North Vietnam by the Mu Gia Pass was wrecked. When the government in Cambodia changed the US became more concerned. On April 3 a second pipeline operation had failed but Headquarters encouraged them to keep trying\n\nOn April 25 they had tried again but soon had to stop when they came across a North Vietnamese bivouac.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\" /> On July 3, 1969,the CIA produced an assessment of their collection program pertaining to the North Vietnamese logistics network (Ho Chi Minh trail). The document was intended to be read by Henry Kissinger and detailed the current inventory of CIA collection activities and their corresponding recommendations.  Based on the document, the CIA was having difficulty identifying the total logistics  structure of North Vietnam (between Laos and Cambodia) and the quantities/frequency of the supplies being transported. It was noted that the supply route in Laos was more active than Cambodia. (Due to the terrain of Cambodia). Though the CIA collection program was predominantly supported by technical and human collection, the high level of hostility made human collection very difficult. The recommendation of the assessment listed the need for more road watchers (to supplement human collection) and more sensors, aerial reconnaissance  and wire taps for technical collection.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001300120016-4.pdf</ref>\n\nThe constant pressure placed on Thieu from the Station began to take its toll by the end of the 1960s. On May 25, 1969 President Thieu created another political organization called the National Social Democratic Front (NSDF) in attempts to rival the Communists.<ref name=\"Thomas 2009\">Ahern Jr., Thomas (February 19, 2009). \"CIA and the Generals\" (PDF). http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/. Retrieved March 1, 2017.</ref> Since the NSDF had a larger network than the Lien Minh, it quickly gained financial support from the U.S. However, despite all the resources that were being devoted to the organization, the NSDF failed to satisfy expectations and was largely considered to be a disappointment. Many politicians refused to work with a vexed associate of the organization named Houng. The National Salvation Front rejected the NSDF's consolidation request for this very reason. Moreover, the NSDF did not have any success with integrating its constituent parts. The CIA's experiment with the NSDF fizzled out and lasted about a year. Thieu did not want to turn pacification into a political task and would offer no supplemental ideology or program to replace Communism in Vietnam.<ref name=\"Thomas 2009\"/>\n\n===Mixed covert action and intelligence collection===\nKatrosh wanted Theiu and Ky to get along, so that \"there would finally be political cohesion in South Vietnam\",and ended up using the CIA as the main proponent to help make this happen. Eventually, Katrosh was successful in bringing the two together for the Lien Minh inauguration. Theiu did not want to be personally involved with the Lien Minh organizational activity. Bunker wanted Katrosh's help with pursuing him, so he was sending large sums of CIA money, in the amount of $400,000 to Katrosh.<ref>Thomas L.

Carver, Jr., the DCI\u2019s Special Assistant for Vietnamese Affairs. In a December 15 memorandum to Helms, Carver stated that Laird was anxious to remove all U.S. military personnel from the PRU program, as were [[MACV]] commanding general [[Creighton Abrams]] and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Laird admitted that his concerns were \"political,\" and he wanted to avoid a flap over the PRU in which U.S. military personnel would be associated. Carver explained that recent steps had been taken to tighten controls over the program, curtail the operational involvement of U.S. military personnel, and shift the emphasis to intelligence collection from ambush or \"elimination.\" Carver argued that the sudden removal of U.S. military personnel, who were already in the process of being gradually reduced, would be a mistake and would jeopardize the program. Laird agreed to reconsider his view.</blockquote>\n\nThe main report gives the level of US involvement, showing the Phoenix personnel were primarily South Vietnamese. <blockquote>The [[Provincial Reconnaissance Unit]] (PRU) Program in South Vietnam forms an investigative and paramilitary attack upon the covert communist apparatus in South Vietnam. PRU teams, currently totalling approximately 4,200 men, operate in 44 provinces of South Vietnam. PRU are based in their home areas and operate in teams of 15\u201320 men. They are presently advised and supported by 101 US military advisors and seven CIA personnel. CIA funds the PRU and retains overall administrative control of the project for the U.S. Government.</blockquote>\n\nReasons against continued CIA involvement included a concern, much like that raised during the Korean War, about diverting CIA from its national-level to a tactical role:\n:#Continued U.S. support of the PRU program risks adverse publicity either through an untoward incident, a press campaign to publicize its efforts or complaints from accommodation-minded South Vietnamese officials or politicians.\n:#CIA will have to continue its support to a program which lies, at least in part, outside its usual intelligence mission.<ref name=303-1969-12-11 />\n\n'''Vietnam 1969\u20131972'''\nCIA's pacification programs in Vietnam deteriorated because the Vietnamese chose to not invest in them.<ref>Thomas L.

Supporters say that it was a legal and closely controlled U.S.\u2013Vietnamese intelligence program aimed at destroying the Vietcong infrastructure, while the critics say that it was an illegal system of arresting, torturing and murdering innocent Vietnamese civilians...<ref name=MACVdir381-41>{{citation\n | url = http://www.psywarrior.com/VietnamOBPSYOP\n | title = The Phoenix Program\n | first1 = Herbert A. | last1 = Friedman\n}}</ref>\n\n\"Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) Directive 381-41, dated 9 July 1967, inaugurated the Intelligence Coordination and Exploitation (ICEX) program to Attack the Vietcong Infrastructure (VCI). In late 1967, MACV replaced the name \"ICEX\" with \"Phoenix,\" after a mythical bird that appeared as a sign of prosperity and luck and a near translation of the South Vietnamese name for the program, \"Phung Hoang\" (\"All-seeing bird\").\"\n\nAs early as 1964, General [[William C. Westmoreland]], commander of [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) \"knew that he lacked the forces to wage both a war of attrition and one of pacification, so he chose the former. The argument over whether or not this was the right course of action will likely go on forever, but undoubtedly the shape of the war changed dramatically after the [[Tet Offensive]]. The enemy was badly mauled and, despite the political gains made, militarily lost the initiative for quite some time.\"<ref name=\"andrade\"/>\n\nWhen the VC regrouped after the Tet Offensive, \"Westmoreland never had such an advantage. When American ground forces entered the war in 1965, they faced an enemy on the offensive, but in June 1968 the new MACV commander, General [[Creighton W. Abrams]], confronted an enemy on the ropes. Abrams plainly recognized his advantage and implemented a clear-and-hold strategy aimed at moving into rural enclaves formerly dominated by the VC.\"\n\nMuch criticized for lack of precision, the Phoenix Program was described by a former official as a \"sterile depersonalized murder program...I never knew an individual to be detained as a VC suspect who ever lived through an interrogation\" Also many of the people captured under the Phoenix program can be seen as innocent. Many of the thousands of victims were given to the Americans cause of petty disputes among neighbors and for personal gain. Phoenix also had little chance for success because the Vietcong had the operation filled with their double agents from the beginning.<ref name = \"bart\">{{cite web\n |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jksonc/docs/phoenix-hcgo-19710802.html#kbo\n |title=Committee on Government Operations House of Representatives \u2013 U.S. Assistance Programs in Vietnam \u2013 Statement of K.

They came in all shapes and sizes and in varying degrees of sophistication, but they had a huge impact on the morale of American troops. These traps were not meant to kill, but instead maim and injure because it instilled more fear in the enemy soldiers, and because it took 4\u20135 men to care for 1 injured soldier, when a dead soldier would be less of a strain on resources. The Vietcong also used tunnels to their advantage. They could sneak out of their hiding spaces and take out a few American soldiers at a time. This increased the fear of the enemy because attacks could happen at any time and anywhere<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA and the Vietnam War Declassified Part 5|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb05Gq_8MHQ|website=Youtube|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Operation Wandering Soul ===\n\nAnother psychological warfare tactic utilized by the CIA was Operation Wandering Soul. This preyed on the superstitions of the Vietnamese. It was believed that if one died away from one's family and was not buried with their ancestors, then they would be forced to wander forever; their souls in pain. The U.S. recorded tapes of South Vietnamese actors wailing, searching for their loved ones and imploring the Viet Cong to \"desert the army to save your soul.\" These tapes were broadcast by GIs walking about with speakers or by overhead choppers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tri Tong hop|first1=Kenh Giai|title=CIA and the Vietnam War Declassified Part 6|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE2s7FlbAQ0|website=Youtube|accessdate=2016-06-24}}</ref>\n\nAnother broadcast used at Nui Ba Den Mountain in 1970 used an actual recording of a tiger from a zoo in Bangkok. A rumor was spread of a tiger attacking the Viet Cong to supplement the playing of the recording. Allegedly, this acted as a catalyst for 150 Viet Cong leaving their positions.

The end goal of this was to strengthen the military of South Vietnam. An expanded program of irregular operations in the eastern Panhandle was more productive. There was a lot of pressure for Nixon to withdraw from Indochina on the home front. Johnson's bombing of North Vietnam in 1968 really got backlash from the citizens back in America. There were a lot of protests all over the United States because of this. Even though the war was ending in Vietnam, protestors in the United States were still going crazy as the troops were returning from the battlefield.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ahern |first1=Thomas |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/6-UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf}}</ref> During the Nixon Presidency, domestic pressure to withdrawal from Indochina exponentially increased.

On 22 February 1970, the Commando Raider operations began and set ablaze administrative and storage buildings in Dien Bien Phu, and sabotaged a pipeline near Mu Gia Pass. The success of these operations enticed the CIA station in Vientiane to adopt them as a staple of its agenda. The change of government's Cambodia in March 1970 signaled an opportunity to expand the Commando Raider operations. The CIA gathered more intelligence pertaining to the specifics of troop movements and the location of NVA supplies. Raids to destroy these supplies became common. The CIA focused on the complete interdiction of the trail system that extended through Laos and Cambodia. While many of these raids were successful, it was a futile operation. The \u201cmeans [were] inadequate to the end.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/6-UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf|title=Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos|last=|first=|date=August 26, 2009|website=The National Security Archive|page=351|access-date=}}</ref> The CIA spent a great amount of resources and energy into preparing these raids, collecting intelligence, and carrying out attempts to further undermine the enemy now defeating them.

Furthermore, the ultimate failure of CIA covert action reflected a recurring trend in the Agency's history\u2014no matter the amount of intelligence collected, resources amassed, or strategies implemented, the Agency still failed to understand its enemy. Although the CIA had some success in anticipating the North Vietnamese offensive of 1972, the agency's last station chief in South Vietnam argued that \"the illusion that the war is over and we have won is shattered.\" <ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nEven as late as 1971, the United States worried about resistance in the region along with the want of at least one American ambassador in order to allow for a Thieu victory in the region. Not only this, but there were attempts by the U.S. in order to garner Catholic support for Thieu in the country in order to set up footing among Chinese nationals and other groups. However, the senatorial election of 1970 caused American interest in the political machinations of South Vietnam at least to subside, even if they were interested as late as 1971.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ahern, Jr.|first1=Thomas L.|title=CIA and the Generals: Covert Support in South Vietnam|url= http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/1-CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf |website=National Security Archive|accessdate=10 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nA series of accusations in the early 1970s that the CIA was complicit in drug trafficking in Laos was a contributing factor in the public's opposition to U.S. activities in Southeast Asia. Neither the CIA nor any of its officers were accused of direct activity in the narcotics operations. It is likely that the agency did not focus much energy on the trafficking by indigenous allies until a heroin epidemic broke out among U.S. troops in South Vietnam. There was nothing preventing the hill tribes in northern Laos from producing and selling opium until 1971, as the trade was an economic benefactor to the tribes, but under U.S. pressure, the Laotian government made it illegal. These activities predate the war on drugs in the United States and there was not even a reporting requirement in place until after Nixon's war on drugs had been declared.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Undercover Armies|last=Ahern, Jr.|first=Thomas L.|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=535\u2013537}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, The U.S. signed an agreement put forth by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (during Nixon's administration) that stated that the U.S. must cease fire immediately throughout Vietnam and that there should be no more U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. Also, there should also be a return of all captured personnel of the parties, and most importantly the U.S. must agree on South Vietnam's right to self determine their own government.\n\nOn March 12 of 1975 an anti-aircraft missile from North Vietnam struck an Air Vietnam DC-4 that was en route from Ventiane to Saigon, shortly after the aircraft communicated for the last time over a reporting point (PE9 on the G67 airway) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19750312-0|title=Accident Report of downed Douglas C-54D-5-DC (DC-4) of Air Vietnam on 12 March 1975}}</ref> near Pleiku. The ARVN had fallen apart partially due to the North Vietnamese offensive, but it was not the sole reason. Since the North Vietnamese had been attacking everything, including B-52s and naval vessels, they had grown stronger and the South appeared to get weaker.

Further, the CIA provided suggestions for political platforms, supported candidates, used agency resources to refute electoral fraud charges, and manipulated the certification of election results by the South Vietnamese National Assembly. Ethnic minorities who allied with the anti-communist Vietnamese and the U.S. CIA included the Montagnards, Hmong, and Khmer.<ref name=\":1\" /> There are 174 National Intelligence Estimates dealing with Vietnam, issued by the CIA after coordination with the intelligence community of the [[US government]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dni.gov/nic/foia_vietnam_content.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306110446/http://www.dni.gov/nic/foia_vietnam_content.html |archive-date=2008-03-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Vietnam 1945\u20131947==\nPrior to [[World War II]], Vietnam had been part of a larger French colony named Indochina. During the war, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conquered Vietnam and remained there until 1945, when the [[Axis powers]] were defeated. The Japanese were removed from Vietnam with the help of revolutionary leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] and his Vietminh forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA and the Vietnam War Declassified part 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WedksPgYC8o|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> Following the war, France intended to retake the Indochina region and reassert its former dominance. Much of this can be traced back to a desire to restore French glory and national pride after the humiliation the nation suffered during the course of World War II. The French also wished to reclaim the Indochina region to regain control over the vast rubber plantations across the country.\n\nThe people of Vietnam were completely against the return of the French. The Vietnamese experienced a lot of abuses by the French during their colonization in the mid 19th century. The people of [[North Vietnam]] rallied around their recently returned revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh and looked to him to gain at long last, their independence.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA and the Vietnam War Declassified part 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WedksPgYC8o|website=Youtube|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe French spent nine years (1946\u201354) attempting to regain control of Vietnam. France did not realize that the current Vietnamese were much stronger than those that they were familiar with.  They greatly underestimated the strength and capability of the Vietnamese force.  Viet Minh or Vietcong as they came to be called, were not going to let the French take control of their region without a fight.  The men of the Vietcong were communists and did not want to surrender their beliefs to the French. Together with the North Vietnamese army, they would defend their land.  The Vietnamese used military and political tactics to push and expel the French from their lands. Northern Vietnamese troops were prepared to fight the French to the bitter end in order to ensure victory and their freedom. The loss of thousands of French men made it easy for North Vietnam and the Vietcong to win the war.  France lost a lot of their supporters of the war after many of their men were killed.  It was also beneficial to the North Vietnamese efforts when they began to receive outside assistance.  The Soviet Union sent them military hardware that they used in combat against the French.  After suffering a major defeat at the French's jungle fortress of Dein Bein Phu on May 7, 1954, the French military influence in Asia came to an end.  Weapons given to the Vietnamese army played a key role in the defeat of France.\n\nEven before the [[CIA]] was formed, a team from the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], and its successors that would later become the CIA, under Major [[Archimedes Patti]], was in [[French Indochina]], assessing the situation, and discussing alternatives with parties on all sides, including [[Ho Chi Minh]].<ref name=Patti>{{Citation|title=Why Viet Nam?: Prelude to America's albatross|author=Patti, Archimedes L. A|publisher=University of California Press|year=1980|isbn=0520041569}}</ref>\n\n== Vietnam 1950\u20131954 ==\n\nCIA officers moved to French Indochina in 1950 as a part of the legation of the United States in the city of Saigon. After their arrival, CIA involvement expanded to a new large base in Hanoi. The CIA's activities in Vietnam did not grow any further due to the French discouraging CIA activity (the French were still clinging to the idea that they could one day still dominate Vietnam and the US was against this course of action).<ref>Bernstein, Marc D. \"Ed Lansdale's Black Warfare in 1950s Vietnam.\" HistoryNet. World History Group, 26 Apr. 2016. Web. 08 May 2017.</ref>\n\nCIA involvement in Vietnam was discouraged by the French because it was found that the CIA would often reach past them to open channels to Vietnamese nationalists. CIA activity expansion occurred when the Indochina region became three separate states, and grew exponentially during the French War in 1953 to 1954 when France was essentially forced to accept American assistance with unconventional warfare activities.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\" />\n\nDespite this resilience by the French, CIA intelligence perceived a deteriorating situation in Vietnam. A 1950 CIA intelligence report noted that the threat of Communism in Indochina was rising as rebel attacks on French outposts continued and highlighted the weaknesses of the French. An intelligence report on Indochinese Military Developments revealed how vulnerable the French military was due to the fall of the French border holding at Dongkhe, as well as, some attacks they had suffered at Tonkin. The report doubted France's ability to hold Indochina much longer if the Viet Minh continued to attack.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA Indochinese Military Developments|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-01617A002400090001-5.pdf}}</ref> They feared that \"if these attacks [were to] develop into a coordinated, a large-scale Viet Minh offensive, an action which [might] soon be within Viet Minh capabilities, French maintenance of control over Indochina \u2013 by means of their own forces alone \u2013 [would] be seriously threatened.\" This document also noted French hesitancy to bolster the Vietnamese Army, \"apparently fearing that such a step would weaken their ability to contain Vietnamese nationalism.\"<ref>\"Indochinese Military Developments\" https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-01617A002400090001-5.pdf</ref>\n\nThe US intelligence community notes how cautious the French were in arming a Vietnamese army. The report continues to claim, \"French reluctance to expand or strengthen the Vietnam Army is indicated by insistence on allocation and distribution of US military aid under French control, failure to make plans for necessary financing, inability of French officials to agree on a course of action or policy, and refusal to expand the local militia.\" Additionally the French officially refused to accept help from the US in the form of training Vietnamese troops from US military instructors. There is a suggestion at the end of the reports that proposed the French would need to accept American aid to train the Vietnamese army and to supply them if they wanted to change their policy of arming the Vietnamese.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indochinese Military Developments|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-01617A002400090001-5.pdf|website=CIA}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1953\u20131954, the involvement of the CIA had increased when the French finally accepted US assistance with the unconventional (guerrilla) warfare tactics they faced, as the French were facing large and costly losses at the hands of what would become the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese resistance forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA and the Vietnam War Declassified Part 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C80MD08QBkY|website=Youtube|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> The primary aid initially offered by the US was military aid in supplying military hardware and training of the Vietnamese army; the scope of US aid to the French was then greatly expanded following the Eisenhower administration.

There was also a unilateral covert action which was suspended in 1953 under State Department pressure. This was due to the French exposing paramilitary operations against the Vietminh in Hanoi that the agency did not previously clear with them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/2-CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdf</ref>\n\nThe CIA's mission in Saigon was to directly assess the nationalist politicians.<ref>Thomas L. Ahern, Jr., CIA and the Generals: Covert Support to Military Government in South Vietnam, Center for the Study of Intelligence, October 1998, 243 pp</ref> The primary cause and motivation behind the intervention of the US and CIA through 1954 was to gather intelligence, and provide interpretations of the events that occurred in Indochina through an American perspective. Outside of North Vietnam, the agency's broad span of activities reached into almost every aspect of the Indochina war. The agency conducted several paramilitary programs and conducted a full-scale war in [[Laos]] and [[South Vietnam]].<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\" />\n\n==Vietnam 1954==\nIn 1954, the CIA would remain consistent in its activities in Vietnam. The CIA's expansion included various stations throughout Vietnam and Laos. A station was also located in Cambodia, but relations were broken in 1963 and reinstated during the 1970s.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\" /> The CIA stations, though initially used solely for gathering intelligence and providing interpretations of events in Indochina, came to gain as much importance as the US embassy in its scale of political relations with the South Vietnamese government due to its broad range of activities. The CIA stations in Vietnam were also responsible for conducting a full-scale war in Laos at that time in addition to South Vietnam paramilitary operations.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\" />\n\nAnother key event that occurred in 1954 was the creation of the Geneva Accords. Signed by France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and three Associated States of Indochina including Ho Chi Minh's Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Accords addressed the issue of what to do with Vietnam since the Viet Minh had destroyed colonial rule. Although the United States had agreed to respect the Accords, it would not sign them because the US government disagreed with the provision that split Vietnam at the 17th parallel.<ref name=\"History 2017\">\"Geneva Conference begins.\" History.com. A&E Television Networks, n.d. Web. 08 May 2017.</ref> These Accords would come to play a major role in the United States' decision to interfere with the situation in Vietnam. The US government had provided the French with logistical support in their mission to defeat the Viet Minh, however it was only a matter of time before the French needed military support as well. Essentially, the Geneva Accords forced the United States to decide if they were willing to provide such assistance. As historian Thomas L. Abern Jr stated, \"In the end, the importance of halting Communism overshadowed the risks, and the United States embarked on its 21-year effort to create in South Vietnam a permanent barrier to Communist expansion in Southeast Asia.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=CIA and the House of NGO: Covert Action in South Vietnam 1954\u20131963 (U)|last=Ahern, Jr.|first=Thomas L.|publisher=|year=June 2000|isbn=|location=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/2-CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdfiipages=231-232}}</ref>\n\n===Covert action===\nThe initial CIA team in Saigon was the Saigon Military Mission, headed by  [[United States Air Force]] Colonel [[Edward Lansdale]], who arrived on June 1, 1954. His diplomatic cover job was Assistant Air Attach\u00e9. The broad mission for the team was to undertake paramilitary operations against the enemy and to train the South Vietnamese in the arts of [[psychological warfare]], just like Landsdale had done in an earlier conflict in the Philippines. Although, Lansdale worked for the OSS briefly in  World War II, he was never a CIA employee.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=PPv1D95>{{citation\n | title = Document 95, Lansdale Team's Report on Covert Saigon Mission in 1954 and 1955\n | work = The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Volume 1\n | pages = 573\u201383\n | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/doc95.htm\n}}</ref>\n\nWorking in close cooperation with the [[U.S. Information Agency]], a new psychological warfare campaign was devised for the Vietnamese Army and for the government in Hanoi. Shortly after, a refresher course in combat psy-war was constructed. \n\nOne such example of psychological warfare dealt directly with misinformation. Lansdale would later recall the event in his memoirs. \"The first idea was used just before the French quit the city of Hanoi and turned over control to the [[Viet Minh|Vietminh]]. At the time, the Communist apparatus inside the city was busy with secret plans to ready the population to welcome the entry of Vietminh troops. I suggested that my nationalist friends issue a fake Community manifesto, ordering everyone in the city except essential hospital employees to be out on the streets not just for a few hours of welcome but for a week-long celebration. In actuality this would mean a seven-day work stoppage. Transportation, electric power, and communication services would be suspended. The simple enlargement of plans already afoot should give the communists an unexpectedly vexing problem as they started their rule.\"<ref name=\"Lansdale, Edward Geary 1972 p.225\">''Lansdale, Edward Geary.'' ''(1972). In the Midst of Wars: An American's Mission to Southeast Asia.'' New York: Harper and Row. p. 225.</ref> The celebration did not last a week. The Communists thought that this manifesto was French [[counterpropaganda]] and attempted to order everyone back to work, which took three days.<ref name=\"Lansdale, Edward Geary 1972 p.225\"/>\n\nThe second SMM member, Major Lucien Conein, arrived on July 1.  A paramilitary specialist, well known to the French for his help with French-operated maquis in Tonkin against the Japanese in 1945, he was the one American guerrilla fighter who had not been a member of the Patti Mission. In August, he went to Hanoi with the assignment of developing a paramilitary organization in the north.... A second paramilitary team for the south was formed, with Army LT Edward Williams doing double duty as the only experienced counter-espionage officer, working with revolutionary political groups.<ref name=\"History 2017\"/>\n\n===Intelligence analysis===\nWorking with available data, the CIA produced a [[National Intelligence Estimate]] in August 1954. It began by stating that the Communist signing of the Geneva agreements had legitimized them, and they would need to immediately move to control the North while planning for long-term control of the country.\n\nThis National Intelligence Estimate went on to suggest that while the Diem government was in official control of the South (though remained unpopular because of a disconnect of the government from the people), certain pro-French elements may have been planning to overthrow it. CIA experts also noted that Diem would have political problems on top of already sinking popularity.[[Viet Minh|Vietminh]] elements would remain in the South and create an underground resistance force, discredit the government, and undermine French-Vietnamese relations.<ref name=\"NIE 63-5-54\">NIE 63-5-54</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 1954, Lansdale lured two key personnel in a planned coup against South Vietnamese President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] out of the country. Lansdale invited Hinh and staff to visit the Philippines.\n\nUS personnel dealing with the Government of Vietnam had difficulties understanding their politics. This can be attributed to the fact that the CIA did not make a concerted effort to gain a better understanding of the history and culture of Vietnam. The CIA instead focused on the military forces occupying the territory instead of the political and economic forces that motivated them.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ahern|first1=Thomas|title=CIA and Rural Pacification in South Vietnam|journal=FOIA|date=August 2001|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/3-CIA_AND_RURAL_PACIFICATION.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> The diplomats were not getting clear information in 1954 and early 1955, but the CIA station \"had ... no mandate or mission to perform systematic intelligence and espionage in friendly countries, and so lacks the resources to gather and evaluate the large amounts of information required on political forces, corruption, connections, and so on.\"<ref name=\"PPv1D95\"/>\n\nIn Thomas Ahern's monograph, he stops short of any admission that the agency was an actor in the coup that overthrew Saigon leader Ngo Dinh Diem. Within the monograph it is noted that on the morning of the coup the US military command in South Vietnam advised the CIA that Saigon was quiet, and that the CIA should stop reporting a coup was imminent or in-progress.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The CIA also reportedly recognized that Diem would have political problems as early as August 1954. It is reported that policy surrounding Diem was set with this in mind. Relations with Diem's brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, began as early as 1952, also signaling that the CIA predicted political problems with Diem. Despite having the benefit of expert warnings, it is clear that the CIA acted beyond the scope of it experts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Vietnam 1955==\nBy 31 January 1955, a paramilitary group had cached its supplies in Haiphong, having had them shipped by [[Civil Air Transport]], a CIA proprietary airline belonging to the Directorate of Support.\n\nNgo Dinh Diem and Ngo Dinh Nhu had been exploited by the help of CIA advisors to help defeat one of the challenges to the new Prime Minister's authority.\n\nLansdale and the South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dienh Diem had been working together, however they did not agree on the government system they wanted in South Vietnam. In August 1955, Lansdale brought Juan Orendain, a Filipino constitutional scholar, to Saigon in order to sway Diem in a direction similar to the American system. Lansdale was hoping he could have the same effect on Diem as he had previously when working with [[Magsaysay]] in the Philippines.  Part of this meant proposing a legislature and a judicial system to signal that Diem was open to checks and balances, and was not trying to be beyond reproach in his position.  By April 1956 Diem had considered and rejected the model proposed by Orendain, and was more concerned about the broad authority he needed that very moment.  All the while Lansdale had little to no real oversight from the rest of the CIA as these actions were taking place.  Though he took advantage of this autonomy to improvise, it also meant he had little to no backup to enforce or further persuade Diem into a governmental separation of powers.<ref>http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/2-CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdf pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nDuring one encounter in early 1955, Diem rejected US ambassadorial representative [[J. Lawton Collins]]'s nominee for commander of the Vietnamese Army. Collins wanted competence, whereas Diem preferred someone loyal.\n\nOn April 27, 1955 the Battle of Saigon had begun.  The private crime syndicate Binh Xuyen and the Vietnamese National Army would wage conflict for around a month in Cholon.  The Binh Xuyen had been influential (as a powerful Saigon gang) in post-colonial Vietnam, and had even stolen arms and fought the French, however they were defeated quickly.<ref>Letwin, Brian. \"Gangsters of Old Saigon: Binh Xuyen.\" Saigoneer. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 May 2017.\n</ref>  Diem had issued the Binh Xuyen an ultimatum to come under control or be eliminated. The damage caused by the fighting resulted in around a thousand casualties, and tens of thousands more homeless.\n\nIn January 1956 Diem promulgated Ordinance 6, which authorized detention and reeducation for anyone considered a danger to the state. This led to a problem of overcrowding as there were already 20,000 communists that had been placed in detention camps since 1954.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/3-CIA_AND_RURAL_PACIFICATION.pdf</ref> Landsdale claimed that there was 7,000 political detainees in Saigon's Chi Hoa prison alone.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nOperation Brotherhood, created by Ramon Magsaysay in the Philippines, had its first medical team beginning in late 1954. By 1955, it had more than 100 doctors and nurses at 10 medical center locations in South Vietnam to treat refugees and to train Vietnamese medical personnel. The second pacification operation was launched late April 1955 in the southern Dinh Dinh and northern Phu Yen portion of [[Central Vietnam]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Vietnam 1959 ==\nNorthern Vietnamese troops needed a way to link themselves with their allies in Southern Vietnam. The Viet Cong and Northern Vietnamese soldiers were able to supply troops and military operations through secret tunnels and the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]].  The Ho Chi Minh trail was an interlocking trail system that was created through the borders of Laos and Cambodia that reach from North Vietnam to South Vietnam. During the construction of this trail, native guides had to be used to guide the Northern Vietnamese troops through the wild countryside. Campsites that were built along the side of the trail grew into way points for troops to gather and rest. The trail stretched 800 miles and could take up to three months to travel by foot.<ref>The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. \"Ho Chi Minh Trail.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Guides were needed for groups to navigate the dangerous trail.  Snakes and spiders would flood the clothing of travelers along with dangerous terrain.  For these reasons, travelers needed to practice great precaution along the way.  The trail quickly became on of the secret forces of the war.  Once United States officials gathered intelligence about the trail, they quickly installed motion censors across the trail to catch insurgents.<ref name=\":0\" /> The complexity of the trail grew further during the 1960s.\n\nDetecting Viet Cong movements on the Ho Chi Minh trail was exceedingly difficult. The trail was a complex collection of interconnecting footpaths. The flexibility afforded by its complexity meant multiple routes could be traversed from north to south. As such, it was easy to shift to a different route if the security of one area was compromised. Furthermore, the length of the trail and the small number of persons using it on any given segment, coupled with its flexible nature made detection all but impossible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79S00427A000500040044-3.pdf|title=THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref>\n\nIn attempts to combat troop and supply movement along the trail, the CIA and US military set up heat and movement sensors along the trail to track enemy movement. US forces also attempted to use air dropped listening devices to track enemy troops and pinpoint Viet Cong movements.\n\n1959 also saw the arrival of William Colby in the region, and it became increasingly noticeable throughout 1959 that Diem was becoming paranoid regarding security issues and the military.

Instead, he called upon the CIA to use its \"tribal forces\" in Laos and to \"make every possible effort to launch guerrilla operations in North Vietnam with its Asian recruits.\" Hence, under this code name, General [[Vang Pao]], who served the royal Lao family was recruited. He then recruited and trained his Hmong soldiers to ally with the CIA and fight against the communist North.\n\n==Vietnam 1961==\nIn April 1961,  Lansdale, who had been designated the Operations Officer for an interagency Task Force in charge of political, military, economic, psychological, and covert character, was to go to Vietnam. Changes of policy in Washington however, transferred these responsibilities to the military and diplomats, and Lansdale was no longer involved with Vietnam.\n\nOn May 11, 1961, President Kennedy gave the authorization to begin \"a program for covert actions to be carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency which would precede and remain in force after any commitment of US forces to South Vietnam.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Kennedy was giving the CIA the job of preparing for the eventual landing of US troops. Later that year, in October 1961 the Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles approved a massive counterinsurgency program with the goal of launching a \"village defense program in the lightly populated but strategically important Central Highlands.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The involvement of the CIA rose substantially when they were given the task of supporting \"irregular formations\" that did not fall under other agencies\u2019 jurisdictions, which include civil wars, guerrilla wars, and rebellions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> They were given this job because of an interagency task force recommendation in January 1962. Later that year in May 1962, Defense Secretary McNamara promised the Far East Division chief Desmond FitzGerald \"a blank check\u2026in terms of men, money, and material.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This illustrates the important mission given to the CIA by the Department of Defense and the White House.\n\nCIA begins to sponsor and train the [[Civilian Irregular Defense Group]]s (CIDG) in the South Central Highlands.  These were local defense operations with a mobile support component, \"Mike Force\", made up primarily of [[Nung people|Nung]] mercenaries. Most CIDG units eventually became Vietnamese Rangers. These forces were intended to help combat the guerrilla tactics of the Vietcong.The CIDG grew out of a Military Operations Section (MOS) program led by Gilbert Layton. Layton's priority was strengthening the intelligence network in the country, specifically in the border regions with Cambodia and Laos.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Layton sought to find locals that could gather intelligence on Viet Cong installations in the area.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> He proposed a program \"designed to recruit as many as 1,000 tribesmen to operate in the guerrilla-infested high plateau areas bordering on northern Cambodia and South Laos.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> His proposal for a crop station and seed distribution was approved but it suffered many delays and problems.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> CIA Deputy Chief William Colby expanded the intelligence gathering operation into a defense building operation known as the \"Montagnard defense program.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn 1961, the CIA also strengthened contact with then-captain in the Royal Laotian Armed Forces, Vang Pao.<ref>Ahern, Thomas L., Jr. Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos.

First donations of food, blankets, and then by January 24, 1961 300 Hmong received weapons to Vang Pao's troops, the CIA sent men to train Hmong fighters in guerrilla tactics, eventually engaging soon-to-be-General Pao's approximately 10,000 men.<ref>Ahern, Thomas L., Jr. Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos.

Kennedy had organized a meeting with Eisenhower, who was on his way out of the Oval Office, to discuss the strategic importance of Laos. They discussed \"keeping the 'cork in the bottle'...to prevent communist dominion over most of the Far East.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos, 1961\u20131973|last=Ahern|first=Thomas L.|publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=xv}}</ref> Eisenhower saw Laos as so important, that he was worried about all of Thailand, Cambodia, and South Vietnam falling to communism if Laos went that way. The president was concerned that the Royal Laotian Army (RLA) was impotent and mutinous, and did not want to rely on them. He was so concerned, that in this meeting, he said he would \"as a last desperate hope...intervene unilaterally,\" if it were up to him.<ref name=\":2\" /> The interventions, as mentioned in the paragraph above, ended up being the arming and training of paramilitary forces. While preventing a communist Laos remained the objective of the CIA for the next 14 years, the focus of their paramilitary operations changed over time. Until 1964, the Hmong fighters in Laos focused on trying to fight back North Vietnamese fighters and on preventing further encroachment. They were highly important, because the US hadn't begun putting troops on the ground in any great numbers, yet. After that, in 1965, the report describes the Hmong activities in Laos as \"flitt[ing] over mountain trails or mov[ing] by air to occupy key high ground and to harass Hanoi's tanks and artillery,\"<ref name=\":2\" /> meaning that US troops took on a frontline role and asked the paramilitary forces to operate in more difficult terrain and in less standard ways.\n\n'''The Buon Enao Project'''\n\nBuon Enao was a Rhad\u00e9 village that was the location of a CIA experimental program designed to strengthen defenses against the Viet Cong.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> The CIA brought several proposals to the village elders, and almost all were met with protest or skepticism. After satisfying all of their concerns, the Americans were able to build a perimeter border fence as well as dispensary. They also armed the villages and trained them how to shoot. They were named the CIDG so that they did not give the appearance of a \"covert offensive military unity.\" Buon Enao was the \"first CIDG Area Development Center, which controlled social and economic development services as well as the village defense system in the surrounding area.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n=== Tony Po (Anthony Poshepny) ===\nTony Po was recruited into the CIA after he graduated from San Jose State University and finished his training in 1953. Po worked with the Hmong starting in March 1961. He was then transferred to Long Tieng. In Long Tieng Po ran field missions with the Hmong partisans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/the-biography-of-tony-po-aka-anthony-poshepny/|title=The biography of Tony Po|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> After he took an enemy round in the stomach in January 1965, and one-too-many confrontations with Vang Pao, Poshepny was transferred up-country, to the land of Yao tribesmen.

In order to fulfill this operation, the CIA hired \u201c18 South Vietnamese who had been trained in underwater demolition\u201d to target the port of [[Qu\u1ea3ng Kh\u00ea|Queng Khe]]. which \u201cwas home to several of the DRV's [[Shantou-class gunboat|Swatow-class]] gunboats\u201d.<ref name=\":3\" /> \u00a0In June 1962, the demolition crew, called the \u201cfrogmen\u201d were driven by the ''Nautilus III'' within swimming distance of the North Vietnamese port.

However, \u201chow many of them detonated remained unclear, for one of them went off prematurely, with the swimmer already spotted and trying to escape\u201d.<ref name=\":3\" /> The ''Nautilus III'' was chased down by a Swatow at which point the Swatow collided with the ''Nautilus III'', and all crew, except one, were captured by the North Vietnamese.

The agreement went into place in October 1962. Later the CIA grew afraid that they might demoralize their liaison partners so they did not disclose information pertaining to the policy basis that halted some operations. TARZAN was developed in order to monitor the North Vietnamese road traffic and then the findings would be taken back to the CIA. They were a sabotage team that was released near Route 2. On December 30 a sabotage team that was sponsored by SEPES was called LYRE. This was a part of the 9 teams developed that often did not go into full effect.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/5-THE_WAY_WE_DO_THINGS.pdf|title=The Way We Do Things|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIt wasn't until November 1, 1963 when the rebels killed Col. Le Quang Tung, whom was Diem's right-hand man, as leverage to get Diem and Nhu to surrender. However, both Diem and Nhu managed to escape through a secret cordon within the presidential palace to a refuge at a catholic church within the Chinese quarter. General Duong Van Minh found this refuge and shot both Diem and Nhu, despite American appeals.\n\nAt this time, the Americans and the generals gave little focus to the next regime that was to follow after the coup. Diem was considered a failure as a leader, but relationships with the generals was secured for mutual desire to eliminate the Communist threat with more American involvement.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ahern|first1=Thomas|date=19 Feb 2009|title=CIA and the Generals|pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n==Vietnam 1963==\n\nThe US supported Diem in hopes to create a nation that was south of the demilitarized zone at the 17th parallel.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">CIA and the Generals.http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/1-CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf</ref>  In August 1963 South Vietnamese military officers initially planned to obtain support from the U.S. for their coup against Ngo Dinh Diem.  State Department official Roger Hilsman originated a cable giving the South Vietnamese generals the green light for a coup against Diem and in October 1963 final plans were made for the coup that was carried out.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> On November 1, 1963 the House of Ngo ended when generals working for President Diem surrounded the Palace.

After a bombardment of artillery fire to intimidate Diem, Minh ordered an assault on the palace.  The next morning Diem finally called the JGC Headquarters promising to surrender if he had safe passage out of the country.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Americans had ordered that the Diem and Nhu were kept safe but an officer of Minh had placed them into an armored vehicle and shot them to death. The Americans began to focus on fixing the makeup of the coup rather than the policy of the successor's government after they had realized how bad Diem was as a leader.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>  The CIA paid $42,000 in immediate support money to the plotters the morning the coup, given by Lucien Connie an act of prefigured in administration planning.<ref name=\"Evans\"/>\n\nOn July 8, 1963, A CIA officer was told by Major General Tran Van Don(South Vietnam's army commander) that there were plans by the military to overthrow President Diem.<ref>http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB101/vn01.pdf</ref>\n\nIn November 1963, the CIA, or \"the Station\", was relied upon by Vietnamese generals, who had [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|recently staged a coup]], to aid in the set up of a new regime.  The Station was coming out of a US Mission moratorium on contacts with the new leadership imposed by Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge.  A White House tape of President Kennedy and his advisers confirms that top U.S. officials sought the November 1, 1963 coup against South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem without apparently considering the consequences for Diem personally.<ref name=\"Evans\" /> With support of the coup coming from the U.S. it would have the potential of making us responsible for the outcome in South Vietnam.\n\n==Vietnam 1964==\n[[File:Phoenix Program.jpg|thumb|Badge of members of the [[Phoenix Program]]]]\n\n===Intelligence analysis===\nA Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) issued in May theorized that a short but intense air and naval campaign against the DRV would deter an invasion of the South, although not stop activities there. It also estimated that this would be a strong morale boost to the RVN.<ref name=SNIE50-2-64>SNIE50-2-64</ref> The campaign described, however, was different than the actual gradual attacks that resulted from the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] incident in August. This tactic failed spectacularly, as it drove the North Vietnamese and Vietcong to use vicious guerrilla tactics against the US.\n\nIn October, another, less optimistic SNIE was issued, limited to the South. It said the situation was deteriorating, and a coup could occur at any time. The Prime Minister of the country, General [[Nguyen Khanh]], stayed in power by placating various groups, while exhibiting little leadership of the country or the military. Defeatism was spreading from Saigon to the countryside, and was aggravated by a [[Degar|Montagnard]] revolt on September 20. No clear leadership was emerging. Much of this turmoil can be traced back to the Diem government and its inability to capture the hearts of the people like Ho Chi Minh had. The South Vietnamese government was completely detached from its people as much of its government was focused in Saigon (though most of the people lived in small villages and Hamlets in the countryside).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ahern|first1=Thomas|title=CIA and the Generals: Covert Support to Military Government in South Vietnam|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/1-CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf|website=The CIA's Vietnam Histories|publisher=FOIA|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Viet Cong|Vietcong]], however, were not seen to be planning an immediate takeover, but are concentrating on psychological operations to increase unrest in the south and among American forces.<ref name=\"SNIE 53-2-64\">{{citation\n |author       = Central Intelligence Agency\n |title        = SNIE 53-2-64 The Situation in South Vietnam\n |date         = 1 October 1964\n |url          = http://www.dni.gov/nic/PDF_GIF_declass_support/vietnam/SNIE_53-2-64.pdf\n |access-date  = 2008-04-25\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227144818/http://www.dni.gov/nic/PDF_GIF_declass_support/vietnam/SNIE_53-2-64.pdf\n |archive-date = 2008-02-27\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n==Vietnam 1965==\n\n===Intelligence analysis===\nSpecial National Intelligence Estimate 10-9-65, was done to assess the reactions, in various parts of the world, to an escalation of US attacks on North Vietnam.

Under Diem religious tensions increased between the Buddhists and minority Roman Catholics. He gave Roman Catholics preference in governmental appointments and in military positions in addition to other actions that benefited Christians disproportionately over Buddhists.  In a special report on The Buddhists in South Vietnam from 1963, the CIA noted that they were tracking the discontent within the Buddhist community and trying to discern if these grievances could lead to political change within the country. In a section concerning political influences they write, \"There seems to be little doubt that the intensity of the Buddhist protests reflected general discontent over the entrenched, autocratic rule of the Diems as well as specific grievances against their religious biases. there have been persistent reports that some extremist Buddhist leaders have been determined to keep up the momentum of demonstrations, not just to secure satisfaction of demands, but in hopes of bringing about the government's overthrow. Available information, however, indicates that most Buddhist leaders hoped to keep the religious issues isolated from broader political discontent and avoided collaboration with political opponents of Diem seeking to use the Buddhist issue to bring down his government\". Diem's fight with the Buddhists lowered morale both within his government and his public support. The CIA feared that the Communists would exploit this in order to expand their influence in the community and made efforts to reduce Buddhist political involvement.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79-00927A004100030002-4.pdf</ref> An Quang Buddhists, led by [[Th\u00edch Tr\u00ed Quang|Tri Quang]], were contacted by the CIA.  They offered to fund An Quang training programs in return for them remaining nonpolitical.  The CIA felt that An Quang Buddhists may resume protests against the government because the new Prime Minister, [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u|Thieu-Ky]] was Catholic. The CIA wanted to keep the Buddhists out of conflict with the South Vietnamese during such a delicate time. Through December 1965, the CIA had given the An Quang Buddhists $12,500.  This endeavor was successful in keeping the Buddhists out of the political arena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/1-CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf|title=CIA and the Generals|last=Ahern Jr.|first=Thomas|date=February 19, 2009|website=gwu.edu|access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, the CIA began gathering intelligence on Sihanoukville, a port in Cambodia that the CIA believed had importance to the Viet Cong.

In that the VCI, as opposed to the main force VC/NVA combat forces, used terror against villagers, Phoenix can be considered a [[Counter-terrorism|counterterror]] program using some of the same methods as its opponents. The main targets of this program were taking out the hierarchy of officials, guerrilla leaders,and local organization. The idea behind it was if the villages fell, as well as social order, the North Vietnamese would have to give in to American wills.\n\nThe creation of the Phoenix Program came as a result of a decade-long negligence on the part of the United States to track the activities of the Communist Party's political and administrative structure.  From 1954\u20131964, the only intelligence offered by CIA efforts came in the form of a Hamlet Informant Program, which paid for information from untrained informants. Due to a lack in quality information, the CIA Station joined [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|MACV J-2]] and [[Operation Passage to Freedom|USOM's]] Public Safety Division in emphasizing a restructuring of intelligence. The Station wanted more centralization of intelligence, but US generals initially refused to offer a joint partnership in the efforts. As a result of this chasm in CIA and military intelligence efforts, the FBI broadened the National Interrogation Center for use by all security and intelligence operations. This change in strategy led to early successes, including the arrest of ninety-seven suspects identified under insurgent auspices, thanks in large part to information shared by police forces.<ref>Ahern Jr., Thomas L.

The CIA contribution began with COS and Deputy COS membership on Komer's Phoenix Committee. It included, as already noted, Evan Parker as program director, and its Executive Officer, Chief of Operations, an analyst, and two secretaries also came from the Station. For the most part, the Stations participation in Phoenix staffing entailed a second hat for an Agency officer already working against the VCI. As Phoenix Chief of Operations, for example, John Hart was assigned to CORDS the chief of his Intelligence. Operations Division (lOD), which conducted joint operations with the Police Special Branch. The entire division adopted CORDS cover under the title.\n\nWhile Phoenix has often been called a CIA program, that is not entirely correct. It was under the direction of [[William Colby]], who had been Saigon Deputy CIA Station Chief, and then Station Chief, between 1959 and 1962. He returned to Vietnam in 1968, as deputy to [[Robert Komer]], the civilian head of the American efforts against the Communists, called '''Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support''' (CORDS). Shortly after arriving, Colby succeeded Komer as head of CORDS, which drew on a wide range of US and South Vietnamese organizations, including the CIA station's Rural Development cadre.<ref name=andrade>{{citation\n | title = CORDS/Phoenix: Counterinsurgency Lessons from Vietnam for the Future\n | first1 =Dale | last1 = Andrade\n | first2 = James H. | last2 = Willbanks\n | journal = Military Review\n |date=March\u2013April 2006\n | url = http://usacac.army.mil/CAC/milreview/English/MarApr06/Andrade-Willbanks.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\nThere were many allegations of torture among The Phoenix Program. Such tactics included were: rape, gang rape, rape using eels, snakes, or hard objects, and rape followed by murder; electric shock ('the Bell Telephone Hour') rendered by attaching wires to the genitals or other sensitive parts of the body, like the tongue; the 'water treatment'; the 'airplane' in which the prisoner's arms were tied behind the back, and the rope looped over a hook on the ceiling, suspending the prisoner in midair, after which he or she was beaten; beatings with rubber hoses and whips; the use of police dogs to maul prisoners.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoxuDCMmlqoC|title=State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The North in the South|last=Blakeley|first=Ruth|date=2009-04-03|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780203876510|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Phoenix Program can be called a resounding failure. The South Vietnamese had a resounding lack of interest and investment in this part of the conflict. Many of those people who were captured and put into prison or who were executed were indeed not high ranking communists, but were instead average citizens. Numerous neighbors would turn in individuals who were their personal enemies or people who owed them money. American troops would commonly buy into these stories.

The CIA planted sabotaged explosive Budweiser and poisoned cigarettes along the Ho Chi Minh trail, and The CIA extracted letters from communist bodies and used them as methods to gain intelligence.\n\n==Vietnam 1968==\n\n=== Operation Shock ===\nShortly after the Tet Offensive on February 2, a small group of CIA analysts who called themselves \"brethren,\" lead by George Carver, reacted to the attack by devising a plan they called, Operation Shock. The analysts were worried that the generals in the Vietnamese Government grew too comfortable with the American army helping them which lead to growing support for the Vietcong. Their plan was to have the Vice President Ky \"supervise a purge of all military and civilian officials guilty of corruption or other abuses.\" President Thieu would never have allowed the Vice President, who was his rival at the time, to lead a purging campaign, and as if knowing their plan would fail, the \"brethren\" included alternative solutions to turn the tide of the war including, forcing Thieu to resign and let a war hero come into office, temporarily stop bombardment of Northern Vietnam and initiate talks to try and negotiate surrender, or initiate talks with the National Liberation Front to possibly form a coalition government. The Director of Central Intelligence, Helms, silently handed off the plan to policymakers in DC, who then relayed the information to President Johnson. Johnson's response was to talk with the Vietcong, stop bombardments, and announced that he was withdrawing from re-election. Vice President Hubert Humphrey is said to have later thanked Carver for stating that he \"had a profound effect on the course of U.S. policy on Vietnam.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=CIA and the Generals: Covert Support to Military Government in South Vietnam|last=Ahern|first=Thomas L.|publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=73\u201375}}</ref>\n\nAn important part of the CIA's mission in Vietnam was to constantly monitor what was happening in North Vietnam in order to help the war effort. Since the conflict was part of the Cold War, concerns about aid from the communist powers of China and the USSR constantly remained a concern. One 1968 memorandum demonstrates what was discussed. In the document, titled \"Communist Aid to North Vietnam,\" the types of aid being provided by the Chinese and the Russians are described in detail, with sections on economic and military aid.<ref>{{cite web|title= Communist Aid to North Vietnam|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000483828.pdf|website=CIA Reading Room|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> On October 31, 1968 President Johnson announced a suspension of bombing attacks on the North Vietnam.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n==Vietnam 1969==\nIn November 1968 President Johnson had written something pertaining to the bombing of North Vietnam. Kissinger tried to convince the CIA to form a smart plan in order to take action on the military targets on North Vietnam.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">Undercover Armies.http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/6-UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf</ref> They responded to him by using Laotian guerrillas to go through different barracks and storage facilities located at Dien Bien Phu. Though most organizations figured that the costs would outweigh the benefits, Kissinger still convinced them to go through with it.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> In December 1969 Kissinger tried to get more strikes on \"lucrative targets\" in North Vietnam. On March 10 a pipeline located in North Vietnam by the Mu Gia Pass was wrecked. When the government in Cambodia changed the US became more concerned. On April 3 a second pipeline operation had failed but Headquarters encouraged them to keep trying\n\nOn April 25 they had tried again but soon had to stop when they came across a North Vietnamese bivouac.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\" /> On July 3, 1969,the CIA produced an assessment of their collection program pertaining to the North Vietnamese logistics network (Ho Chi Minh trail). The document was intended to be read by Henry Kissinger and detailed the current inventory of CIA collection activities and their corresponding recommendations.  Based on the document, the CIA was having difficulty identifying the total logistics  structure of North Vietnam (between Laos and Cambodia) and the quantities/frequency of the supplies being transported. It was noted that the supply route in Laos was more active than Cambodia. (Due to the terrain of Cambodia). Though the CIA collection program was predominantly supported by technical and human collection, the high level of hostility made human collection very difficult. The recommendation of the assessment listed the need for more road watchers (to supplement human collection) and more sensors, aerial reconnaissance  and wire taps for technical collection.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001300120016-4.pdf</ref>\n\nThe constant pressure placed on Thieu from the Station began to take its toll by the end of the 1960s. On May 25, 1969 President Thieu created another political organization called the National Social Democratic Front (NSDF) in attempts to rival the Communists.<ref name=\"Thomas 2009\">Ahern Jr., Thomas (February 19, 2009). \"CIA and the Generals\" (PDF). http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/. Retrieved March 1, 2017.</ref> Since the NSDF had a larger network than the Lien Minh, it quickly gained financial support from the US. However, despite all the resources that were being devoted to the organization, the NSDF failed to satisfy expectations and was largely considered to be a disappointment. Many politicians refused to work with a vexed associate of the organization named Houng. The National Salvation Front rejected the NSDF's consolidation request for this very reason. Moreover, the NSDF did not have any success with integrating its constituent parts. The CIA's experiment with the NSDF fizzled out and lasted about a year. Thieu did not want to turn pacification into a political task and would offer no supplemental ideology or program to replace Communism in Vietnam.<ref name=\"Thomas 2009\"/>\n\n===Mixed covert action and intelligence collection===\nKatrosh wanted Theiu and Ky to get along, so that \"there would finally be political cohesion in South Vietnam\",and ended up using the CIA as the main proponent to help make this happen. Eventually, Katrosh was successful in bringing the two together for the Lien Minh inauguration. Theiu did not want to be personally involved with the Lien Minh organizational activity. Bunker wanted Katrosh's help with pursuing him, so he was sending large sums of CIA money, in the amount of $400,000 to Katrosh.<ref>Thomas L.

Carver, Jr., the DCI\u2019s Special Assistant for Vietnamese Affairs. In a December 15 memorandum to Helms, Carver stated that Laird was anxious to remove all US military personnel from the PRU program, as were [[MACV]] commanding general [[Creighton Abrams]] and the JCS. Laird admitted that his concerns were \"political,\" and he wanted to avoid a flap over the PRU in which US military personnel would be associated. Carver explained that recent steps had been taken to tighten controls over the program, curtail the operational involvement of US military personnel, and shift the emphasis to intelligence collection from ambush or \"elimination.\" Carver argued that the sudden removal of US military personnel, who were already in the process of being gradually reduced, would be a mistake and would jeopardize the program. Laird agreed to reconsider his view.</blockquote>\n\nThe main report gives the level of US involvement, showing the Phoenix personnel were primarily South Vietnamese. <blockquote>The [[Provincial Reconnaissance Unit]] (PRU) Program in South Vietnam forms an investigative and paramilitary attack upon the covert communist apparatus in South Vietnam. PRU teams, currently totalling approximately 4,200 men, operate in 44 provinces of South Vietnam. PRU are based in their home areas and operate in teams of 15\u201320 men. They are presently advised and supported by 101 US military advisors and seven CIA personnel. CIA funds the PRU and retains overall administrative control of the project for the US Government.</blockquote>\n\nReasons against continued CIA involvement included a concern, much like that raised during the Korean War, about diverting CIA from its national-level to a tactical role:\n:#Continued US support of the PRU program risks adverse publicity either through an untoward incident, a press campaign to publicize its efforts or complaints from accommodation-minded South Vietnamese officials or politicians.\n:#CIA will have to continue its support to a program which lies, at least in part, outside its usual intelligence mission.<ref name=303-1969-12-11 />\n\n'''Vietnam 1969\u20131972'''\nCIA's pacification programs in Vietnam deteriorated because the Vietnamese chose to not invest in them.<ref>Thomas L.

Supporters say that it was a legal and closely controlled US\u2013Vietnamese intelligence program aimed at destroying the Vietcong infrastructure, while the critics say that it was an illegal system of arresting, torturing and murdering innocent Vietnamese civilians...<ref name=MACVdir381-41>{{citation\n | url = http://www.psywarrior.com/VietnamOBPSYOP\n | title = The Phoenix Program\n | first1 = Herbert A. | last1 = Friedman\n}}</ref>\n\n\"Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) Directive 381-41, dated 9 July 1967, inaugurated the Intelligence Coordination and Exploitation (ICEX) program to Attack the Vietcong Infrastructure (VCI). In late 1967, MACV replaced the name \"ICEX\" with \"Phoenix,\" after a mythical bird that appeared as a sign of prosperity and luck and a near translation of the South Vietnamese name for the program, \"Phung Hoang\" (\"All-seeing bird\").\"\n\nAs early as 1964, GEN [[William C. Westmoreland]], commander of [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) \"knew that he lacked the forces to wage both a war of attrition and one of pacification, so he chose the former. The argument over whether or not this was the right course of action will likely go on forever, but undoubtedly the shape of the war changed dramatically after the [[Tet Offensive]]. The enemy was badly mauled and, despite the political gains made, militarily lost the initiative for quite some time.\"<ref name=\"andrade\"/>\n\nWhen the VC regrouped after the Tet Offensive, \"Westmoreland never had such an advantage. When American ground forces entered the war in 1965, they faced an enemy on the offensive, but in June 1968 the new MACV commander, General [[Creighton W. Abrams]], confronted an enemy on the ropes. Abrams plainly recognized his advantage and implemented a clear-and-hold strategy aimed at moving into rural enclaves formerly dominated by the VC.\"\n\nMuch criticized for lack of precision, the Phoenix Program was described by a former official as a \"sterile depersonalized murder program...I never knew an individual to be detained as a VC suspect who ever lived through an interrogation\" Also many of the people captured under the Phoenix program can be seen as innocent. Many of the thousands of victims were given to the Americans cause of petty disputes among neighbors and for personal gain. Phoenix also had little chance for success because the Vietcong had the operation filled with their double agents from the beginning.<ref name = \"bart\">{{cite web\n |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jksonc/docs/phoenix-hcgo-19710802.html#kbo\n |title=Committee on Government Operations House of Representatives \u2013 U.S. Assistance Programs in Vietnam \u2013 Statement of K.

They came in all shapes and sizes and in varying degrees of sophistication, but they had a huge impact on the morale of American troops. These traps were not meant to kill, but instead maim and injure because it instilled more fear in the enemy soldiers, and because it took 4\u20135 men to care for 1 injured soldier, when a dead soldier would be less of a strain on resources. The Vietcong also used tunnels to their advantage. They could sneak out of their hiding spaces and take out a few American soldiers at a time. This increased the fear of the enemy because attacks could happen at any time and anywhere<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA and the Vietnam War Declassified Part 5|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb05Gq_8MHQ|website=Youtube|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Operation Wandering Soul ===\n\nAnother psychological warfare tactic utilized by the CIA was Operation Wandering Soul. This preyed on the superstitions of the Vietnamese. It was believed that if one died away from one's family and was not buried with their ancestors, then they would be forced to wander forever; their souls in pain. The US recorded tapes of South Vietnamese actors wailing, searching for their loved ones and imploring the Viet Cong to \"desert the army to save your soul.\" These tapes were broadcast by GIs walking about with speakers or by overhead choppers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tri Tong hop|first1=Kenh Giai|title=CIA and the Vietnam War Declassified Part 6|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE2s7FlbAQ0|website=Youtube|accessdate=2016-06-24}}</ref>\n\nAnother broadcast used at Nui Ba Den Mountain in 1970 used an actual recording of a tiger from a zoo in Bangkok. A rumor was spread of a tiger attacking the Viet Cong to supplement the playing of the recording. Allegedly, this acted as a catalyst for 150 Viet Cong leaving their positions. Leaflets were also used to amplify this scare tactic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trick or Treat \u2013 The Strange Tale of Ghost Tape No. 10|url=http://militaryhistorynow.com/2013/10/30/trick-or-treat-the-strange-tale-of-ghost-tape-no-10/|website=Military History Now|accessdate=2016-07-23}}</ref>\n\n== Vietnam 1970 and After ==\n\nWith its \"Vietnamization\" doctrine, proclaimed in early 1969, the Nixon administration began the gradual withdrawal of the United States from ground combat in South Vietnam. The end goal of this was to strengthen the military of South Vietnam. An expanded program of irregular operations in the eastern Panhandle was more productive. There was a lot of pressure for Nixon to withdraw from Indochina on the home front. Johnson's bombing of North Vietnam in 1968 really got backlash from the citizens back in America. There were a lot of protests all over the United States because of this. Even though the war was ending in Vietnam, protestors in the United States were still going crazy as the troops were returning from the battlefield.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ahern |first1=Thomas |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/6-UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf}}</ref> During the Nixon Presidency, domestic pressure to withdrawal from Indochina exponentially increased. However, Nixon was determined to escape the embarrassment of an American military defeat in Vietnam. Needing to rectify the aggravated electorate and ensure the prospects of shaping the settlement in Vietnam from a position of strength, Nixon and Kissinger turned to the CIA. Kissinger ordered the CIA to carry out \u201chigh political and psychological impact actions against military targets in North Vietnam.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/6-UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf|title=Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos|last=|first=|date=August 26, 2009|website=The National Security Archive|page=349|access-date=}}</ref> The Agency sponsored Laotian guerrillas to erode the enemy's confidence in the security of the trail network. On 22 February 1970, the Commando Raider operations began and set ablaze administrative and storage buildings in Dien Bien Phu, and sabotaged a pipeline near Mu Gia Pass. The success of these operations enticed the CIA station in Vientiane to adopt them as a staple of its agenda. The change of government's Cambodia in March 1970 signaled an opportunity to expand the Commando Raider operations. The CIA gathered more intelligence pertaining to the specifics of troop movements and the location of NVA supplies. Raids to destroy these supplies became common. The CIA focused on the complete interdiction of the trail system that extended through Laos and Cambodia. While many of these raids were successful, it was a futile operation. The \u201cmeans [were] inadequate to the end.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/6-UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf|title=Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos|last=|first=|date=August 26, 2009|website=The National Security Archive|page=351|access-date=}}</ref> The CIA spent a great amount of resources and energy into preparing these raids, collecting intelligence, and carrying out attempts to further undermine the enemy now defeating them.

The President dealt under the table to accomplish its strategic interests while hoping to save face among the electorate. Furthermore, the ultimate failure of CIA covert action reflected a recurring trend in the Agency's history\u2014no matter the amount of intelligence collected, resources amassed, or strategies implemented, the Agency still failed to understand its enemy. Although the CIA had some success in anticipating the North Vietnamese offensive of 1972, the agency's last station chief in South Vietnam argued that \"the illusion that the war is over and we have won is shattered.\" <ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nEven as late as 1971, the United States worried about resistance in the region along with the want of at least one American ambassador in order to allow for a Thieu victory in the region. Not only this, but there were attempts by the U.S. in order to garner Catholic support for Thieu in the country in order to set up footing among Chinese nationals and other groups. However, the senatorial election of 1970 caused American interest in the political machinations of South Vietnam at least to subside, even if they were interested as late as 1971.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ahern, Jr.|first1=Thomas L.|title=CIA and the Generals: Covert Support in South Vietnam|url= http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/1-CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf |website=National Security Archive|accessdate=10 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nA series of accusations in the early 1970s that the CIA was complicit in drug trafficking in Laos was a contributing factor in the public's opposition to US activities in Southeast Asia. Neither the CIA nor any of its officers were accused of direct activity in the narcotics operations. It is likely that the agency did not focus much energy on the trafficking by indigenous allies until a heroin epidemic broke out among US troops in South Vietnam. There was nothing preventing the hill tribes in northern Laos from producing and selling opium until 1971, as the trade was an economic benefactor to the tribes, but under US pressure, the Laotian government made it illegal. These activities predate the war on drugs in the United States and there was not even a reporting requirement in place until after Nixon's war on drugs had been declared.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Undercover Armies|last=Ahern, Jr.|first=Thomas L.|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=535\u2013537}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, The US signed an agreement put forth by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (during Nixon's administration) that stated that the US must cease fire immediately throughout Vietnam and that there should be no more US military involvement in Vietnam. Also, there should also be a return of all captured personnel of the parties, and most importantly the US must agree on South Vietnam's right to self determine their own government.\n\nOn March 12 of 1975 an anti-aircraft missile from North Vietnam struck an Air Vietnam DC-4 that was en route from Ventiane to Saigon, shortly after the aircraft communicated for the last time over a reporting point (PE9 on the G67 airway) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19750312-0|title=Accident Report of downed Douglas C-54D-5-DC (DC-4) of Air Vietnam on 12 March 1975}}</ref> near Pleiku. The ARVN had fallen apart partially due to the North Vietnamese offensive, but it was not the sole reason. Since the North Vietnamese had been attacking everything, including B-52s and naval vessels, they had grown stronger and the South appeared to get weaker.

In 2016, the Cambodian [[Ministry of Health (Cambodia)|Ministry of Health]] warned that cupping could be a health risk and particularly dangerous for people with high blood pressure or heart problems.\n\nResearch suggests that cupping is harmful, especially in people who are thin or obese: According to Jack Raso (1997), cupping results in capillary expansion, excessive fluid accumulation in tissues, and the rupture of blood vessels.\n\nCupping therapy adverse events can be divided into local and systemic adverse events. The local adverse events were scar formation, burns, skin infection, panniculitis, abscess formation, pain at the cupping site, and systemic adverse events including: anemia, dizziness, vasovagal attack, insomnia, headaches, and nausea.\n\nAccording to the [[NCCIH]] \"Cupping can cause side effects such as persistent skin discoloration, scars, burns, and infections, and may worsen eczema or psoriasis\".<ref name=nccih>{{cite web |date=8 November 2018 |url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/cupping |title=Cupping |publisher=NCCIH}}</ref>\n\nMishaps associated with the use of easily spilled fuel in combination with fire, during the fire cupping procedure, can result in burning of skin, eye injury, and lung injury. Severity of the injury depends on the amount of fuel spilled and ignited on the patient, and the time before extinguishing the fire.\n\nSome contraindications for cupping may include: pregnancy, swelling, dry or cracked skin, hypotension, open wounds, or thin blood.\n\n== Methods ==\n\nWhile details vary between practitioners, societies, and cultures, the practice consists of drawing tissue into a cap placed on the targeted area by creating a partial vacuum &ndash; either by the heating and subsequent cooling of the air in the cup, or via a mechanical pump.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is cupping therapy|url=http://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/cupping-therapy|website=WebMD|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> The cup is usually left in place for somewhere between five and fifteen minutes.\n\nCupping therapy types can be classified using four distinct methods of categorisation. The first system of categorisation relates to \"technical types\" including: dry, wet, massage, and flash cupping therapy. The second categorisation relates to \"the power of suction related types\" including: light, medium, and strong cupping therapy. The third categorisation relates to \"the method of suction related types\" including: fire, manual suction, and electrical suction cupping therapy. The fourth categorisation relates to \"materials inside cups\" including: herbal products, water, ozone, [[Moxibustion|moxa]], needle, and magnetic cupping therapy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cupping Therapy Encyclopedia|last=Shaban|first=Tamer|publisher=CreateSpace|year=2013|isbn=978-1494780517|pages=29}}</ref>\n\nFurther categories of cupping were developed later.

The cotton is clamped by a pair of forceps and lit via match or lighter, and, in one motion, placed into the cup and quickly removed, while the cup is placed on the skin.  The fire uses up all the oxygen in the cup which creates a negative pressure inside the cup. The cup is then quickly placed onto the body and the negative pressure \"sucks\" the skin up. Massage oil may be applied to create a better seal as well as allow the cups to glide over muscle groups (e.g. trapezius, erectors, latissimus dorsi, etc.) in an act called \"gliding cupping\" or \"sliding cupping\".  Dark circles may appear where the cups were placed because of capillary rupture just under the skin. There are documented cases of burns caused by fire cupping.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Iblher|first1=N.|last2=Stark|first2=B.|year=2007|title=Cupping treatment and associated burn risk: a plastic surgeon's perspective|journal=J Burn Care Res|volume=28|issue=2|pages=355\u20138|doi=10.1097/BCR.0B013E318031A267|pmid=17351459}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sagi|first1=A.|last2=Ben-Meir|first2=P.|last3=Bibi|first3=C.|date=Aug 1988|title=Burn hazard from cupping--an ancient universal medication still in practice|journal=Burns Incl Therm Inj|volume=14|issue=4|pages=323\u20135|doi=10.1016/0305-4179(88)90075-7|pmid=3224303}}</ref>\n\n=== Wet cupping ===\nWet cupping is also known as Hijama ({{lang-ar|\u062d\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0629}} lit. \"sucking\") or medicinal bleeding, where blood is drawn by local suction from a small skin incision.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Albinali |first=Hajar |date=June 2004 |title=Traditional Medicine Among Gulf Arabs Part II - Blood Letting |url=http://www.heartviews.org/text.asp?2004/5/2/74/64567 |journal=Heart Views |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=74\u201385 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911211305/http://www.hmc.org.qa/heartviews/VOL5NO2/special_section.htm |archive-date=11 September 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWet cupping, unlike dry cupping, requires a skin incision.

In 2016, the Cambodian [[Ministry of Health (Cambodia)|Ministry of Health]] warned that cupping could be a health risk and particularly dangerous for people with high blood pressure or heart problems.\n\nResearch suggests that cupping is harmful, especially in people who are thin or obese: According to Jack Raso (1997), cupping results in capillary expansion, excessive fluid accumulation in tissues, and the rupture of blood vessels.\n\nCupping therapy adverse events can be divided into local and systemic adverse events. The local adverse events were scar formation, burns, skin infection, panniculitis, abscess formation, pain at the cupping site, and systemic adverse events including: anemia, dizziness, vasovagal attack, insomnia, headaches, and nausea.\n\nAccording to the [[NCCIH]] \"Cupping can cause side effects such as persistent skin discoloration, scars, burns, and infections, and may worsen eczema or psoriasis\".<ref name=nccih>{{cite web |date=8 November 2018 |url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/cupping |title=Cupping |publisher=NCCIH}}</ref>\n\nMishaps associated with the use of easily spilled fuel in combination with fire, during the fire cupping procedure, can result in burning of skin, eye injury, and lung injury. Severity of the injury depends on the amount of fuel spilled and ignited on the patient, and the time before extinguishing the fire.\n\nSome contraindications for cupping may include: pregnancy, swelling, dry or cracked skin, hypotension, open wounds, or thin blood.\n\n== Methods ==\n\nWhile details vary between practitioners, societies, and cultures, the practice consists of drawing tissue into a cap placed on the targeted area by creating a partial vacuum &ndash; either by the heating and subsequent cooling of the air in the cup, or via a mechanical pump.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is cupping therapy|url=http://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/cupping-therapy|website=WebMD|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> The cup is usually left in place for somewhere between five and fifteen minutes.\n\nCupping therapy types can be classified using four distinct methods of categorisation. The first system of categorisation relates to \"technical types\" including: dry, wet, massage, and flash cupping therapy. The second categorisation relates to \"the power of suction related types\" including: light, medium, and strong cupping therapy. The third categorisation relates to \"the method of suction related types\" including: fire, manual suction, and electrical suction cupping therapy. The fourth categorisation relates to \"materials inside cups\" including: herbal products, water, ozone, [[Moxibustion|moxa]], needle, and magnetic cupping therapy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cupping Therapy Encyclopedia|last=Shaban|first=Tamer|publisher=CreateSpace|year=2013|isbn=978-1494780517|pages=29}}</ref>\n\nFurther categories of cupping were developed later.

The cotton is clamped by a pair of forceps and lit via match or lighter, and, in one motion, placed into the cup and quickly removed, while the cup is placed on the skin.  The fire uses up all the oxygen in the cup which creates a negative pressure inside the cup. The cup is then quickly placed onto the body and the negative pressure \"sucks\" the skin up. Massage oil may be applied to create a better seal as well as allow the cups to glide over muscle groups (e.g. trapezius, erectors, latissimus dorsi, etc.) in an act called \"gliding cupping\" or \"sliding cupping\".  Dark circles may appear where the cups were placed because of capillary rupture just under the skin.

[[Correspondence chess]] has been played by mail for centuries. ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'' has been played by mail since 1963, introducing a multi-player aspect to PBM games.<ref name=Babcock13>[[#Bab13|Babcock 2013]]. p. 16.</ref> [[Flying Buffalo Inc]] pioneered the first commercially available PBM game in 1970. A small number of PBM companies followed in the 1970s, with an explosion of hundreds of startup PBM companies in the 1980s at the peak of PBM gaming popularity, many of them small hobby companies\u2014more than 90 percent of which eventually folded. A number of independent PBM magazines also started in the 1980s, including ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''. These magazines eventually went out of print, replaced in the 21st century by the online PBM journal ''[[Suspense and Decision]]''.\n\nPlay-by-mail games have a number of advantages and disadvantages related to other gaming genres. PBM games allow plenty of time\u2014sometimes days or weeks\u2014to consider moves or turns and players never run out of opponents to face. Additionally, the complexity of PBM games can be far beyond that allowed by a board game in an afternoon, and pits players against live opponents in these conditions, a challenge some players enjoy. Some games allow the number of opponents or teams in the dozens, even as high as fifty. PBM games also allow gamers to interact with others globally. And games with low turn costs compare well with expensive board or video games. Some drawbacks include the price for some PBM games with high setup and/or turn costs, and the lack of ability for face-to-face roleplaying. Additionally, for some players, some games can be overly complex, and delays in turn processing can be a negative.\n\nPlay-by-mail games are multifaceted. In their earliest form they involved two players alternatively sending moves directly to each other by postal mail, such as in correspondence chess. Multi-player games, such as ''Diplomacy'' or more complex games available today, involve a [[game master]] who receives, processes, and adjudicates turn results for players. These games also introduce the element of [[diplomacy]] in which participants can discuss gameplay with each other, strategize, and form [[alliances]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, turn results were sometimes adjudicated completely by humans. Over time, partial or complete turn adjudication by computer became the norm. Games also involve open and closed end variants. Open ended games do not end and players can develop their positions to the fullest extent possible, whereas in closed end games, players typically pursue a set of victory conditions until game conclusion. Finally, PBM games enable players to explore a diverse array of roles, from characters in fantasy or medieval settings, space operas, inner city gangs, or even more unusual ones such as assuming the role of microorganisms or monsters.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=Babcock13/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>[[#Loo13|Loomis 2013]]. p. 38.</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>[[#Fly20|Flying Buffalo 2020]].</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"[Rick Loomis] is generally recognized as the founder of the PBM industry.\"\n| source = \u2014 ''The Editors of Space Gamer Magazine, 1985''.<ref>[[#Edi85|The Editors 1985]]. p. 35.</ref>\n| width  = 27%\n| align  = left| style = padding:8px;\n}}\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend88a>[[#Tow88|Townsend 1988]]. p. 20.</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems.<ref name=Townsend88a/>\n\nThe next \"big entrance\" was [[Superior Simulations]] with its game ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' in 1978.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was \"the most complex game system on Earth\" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.<ref name=Townsend88a/> By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.<ref name=Popo90>[[#Pop90|Popolizio, Leblanc, and Popolizio 1990]]. p. 8.</ref> The most popular games of 1980 were ''Starweb'' and ''Tribes of Crane''.<ref name=Popo90/>\n\nSome players, unhappy with their experiences with Schubel & Son and Superior Simulations, launched their own company\u2014Adventures by Mail\u2014with game, ''[[Beyond the Stellar Empire (play-by-mail game)|''Beyond the Stellar Empire'']]'', which became \"immensely popular\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> In this same way, many people have launched PBM companies, trying their hand at finding the right mix of action and strategy for the gaming audience of the period. According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend88a/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.\"<ref>[[#Tow89|Townsend 1989]]. p. 55.</ref> By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies\u2013not run as businesses to make money.<ref name=Townsend12>[[#Tow12|Townsend 1988]]. p. 19.</ref> Jim Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States\u2014with an additional few in the [[United Kingdom]] and the same in [[Australia]].<ref name=Townsend12/>\n\nThe proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry such as the relatively short-lived ''[[The Nuts & Bolts of PBM]]'' and ''[[Gaming Universal]]''. The PBM genre's \"two preeminent magazines\" of the period were [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''.<ref>[[#Pad93|Paduch 1993]]. p. RC21.</ref> Also in the mid-1980s, \"general gaming magazines\" began carrying articles on PBM and run PBM advertisements, and the Origins Awards began a \"Best PBM Game\" category.<ref>[[#Loo85|Loomis 1985]]. p. 35.</ref> \n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, ''Flagship'' magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>[[#Pro93|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined.\n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>[[#Mui13|Muir 2013]]. p. 14.</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010. The number of remaining play-by-mail publications is relatively small\u2014mostly newsletters associated with play-by-mail companies, although ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'' remains as an independent online journal for play-by-mail gamers in the 21st century.<ref>[[#Sus20|Suspense & Decision 2020]].</ref>\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming==\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref>[[#Pro93a|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Green93>[[#Gre93|Greenberg 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> \n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Green93/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<<ref name=Green93/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Green93/>\n\n==Description==\nIn 1993, ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''\u2014a magazine for play-by-mail gamers\u2014described play-by-mail games thusly: <blockquote>PBM Games vary in the size of the games, turn around time, length of time a game lasts, and prices. An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=MayhemFeb93>[[#Fro93|Paper Mayhem Jan/Feb 1993]]. p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/>\n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts. First, the company informs players on the results of the last turn. Next players conduct diplomatic activities, if desired. Then, they send their next turn sheets to the Game Master. Finally, the turn sheets are processed and the cycle is repeated. This continues until the game or a player is done.<ref>[[#Dan20|danard.net 2020]].</ref>\n\n===Diplomacy===\nAccording to ''Paper Mayhem'' assistant editor Jim Townsend, <blockquote>The most important aspect of PBM games is the diplomacy. If you don't communicate with the other players you will be labeled a \"loner,\" \"mute,\" or just plain \"dead meat.\" You must talk with the others to survive.<ref>[[#Tow87|Townsend 1987]]. p. 29.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Player roles===\nPlay-by-mail games provide a wide array of possible [[Role-playing game|roles to play]], from pirates to space characters to \"previously unknown creatures\".<ref name=Loth42>[[#Lot86|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 42.</ref> In the game ''[[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|Monster Island]]'', players assume the role of a monster which explores a massive island.<ref>[[#Hel93|Helzer 1993]]. p. 12.</ref> And the title of the PBM game ''You're An Amoeba, GO!'' indicates an unusual role as players struggle \"in a 3D pool of primordial ooze [directing] the evolution of a legion of micro-organisms\".<ref>[[#Pap94|Paper Mayhem 1994]]. p. 42.</ref> Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but a higher importance of this aspect requires more time searching for the right PBM game.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth42/> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit. A drawback of this type is that mature games have \"factions of significant power and knowledge\" that can pose an unmanageable problem for the beginner\u2014although some may see this situation as a challenge of sorts.<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of open ended games are ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'',<ref>[[#Tow87a|Townsend 1987]]. p. 24.</ref> [[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|''Monster Island'']],<ref>[[#DuB97|DuBois 1997]]. p. 4.</ref> and ''SuperNova: Rise of the Empire''.<ref>[[#Sus19|Suspense & Decision 2019]]. pp. 35\u201340.</ref> \n\nLoth states that most players in closed end games start equally and the games are \"faster paced, usually more intense...presenting frequent player confrontation; [and] the game terminates when a player or alliance of players has achieved specific conditions or eliminated all opposition\".<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of closed end games are ''[[Hyborian War]]'', ''[[It's a Crime (play-by-mail game)|It's a Crime]]'', and ''[[Starweb]]''.\n\n===Computer versus human moderated===\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail gaming companies began leveraging computers to moderate games. To some degree this was an economic decision, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a player's \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth42/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth42/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Complexity===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth, \"Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.\"<ref name=Loth42/> He noted in 1986 that Midguard was a \"very complex game\" with a 100-page instruction manual and \"255 possible line entries\".<ref name=Loth42/><ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' was \"the most complex game system on Earth\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> Other games, like Galactic Prisoners began simply and gradually increased in complexity.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n==Cost and turn processing time==\nLoth noted that, in 1986, $3\u20135 per turn was the most prevalent cost.<ref name=Loth43>[[#Lot86a|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 43.</ref> At the time, some games were free, while some costed as much as $100 per turn.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\nPlay-by-mail magazine ''Paper Mayhem'' stated that the average turn processing time in 1987 was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most popular.<ref>[[#Pap87d|Paper Mayhem Sep/Oct 1987]]. p. 1.</ref><ref name=Loth43/> In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\n==Information sources==\n[[Rick Loomis]] of [[Flying Buffalo]] Games stated in 1985 that the ''Nuts & Bolts of PBM'' (first called ''Nuts & Bolts of Starweb'') was the first PBM magazine not published by a PBM company.<ref name=Loomis36>[[#Loo85|Loomis 1985]]. p. 36.</ref> The name changed to ''Nuts & Bolts of Gaming''<ref name=Loomis36/> and it eventually went out of print.\n\nJohn Kevin Loth stated that, in 1986, the \"three major information sources in PBM\" were ''Paper Mayhem'', ''Flagship Magazine'', and the [[Play By Mail Association]].<ref name=Loth43/> These sources were solely focused on play-by-mail gaming. Additional PBM information sources included company-specific publications, although Rick Loomis stated that these were \"of interest only to their own customers\".<ref name=Loomis36/> Finally, play-by-mail gamers could also draw from \"alliances, associations, and senior players\" for information.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, \"general gaming magazines\" also began venturing into PBM.<ref name=Loomis35>[[#Loo85|Loomis 1985]]. p. 35.</ref> For example, ''[[White Wolf Magazine]]'' also began a regular PBM column beginning in issue #11 as well as publishing an annual PBM issue beginning with issue #16.<ref>[[#Whi88|White Wolf 1988]]. p. 2.</ref><ref>[[#Whi89|White Wolf 1989]]. p. 1.</ref> ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' also carried PBM articles and reviews.<ref name=Loomis35/> Additional minor information sources included magazines such as \"''[[Different Worlds]]'', [[Dragon (magazine)|''Dragon'']], ''[[Game New]]'', [[Imagine (game magazine)|''Imagine'']], and [[White Dwarf (magazine)|''White Dwarf'']]\".<ref name=Loth43/> \n\n''Flagship Magazine'' ran into the 21st Century, but ceased publication in 2010. In November 2013, an online journal for play-by-mail games, ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'', began publication.<ref>[[#Sus13|Suspense & Decision 2013]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of play-by-mail games]]\n* [[Play-by-post role-playing game]]\n* [[Turn-based]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite magazine |last= Babcock|first= Chris  |date= December 2013|title= Diplomacy|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |magazine= Suspense and Decision|location= |publisher= | issue = 2|pages= 16|accessdate= March 20, 2020|ref=Bab13}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= DuBois |first= Steven |date=January\u2013February 1997 |title= Monster Island: A Review|magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=82|page= 4 |ref= DuB97}}\n* {{Cite magazine |first= |last= Editors|date=July\u2013August 1985 |title= Rick Loomis on Play-By-Mail [Editor Intro] |magazine= [[The Space Gamer]] |issue= #75|page= 35 |ref= Edi85}} \n* {{Cite magazine |last= Greenberg|first= Andrew |date=May\u2013June 1993 |title= PBM Corner: A Beginning in Play-By-Mail; Is it Worth It? |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=36|page= 51 |ref= Gre93}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= Helzer|first= Herb |date= January\u2013February 1993 |title= Monster Island: Just One Destination for PBM Company |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=58|page= 12 |ref= Hel93}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= Loomis|first= Rick|date=July\u2013August 1985 |title= Rick Loomis on Play-By-Mail |magazine= [[The Space Gamer]] |issue= #75|pages= 35\u201336 |ref= Loo85}} \n* {{Cite magazine |first= Rick|last= Loomis|date=May 1999 |title= The History of Play-by-Mail and Flying Buffalo |magazine= Flying Buffalo Quarterly |number=79|pages= 2\u20135 |url=http://flyingbuffalo.com/download/fbq79.pdf|accessdate= April 17, 2020|ref= Loo99}} \n* {{cite magazine |last= Loomis|first= Rick  |date= December 2013|title= Letter from Rick Loomis to the Play By Mail/Email/Web/Turn Based Games Community|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |magazine= Suspense and Decision|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association| issue = 2|page= 38|accessdate= March 20, 2020|ref=Loo13}}\n* {{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth III|date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 42 |ref= Lot86}}\n* {{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth III|date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 43 |ref= Lot86a}}\n* {{cite magazine |last= Muir|first= Shannon|date= December 2013|title= Using Play By Mail in a Novel's Plot: The Story Behind for the Love of Airagos|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue-5-Suspense&Decision.pdf|dead-url= |magazine= Suspense and Decision||issue= 5 |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= February 15, 2020|ref= Mui13}}\n* {{cite magazine |first1= Shannon|last1= Muir|first2= John C.|last2= Muir|title= Thoughts on the Evolution of PBM|magazine=Sabledrake Magazine|date= November 2001| url =http://www.sabledrake.com/0111_evolution_PBeM.shtml|issue= |pages= | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20020617165952/http://www.sabledrake.com/0111_evolution_PBeM.shtml| archive-date= June 17, 2002|via= Wayback Machine|access-date= April 19, 2010| ref=Mui02}} Interview with John C.

[[Correspondence chess]] has been played by mail for centuries. ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'' has been played by mail since 1963, introducing a multi-player aspect to PBM games.<ref name=Babcock13>[[#Bab13|Babcock 2013]]. p. 16.</ref> [[Flying Buffalo Inc]] pioneered the first commercially available PBM game in 1970. A small number of PBM companies followed in the 1970s, with an explosion of hundreds of startup PBM companies in the 1980s at the peak of PBM gaming popularity, many of them small hobby companies\u2014more than 90 percent of which eventually folded. A number of independent PBM magazines also started in the 1980s, including ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''. These magazines eventually went out of print, replaced in the 21st century by the online PBM journal ''[[Suspense and Decision]]''.\n\nPlay-by-mail games have a number of advantages and disadvantages related to other gaming genres. PBM games allow plenty of time\u2014sometimes days or weeks\u2014to consider moves or turns and players never run out of opponents to face. Additionally, the complexity of PBM games can be far beyond that allowed by a board game in an afternoon, and pits players against live opponents in these conditions, a challenge some players enjoy. Some games allow the number of opponents or teams in the dozens, even as high as fifty. PBM games also allow gamers to interact with others globally. And games with low turn costs compare well with expensive board or video games. Some drawbacks include the price for some PBM games with high setup and/or turn costs, and the lack of ability for face-to-face roleplaying. Additionally, for some players, some games can be overly complex, and delays in turn processing can be a negative.\n\nPlay-by-mail games are multifaceted. In their earliest form they involved two players alternatively sending moves directly to each other by postal mail, such as in correspondence chess. Multi-player games, such as ''Diplomacy'' or more complex games available today, involve a [[game master]] who receives, processes, and adjudicates turn results for players. These games also introduce the element of [[diplomacy]] in which participants can discuss gameplay with each other, strategize, and form [[alliances]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, turn results were sometimes adjudicated completely by humans. Over time, partial or complete turn adjudication by computer became the norm. Games also involve open and closed end variants. Open ended games do not end and players can develop their positions to the fullest extent possible, whereas in closed end games, players typically pursue a set of victory conditions until game conclusion. Finally, PBM games enable players to explore a diverse array of roles, from characters in fantasy or medieval settings, space operas, inner city gangs, or even more unusual ones such as assuming the role of microorganisms or monsters.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=Babcock13/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>[[#Loo13|Loomis 2013]]. p. 38.</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>[[#Fly20|Flying Buffalo 2020]].</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"[Rick Loomis] is generally recognized as the founder of the PBM industry.\"\n| source = \u2014 ''The Editors of Space Gamer Magazine, 1985''.<ref>[[#Edi85|The Editors 1985]]. p. 35.</ref>\n| width  = 27%\n| align  = left| style = padding:8px;\n}}\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend88a>[[#Tow88|Townsend 1988]]. p. 20.</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems.<ref name=Townsend88a/>\n\nThe next \"big entrance\" was [[Superior Simulations]] with its game ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' in 1978.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was \"the most complex game system on Earth\" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.<ref name=Townsend88a/> By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.<ref name=Popo90>[[#Pop90|Popolizio, Leblanc, and Popolizio 1990]]. p. 8.</ref> The most popular games of 1980 were ''Starweb'' and ''Tribes of Crane''.<ref name=Popo90/>\n\nSome players, unhappy with their experiences with Schubel & Son and Superior Simulations, launched their own company\u2014Adventures by Mail\u2014with game, ''[[Beyond the Stellar Empire (play-by-mail game)|''Beyond the Stellar Empire'']]'', which became \"immensely popular\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> In this same way, many people have launched PBM companies, trying their hand at finding the right mix of action and strategy for the gaming audience of the period. According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend88a/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.\"<ref>[[#Tow89|Townsend 1989]]. p. 55.</ref> By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies\u2013not run as businesses to make money.<ref name=Townsend12>[[#Tow12|Townsend 1988]]. p. 19.</ref> Jim Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States\u2014with an additional few in the [[United Kingdom]] and the same in [[Australia]].<ref name=Townsend12/>\n\nThe proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry such as the relatively short-lived ''[[The Nuts & Bolts of PBM]]'' and ''[[Gaming Universal]]''. The PBM genre's \"two preeminent magazines\" of the period were [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''.<ref>[[#Pad93|Paduch 1993]]. p. RC21.</ref> Also in the mid-1980s, \"general gaming magazines\" began carrying articles on PBM and run PBM advertisements, and the Origins Awards began a \"Best PBM Game\" category.<ref>[[#Loo85|Loomis 1985]]. p. 35.</ref> \n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, ''Flagship'' magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>[[#Pro93|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined.\n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>[[#Mui13|Muir 2013]]. p. 14.</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010. The number of remaining play-by-mail publications is relatively small\u2014mostly newsletters associated with play-by-mail companies, although ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'' remains as an independent online journal for play-by-mail gamers in the 21st century.<ref>[[#Sus20|Suspense & Decision 2020]].</ref>\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming==\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref>[[#Pro93a|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Green93>[[#Gre93|Greenberg 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> \n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Green93/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<<ref name=Green93/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Green93/>\n\n==Description==\nIn 1993, ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''\u2014a magazine for play-by-mail gamers\u2014described play-by-mail games thusly: <blockquote>PBM Games vary in the size of the games, turn around time, length of time a game lasts, and prices. An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=MayhemFeb93>[[#Fro93|Paper Mayhem Jan/Feb 1993]]. p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/>\n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts. First, the company informs players on the results of the last turn. Next players conduct diplomatic activities, if desired. Then, they send their next turn sheets to the Game Master. Finally, the turn sheets are processed and the cycle is repeated. This continues until the game or a player is done.<ref>[[#Dan20|danard.net 2020]].</ref>\n\n===Diplomacy===\nAccording to ''Paper Mayhem'' assistant editor Jim Townsend, <blockquote>The most important aspect of PBM games is the diplomacy. If you don't communicate with the other players you will be labeled a \"loner,\" \"mute,\" or just plain \"dead meat.\" You must talk with the others to survive.<ref>[[#Tow87|Townsend 1987]]. p. 29.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Player roles===\nPlay-by-mail games provide a wide array of possible [[Role-playing game|roles to play]], from pirates to space characters to \"previously unknown creatures\".<ref name=Loth42>[[#Lot86|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 42.</ref> In the game ''[[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|Monster Island]]'', players assume the role of a monster which explores a massive island.<ref>[[#Hel93|Helzer 1993]]. p. 12.</ref> And the title of the PBM game ''You're An Amoeba, GO!'' indicates an unusual role as players struggle \"in a 3D pool of primordial ooze [directing] the evolution of a legion of micro-organisms\".<ref>[[#Pap94|Paper Mayhem 1994]]. p. 42.</ref> Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but a higher importance of this aspect requires more time searching for the right PBM game.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth42/> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit. A drawback of this type is that mature games have \"factions of significant power and knowledge\" that can pose an unmanageable problem for the beginner\u2014although some may see this situation as a challenge of sorts.<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of open ended games are ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'',<ref>[[#Tow87a|Townsend 1987]]. p. 24.</ref> [[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|''Monster Island'']],<ref>[[#DuB97|DuBois 1997]]. p. 4.</ref> and ''SuperNova: Rise of the Empire''.<ref>[[#Sus19|Suspense & Decision 2019]]. pp. 35\u201340.</ref> \n\nLoth states that most players in closed end games start equally and the games are \"faster paced, usually more intense...presenting frequent player confrontation; [and] the game terminates when a player or alliance of players has achieved specific conditions or eliminated all opposition\".<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of closed end games are ''[[Hyborian War]]'', ''[[It's a Crime (play-by-mail game)|It's a Crime]]'', and ''[[Starweb]]''.\n\n===Computer versus human moderated===\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail gaming companies began leveraging computers to moderate games. To some degree this was an economic decision, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a player's \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth42/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth42/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Complexity===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth, \"Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.\"<ref name=Loth42/> He noted in 1986 that Midguard was a \"very complex game\" with a 100-page instruction manual and \"255 possible line entries\".<ref name=Loth42/><ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' was \"the most complex game system on Earth\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> Other games, like Galactic Prisoners began simply and gradually increased in complexity.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n==Cost and turn processing time==\nLoth noted that, in 1986, $3\u20135 per turn was the most prevalent cost.<ref name=Loth43>[[#Lot86a|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 43.</ref> At the time, some games were free, while some costed as much as $100 per turn.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\nPlay-by-mail magazine ''Paper Mayhem'' stated that the average turn processing time in 1987 was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most popular.<ref>[[#Pap87d|Paper Mayhem Sep/Oct 1987]]. p. 1.</ref><ref name=Loth43/> In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\n==Information sources==\n[[Rick Loomis]] of [[Flying Buffalo]] Games stated in 1985 that the ''Nuts & Bolts of PBM'' (first called ''Nuts & Bolts of Starweb'') was the first PBM magazine not published by a PBM company.<ref name=Loomis36>[[#Loo85|Loomis 1985]]. p. 36.</ref> The name changed to ''Nuts & Bolts of Gaming''<ref name=Loomis36/> and it eventually went out of print.\n\nJohn Kevin Loth stated that, in 1986, the \"three major information sources in PBM\" were ''Paper Mayhem'', ''Flagship Magazine'', and the [[Play By Mail Association]].<ref name=Loth43/> These sources were solely focused on play-by-mail gaming. Additional PBM information sources included company-specific publications, although Rick Loomis stated that these were \"of interest only to their own customers\".<ref name=Loomis36/> Finally, play-by-mail gamers could also draw from \"alliances, associations, and senior players\" for information.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, \"general gaming magazines\" also began venturing into PBM.<ref name=Loomis35>[[#Loo85|Loomis 1985]]. p. 35.</ref> For example, ''[[White Wolf Magazine]]'' also began a regular PBM column beginning in issue #11 as well as publishing an annual PBM issue beginning with issue #16.<ref>[[#Whi88|White Wolf 1988]]. p. 2.</ref><ref>[[#Whi89|White Wolf 1989]]. p. 1.</ref> ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' also carried PBM articles and reviews.<ref name=Loomis35/> Additional minor information sources included magazines such as \"''[[Different Worlds]]'', [[Dragon (magazine)|''Dragon'']], ''[[Game New]]'', [[Imagine (game magazine)|''Imagine'']], and [[White Dwarf (magazine)|''White Dwarf'']]\".<ref name=Loth43/> \n\n''Flagship Magazine'' ran into the 21st Century, but ceased publication in 2010. In November 2013, an online journal for play-by-mail games, ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'', began publication.<ref>[[#Sus13|Suspense & Decision 2013]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of play-by-mail games]]\n* [[Play-by-post role-playing game]]\n* [[Turn-based]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite magazine |last= Babcock|first= Chris  |date= December 2013|title= Diplomacy|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |magazine= Suspense and Decision|location= |publisher= | issue = 2|pages= 16|accessdate= March 20, 2020|ref=Bab13}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= DuBois |first= Steven |date=January\u2013February 1997 |title= Monster Island: A Review|magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=82|page= 4 |ref= DuB97}}\n* {{Cite magazine |first= |last= Editors|date=July\u2013August 1985 |title= Rick Loomis on Play-By-Mail [Editor Intro] |magazine= [[The Space Gamer]] |issue= #75|page= 35 |ref= Edi85}} \n* {{Cite magazine |last= Greenberg|first= Andrew |date=May\u2013June 1993 |title= PBM Corner: A Beginning in Play-By-Mail; Is it Worth It? |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=36|page= 51 |ref= Gre93}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= Helzer|first= Herb |date= January\u2013February 1993 |title= Monster Island: Just One Destination for PBM Company |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=58|page= 12 |ref= Hel93}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= Loomis|first= Rick|date=July\u2013August 1985 |title= Rick Loomis on Play-By-Mail |magazine= [[The Space Gamer]] |issue= #75|pages= 35\u201336 |ref= Loo85}} \n* {{Cite magazine |first= Rick|last= Loomis|date=May 1999 |title= The History of Play-by-Mail and Flying Buffalo |magazine= Flying Buffalo Quarterly |number=79|pages= 2\u20135 |url=http://flyingbuffalo.com/download/fbq79.pdf|accessdate= April 17, 2020|ref= Loo99}} \n* {{cite magazine |last= Loomis|first= Rick  |date= December 2013|title= Letter from Rick Loomis to the Play By Mail/Email/Web/Turn Based Games Community|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |magazine= Suspense and Decision|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association| issue = 2|page= 38|accessdate= March 20, 2020|ref=Loo13}}\n* {{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth III|date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 42 |ref= Lot86}}\n* {{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth III|date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 43 |ref= Lot86a}}\n* {{cite magazine |last= Muir|first= Shannon|date= December 2013|title= Using Play By Mail in a Novel's Plot: The Story Behind for the Love of Airagos|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue-5-Suspense&Decision.pdf|dead-url= |magazine= Suspense and Decision||issue= 5 |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= February 15, 2020|ref= Mui13}}\n* {{cite magazine |first1= Shannon|last1= Muir|first2= John C.|last2= Muir|title= Thoughts on the Evolution of PBM|magazine=Sabledrake Magazine|date= November 2001| url =http://www.sabledrake.com/0111_evolution_PBeM.shtml|issue= |pages= | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20020617165952/http://www.sabledrake.com/0111_evolution_PBeM.shtml| archive-date= June 17, 2002|via= Wayback Machine|access-date= April 19, 2010| ref=Mui02}} Interview with John C.

{"title_page": "Protistology", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2013}}\n\n'''Protistology''' is a scientific discipline devoted to the study of [[protists]], a highly diverse group of [[Microorganism#Eukaryotes|eukaryotic]] organisms. Its field of study overlaps with more traditional disciplines of [[phycology]], [[mycology]], and [[protozoology]], just as protists, which, being a [[paraphyletic group]] embrace [[algae]], some organisms regarded previously as primitive [[fungi]], and [[protozoa]] (\"animal\" motile protists lacking chloroplasts).\n\n==History==\nAs the term \"[[protozoology]]\" has become dated as our understanding of the evolutionary relationships of the eukaryotes has improved, the term \"protistology\" become more common.

The expansion of [[remote sensing]] and the development of [[geographical information systems|GIS-based]] environmental modelling increase the amount of environmental information available for model-building and made it easier to use.<ref name=\"Elith & Leathwick\" />\n\n== Correlative vs mechanistic models ==\n\n=== Correlative SDMs ===\nSDMs originated as correlative models. Correlative SDMs model the observed distribution of a species as a function of geographically referenced climatic predictor variables using multiple regression approaches. Given a set of geographically referred observed presences of a species and a set of climate maps, an algorithm find the most likely environmental ranges within which a species lives. Correlative SDMs assume that species are at equilibrium with their environment and that the relevant environmental variables have been adequately sampled. The models allow for interpolation between a limited number of species occurrences.\n\nFor these algorithms to be effective, it is required to gather observations not only of species presences, but also of absences, that is, where the species does not live. Records of species absences are typically not as common as records of presences, thus often \"random background\" or \"pseudo-absence\" data are used to fit these models. If there are incomplete records of species occurrences, pseudo-absences can introduce bias. Since correlative SDMs are models of a species\u2019 observed distribution, they are models of the [[realized niche]] (the environments where a species ''is'' found), as opposed to the [[fundamental niche]] (the environments where a species ''can'' be found, or where the abiotic environment is appropriate for the survival). For a given species, the realized and fundamental niches might be the same, but if a species is geographically confined due to dispersal limitation or species interactions, the [[realized niche]] will be smaller than the [[fundamental niche]].\n\nCorrelative SDMs are easier and faster to implement than mechanistic SDMs, and can make ready use of available data. Since they are correlative however, they do not provide much information about causal mechanisms and are not good for extrapolation. They will also be inaccurate if the observed species range is not at equilibrium (e.g. if a species has been recently introduced and is actively expanding its range).\n\n=== Mechanistic SDMs ===\nMechanistic SDMs are more recently developed. In contrast to correlative models, mechanistic SDMs use physiological information about a species (taken from controlled field or laboratory studies) to determine the range of environmental conditions within which the species can persist.<ref name=\":0\" /> These models aim to directly characterize the fundamental niche, and to project it onto the landscape. A simple model may simply identify threshold values outside of which a species can't survive. A more complex model may consist of several sub-models, e.g. [[Microclimate|micro-climate]] conditions given macro-climate conditions, body temperature given micro-climate conditions, fitness or other biological rates (e.g. survival, fecundity) given body temperature (thermal performance curves), resource or energy requirements, and [[population dynamics]]. Geographically referenced environmental data are used as model inputs. Because the species distribution predictions are independent of the species\u2019 known range, these models are especially useful for species whose range is actively shifting and not at equilibrium, such as invasive species.\n\nMechanistic SDMs incorporate causal mechanisms and are better for extrapolation and non-equilibrium situations. However, they are more labor-intensive to create than correlational models and require the collection and validation of a lot of physiological data, which may not be readily available. The models require many assumptions and parameter estimates, and they can become very complicated.\n\nDispersal, biotic interactions, and evolutionary processes present challenges, as they aren\u2019t usually incorporated into either correlative or mechanistic models. \n\nCorrelational and mechanistic models can be used in combination to gain additional insights. For example, a mechanistic model could be used to identify areas that are clearly outside the species\u2019 fundamental niche, and these areas can be marked as absences or excluded from analysis.

The models allow for interpolation between a limited number of species occurrences.\n\nFor these algorithms to be effective, it is required to gather observations not only of species presences, but also of absences, that is, where the species does not live. Records of species absences are typically not as common as records of presences, thus often \"random background\" or \"pseudo-absence\" data are used to fit these models. If there are incomplete records of species occurrences, pseudo-absences can introduce bias. Since correlative SDMs are models of a species\u2019 observed distribution, they are models of the [[realized niche]] (the environments where a species ''is'' found), as opposed to the [[fundamental niche]] (the environments where a species ''can'' be found, or where the abiotic environment is appropriate for the survival). For a given species, the realized and fundamental niches might be the same, but if a species is geographically confined due to dispersal limitation or species interactions, the [[realized niche]] will be smaller than the [[fundamental niche]].\n\nCorrelative SDMs are easier and faster to implement than mechanistic SDMs, and can make ready use of available data. Since they are correlative however, they do not provide much information about causal mechanisms and are not good for extrapolation. They will also be inaccurate if the observed species range is not at equilibrium (e.g. if a species has been recently introduced and is actively expanding its range).\n\n=== Mechanistic SDMs ===\nMechanistic SDMs are more recently developed. In contrast to correlative models, mechanistic SDMs use physiological information about a species (taken from controlled field or laboratory studies) to determine the range of environmental conditions within which the species can persist.<ref name=\":0\" /> These models aim to directly characterize the fundamental niche, and to project it onto the landscape. A simple model may simply identify threshold values outside of which a species can't survive. A more complex model may consist of several sub-models, e.g. [[Microclimate|micro-climate]] conditions given macro-climate conditions, body temperature given micro-climate conditions, fitness or other biological rates (e.g. survival, fecundity) given body temperature (thermal performance curves), resource or energy requirements, and [[population dynamics]]. Geographically referenced environmental data are used as model inputs. Because the species distribution predictions are independent of the species\u2019 known range, these models are especially useful for species whose range is actively shifting and not at equilibrium, such as invasive species.\n\nMechanistic SDMs incorporate causal mechanisms and are better for extrapolation and non-equilibrium situations. However, they are more labor-intensive to create than correlational models and require the collection and validation of a lot of physiological data, which may not be readily available. The models require many assumptions and parameter estimates, and they can become very complicated.\n\nDispersal, biotic interactions, and evolutionary processes present challenges, as they aren\u2019t usually incorporated into either correlative or mechanistic models. \n\nCorrelational and mechanistic models can be used in combination to gain additional insights. For example, a mechanistic model could be used to identify areas that are clearly outside the species\u2019 fundamental niche, and these areas can be marked as absences or excluded from analysis.

[[Roman Catholic Marian music|Marian music]] and [[Roman Catholic Marian churches|Marian shrines]] interact with Marian art as key components of Mariology, e.g. the construction of major Marian churches gives rise to major pieces of art for the decoration of the church.<ref>Janusz Rosikon, 2001, ''The Madonnas of Europe: Pilgrimages to the Great Marian Shrines'' {{ISBN|978-0-89870-849-3}}</ref><ref>Edel 2006, ''Madonna: Sacred Art And Holy Music'' {{ISBN|9783937406404}}</ref><ref>University of Dayton Marian Music https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php</ref><ref>Peter Mullen ''Shrines of Our Lady'' {{ISBN|978-0-312-19503-8}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, [[Gabriele Paleotti]]'s ''Discourse on Sacred and Profane Images'' became known as the \"Catechism of images\" for Catholics, given that it established key concepts for the use of images as a form of religious instruction and indoctrination via [[silent preaching]] (''muta predicatio'').<ref name=Mitchell >''The Mystery of the Rosary: Marian Devotion and the Reinvention of Catholicism'' by Nathan Mitchell 2009 {{ISBN|0-8147-9591-9}} pp. 37\u201342</ref><ref name=Barber >''The road from Eden: studies in Christianity and culture'' by John Barber 2008 {{ISBN|1-933146-34-6}} p. 288</ref> Paleotti's approach was implemented by his powerful contemporary Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] and his focus on \"the transformation of Christian life through vision\" and the \"nonverbal [[rules of language]]\" shaped the Catholic reinterpretations of the Virgin Mary in the 16th and 17th centuries and fostered and promoted Marian devotions such as the Rosary.<ref name=Mitchell /><ref name=Barber />\n\nAn example of the interaction of Marian art, culture and churches is [[Salus Populi Romani]], a key Marian icon in Rome at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], the earliest Marian church in Rome. The practice of crowning the images of Mary started at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome by Pope [[Clement VIII]] in the 17th century.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07664a.htm Catholic encyclopedia]</ref> In 1899 Eugenio Pacelli (later [[Pope Pius XII]]) said his first Holy Mass in front of it at the [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. Fifty years later, he physically crowned this picture as part of the first Marian year in Church history, as he proclaimed the [[Queenship of Mary]]. The image was carried from Santa Maria Maggiore around Rome as part of the celebration of the Marian year and the proclamation of the Queenship of Mary.\n\nAnother example is [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]]. Catholics have, for centuries, prayed before this icon, usually in reproductions, to intercede on their behalf to Christ.<ref>Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} pp. 431\u2013433</ref> Over the centuries, several churches dedicated to Our Mother of Perpetual Help have been constructed. Pope [[John Paul II]] held mass at the [[National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help]] in the Philippines where the devotion is very popular and many Catholic churches hold a Novena and Mass honoring it every Wednesday using a replica of the icon, which is also widely displayed in houses, buses and public transport in the Philippines.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1981/february/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19810217_manila-baclaran_en.html Vatican website: Pope John Paul II in the Philippines]</ref><ref>''Culture and customs of the Philippines'' by Paul A.

The widespread Catholic use of replicas of the statue of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] emphasizes devotions to the [[Immaculate Conception]] and the [[Rosary]], both reported in the Lourdes messages. To Catholics, the distinctive blue and white Lourdes statues are reminders of the emphasis of Lourdes on [[Rosary devotions and spirituality|Rosary devotions]] and the millions of pilgrimages to the [[Rosary Basilica]] at Lourdes shows how Churches, devotions and art intertwine within Catholic culture. The Rosary remains the prayer of choice among Catholics who visit Lourdes or venerate the Lourdes statues worldwide.<ref>''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 {{ISBN|90-04-12654-6}} p. 339</ref><ref>''Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac'' by Matthew Bunson 2008 {{ISBN|1-59276-441-X}} p. 123</ref><ref>''The Mystery of the Rosary'' by Nathan Mitchell 2009 {{ISBN|0-8147-9591-9}} p. 193</ref><ref>''China's Catholics'' by Richard Madsen 1998 {{ISBN|0-520-21326-2}} pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nHistorically, Marian art has not only impacted the image of Mary among Catholics, but that of Jesus. The early \"[[Kyrios]] image\" of Jesus as \"the Lord and Master\" was specially emphasized in the [[Pauline Epistles]].<ref name =mercer >''Mercer dictionary of the Bible'' by Watson E.

In the 12th century [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]] in France used the motif of the ''protective mantle'' of the Virgin Mary which shielded the kneeling abbots and abbesses. In the 13th century [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] was also aware of this motif, which eventually led to the iconography of the [[Virgin of Mercy]] and an increased focused on the concept of Marian protection.<ref>Arthur Calkins, Marian Consecration and Entrustment in Burke, Raymond L.; et al.

Some of the earliest Marian churches in Rome date to the 5th century, such as [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] and Santa Maria Maggiore, and these churches were in turn decorated with significant works of art through the centuries.<ref>''Image and Relic: Mediating the Sacred in Early Medieval Rome'' by Erik Thun 2003 {{ISBN|8882652173}} pages 33-35</ref><ref name=Tim37 /> The interaction of Marian art and church construction thus influenced the development of Marian art.<ref>Michael Rose, 2004, ''In Tiers of Glory: The Organic Development of Catholic Church Architecture through the Ages'' Mesa Folio editions, {{ISBN|0967637120}} pages 9-12</ref>\n\nThe Virgin Mary has since become a major subject of Western Art. Masters such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Giotto]], [[Duccio]] and others produced masterpieces with Marian themes.\n\n==Mother of God==\n[[File:Mary & Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints [[Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers|George]], [[Theodore of Amasea|Theodore]] and angels, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].]]\n\nMary's status as the [[Mother of God]] is clear in the Gospels, and the theological implications of this were defined and confirmed by the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431).  Different aspects of Mary's position as mother have been the subject of a large number of works of Catholic art.\n\nThere was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the Council of Ephesus in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].<ref name=Tim37 >''Mary in Western Art'' by Timothy Verdon 2005 {{ISBN|097129819X}} pages 37-40</ref><ref>''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' 2000 {{ISBN|0877790442}} page 408</ref>\n\nBy the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day.  The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[Session of Christ|exaltation]] above other humans.\n\nAt this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.\n\nThe earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.\n\n===Nativity of Jesus===\n{{main|Nativity of Jesus in art}}\n[[File:Nativity (Throne of Maximianus).jpg|thumb|left|120px|Representation of the Nativity on the Throne of Maximianus in [[Ravenna]]]]\n\nThe [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]] has been a major subject of Christian art since the early 4th century. It has been depicted in many different media, both pictorial and sculptural. Pictorial forms include murals, panel paintings, manuscript illuminations, stained glass windows and oil paintings.\nThe earliest representations of the Nativity itself are very simple, just showing the infant, tightly wrapped, lying near the ground in a trough or wicker basket.\n\nA new form of the image, which from the rare early versions seems to have been formulated in 6th-century Palestine, was to set the essential form of Eastern Orthodox images down to the present day. The setting is now a cave - or rather the specific Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem, already underneath the Church of the Nativity, and well-established as a place of pilgrimage, with the approval of the Church.\n[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|thumb|right|210px|''[[Nativity at Night]]'' ({{circa}} 1490) by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]]]]\n\nWestern artists adopted many of the Byzantine iconographic elements, but preferred the scriptural stable to the cave, though [[Duccio]]'s Byzantine-influenced Maest\u00e0 version tries to have both. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or he looks over to her. Suckling is very unusual, but is sometimes shown.\n\nThe image in later medieval Northern Europe was often influenced by the vision of the Nativity of [[Saint Bridget of Sweden]] (1303\u20131373), a very popular mystic. Shortly before her death, she described a vision of the infant Jesus as lying on the ground, and emitting light himself.\n\nFrom the 15th century onwards, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] increasingly became a more common depiction than the Nativity proper. From the 16th century plain Nativities with just the Holy Family, become a clear minority, although [[Caravaggio]] led a return to a more realistic treatment of the ''Adoration of the Shepherds''.\n\nThe perpetual character of Mary's virginity, namely that she was a virgin all her life and not only at her [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]] of [[Jesus Christ]] at the Annunciation (that she was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to him) is alluded to in some forms of Nativity art: [[Salome (Gospel of James)|Salome]], who according to the story in the 2nd-century ''Nativity of Mary''<ref>[http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html Infancy Gospel of James, chapter 20] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611085726/http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html |date=2008-06-11 }}</ref> received physical proof that Mary remained a virgin even in giving birth to Jesus, is found in many depictions of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Comparative Iconography'' by Helene E. Roberts 1998 {{ISBN|1-57958-009-2}} p. 904</ref> Sweaty chimp\n\n===Madonna===\n[[File:Fra Filippo Lippi 002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Filippo Lippi]], 1459]]\n{{main|Madonna (art)}}\nThe depiction of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. Important to Italian tradition are Byzantine icons, especially those created in Constantinople (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring medieval civilization whose icons, such as the [[Hodegetria]], participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties. Western depictions remained heavily dependent on Byzantine types until at least the 13th century.  In the late Middle Ages, the [[Cretan school]], under [[Venice|Venetian]] rule, was the source of great numbers of icons exported to the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western iconography when required.\n\n[[File:Sto Dom de Sil-23.JPG|thumb|left|120px|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] enthroned Madonna, [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]]]]\nIn the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]] free-standing statues, typically about half life-size, of the enthroned Madonna and Child were an original Western development, since monumental sculpture was forbidden by Orthodoxy. The [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] of c. 980 is one of the earliest of these, made of gold applied to a wooden core, and still the subject of considerable local veneration, as is the 12th century [[Virgin of Montserrat]] in [[Catalonia]], a more developed treatment.\n\nWith the growth of monumental panel painting in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, this type was frequently painted at the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout Tuscany. While members of the mendicant orders of the Franciscan and Dominican Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and later homes. Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.\n\n====Some key Madonnas====\n[[File:Gardenenclosed.jpg|180px|thumb|right|''[[Our Lady of Sorrows]]'' by [[Miguel Bejarano Moreno|Moreno]], [[Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden|hermitage in Warfhuizen]], the Netherlands.]]\nA number of Madonna paintings and statues have gathered a following as important religious icons and noteworthy works of art in various regions of the world.\n\nSome Madonnas are known by a general name and concept rendered or depicted by various artists. For instance, [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is the patron saint of several countries such as [[Slovakia]] and [[Philippines]]. It is represented as the Virgin Mary wounded by seven swords in her heart, a reference to the prophecy of Simeon at the [[Presentation of Jesus]]. [[Our Lady of Sorrows, Queen of Poland]] located in the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]] (Poland's largest church) is an important icon in Poland. The term ''Our Lady of Sorrows'' is also used in other contexts, without a Madonna, e.g. for [[Our Lady of Kibeho]] apparitions.\n\nSome Madonnas become the subject of widespread devotion, and the Marian shrines dedicated to them attract millions of pilgrims per year. An example is [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] in Brazil, whose shrine is surpassed in size only by [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]], and receives more pilgrims per year than any other [[Roman Catholic Marian church]] in the world.<ref>''Religions of the World'' by J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann 2003 {{ISBN|1576072231}} pages 308-309</ref>\n\n=====Latin America=====\nThere is a rich tradition of building statues of the Madonna in South America, a sampling of which is shown in the galleries section of this article. The South American tradition of Marian art dates back to the 16th century, with the [[Virgin of Copacabana]] gaining fame in 1582.<ref>''Art and architecture of viceregal Latin America, 1521\u20131821'' by Kelly Donahue-Wallace 2008 {{ISBN|0826334598}}</ref> Some noteworthy examples are:\n\n:* [[Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos]] is located in the small town of [[San Juan de los Lagos]] in Mexico.

The devotion started by the 15th century Portuguese navigators, praying for a safe return to their homes and then spread in Brazil.\n\nImages of, and devotions to, Madonnas such as Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos have spread from Mexico to the United States.<ref>''Mapping the Catholic cultural landscape'' by Richard Fossey 2004 {{ISBN|0-7425-3184-8}} p. 78</ref><ref>''Globalizing the sacred: religion across the Americas'' by Manuel A.

Dall'Orto 26-5-2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Christ and Mary, mosaic, [[Chora Church]], 16th century]]\n{{main|Life of the Virgin}}\nScenes of Mary and Jesus together fall into two main groups: those with an infant Jesus, and those from the last period of his life.  After the episodes of the Nativity, there are a number of further narrative scenes of Mary and the infant Jesus together which are often depicted: the [[Circumcision of Christ]], [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]], [[Flight into Egypt]], and less specific scenes of Mary and Jesus with his cousin [[John the Baptist]], sometimes with John's mother [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Virgin of the Rocks]] is a famous example.  Gatherings of the whole extended family of Jesus form a subject known as the [[Holy Kinship]], popular in the [[Northern Renaissance]].  Mary appears in the background of the only incident in the [[Gospel]]s from the later childhood of Jesus, the [[Finding in the Temple]].\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Michelangelo]]'s [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|''Piet\u00e0'']], 1498]]\nMary is then usually absent from scenes of the period of Christ's life between his [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]] and his Passion, except for the [[Wedding at Cana]], where she is placed in the Gospels.  A non-scriptural subject of [[Christ taking leave of his Mother]] (before going to [[Jerusalem]] at the start of his Passion) was often painted in 15th- and early 16th-century Germany.  Mary is placed at the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] by the Gospels, and is almost invariably shown, with Saint [[John the Evangelist]], in fully depicted works, as well as often being shown in the background of earlier scenes of the [[Passion of Christ]].  The [[rood]] cross common in medieval Western churches had statues of Mary and John flanking a central [[crucifix]].  Mary is shown as present at the [[Deposition of Christ]] and his Entombment; in the late Middle Ages the [[Piet\u00e0]] emerged in Germany as a separate subject, especially in sculpture.  Mary is also included, though this is not mentioned in any of the scriptural accounts, in depictions of the [[Ascension of Jesus]].  After the Ascension, she is the centrally-placed figure in depictions of [[Pentecost]], which is her latest appearance in the Gospels.\n\nThe main scenes above, showing incidents celebrated as [[feast day]]s by the church, formed part of cycles of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' (though the selection of scenes in these varied considerably), as well as the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]''.\n\n==Perpetual virginity==\n[[File:Annunciation Melozzo da Forli Pantheon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Fresco of the Annunciation at the [[Pantheon, Rome]], 15th century]]\n\nThe [[dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is the earliest of the four Marian dogmas and Catholic [[liturgy]] has repeatedly referred to Mary as \"ever virgin\" for centuries.<ref>Marian Dogmas at University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/mariandogmas.html</ref><ref>[http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/liturgy/liturgy.html Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom], [http://www.coptic.net/prayers/StBasilLiturgy.html Coptic Liturgy of St Basil], [http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/liturgy/liturgy_of_st_cyril.pdf Liturgy of St Cyril], [http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm Liturgy of St James]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615045105/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm |date=15 June 2008 }}, [http://www.frmichel.najim.net/liturgyvid.pdf Understanding the Orthodox Liturgy], etc.</ref> The dogma means that Mary was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to [[Jesus Christ]].

In many depictions the angel may be holding a [[Lily flower|lily]], symbolic of Mary's virginity.<ref>''Medieval art: a topical dictionary'' by Leslie Ross 1996 {{ISBN|0-313-29329-5}} p. 16</ref> The mosaics of [[Pietro Cavallini]] in [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome (1291), the [[fresco]]s of [[Giotto]] in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] (1303), [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s fresco at the church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]] (1486) and [[Donatello]]'s gilded sculpture at the church of [[Santa Croce, Florence]] (1435) are famous examples.\n\nThe natural composition of the scene, consisting of two figures facing each other, also made it suitable for decorated arches above doorways.\n\n==Immaculate Conception==\n[[File:Inmaculada Concepcion (La Colosal).jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Murillo]]'s ''Immaculate Conception'', 1650]]\n\nGiven that up to the 13th century a series of saints including [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in general had either opposed or questioned this doctrine, Roman Catholic art on the subject mostly dates to periods after the 15th century and is absent from [[Renaissance]] art. But with support from popular opinion, the [[Franciscans]] and theologians such as [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Duns Scotus]], the popularity of the doctrine increased and a feast-day for it was promoted.\n\n[[File:ImmaculateEmblem.jpg|thumb|right|Swiss emblem, 16th century.]]\n[[Pope Pius V]], the Dominican Pope who in 1570 established the [[Tridentine Mass]], included the feast (but without the adjective \"Immaculate\") in the [[Tridentine Calendar]], but suppressed the existing special Mass for the feast, directing that the Mass for the Nativity of Mary (with the word \"Nativity\" replaced by \"Conception\") be used instead.<ref>[http://civitas-dei.eu/cavendish.htm Paul Cavendish, \"The Tridentine Mass\"]</ref> Part of that earlier Mass was revived in the Mass that [[Pope Pius IX]] ordered to be used on the feast and that is still in use.<ref name=Habig>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/LANDMARY.HTM Marion A. Habig, \"Land of Mary Immaculate\"]</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century there was a widespread intellectual fashion for [[emblem]]s in both religious and secular contexts.  These consisted of a visual representation of the symbol (pictura) and usually a Latin [[motto]]; frequently an explanatory epigram was added. [[Emblem book]]s were very popular.<ref>Emblems for Immaculate Conception {{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211015523/https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |archivedate=2008-12-11 }}</ref>\n\nDrawing on the emblem tradition, [[Francisco Pacheco]] established an iconography that influenced artists such as Murillo, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others. This style of representation of the immaculate Conception then spread to the rest of Europe, and has since remained the usual depiction.\n\nThe [[dogmatic definition]] of Immaculate Conception was performed by [[Pope Pius IX]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'', in 1854. The dogma gained additional significance from the apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858, with the lady in the apparition identifying herself as \"the Immaculate Conception\" and the faithful believing her to be the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n\n===Depiction of the Immaculate Conception===\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Piero di Cosimo]] ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505]]\nFrom an art historical perspective, the depiction of the Immaculate Conception involves a number of interesting issues. Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the [[Immaculate Conception]], and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years.\n\nSince a key Scriptural text pointed to in support of the doctrine was \"[[Tota pulchra es]]...\", \"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee\", verse 4.7 from the [[Song of Solomon]],<ref>[http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html The whole text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529140849/http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html |date=2011-05-29 }}</ref> a number of symbolic objects drawn from the imagery of the ''Song'', and often already associated with the Annunciation and the Perpetual Virginity, were combined in versions of the [[Hortus conclusus]] (\"enclosed garden\") subject. This gave a rather cluttered subject, and usually was impossible to combine with correct perspective, so never caught on outside Germany and the [[Low Countries]]. [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists who tried new solutions, but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\n[[File:10 Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n (National Gallery de Londres, c. 1618).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Immaculate Conception]]'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1618]]\nThe definitive iconography for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] (1564\u20131644), to whom the Inquisition in [[Seville]] also contracted the approval of new images. He described his iconography in his ''Art of Painting'' (''Arte de la Pintura'', published posthumously in 1649):\n\n<blockquote>\"The version that I follow is the one that is closest to the holy revelation of the Evangelist and approved by the Catholic Church on the authority of the sacred and holy interpreters... In this loveliest of mysteries Our Lady should be painted as a beautiful young girl, 12 or 13 years old, in the flower of her youth... And thus she is praised by the Husband: ''tota pulchra es amica mea'', a text that is always written in this painting. She should be painted wearing a white tunic and a blue mantle... She is surrounded by the sun, an oval sun of white and ochre, which sweetly blends into the sky.  Rays of light emanate from her head, around which is a [[Circle of stars|ring of twelve stars]].  An imperial crown adorns her head, without, however, hiding the stars.  Under her feet is the moon. Although it is a solid globe, I take the liberty of making it transparent so that the landscape shows through.\"<ref>''\u00c9sot\u00e9risme, gnoses & imaginaire symbolique: m\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} p. 676</ref><ref>''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R. Katz and Robert A. Orsi 2001 {{ISBN|0-19-514557-7}} p. 98</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSpanish artists such as [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]] (especially), [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others adopted this formula, with variations, and it then spread to the rest of Europe, since when it has remained the usual depiction.\n\nThis particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) [[God]]. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1-2. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[cherubs]]. In some paintings the cherubim are holding [[Lilium candidum|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.\n\n==Assumption of Mary==\n[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Titian]] ''Assumption'', 1516]]\n\nThe Catholic doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of Mary into Heaven]] states that Mary was transported into Heaven with her body and soul united. Although the Assumption was only officially declared a [[Roman Catholic dogma|dogma]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' in 1950, its roots in Catholic culture and art go back many centuries. While Pope [[Pius XII]] deliberately left open the question of whether Mary died before her Assumption, the more common teaching of the early Fathers is that she did.<ref>As the Virgin Mary remained an ever-virgin and sinless, it is viewed that the Virgin Mary could not thus suffer the consequences of [[Original Sin]], which is chiefly Death. http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3819.htm Nicea II Session 6 Decree</ref><ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/NICAEA2.HTM#2 Nicaea II Definition, \"without blemish\"]</ref>\n\nAn early supporter of the Assumption was Saint [[John of Damascus]] (676\u2013794), a [[Doctor of the Church]] who is often called the ''Doctor of the Assumption''.<ref>\nChristopher Rengers, ''The 33 Doctors Of The Church'', Tan Books & Publishers, 200, {{ISBN|0-89555-440-2}}</ref> Saint John was not only interested in the Assumption, but also supported the use of holy images in response to the edict by the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], banning the worship or exhibition of holy images.<ref>Mary H. Allies, ''St. John Damascene on Holy Images, Followed by Three Sermons on the Assumption'' London, 1899.</ref> He wrote: \"On this day the sacred and life-filled ark of the living God, she who conceived her Creator in her womb, rests in the Temple of the Lord that is not made with hands. David, her ancestor, leaps, and with him the angels lead the dance.\"\n\nThe Eastern Church held the feast of the Assumption as early as the second half of the 6th century, and [[Pope Sergius I]] (687\u2013701) ordered its observance in Rome.<ref>University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/maryassump1.html</ref>\n\nThe Orthodox tradition is clear that Mary died normally, before being bodily assumed. The Orthodox term for the death is the [[Dormition of the Virgin]].  Byzantine depictions of this were the basis for Western images, the subject being known as the [[Death of the Virgin]] in the West.  As the nature of the Assumption became controversial during the High Middle Ages, the subject was often avoided, but depiction continued to be common until the Reformation.  The last major Catholic depiction is [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'' of 1606.\n\nMeanwhile, depictions of the Assumption had been becoming more frequent during the late Middle Ages, with the Gothic [[Siena|Siennese]] school a particular source. By the 16th century they had become the norm, initially in Italy, and then elsewhere.  They were sometimes combined with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], as the [[Trinity]] waited in the clouds.  The subject was very suited to Baroque treatment.\n\n==Queen of Heaven==\n{{Main|Queen of Heaven}}\n[[File:SalusPopuliromanicrowned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Salus Populi Romani]] crowned by [[Pope Pius XII]]]]\n\nThe Roman Catholic teaching that Mary is far above all other creatures in dignity, and after [[Jesus Christ]] possesses primacy over all goes back to the early church. Saint [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] said: \"You have surpassed every creature\" and Saint [[Germain of Paris]] (469\u2013576) stated: \"Your honor and dignity surpass the whole of creation; your greatness places you above the angels.\" Saint [[John of Damascus]] went further: \"Limitless is the difference between God's servants and His Mother.\"<ref>Dictionary of Mary, Catholic Book Publishing Co., New York, 1985</ref><ref>[[Ad Caeli Reginam]] 40</ref>\n\n[[File:PiusXIISaluspopuli.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Coronation of the icon by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1954]]\nThe feast of the [[Queenship of Mary]] was only formally established in 1954 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[encyclical]] [[Ad Caeli Reginam]]. Pius XII also declare the first Marian year and a number of [[Roman Catholic Church]] rededications took place, e.g. the 1955 rededication of the church of ''Saint James the Great'' in [[Montreal]] with the new title [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]] a title proclaimed by Pius XII.\n\nYet, long before 1954 the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] had been the subject of a good number of artistic works. Some of these paintings built on the third phase of the Assumption of Mary in which following her Assumption, she is crowned as the ''[[Queen of Heaven]]''.\n\n== Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times ==\n[[File:Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times (by Vito Petrus).jpg|thumb]]\nThis icon has two Gospel passages written on it. The first one is, Mark 14:72.\n\nImmediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.\n\nThe second one is, John 21:15-19.\n\nWhen they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of Jonas, do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my lambs. \u201cA second time he said to him, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cTend my sheep. \u201cHe said to him the third time, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time \u201cDo you love me?\u201d And he said to him, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.\u201d He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God. After this he said to him, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nAs we know by tradition, the apostle Peter was in charge of the rest of the eleven apostles since the beginning even before when Jesus told him, \u201cAnd I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.\u201d Matthew 16:18.\n\nThis means that from the time when Peter denied Jesus and the rooster crowed on Holy Thursday, till the time when Jesus appeared to his disciples for the third time after he was raised from the dead and asked him three times if he loves Him, no one was in charge of the church characterized by the faithful and the apostles, but instead of Peter, Mary the Mother of Jesus was in charge of it, and that is why this icon depicts her with two keys in her hands given to her by Jesus Himself depicted as a child to show that this was already planned by God the Father beforehand.\n\nThe other title Our Lady of the end of Times, is given to her because due to the confusion in the church that we are experiencing today, she is not just in charge of the church instead of the successor of Peter as she was before after Peter\u2019s denial of Jesus, but she has this double title due to the end of times as prophesied by many mystics and in the Bible itself.\n\n==Apparitions==\n[[File:Virgen de F\u00e1tima.JPG|thumb|200px|The statue of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] includes several Catholic elements, such as being apparition-based, being a crowned statue and holding a [[Rosary]]. One of the bullets that wounded [[Pope John Paul II]] in [[St. Peter's Square]] in 1981 was placed in the crown of the statue.<ref name=Guiley >{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Saints |author= [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |year=2001 |isbn= 0-8160-4134-2 |page=162 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]}}</ref>]]\n\nRoman Catholic devotion to Mary has at times been driven by [[Marian apparition|religious experiences and visions]] of simple and modest individuals (in many cases children) on remote hilltops which in time have created strong emotions among large numbers of Roman Catholics. Examples include Saint [[Juan Diego]] in 1531 as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous]] as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858 and [[Lucia dos Santos]], [[Jacinta Marto]] and [[Francisco Marto]] as [[Our Lady of Fatima]] in 1917.<ref>Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}</ref>\n\nAlthough every year over five million pilgrims visit Lourdes and Guadalupe each, the volume of Roman Catholic art to accompany this enthusiasm has been essentially restricted to popular images. Hence although apparitions have resulted in the construction of very large Marian churches at [[Lourdes]] and [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]] they have not so far had a similar impact on Marian art. Yet images such as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] and the artistic renditions of it as statues are not simply works of art but are a central elements of the daily lives of the Mexican people.<ref name= Meade >''A History of Modern Latin America'' by Teresa A.

From the very beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation]] its leaders expressed their discomfort with the depictions of saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition of art developed, the depictions of the Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and view it as a Catholic excess.<ref name=Hillerbrand >''The encyclopedia of Protestantism'' edited by Hans Joachim Hillerbrand 2003 {{ISBN|0-415-92472-3}} pp. 171\u2013173</ref><ref>''Mary in Western art'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} p. 61</ref><ref>''Christian art'' by Beth Williamson 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-280328-X}} pp. 102\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgen del Carmen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The use of Marian [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Brown Scapular]] is a distinguishing feature of Catholic art.]]\nUnlike the majority of the Protestants, the Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Marian images, but in a different manner and with a different emphasis from the Catholic tradition. While statues of the Virgin Mary abound in Catholic churches, there are specific prohibitions against all three-dimensional representations (of Mary or any other any saints) within the Orthodox Church, for they are regarded as remnants of pagan idolatry. Hence the Orthodox only produce and venerate two-dimensional images.<ref name=Benz >''The Eastern Orthodox Church: Its Thought and Life'' by Ernst Benz 2009 {{ISBN|0-202-36298-1}} pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=Mylonas >''Serbian orthodox fundamentals'' by Christos Mylonas 2003 {{ISBN|963-9241-61-X}} pp. 45\u201348</ref><ref name=Flinn >Encyclopedia of Catholicism'' by Frank K.

In fact, there is a three way, carefully coordinated interplay of prayers, icons and [[hymns to Mary]] within Orthodox liturgy, at times with specific feasts that relate to the Theotokos icons and the [[Hymns to Mary|Akathists]].<ref name=Benz /><ref name=Dragas /><ref>''America's religions: from their origins to the twenty-first century'' by Peter W. Williams 2008 {{ISBN|0-252-07551-X}} pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nWhile there is a tradition for the best known Western artists from [[Duccio]] to [[Titian]] to depict the Virgin Mary, most painters of Eastern Orthodox icons have remained anonymous for the production of an icon is not viewed as a \"work of art\" but as a \"sacred craft\" practiced and perfected in monasteries.<ref name=Benz /> To some Eastern Orthodox the natural looking Renaissance depictions used in Catholic art are not conducive to meditation, for they lack the [[kenosis]] needed for Orthodox contemplation. The rich background representation of flowers or gardens found in Catholic art are not present in Orthodox depictions whose primary focus is the Theotokos, often with the [[Child Jesus]].<ref name=McPherson >''Keeping silence: Christian practices for entering stillness'' by C.

Alles 2007 {{ISBN|0-8160-6141-6}} pp. 33\u201334</ref> Apparition-based images such as the statues of the [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] accentuate the differences in that they are based on apparitions that are purely Catholic, as well as being three-dimensional representations. And the presence of [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Rosary]] and the [[Brown Scapular]] on the statues of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] emphasize a totally Catholic form of Marian art.\n\nApart from stylistic issues, significant doctrinal differences separate Catholic Marian art from other Christian approaches. Three examples are the depictions that involve the [[Immaculate Conception]], [[Queen of Heaven]] and the [[Assumption of Mary]]. Given that the Immaculate Conception is a mostly Catholic doctrine, its depictions within other Christian traditions remain rare.<ref>Mark Miravalle, 1993, ''Introduction to Mary'', Queenship Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-882972-06-7}} pp. 64\u201370</ref> The same applies to ''Queen of Heaven'', for long an element of Catholic tradition (and eventually the subject of the encyclical ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'') but its representation within themes such as the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] continue to remain mostly Catholic.<ref name=Reginam >[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_11101954_ad-caeli-reginam_en.html Encyclical ''Ad Caeli Reginam'' on the Vatican website]</ref> While the Eastern Orthodox support the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]], they do not support the Catholic doctrines of the [[Assumption of Mary]] and hence their depictions of the dormition are distinct and the Virgin Mary is usually shown sleeping surrounded by saints, while Catholic depictions often show Mary rising to Heaven.<ref name=Dragas >''Ecclesiasticus II: Orthodox Icons, Saints, Feasts and Prayer'' by George Dion Dragas 2005 {{ISBN|0-9745618-0-0}} pp. 177\u2013178</ref><ref>''Butler's Lives of the Saints: August'' by Alban Butler, Paul Burns 1998 {{ISBN|0-86012-257-3}} p. 147</ref>\n\n==Galleries of Marian art==\n\n===[[Perpetual virginity]]===\n:''For a larger gallery, please see: [[Annunciation in Christian art]]\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"110px\" caption=\"Perpetual virginity\">\nImage:Anunciaci\u00f3n (Mariotto).jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Mariotto Albertinelli]], 15th century\nImage:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo 023.jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo|Murillo]], 1655\nFile:L' Annonciation de 1644, Philippe de Champaigne..jpg|[[Philippe de Champaigne]], 1644\nImage:Pietro Perugino cat23.jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Pietro Perugino]], 1489\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens - Annunciation - WGA20250.jpg|[[Rubens]] ''Annunciation'' 1628 [[Antwerp]]\nImage:Sandro Botticelli 080.jpg|[[Cestello Annunciation (Botticelli)|''Cestello Annunciation'']] by [[Botticelli]], 1490\nFile:The Annunciation, by Francesco Albani.jpg|[[Francesco Albani]] ''Annunciation'' [[Hermitage Museum|The Hermitage]]\nFile:Annunciation nesterov.jpg|[[Mikhail Nesterov]], Russia, 19th century\n</gallery>\n\n===[[Nativity of Jesus|Birth of Jesus]]===\n::''For more images, please see'': [[Salome (disciple)#Gallery of art|Salome images]]\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"110px\" caption=\"Birth of Christ\">\nFile:Adoration of the Magi, ivory, 15th century, perhaps South German - Worcester Art Museum - IMG 7516.JPG|''Adoration of the Magi'', ivory, 15th century\nImage:Marten de vos Nativity.jpg|[[Marten de Vos]], 1577\nFile:Lorenzo Lotto 017.jpg|[[Lorenzo Lotto]], 1523\n<!-- Image:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|[[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]], 1490 -->\nFile:Pietro Perugino 015.jpg|[[Pietro Perugino]], 15th century\nImage:Birthofchristwithangelsberruguete.png|[[Pedro Berruguete]], 15th century\nFile:Giorgione 014.jpg|[[Giorgione]], c1507\nFile:Retablo del Nacimiento.

The practice of crowning the images of Mary started at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome by Pope [[Clement VIII]] in the 17th century.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07664a.htm Catholic encyclopedia]</ref> In 1899 Eugenio Pacelli (later [[Pope Pius XII]]) said his first Holy Mass in front of it at the [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. Fifty years later, he physically crowned this picture as part of the first Marian year in Church history, as he proclaimed the [[Queenship of Mary]]. The image was carried from Santa Maria Maggiore around Rome as part of the celebration of the Marian year and the proclamation of the Queenship of Mary.\n\nAnother example is [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]]. Catholics have, for centuries, prayed before this icon, usually in reproductions, to intercede on their behalf to Christ.<ref>Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} pp. 431\u2013433</ref> Over the centuries, several churches dedicated to Our Mother of Perpetual Help have been constructed.

In the 12th century [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]] in France used the motif of the ''protective mantle'' of the Virgin Mary which shielded the kneeling abbots and abbesses. In the 13th century [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] was also aware of this motif, which eventually led to the iconography of the [[Virgin of Mercy]] and an increased focused on the concept of Marian protection.<ref>Arthur Calkins, Marian Consecration and Entrustment in Burke, Raymond L.; et al.

Masters such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Giotto]], [[Duccio]] and others produced masterpieces with Marian themes.\n\n==Mother of God==\n[[File:Mary & Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints [[Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers|George]], [[Theodore of Amasea|Theodore]] and angels, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].]]\n\nMary's status as the [[Mother of God]] is clear in the Gospels, and the theological implications of this were defined and confirmed by the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431).  Different aspects of Mary's position as mother have been the subject of a large number of works of Catholic art.\n\nThere was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the Council of Ephesus in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].<ref name=Tim37 >''Mary in Western Art'' by Timothy Verdon 2005 {{ISBN|097129819X}} pages 37-40</ref><ref>''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' 2000 {{ISBN|0877790442}} page 408</ref>\n\nBy the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day.  The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[Session of Christ|exaltation]] above other humans.\n\nAt this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.\n\nThe earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.\n\n===Nativity of Jesus===\n{{main|Nativity of Jesus in art}}\n[[File:Nativity (Throne of Maximianus).jpg|thumb|left|120px|Representation of the Nativity on the Throne of Maximianus in [[Ravenna]]]]\n\nThe [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]] has been a major subject of Christian art since the early 4th century. It has been depicted in many different media, both pictorial and sculptural. Pictorial forms include murals, panel paintings, manuscript illuminations, stained glass windows and oil paintings.\nThe earliest representations of the Nativity itself are very simple, just showing the infant, tightly wrapped, lying near the ground in a trough or wicker basket.\n\nA new form of the image, which from the rare early versions seems to have been formulated in 6th-century Palestine, was to set the essential form of Eastern Orthodox images down to the present day. The setting is now a cave - or rather the specific Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem, already underneath the Church of the Nativity, and well-established as a place of pilgrimage, with the approval of the Church.\n[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|thumb|right|210px|''[[Nativity at Night]]'' ({{circa}} 1490) by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]]]]\n\nWestern artists adopted many of the Byzantine iconographic elements, but preferred the scriptural stable to the cave, though [[Duccio]]'s Byzantine-influenced Maest\u00e0 version tries to have both. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or he looks over to her. Suckling is very unusual, but is sometimes shown.\n\nThe image in later medieval Northern Europe was often influenced by the vision of the Nativity of [[Saint Bridget of Sweden]] (1303\u20131373), a very popular mystic. Shortly before her death, she described a vision of the infant Jesus as lying on the ground, and emitting light himself.\n\nFrom the 15th century onwards, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] increasingly became a more common depiction than the Nativity proper. From the 16th century plain Nativities with just the Holy Family, become a clear minority, although [[Caravaggio]] led a return to a more realistic treatment of the ''Adoration of the Shepherds''.\n\nThe perpetual character of Mary's virginity, namely that she was a virgin all her life and not only at her [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]] of [[Jesus Christ]] at the Annunciation (that she was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to him) is alluded to in some forms of Nativity art: [[Salome (Gospel of James)|Salome]], who according to the story in the 2nd-century ''Nativity of Mary''<ref>[http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html Infancy Gospel of James, chapter 20] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611085726/http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html |date=2008-06-11 }}</ref> received physical proof that Mary remained a virgin even in giving birth to Jesus, is found in many depictions of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Comparative Iconography'' by Helene E. Roberts 1998 {{ISBN|1-57958-009-2}} p. 904</ref>\n\n===Madonna===\n[[File:Fra Filippo Lippi 002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Filippo Lippi]], 1459]]\n{{main|Madonna (art)}}\nThe depiction of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. Important to Italian tradition are Byzantine icons, especially those created in Constantinople (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring medieval civilization whose icons, such as the [[Hodegetria]], participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties. Western depictions remained heavily dependent on Byzantine types until at least the 13th century.  In the late Middle Ages, the [[Cretan school]], under [[Venice|Venetian]] rule, was the source of great numbers of icons exported to the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western iconography when required.\n\n[[File:Sto Dom de Sil-23.JPG|thumb|left|120px|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] enthroned Madonna, [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]]]]\nIn the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]] free-standing statues, typically about half life-size, of the enthroned Madonna and Child were an original Western development, since monumental sculpture was forbidden by Orthodoxy. The [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] of c. 980 is one of the earliest of these, made of gold applied to a wooden core, and still the subject of considerable local veneration, as is the 12th century [[Virgin of Montserrat]] in [[Catalonia]], a more developed treatment.\n\nWith the growth of monumental panel painting in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, this type was frequently painted at the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout Tuscany. While members of the mendicant orders of the Franciscan and Dominican Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and later homes. Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.\n\n====Some key Madonnas====\n[[File:Gardenenclosed.jpg|180px|thumb|right|''[[Our Lady of Sorrows]]'' by [[Miguel Bejarano Moreno|Moreno]], [[Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden|hermitage in Warfhuizen]], the Netherlands.]]\nA number of Madonna paintings and statues have gathered a following as important religious icons and noteworthy works of art in various regions of the world.\n\nSome Madonnas are known by a general name and concept rendered or depicted by various artists. For instance, [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is the patron saint of several countries such as [[Slovakia]] and [[Philippines]]. It is represented as the Virgin Mary wounded by seven swords in her heart, a reference to the prophecy of Simeon at the [[Presentation of Jesus]]. [[Our Lady of Sorrows, Queen of Poland]] located in the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]] (Poland's largest church) is an important icon in Poland. The term ''Our Lady of Sorrows'' is also used in other contexts, without a Madonna, e.g. for [[Our Lady of Kibeho]] apparitions.\n\nSome Madonnas become the subject of widespread devotion, and the Marian shrines dedicated to them attract millions of pilgrims per year. An example is [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] in Brazil, whose shrine is surpassed in size only by [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]], and receives more pilgrims per year than any other [[Roman Catholic Marian church]] in the world.<ref>''Religions of the World'' by J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann 2003 {{ISBN|1576072231}} pages 308-309</ref>\n\n=====Latin America=====\nThere is a rich tradition of building statues of the Madonna in South America, a sampling of which is shown in the galleries section of this article. The South American tradition of Marian art dates back to the 16th century, with the [[Virgin of Copacabana]] gaining fame in 1582.<ref>''Art and architecture of viceregal Latin America, 1521\u20131821'' by Kelly Donahue-Wallace 2008 {{ISBN|0826334598}}</ref> Some noteworthy examples are:\n\n:* [[Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos]] is located in the small town of [[San Juan de los Lagos]] in Mexico.

Dall'Orto 26-5-2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Christ and Mary, mosaic, [[Chora Church]], 16th century]]\n{{main|Life of the Virgin}}\nScenes of Mary and Jesus together fall into two main groups: those with an infant Jesus, and those from the last period of his life.  After the episodes of the Nativity, there are a number of further narrative scenes of Mary and the infant Jesus together which are often depicted: the [[Circumcision of Christ]], [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]], [[Flight into Egypt]], and less specific scenes of Mary and Jesus with his cousin [[John the Baptist]], sometimes with John's mother [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Virgin of the Rocks]] is a famous example.  Gatherings of the whole extended family of Jesus form a subject known as the [[Holy Kinship]], popular in the [[Northern Renaissance]].  Mary appears in the background of the only incident in the [[Gospel]]s from the later childhood of Jesus, the [[Finding in the Temple]].\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Michelangelo]]'s [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|''Piet\u00e0'']], 1498]]\nMary is then usually absent from scenes of the period of Christ's life between his [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]] and his Passion, except for the [[Wedding at Cana]], where she is placed in the Gospels.  A non-scriptural subject of [[Christ taking leave of his Mother]] (before going to [[Jerusalem]] at the start of his Passion) was often painted in 15th- and early 16th-century Germany.  Mary is placed at the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] by the Gospels, and is almost invariably shown, with Saint [[John the Evangelist]], in fully depicted works, as well as often being shown in the background of earlier scenes of the [[Passion of Christ]].  The [[rood]] cross common in medieval Western churches had statues of Mary and John flanking a central [[crucifix]].  Mary is shown as present at the [[Deposition of Christ]] and his Entombment; in the late Middle Ages the [[Piet\u00e0]] emerged in Germany as a separate subject, especially in sculpture.  Mary is also included, though this is not mentioned in any of the scriptural accounts, in depictions of the [[Ascension of Jesus]].  After the Ascension, she is the centrally-placed figure in depictions of [[Pentecost]], which is her latest appearance in the Gospels.\n\nThe main scenes above, showing incidents celebrated as [[feast day]]s by the church, formed part of cycles of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' (though the selection of scenes in these varied considerably), as well as the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]''.\n\n==Perpetual virginity==\n[[File:Annunciation Melozzo da Forli Pantheon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Fresco of the Annunciation at the [[Pantheon, Rome]], 15th century]]\n\nThe [[dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is the earliest of the four Marian dogmas and Catholic [[liturgy]] has repeatedly referred to Mary as \"ever virgin\" for centuries.<ref>Marian Dogmas at University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/mariandogmas.html</ref><ref>[http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/liturgy/liturgy.html Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom], [http://www.coptic.net/prayers/StBasilLiturgy.html Coptic Liturgy of St Basil], [http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/liturgy/liturgy_of_st_cyril.pdf Liturgy of St Cyril], [http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm Liturgy of St James]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615045105/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm |date=15 June 2008 }}, [http://www.frmichel.najim.net/liturgyvid.pdf Understanding the Orthodox Liturgy], etc.</ref> The dogma means that Mary was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to [[Jesus Christ]].

In many depictions the angel may be holding a [[Lily flower|lily]], symbolic of Mary's virginity.<ref>''Medieval art: a topical dictionary'' by Leslie Ross 1996 {{ISBN|0-313-29329-5}} p. 16</ref> The mosaics of [[Pietro Cavallini]] in [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome (1291), the [[fresco]]s of [[Giotto]] in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] (1303), [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s fresco at the church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]] (1486) and [[Donatello]]'s gilded sculpture at the church of [[Santa Croce, Florence]] (1435) are famous examples.\n\nThe natural composition of the scene, consisting of two figures facing each other, also made it suitable for decorated arches above doorways.\n\n==Immaculate Conception==\n[[File:Inmaculada Concepcion (La Colosal).jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Murillo]]'s ''Immaculate Conception'', 1650]]\n\nGiven that up to the 13th century a series of saints including [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in general had either opposed or questioned this doctrine, Roman Catholic art on the subject mostly dates to periods after the 15th century and is absent from [[Renaissance]] art. But with support from popular opinion, the [[Franciscans]] and theologians such as [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Duns Scotus]], the popularity of the doctrine increased and a feast-day for it was promoted.\n\n[[File:ImmaculateEmblem.jpg|thumb|right|Swiss emblem, 16th century.]]\n[[Pope Pius V]], the Dominican Pope who in 1570 established the [[Tridentine Mass]], included the feast (but without the adjective \"Immaculate\") in the [[Tridentine Calendar]], but suppressed the existing special Mass for the feast, directing that the Mass for the Nativity of Mary (with the word \"Nativity\" replaced by \"Conception\") be used instead.<ref>[http://civitas-dei.eu/cavendish.htm Paul Cavendish, \"The Tridentine Mass\"]</ref> Part of that earlier Mass was revived in the Mass that [[Pope Pius IX]] ordered to be used on the feast and that is still in use.<ref name=Habig>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/LANDMARY.HTM Marion A. Habig, \"Land of Mary Immaculate\"]</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century there was a widespread intellectual fashion for [[emblem]]s in both religious and secular contexts.  These consisted of a visual representation of the symbol (pictura) and usually a Latin [[motto]]; frequently an explanatory epigram was added. [[Emblem book]]s were very popular.<ref>Emblems for Immaculate Conception {{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211015523/https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |archivedate=2008-12-11 }}</ref>\n\nDrawing on the emblem tradition, [[Francisco Pacheco]] established an iconography that influenced artists such as Murillo, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others. This style of representation of the immaculate Conception then spread to the rest of Europe, and has since remained the usual depiction.\n\nThe [[dogmatic definition]] of Immaculate Conception was performed by [[Pope Pius IX]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'', in 1854. The dogma gained additional significance from the apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858, with the lady in the apparition identifying herself as \"the Immaculate Conception\" and the faithful believing her to be the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n\n===Depiction of the Immaculate Conception===\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Piero di Cosimo]] ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505]]\nFrom an art historical perspective, the depiction of the Immaculate Conception involves a number of interesting issues. Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the [[Immaculate Conception]], and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years.\n\nSince a key Scriptural text pointed to in support of the doctrine was \"[[Tota pulchra es]]...\", \"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee\", verse 4.7 from the [[Song of Solomon]],<ref>[http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html The whole text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529140849/http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html |date=2011-05-29 }}</ref> a number of symbolic objects drawn from the imagery of the ''Song'', and often already associated with the Annunciation and the Perpetual Virginity, were combined in versions of the [[Hortus conclusus]] (\"enclosed garden\") subject. This gave a rather cluttered subject, and usually was impossible to combine with correct perspective, so never caught on outside Germany and the [[Low Countries]]. [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists who tried new solutions, but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\n[[File:10 Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n (National Gallery de Londres, c. 1618).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Immaculate Conception]]'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1618]]\nThe definitive iconography for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] (1564\u20131644), to whom the Inquisition in [[Seville]] also contracted the approval of new images. He described his iconography in his ''Art of Painting'' (''Arte de la Pintura'', published posthumously in 1649):\n\n<blockquote>\"The version that I follow is the one that is closest to the holy revelation of the Evangelist and approved by the Catholic Church on the authority of the sacred and holy interpreters... In this loveliest of mysteries Our Lady should be painted as a beautiful young girl, 12 or 13 years old, in the flower of her youth... And thus she is praised by the Husband: ''tota pulchra es amica mea'', a text that is always written in this painting. She should be painted wearing a white tunic and a blue mantle... She is surrounded by the sun, an oval sun of white and ochre, which sweetly blends into the sky.  Rays of light emanate from her head, around which is a [[Circle of stars|ring of twelve stars]].  An imperial crown adorns her head, without, however, hiding the stars.  Under her feet is the moon. Although it is a solid globe, I take the liberty of making it transparent so that the landscape shows through.\"<ref>''\u00c9sot\u00e9risme, gnoses & imaginaire symbolique: m\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} p. 676</ref><ref>''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R. Katz and Robert A. Orsi 2001 {{ISBN|0-19-514557-7}} p. 98</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSpanish artists such as [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]] (especially), [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others adopted this formula, with variations, and it then spread to the rest of Europe, since when it has remained the usual depiction.\n\nThis particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) [[God]]. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1-2. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[cherubs]]. In some paintings the cherubim are holding [[Lilium candidum|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.\n\n==Assumption of Mary==\n[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Titian]] ''Assumption'', 1516]]\n\nThe Catholic doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of Mary into Heaven]] states that Mary was transported into Heaven with her body and soul united. Although the Assumption was only officially declared a [[Roman Catholic dogma|dogma]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' in 1950, its roots in Catholic culture and art go back many centuries. While Pope [[Pius XII]] deliberately left open the question of whether Mary died before her Assumption, the more common teaching of the early Fathers is that she did.<ref>As the Virgin Mary remained an ever-virgin and sinless, it is viewed that the Virgin Mary could not thus suffer the consequences of [[Original Sin]], which is chiefly Death. http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3819.htm Nicea II Session 6 Decree</ref><ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/NICAEA2.HTM#2 Nicaea II Definition, \"without blemish\"]</ref>\n\nAn early supporter of the Assumption was Saint [[John of Damascus]] (676\u2013794), a [[Doctor of the Church]] who is often called the ''Doctor of the Assumption''.<ref>\nChristopher Rengers, ''The 33 Doctors Of The Church'', Tan Books & Publishers, 200, {{ISBN|0-89555-440-2}}</ref> Saint John was not only interested in the Assumption, but also supported the use of holy images in response to the edict by the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], banning the worship or exhibition of holy images.<ref>Mary H. Allies, ''St. John Damascene on Holy Images, Followed by Three Sermons on the Assumption'' London, 1899.</ref> He wrote: \"On this day the sacred and life-filled ark of the living God, she who conceived her Creator in her womb, rests in the Temple of the Lord that is not made with hands. David, her ancestor, leaps, and with him the angels lead the dance.\"\n\nThe Eastern Church held the feast of the Assumption as early as the second half of the 6th century, and [[Pope Sergius I]] (687\u2013701) ordered its observance in Rome.<ref>University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/maryassump1.html</ref>\n\nThe Orthodox tradition is clear that Mary died normally, before being bodily assumed. The Orthodox term for the death is the [[Dormition of the Virgin]].  Byzantine depictions of this were the basis for Western images, the subject being known as the [[Death of the Virgin]] in the West.  As the nature of the Assumption became controversial during the High Middle Ages, the subject was often avoided, but depiction continued to be common until the Reformation.  The last major Catholic depiction is [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'' of 1606.\n\nMeanwhile, depictions of the Assumption had been becoming more frequent during the late Middle Ages, with the Gothic [[Siena|Siennese]] school a particular source. By the 16th century they had become the norm, initially in Italy, and then elsewhere.  They were sometimes combined with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], as the [[Trinity]] waited in the clouds.  The subject was very suited to Baroque treatment.\n\n==Queen of Heaven==\n{{Main|Queen of Heaven}}\n[[File:SalusPopuliromanicrowned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Salus Populi Romani]] crowned by [[Pope Pius XII]]]]\n\nThe Roman Catholic teaching that Mary is far above all other creatures in dignity, and after [[Jesus Christ]] possesses primacy over all goes back to the early church. Saint [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] said: \"You have surpassed every creature\" and Saint [[Germain of Paris]] (469\u2013576) stated: \"Your honor and dignity surpass the whole of creation; your greatness places you above the angels.\" Saint [[John of Damascus]] went further: \"Limitless is the difference between God's servants and His Mother.\"<ref>Dictionary of Mary, Catholic Book Publishing Co., New York, 1985</ref><ref>[[Ad Caeli Reginam]] 40</ref>\n\n[[File:PiusXIISaluspopuli.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Coronation of the icon by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1954]]\nThe feast of the [[Queenship of Mary]] was only formally established in 1954 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[encyclical]] [[Ad Caeli Reginam]]. Pius XII also declare the first Marian year and a number of [[Roman Catholic Church]] rededications took place, e.g. the 1955 rededication of the church of ''Saint James the Great'' in [[Montreal]] with the new title [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]] a title proclaimed by Pius XII.\n\nYet, long before 1954 the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] had been the subject of a good number of artistic works. Some of these paintings built on the third phase of the Assumption of Mary in which following her Assumption, she is crowned as the ''[[Queen of Heaven]]''.\n\n== Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times ==\n[[File:Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times (by Vito Petrus).jpg|thumb]]\nThis icon has two Gospel passages written on it. The first one is, Mark 14:72.\n\nImmediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.\n\nThe second one is, John 21:15-19.\n\nWhen they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of Jonas, do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my lambs. \u201cA second time he said to him, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cTend my sheep. \u201cHe said to him the third time, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time \u201cDo you love me?\u201d And he said to him, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.\u201d He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God. After this he said to him, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nAs we know by tradition, the apostle Peter was in charge of the rest of the eleven apostles since the beginning even before when Jesus told him, \u201cAnd I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.\u201d Matthew 16:18.\n\nThis means that from the time when Peter denied Jesus and the rooster crowed on Holy Thursday, till the time when Jesus appeared to his disciples for the third time after he was raised from the dead and asked him three times if he loves Him, no one was in charge of the church characterized by the faithful and the apostles, but instead of Peter, Mary the Mother of Jesus was in charge of it, and that is why this icon depicts her with two keys in her hands given to her by Jesus Himself depicted as a child to show that this was already planned by God the Father beforehand.\n\nThe other title Our Lady of the end of Times, is given to her because due to the confusion in the church that we are experiencing today, she is not just in charge of the church instead of the successor of Peter as she was before after Peter\u2019s denial of Jesus, but she has this double title due to the end of times as prophesied by many mystics and in the Bible itself.\n\n==Apparitions==\n[[File:Virgen de F\u00e1tima.JPG|thumb|200px|The statue of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] includes several Catholic elements, such as being apparition-based, being a crowned statue and holding a [[Rosary]]. One of the bullets that wounded [[Pope John Paul II]] in [[St. Peter's Square]] in 1981 was placed in the crown of the statue.<ref name=Guiley >{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Saints |author= [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |year=2001 |isbn= 0-8160-4134-2 |page=162 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]}}</ref>]]\n\nRoman Catholic devotion to Mary has at times been driven by [[Marian apparition|religious experiences and visions]] of simple and modest individuals (in many cases children) on remote hilltops which in time have created strong emotions among large numbers of Roman Catholics. Examples include Saint [[Juan Diego]] in 1531 as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous]] as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858 and [[Lucia dos Santos]], [[Jacinta Marto]] and [[Francisco Marto]] as [[Our Lady of Fatima]] in 1917.<ref>Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}</ref>\n\nAlthough every year over five million pilgrims visit Lourdes and Guadalupe each, the volume of Roman Catholic art to accompany this enthusiasm has been essentially restricted to popular images. Hence although apparitions have resulted in the construction of very large Marian churches at [[Lourdes]] and [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]] they have not so far had a similar impact on Marian art. Yet images such as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] and the artistic renditions of it as statues are not simply works of art but are a central elements of the daily lives of the Mexican people.<ref name= Meade >''A History of Modern Latin America'' by Teresa A.

From the very beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation]] its leaders expressed their discomfort with the depictions of saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition of art developed, the depictions of the Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and view it as a Catholic excess.<ref name=Hillerbrand >''The encyclopedia of Protestantism'' edited by Hans Joachim Hillerbrand 2003 {{ISBN|0-415-92472-3}} pp. 171\u2013173</ref><ref>''Mary in Western art'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} p. 61</ref><ref>''Christian art'' by Beth Williamson 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-280328-X}} pp. 102\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgen del Carmen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The use of Marian [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Brown Scapular]] is a distinguishing feature of Catholic art.]]\nUnlike the majority of the Protestants, the Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Marian images, but in a different manner and with a different emphasis from the Catholic tradition. While statues of the Virgin Mary abound in Catholic churches, there are specific prohibitions against all three-dimensional representations (of Mary or any other any saints) within the Orthodox Church, for they are regarded as remnants of pagan idolatry. Hence the Orthodox only produce and venerate two-dimensional images.<ref name=Benz >''The Eastern Orthodox Church: Its Thought and Life'' by Ernst Benz 2009 {{ISBN|0-202-36298-1}} pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=Mylonas >''Serbian orthodox fundamentals'' by Christos Mylonas 2003 {{ISBN|963-9241-61-X}} pp. 45\u201348</ref><ref name=Flinn >Encyclopedia of Catholicism'' by Frank K.

Gordon Melton 2007 ISBN pp. 244\u2013245</ref><ref name=Dragas />\n\nCatholic Marian images are almost entirely [[Marian devotions|devotional]] depictions and do not have an official standing within liturgy, but Eastern icons are an inherent part of Orthodox liturgy. In fact, there is a three way, carefully coordinated interplay of prayers, icons and [[hymns to Mary]] within Orthodox liturgy, at times with specific feasts that relate to the Theotokos icons and the [[Hymns to Mary|Akathists]].<ref name=Benz /><ref name=Dragas /><ref>''America's religions: from their origins to the twenty-first century'' by Peter W. Williams 2008 {{ISBN|0-252-07551-X}} pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nWhile there is a tradition for the best known Western artists from [[Duccio]] to [[Titian]] to depict the Virgin Mary, most painters of Eastern Orthodox icons have remained anonymous for the production of an icon is not viewed as a \"work of art\" but as a \"sacred craft\" practiced and perfected in monasteries.<ref name=Benz /> To some Eastern Orthodox the natural looking Renaissance depictions used in Catholic art are not conducive to meditation, for they lack the [[kenosis]] needed for Orthodox contemplation. The rich background representation of flowers or gardens found in Catholic art are not present in Orthodox depictions whose primary focus is the Theotokos, often with the [[Child Jesus]].<ref name=McPherson >''Keeping silence: Christian practices for entering stillness'' by C. W. McPherson {{ISBN|0-8192-1910-X}}, 2002 p. 48</ref><ref>''The encyclopedia of world religions'' by Robert S. Ellwood, Gregory D. Alles 2007 {{ISBN|0-8160-6141-6}} pp. 33\u201334</ref> Apparition-based images such as the statues of the [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] accentuate the differences in that they are based on apparitions that are purely Catholic, as well as being three-dimensional representations. And the presence of [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Rosary]] and the [[Brown Scapular]] on the statues of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] emphasize a totally Catholic form of Marian art.\n\nApart from stylistic issues, significant doctrinal differences separate Catholic Marian art from other Christian approaches. Three examples are the depictions that involve the [[Immaculate Conception]], [[Queen of Heaven]] and the [[Assumption of Mary]]. Given that the Immaculate Conception is a mostly Catholic doctrine, its depictions within other Christian traditions remain rare.<ref>Mark Miravalle, 1993, ''Introduction to Mary'', Queenship Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-882972-06-7}} pp. 64\u201370</ref> The same applies to ''Queen of Heaven'', for long an element of Catholic tradition (and eventually the subject of the encyclical ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'') but its representation within themes such as the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] continue to remain mostly Catholic.<ref name=Reginam >[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_11101954_ad-caeli-reginam_en.html Encyclical ''Ad Caeli Reginam'' on the Vatican website]</ref> While the Eastern Orthodox support the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]], they do not support the Catholic doctrines of the [[Assumption of Mary]] and hence their depictions of the dormition are distinct and the Virgin Mary is usually shown sleeping surrounded by saints, while Catholic depictions often show Mary rising to Heaven.<ref name=Dragas >''Ecclesiasticus II: Orthodox Icons, Saints, Feasts and Prayer'' by George Dion Dragas 2005 {{ISBN|0-9745618-0-0}} pp. 177\u2013178</ref><ref>''Butler's Lives of the Saints: August'' by Alban Butler, Paul Burns 1998 {{ISBN|0-86012-257-3}} p. 147</ref>\n\n==Galleries of Marian art==\n\n===[[Perpetual virginity]]===\n:''For a larger gallery, please see: [[Annunciation in Christian art]]\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"110px\" caption=\"Perpetual virginity\">\nImage:Anunciaci\u00f3n (Mariotto).jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Mariotto Albertinelli]], 15th century\nImage:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo 023.jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo|Murillo]], 1655\nFile:L' Annonciation de 1644, Philippe de Champaigne..jpg|[[Philippe de Champaigne]], 1644\nImage:Pietro Perugino cat23.jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Pietro Perugino]], 1489\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens - Annunciation - WGA20250.jpg|[[Rubens]] ''Annunciation'' 1628 [[Antwerp]]\nImage:Sandro Botticelli 080.jpg|[[Cestello Annunciation (Botticelli)|''Cestello Annunciation'']] by [[Botticelli]], 1490\nFile:The Annunciation, by Francesco Albani.jpg|[[Francesco Albani]] ''Annunciation'' [[Hermitage Museum|The Hermitage]]\nFile:Annunciation nesterov.jpg|[[Mikhail Nesterov]], Russia, 19th century\n</gallery>\n\n===[[Nativity of Jesus|Birth of Jesus]]===\n::''For more images, please see'': [[Salome (disciple)#Gallery of art|Salome images]]\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"110px\" caption=\"Birth of Christ\">\nFile:Adoration of the Magi, ivory, 15th century, perhaps South German - Worcester Art Museum - IMG 7516.JPG|''Adoration of the Magi'', ivory, 15th century\nImage:Marten de vos Nativity.jpg|[[Marten de Vos]], 1577\nFile:Lorenzo Lotto 017.jpg|[[Lorenzo Lotto]], 1523\n<!-- Image:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|[[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]], 1490 -->\nFile:Pietro Perugino 015.jpg|[[Pietro Perugino]], 15th century\nImage:Birthofchristwithangelsberruguete.png|[[Pedro Berruguete]], 15th century\nFile:Giorgione 014.jpg|[[Giorgione]], c1507\nFile:Retablo del Nacimiento.
