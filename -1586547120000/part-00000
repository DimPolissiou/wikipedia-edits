The Stephens Party is significant in California history because they were the first wagon train to cross the [[Sierra Nevada (United States)|Sierra Nevada]] during the expansion of the [[American West]]. In 1844, they pioneered the first route at or near what was later named [[Donner Pass]]. The crossing was a year before [[John Charles Fremont#Third expedition|John C. Fremont]], two years before the [[Donner Party]], and five years before the 1848\u201349 Gold Rush.\n\n==Journey==\nThe 50-member Stephens group left near present-day [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] on May 22, 1844. They departed with a larger group of [[Oregon]]-bound settlers in a train of 40 wagons. Fifty travelers left Iowa; 52 arrived in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] with the Stephens party, as there were two births along the way. [[Elisha Stephens]] was elected captain of the wagon train because he had spent several years as a [[mountain man]] and [[beaver]] hunter in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. He also had skills as a [[blacksmith]]. He had worked at the [[Potawatomi]] Council Bluffs US Indian Subagency before resigning to go to California.\n\nDr. John Townsend, his wife Elizabeth, and her younger brother Moses Schallenberger, were also going west.  A man of vision, Townsend wanted a chance at grand adventure and opportunity in California. He would become the first licensed [[physician]] in California.\n\nThe largest family group in the party was headed by Martin Murphy, Sr. His family had 23 members. As Irish [[Catholic]]s, the Murphy family, along with the Martin and Sullivan families, were seeking religious, economic, and political freedoms in the West. The group included James Miller (1814\u20131890), an Irishman, who would marry  Martin Murphy, Sr.'s third daughter and settle at Rancho San Pedro, Santa Margarita y Las Gallinas near [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Irish Families on the California Trail: Pioneers and 49ers from the Earliest Days Including the Gold Rush & San Francisco |author=Michael C.

In [[Wyoming]], Hitchcock, who had been \"trapping and trading\" in California in 1832, led the party west from the Big Sandy River to the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] bypassing [[Fort Bridger]]. The [[Emigrant Trail in Wyoming#Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff|cutoff]] was dangerous, as it crossed {{convert|40|mi|km}} without water for livestock, but it cut {{convert|85|mi|km}} and 7 days off the established route. The cutoff was later popularized in a guide book and used heavily by miners heading to the [[California Gold Rush]].\n\nIn the Sierra Nevada they encountered snow and  on November 14, 1844, the party split.  Six of the party, including Elizabeth Townsend, set off on horseback following the [[Truckee River]] southward with the aim of reaching Sutter Fort quickly and sending help back.  They became the first Americans to step foot on the shore of [[Lake Tahoe]] on November 16 ([[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] had been the first American to see it the previous February). They arrived at Sutters Fort on December 10.<ref name=\"truckee\">{{cite web |title=The First Pioneer Wagons Crossed the Sierra Over 160 Years Ago |url=https://www.truckeehistory.org/the-first-pioneer-wagons-crossed-the-sierra-over-160-years-ago.html |website=Truckee-Donner Historical Society |accessdate=29 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref> \n\nThe rest of the party continued until reaching Truckey's (or Truckee) Lake (now [[Donner Lake]]).  Here they left six of their eleven wagons because of difficulties getting the wagons over the pass and continued with the remaining five.  At one point they had to unhitch the wagons and haul them up a cliff with makeshift pulleys while the oxen were led up through a narrow slot.  On November 25 they managed to reach the top of the pass.  Three men, Joseph Foster, Allan Montgomery, and Moses Schallenberger, returned to the wagons with the intent of watching over them until the snow melted.  They quickly put up a cabin (later used by the Donner Party) but soon realized that it would be very difficult for them to survive the winter.  On makeshift snowshoes they set out after the party ahead of them but after the first day the youngest, eighteen-year-old Moses Schallenberger realized he couldn't make it and returned to the wagons.  He survived only by trapping [[Sierra Nevada red fox|High Sierra fox]]es for food.<ref name=\"truckee\"/>\n\nThe rest of the party after crossing the pass continued until snow made it impossible to continue with wagons on the upper [[Yuba River]] valley. They set up camp and, on December 6, 17 of the adult men continue in order to find help while the women, children, and two adult men remained in the camp.  Unfortunately most of the men were enticed or coerced to fight with [[John A. Sutter|Captain John Sutter]] for Mexican California Governor [[Manuel Micheltorena]] in exchange for promises of land grants. Instead of joining them, Dennis Martin returned to the upper Yuba with supplies for the women and children.

The Stephens Party is significant in California history because they were the first wagon train to cross the [[Sierra Nevada (United States)|Sierra Nevada]] during the expansion of the [[American West]]. In 1844, they pioneered the first route at or near what was later named [[Donner Pass]]. The crossing was a year before [[John Charles Fremont#Third expedition|John C. Fremont]], two years before the [[Donner Party]] and five years before the 1848\u201349 Gold Rush.\n\n==Journey==\nThe 50-member Stephens group left near present-day [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] on May 22, 1844. They departed with a larger group of [[Oregon]]-bound settlers in a train of 40 wagons. Fifty travelers left Iowa; 52 arrived in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] with the Stephens party, as there were two births along the way. [[Elisha Stephens]] was elected captain of the wagon train because he had spent several years as a [[mountain man]] and [[beaver]] hunter in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. He also had skills as a [[blacksmith]]. He had worked at the [[Potawatomi]] Council Bluffs US Indian Subagency before resigning to go to California.\n\nDr. John Townsend, his wife Elizabeth, and her younger brother Moses Schallenberger, were also going west.  A man of vision, Townsend wanted a chance at grand adventure and opportunity in California. He would become the first licensed [[physician]] in California.\n\nThe largest family group in the party was headed by Martin Murphy, Sr. His family had 23 members. As Irish [[Catholic]]s, the Murphy family, along with the Martin and Sullivan families, were seeking religious, economic, and political freedoms in the West. The group included James Miller (1814\u20131890), an Irishman, who would marry  Martin Murphy, Sr.'s third daughter and settle at Rancho San Pedro, Santa Margarita y Las Gallinas near [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Irish Families on the California Trail: Pioneers and 49ers from the Earliest Days Including the Gold Rush & San Francisco |author=Michael C.

In [[Wyoming]], Hitchcock, who had been \"trapping and trading\" in California in 1832, led the party west from the Big Sandy River to the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] bypassing [[Fort Bridger]]. The [[Emigrant Trail in Wyoming#Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff|cutoff]] was dangerous, as it crossed {{convert|40|mi|km}} without water for livestock, but it cut {{convert|85|mi|km}} and 7 days off the established route. The cutoff was later popularized in a guide book and used heavily by miners heading to the [[California Gold Rush]].\n\nIn the Sierra Nevada they encountered snow and  on November 14, 1844, the party split.  Six of the party, including Elizabeth Townsend, set off on horseback following the [[Truckee River]] southward with the aim of reaching Sutter Fort quickly and sending help back.  They became the first Americans to step foot on the shore of [[Lake Tahoe]] on November 16 ([[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] had been the first American to see it the previous February). They arrived at Sutters Fort on December 10.<ref name=\"truckee\">{{cite web |title=The First Pioneer Wagons Crossed the Sierra Over 160 Years Ago |url=https://www.truckeehistory.org/the-first-pioneer-wagons-crossed-the-sierra-over-160-years-ago.html |website=Truckee-Donner Historical Society |accessdate=29 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref> \n\nThe rest of the party continued until reaching Truckey's (or Truckee) Lake (now [[Donner Lake]]).  Here they left six of their eleven wagons because of difficulties getting the wagons over the pass and continued with the remaining five.  At one point they had to unhitch the wagons and haul them up a cliff with makeshift pulleys while the oxen were led up through a narrow slot.  On November 25 they managed to reach the top of the pass.  Three men, Joseph Foster, Allan Montgomery, and Moses Schallenberger, returned to the wagons with the intent of watching over them until the snow melted.  They quickly put up a cabin (later used by the Donner Party) but soon realized that it would be very difficult for them to survive the winter.  On makeshift snowshoes they set out after the party ahead of them but after the first day the youngest, eighteen-year-old Moses Schallenberger realized he couldn't make it and returned to the wagons.  He survived only by trapping [[Sierra Nevada red fox|High Sierra fox]]es for food.<ref name=\"truckee\"/>\n\nThe rest of the party after crossing the pass continued until snow made it impossible to continue with wagons on the upper [[Yuba River]] valley. They set up camp and, on December 6, 17 of the adult men continue in order to find help while the women, children, and two adult men remained in the camp.  Unfortunately most of the men were enticed or coerced to fight with [[John A. Sutter|Captain John Sutter]] for Mexican California Governor [[Manuel Micheltorena]] in exchange for promises of land grants. Instead of joining them, Dennis Martin returned to the upper Yuba with supplies for the women and children. Upon learning of the plight of Moses Schallenberger, twenty-three-year-old Martin crossed the snowbound [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in mid-winter (February, 1845) to rescue Schallenberger at Donner Lake.<ref name=Regnery>{{cite journal |title=Dennis Martin once owned Stanford's backlands, including SLAC, Jasper Ridge, and Webb Ranch |author=Dorothy Regnery |journal=Stanford Historical Society Newsletter |date=September 1983 |url=http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfST/ST7no3.pdf |accessdate=2011-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927162417/http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfST/ST7no3.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref> Martin showed Schallenberger how to construct proper snowshoes and successfully the two recrossed the Sierras to the Central Valley.<ref>{{cite book |title=Moses Schallenberger at Truckey's Lake, 1844-1845 |author=Moses Schallenberger |editor=Charles H.

Written by Jeunet with Guillaume Laurant, the film is a whimsical depiction of contemporary Parisian life, set in [[Montmartre]]. It tells the story of a shy waitress, played by [[Audrey Tautou]], who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better while struggling with her own isolation. The film was a [[International co-production|co-production]] between companies in [[Cinema of France|France]] and [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]]. Taking in over $33&nbsp;million in a limited theatrical release, it is to date the highest-grossing French-language film released in the United States, and one of the biggest international successes for a French movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=foreign.htm&sort=gross&order=DESC&p=.htm |title=Foreign Language Movies at the Box Office |website=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe film received critical acclaim and was a major box office success. ''Am\u00e9lie'' won [[European Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]] at the [[European Film Awards]]; it also won four [[C\u00e9sar Award]]s in 2002 (including [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]]), two [[55th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] (including [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]), and was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Paris - Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins - 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Am\u00e9lie works at the [[Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins]] in Montmartre]]\n\nAm\u00e9lie Poulain is born in June 1974 and brought up by eccentric parents who \u2013 incorrectly believing that she has a heart defect \u2013 decide to home-school her. To cope with her loneliness, Am\u00e9lie develops an active imagination and a mischievous personality. When Am\u00e9lie is six, her mother, Amandine, is killed when a suicidal Canadian tourist jumps from the roof of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and lands on her. As a result, her father Rapha\u00ebl ([[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]]) withdraws more and more from society. Am\u00e9lie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the [[Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins]] in [[Montmartre]], which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. She is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks and cracking [[cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]] with a spoon.\n\nOn 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], Am\u00e9lie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box of childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Am\u00e9lie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others.\n\nAfter asking the apartment's concierge and several old tenants about the boy's identity, Am\u00e9lie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with [[Osteogenesis imperfecta|brittle bone disease]] who repaints [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'''s [[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]'' every year. He recalls the boy's name as \"Bretodeau\". Am\u00e9lie quickly finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau, and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Am\u00e9lie happily embarks on her new mission.\n\nAm\u00e9lie secretly executes complex schemes that affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the M\u00e9tro station, giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his [[garden gnome]] and having a flight attendant friend [[airmail]] pictures of it [[Travelling gnome prank|posing with landmarks from all over the world]]. She starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker Georgette and Joseph, one of the customers in the bar. She convinces Madeleine Wallace, the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She [[Gaslighting|gaslights]] Collignon, the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek but good-natured assistant Lucien. A delighted Lucien takes charge at the grocery stand.\n\nMr. Dufayel, having observed Am\u00e9lie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, Am\u00e9lie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Am\u00e9lie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Am\u00e9lie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Am\u00e9lie retrieves it.\n\nAm\u00e9lie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Am\u00e9lie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina ([[Clotilde Mollet]]), concerned for Am\u00e9lie's well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph's comment about this misleads Am\u00e9lie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayel's insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship. Am\u00e9lie finally finds happiness for herself.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Audrey Tautou]] as Am\u00e9lie Poulain \n** Flora Guiet as young Am\u00e9lie\n* [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] as Nino Quincampoix\n** Amaury Babault as young Nino\n* [[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]] as Rapha\u00ebl Poulain, Am\u00e9lie's father\n* [[Serge Merlin]] as Raymond Dufayel, \"The Glass Man\"\n* [[Lorella Cravotta]] as Amandine Poulain, Am\u00e9lie's mother\n* [[Clotilde Mollet]] as Gina, a fellow waitress\n* [[Claire Maurier]] as Suzanne, the owner of Caf\u00e9 des Deux Moulins\n* [[Isabelle Nanty]] as Georgette, the resident hypochondriac\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] as Joseph\n* [[Artus de Penguern]] as Hipolito, the writer\n* [[Yolande Moreau]] as Madeleine Wallace (Wells, in English subtitled version)\n* [[Urbain Cancelier]] as Collignon, the grocer\n* [[Jamel Debbouze]] as Lucien, the grocer's assistant\n* [[Maurice B\u00e9nichou]] as Dominique Bretodeau\n** Kevin Fernandes as young Dominique\n* [[Michel Robin]] as Mr. Collignon\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Damant]] as Mrs. Collignon\n* [[Claude Perron]] as Eva, Nino's colleague\n* [[Armelle]] as Philom\u00e8ne, air hostess\n* [[Ticky Holgado]] as Man in a photo\n* [[Fabienne Chaudat]] as The woman in a coma\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:20051018\u00c9picerie d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain 2.jpg|thumb|Au March\u00e9 de la Butte, Rue des Trois Fr\u00e8res, Paris, used as the location of Monsieur Collignon's shop]]\n\nIn his [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], Jeunet explains that he originally wrote the role of Am\u00e9lie for the English actress [[Emily Watson]]. In that first draft, Am\u00e9lie's father was an Englishman living in London. However, Watson's French was not strong, and when she became unavailable to shoot the film, owing to a conflict with the filming of ''[[Gosford Park]]'', Jeunet rewrote the screenplay for a French actress.

To cope with her loneliness, Am\u00e9lie develops an active imagination and a mischievous personality. When Am\u00e9lie is six, her mother, Amandine, is killed when a suicidal Canadian tourist jumps from the roof of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and lands on her. As a result, her father Rapha\u00ebl ([[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]]) withdraws more and more from society. Am\u00e9lie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the [[Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins]] in [[Montmartre]], which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. She is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks and cracking [[cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]] with a spoon.\n\nOn 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], Am\u00e9lie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box of childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Am\u00e9lie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others.\n\nAfter asking the apartment's concierge and several old tenants about the boy's identity, Am\u00e9lie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with [[Osteogenesis imperfecta|brittle bone disease]] who repaints [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'''s [[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]'' every year. He recalls the boy's name as \"Bretodeau\". Am\u00e9lie quickly finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau, and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Am\u00e9lie happily embarks on her new mission.\n\nAm\u00e9lie secretly executes complex schemes that affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the M\u00e9tro station, giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his [[garden gnome]] and having a flight attendant friend [[airmail]] pictures of it [[Travelling gnome prank|posing with landmarks from all over the world]]. She starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker Georgette and Joseph, one of the customers in the bar. She convinces Madeleine Wallace, the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She [[Gaslighting|gaslights]] Collignon, the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek but good-natured assistant Lucien. A delighted Lucien takes charge at the grocery stand.\n\nMr. Dufayel, having observed Am\u00e9lie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, Am\u00e9lie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Am\u00e9lie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Am\u00e9lie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Am\u00e9lie retrieves it.\n\nAm\u00e9lie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Am\u00e9lie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina ([[Clotilde Mollet]]), concerned for Am\u00e9lie's well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph's comment about this misleads Am\u00e9lie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayel's insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship. Am\u00e9lie finally finds happiness for herself.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Audrey Tautou]] as Am\u00e9lie Poulain \n** Flora Guiet as young Am\u00e9lie\n* [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] as Nino Quincampoix\n** Amaury Babault as young Nino\n* [[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]] as Rapha\u00ebl Poulain, Am\u00e9lie's father\n* [[Serge Merlin]] as Raymond Dufayel, \"The Glass Man\"\n* [[Lorella Cravotta]] as Amandine Poulain, Am\u00e9lie's mother\n* [[Clotilde Mollet]] as Gina, a fellow waitress\n* [[Claire Maurier]] as Suzanne, the owner of Caf\u00e9 des Deux Moulins\n* [[Isabelle Nanty]] as Georgette, the resident hypochondriac\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] as Joseph\n* [[Artus de Penguern]] as Hipolito, the writer\n* [[Yolande Moreau]] as Madeleine Wallace (Wells, in English subtitled version)\n* [[Urbain Cancelier]] as Collignon, the grocer\n* [[Jamel Debbouze]] as Lucien, the grocer's assistant\n* [[Maurice B\u00e9nichou]] as Dominique Bretodeau\n** Kevin Fernandes as young Dominique\n* [[Michel Robin]] as Mr. Collignon\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Damant]] as Mrs. Collignon\n* [[Claude Perron]] as Eva, Nino's colleague\n* [[Armelle]] as Philom\u00e8ne, air hostess\n* [[Ticky Holgado]] as Man in a photo\n* [[Fabienne Chaudat]] as The woman in a coma\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:20051018\u00c9picerie d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain 2.jpg|thumb|Au March\u00e9 de la Butte, Rue des Trois Fr\u00e8res, Paris, used as the location of Monsieur Collignon's shop]]\n\nIn his [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], Jeunet explains that he originally wrote the role of Am\u00e9lie for the English actress [[Emily Watson]].

{"title_page": "Edward Fitz-Symon", "text_new": "'''Edward Fitz-Symon''' (''[[circa|c.]]'' 1530\u20131593) was a leading Irish [[barrister]] and judge of the [[Elizabethan era]]. He held the offices of [[Attorney General for Ireland]], [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)]] and [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]]. Despite his appointment  these senior offices, he was derided by  his contemporaries as being a man of \"mean learning\".\n\n==Family==\nFitz-Symon was born in [[Dublin]]. Little seems to be known of his family, although the surname is quite common in Ireland.  An earlier bearer of the name was the explorer [[Symon Semeonis]] (aka Simon FitzSimon or Simon FitzSimmons). [[Walter Fitzsimon]], son of one Robert Fitzsimon of Dublin, was [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] 1484-1511. [[James Stanyhurst]], [[Recorder of Dublin]] and Speaker of the  [[Irish House of Commons]], married into the Fitzsimon family.\n\n==Career==\n\nEdward entered the [[Inner Temple]] in 1555, but had returned to Ireland to practice at the [[Irish Bar]] by 1563.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921'' John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p. 219</ref> He was justice of the Liberty of [[Wexford]] and Commissioner for [[Munster]]. In 1570 he was made Attorney General, and in 1574 he became Serjeant-at-law, holding that office until his death in 1593.<ref>Ball p.219</ref> In 1578 when the controversial judge [[Nicholas White]] was removed from office as Master of the Rolls, Fitz-Symon replaced him. He was an unusual choice since serjeants in that era rarely became judges, due largely to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth's]] low opinion of her Irish law officers. In any case the appointment was only a temporary one since White was restored to office within a few months.<ref>Ball p.219</ref>\n\nWe have some glimpses of Fitz-Symon's official work: in 1577, during the height of the \"cess\" controversy, concerning the power of the Crown to levy taxes on the [[Anglo-Irish]]  gentry of [[the Pale]]  for the upkeep of military [[garrisons]], the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], Sir [[William Gerard (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)|William Gerard]], called on him to give an important opinion on the [[royal prerogative]].<ref>Crawford, Jon G. ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber 1571-1641'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p.113</ref> On another occasion he was asked to advise on a commission to reform the customs at [[Chester]], but refused on the ground that he did not have adequate time.<ref>Hart, A. R. '' History of the King's Serjeants at law in Ireland'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2000 p.43</ref> Gerard was clearly unimpressed by Fitz-Symon's  abilities, calling him a man \"of mean learning\".<ref>Kenny, Colum ''King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland'' Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.57</ref>\n\nFitz-Symon pleaded regularly before the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]], and often sat in a quasi-judicial capacity. In 1572 he sat on a commission to inquire into the extent of the former lands of the O'Doyne clan, and decide whether they should be incorporated into [[County Laois|Queen's County]].<ref>''Deputy Keeper of Public Records in Ireland'' 13th Report p.74</ref> Later the same year he sat on the commission to oversee the muster of troops in Dublin.

He held the offices of [[Attorney General for Ireland]], [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)]] and [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]]. Despite his appointment  these senior offices, he was derided by  his contemporaries as being a man of \"mean learning\".\n\n==Family==\nFitz-Symon was born in [[Dublin]]. Little seems to be known of his family, although the surname is quite common in Ireland.  An earlier bearer of the name was the explorer [[Symon Semeonis]] (aka Simon FitzSimon or Simon FitzSimmons). [[Walter Fitzsimon]], son of one Robert Fitzsimon of Dublin, was [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] 1484-1511. [[James Stanyhurst]], [[Recorder of Dublin]] and Speaker of the  [[Irish House of Commons]], married into the Fitzsimon family.\n\n==Career==\n\nEdward entered the [[Inner Temple]] in 1555, but had returned to Ireland to practice at the [[Irish Bar]] by 1563.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921'' John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p. 219</ref> He was justice of the Liberty of [[Wexford]] and Commissioner for [[Munster]]. In 1570 he was made Attorney General, and in 1574 he became Serjeant-at-law, holding that office until his death in 1593.<ref>Ball p.219</ref> In 1578 when the controversial judge [[Nicholas White]] was removed from office as Master of the Rolls, Fitz-Symon replaced him. He was an unusual choice since serjeants in that era rarely became judges, due largely to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth's]] low opinion of her Irish law officers. In any case the appointment was only a temporary one since White was restored to office within a few months.<ref>Ball p.219</ref>\n\nWe have some glimpses of Fitz-Symon's official work: in 1577, during the height of the \"cess\" controversy, concerning the power of the Crown to levy taxes on the [[Anglo-Irish]]  gentry of [[the Pale]]  for the upkeep of military [[garrisons]], the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], Sir [[William Gerard (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)|William Gerard]], called on him to give an important opinion on the [[royal prerogative]].<ref>Crawford, Jon G. ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber 1571-1641'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p.113</ref> On another occasion he was asked to advise on a commission to reform the customs at [[Chester]], but refused on the ground that he did not have adequate time.<ref>Hart, A. R. '' History of the King's Serjeants at law in Ireland'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2000 p.43</ref> Gerard was clearly unimpressed by Fitz-Symon's  abilities, calling him a man \"of mean learning\".<ref>Kenny, Colum ''King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland'' Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.57</ref>\n\nFitz-Symon pleaded regularly before the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]], and often sat in a quasi-judicial capacity. In 1572 he sat on a commission to inquire into the extent of the former lands of the O'Doyne clan, and decide whether they should be incorporated into [[County Laois|Queen's County]].<ref>''Deputy Keeper of Public Records in Ireland'' 13th Report p.74</ref> Later the same year he sat on the commission to oversee the muster of troops in Dublin.
