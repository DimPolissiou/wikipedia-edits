The leading jurist were known as ''[[Marja']].''\n\nThe Constitution stresses the importance of the clergy in government, with Article 4 stating  that <blockquote>\u201call civil, criminal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and all other statutes and regulations (must) be keeping with Islamic measures;\u2026the Islamic legal scholars of the watch council (shura yi nigahban) will keep watch over this.\u201d<ref name=\"preamble\">{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ir00000_.html|title=ICL - Iran - Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref></blockquote> and the importance of the Supreme Leader. Article 5 states \n<blockquote>\u201cduring the absence of the removed [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] (may God hasten his reappearance) government and leadership of the community in the Islamic Republic of Iran belong to the rightful God fearing\u2026 legal scholar (Faqih) who is recognized and acknowledged as the Islamic leader by the majority of the population.\u201d</blockquote> \nArticle 107 in the constitution mentions Imam Khomeini by name and praises him as the most learned and talented leader for emulation (''marja-i taqlid'').   The responsibilities of the Supreme Leader are vaguely stated in the constitution, thus any \u2018violation\u2019 by the Supreme Leader would be dismissed almost immediately.  As the rest of the clergy governed affairs on a daily basis, the Supreme Leader is capable of mandating a new decision as per the concept of Vilayat-e Faqih. (Halm, 120-121)\n\n===1989===\nShortly before Imam Khomeini's death a change was made in the constitution allowing a lower ranking Shia cleric to become Supreme Leader.

Montazeri was demoted as a marja and Khomeini chose  a new successor, a relatively low-ranking member of the clergy, [[Ali Khamene'i]]. However Article 109 stipulated that the leader be `a source of imitation` (Marja-e taqlid). Khomeini wrote a letter to the president of the Assembly for Revising the Constitution, which was in session at the time, making the necessary arrangements to designate Khamene'i as his successor, and Article 109 was revised accordingly.<ref name=asghar.p73>Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran : politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'' / by Asghar Schirazi, London ; New York : I.B.

According to Ayatollah Khomeini, the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was not [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists#Limited guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|restricted]] to orphans or mental incompetents, but applied to everyone in absence of the [[twelfth Imam]]. Jurists were the only rightful political/governmental leaders because \"God had commanded Islamic government\" and \"no one knew religion better than the [[ulama]]\" (Islamic clergy).<ref name=nasr.p125/> They alone would preserve \"Islamic order\" and keep everyone from deviating from \"the just path of Islam\".<ref>Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution, Writings and Declarations Of Imam Khomeini'' p.54</ref> Prior to the revolution observant Shia Muslims selected their own leading faqih to emulate (known as a ''[[Marja']]-i taqlid'') according to their own decision making. The \u201ccongregation rather than the hierarchy decided how prominent the ayatollah was\u201d thus allowing the public to possibly limit the influence of the Faqih.<ref name=nasr.p125>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W. W. Norton & Company, Apr 17, 2007, p.?</ref>\n\nAfter the revolution Shia Muslims (or at least Iranian Shia) were commanded to show allegiance to the current ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|vali-e faghih]]'', Guardian Jurist or Supreme Leader.   In this new system, the jurist oversaw all governmental affairs.    The complete control exercised by the Faqih was not to be limited to the Iranian Revolution because the revolution and its Leader had international aspirations. As the constitution of the Islamic Republic states, it \n<blockquote>intends to establish an ideal and model society on the basis of Islamic norms.  ... the Constitution provides the necessary basis for ensuring the continuation of the Revolution at home and abroad.  In particular, in the development of international relations, the Constitution will strive with other Islamic and popular movements to prepare the way for the formation of a single world community (in accordance with the Koranic verse `This your community is a single community, and I am your Lord, so worship Me` [21:92]), and to assure the continuation of the struggle for the liberation of all deprived and oppressed peoples in the world.<ref name=\"preamble\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author Seyyed Vali Nasr, Khomeini appealed to the masses, during the pre-1979 period, by referring to them as the oppressed and with charisma and political ability was tremendously successful. He became a very popular role model for [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] and hoped for the Iranian Revolution to be the first step to a much larger Islamic revolution, transcending Shia Islam, in the same way that [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] wanted [[Russian Revolution|their revolution]] to be a world revolution, not just a [[Russia|Russian]] one.<ref>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W.

According to [[Francis Fukuyama]], the 1979 constitution is a \"hybrid\" of \"theocratic and democratic elements\" with much of it based on the ideas Khomeini presented in his work ''[[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist]]'' (''Hukumat-e Islami'').<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203946904574300374086282670 |date=July 27, 2009 |title=Iran, Islam and the Rule of Law |first=Francis |last=Fukuyama |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] }}</ref> In the work, Khomeini argued that government must be run in accordance with traditional Islamic ''[[sharia]]'', and for this to happen a leading Islamic jurist (''[[faqih]]'') must provide political \"guardianship\" (''wilayat'' or ''velayat'') over the people. The leading jurist were known as ''[[Marja']].''\n\nThe Constitution stresses the importance of the clergy in government, with Article 4 stating  that <blockquote>\u201call civil, criminal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and all other statutes and regulations (must) be keeping with Islamic measures;\u2026the Islamic legal scholars of the watch council (shura yi nigahban) will keep watch over this.\u201d<ref name=\"preamble\">{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ir00000_.html|title=ICL - Iran - Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref></blockquote> and the importance of the Supreme Leader. Article 5 states \n<blockquote>\u201cduring the absence of the removed [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] (may God hasten his reappearance) government and leadership of the community in the Islamic Republic of Iran belong to the rightful God fearing\u2026 legal scholar (Faqih) who is recognized and acknowledged as the Islamic leader by the majority of the population.\u201d</blockquote> \nArticle 107 in the constitution mentions Imam Khomeini by name and praises him as the most learned and talented leader for emulation (''marja-i taqlid'').   The responsibilities of the Supreme Leader are vaguely stated in the constitution, thus any \u2018violation\u2019 by the Supreme Leader would be dismissed almost immediately.  As the rest of the clergy governed affairs on a daily basis, the Supreme Leader is capable of mandating a new decision as per the concept of Vilayat-e Faqih. (Halm, 120-121)\n\n===1989===\nShortly before Imam Khomeini's death a change was made in the constitution allowing a lower ranking Shia cleric to become Supreme Leader.

Montazeri was demoted as a marja and Khomeini chose  a new successor, a relatively low-ranking member of the clergy, [[Ali Khamene'i]]. However Article 109 stipulated that the leader be `a source of imitation` (Marja-e taqlid). Khomeini wrote a letter to the president of the Assembly for Revising the Constitution, which was in session at the time, making the necessary arrangements to designate Khamene'i as his successor, and Article 109 was revised accordingly.<ref name=asghar.p73>Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran : politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'' / by Asghar Schirazi, London ; New York : I.B.

According to Ayatollah Khomeini, the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was not [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists#Limited guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|restricted]] to orphans or mental incompetents, but applied to everyone in absence of the [[twelfth Imam]]. Jurists were the only rightful political/governmental leaders because \"God had commanded Islamic government\" and \"no one knew religion better than the [[ulama]]\" (Islamic clergy).<ref name=nasr.p125/> They alone would preserve \"Islamic order\" and keep everyone from deviating from \"the just path of Islam\".<ref>Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution, Writings and Declarations Of Imam Khomeini'' p.54</ref> Prior to the revolution observant Shia Muslims selected their own leading faqih to emulate (known as a ''[[Marja']]-i taqlid'') according to their own decision making. The \u201ccongregation rather than the hierarchy decided how prominent the ayatollah was\u201d thus allowing the public to possibly limit the influence of the Faqih.<ref name=nasr.p125>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W. W. Norton & Company, Apr 17, 2007, p.?</ref>\n\nAfter the revolution Shia Muslims (or at least Iranian Shia) were commanded to show allegiance to the current ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|vali-e faghih]]'', Guardian Jurist or Supreme Leader.   In this new system, the jurist oversaw all governmental affairs.    The complete control exercised by the Faqih was not to be limited to the Iranian Revolution because the revolution and its Leader had international aspirations. As the constitution of the Islamic Republic states, it \n<blockquote>intends to establish an ideal and model society on the basis of Islamic norms.  ... the Constitution provides the necessary basis for ensuring the continuation of the Revolution at home and abroad.  In particular, in the development of international relations, the Constitution will strive with other Islamic and popular movements to prepare the way for the formation of a single world community (in accordance with the Koranic verse `This your community is a single community, and I am your Lord, so worship Me` [21:92]), and to assure the continuation of the struggle for the liberation of all deprived and oppressed peoples in the world.<ref name=\"preamble\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author Seyyed Vali Nasr, Khomeini appealed to the masses, during the pre-1979 period, by referring to them as the oppressed and with charisma and political ability was tremendously successful. He became a very popular role model for [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] and hoped for the Iranian Revolution to be the first step to a much larger Islamic revolution, transcending Shia Islam, in the same way that [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] wanted [[Russian Revolution|their revolution]] to be a world revolution, not just a [[Russia|Russian]] one.<ref>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W.

After the war, R\u00e9gine became a [[Torch song|torch singer]] and by 1953 was a nightclub manager in Paris. She is attributed with the invention of the modern-day [[discoth\u00e8que]], by virtue of creating a new, dynamic atmosphere at Paris' Whisky \u00e0 Gogo, with the ubiquitous [[jukebox]] replaced by [[disc jockey]]s utilising linked [[phonograph|turntables]].<ref name=\"Rock and Roll is a State of Mind\">[http://www.rockstateofmind.com/2009/12/whiskey-go-go-los-angeles-ca.html Rock and Roll is a State of Mind:]</ref> In 1957, she opened Chez R\u00e9gine in the [[Latin Quarter]], which became the place to be seen for playboys and princes. As Zylberberg's celebrity expanded she established other venues under the name Chez R\u00e9gine's in London, New York, Monte Carlo and elsewhere. These were ultra-selective venues in prime urban locations, all featuring her signature \"disco-style\" layout. Zylberberg's Paris Whisky \u00e0 Gogo became the inspiration for the later establishment of the [[Whisky a Go Go]] nightclub in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Rock and Roll is a State of Mind\"/> Her two attempts at opening clubs in London both failed within months and she blamed this on what she called the British \"lack of style\".<ref name=mail/> She also established [[Jimmy'z (nightclub)|Jimmy'z]], a nightclub in [[Monaco]], in 1974.<ref>[http://fr.jimmyzmontecarlo.com/Informations-pratiques,1723.html Jimmy'z: Informations pratiques]</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, Zylberberg moved to New York and lived in a suite of the [[Delmonico Hotel]] where she opened one of her clubs on the ground floor of the hotel. The club served food under the direction of French chef [[Michel Guerard]].<ref name=tribune>\"Regine\u2014Queen of the Discos\" (2 May 1976) ''[[Oakland Tribune]]''</ref> At this time there were 25 clubs bearing her name across three continents and it was said that one could party at a Zylberberg's somewhere in the world 17 hours out of every 24. She renovated the Kensington Roof gardens above Barkers and turned it into a night club named \"R\u00e9gine's\". In the 1970s, she designed a line of \"Ready-to-Dance\" evening clothes which were proof against wrinkling and so could be packed, which were sold at [[Bloomingdale's]].<ref name=tribune/>. In 1988, she was in charge of the Ledoyen Restaurant on the Champs Elys\u00e9es in Paris.<ref>\"R\u00e9gine : \"I want to bring some life into the real estate business!\", interview by [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], ''International Amiic Tribune'', March 1989. </ref>\n\nIn 1996 Zylberberg and her son were arrested for refusing to comply with crew requests and smoking on an [[American Airlines]] flight. It was alleged that, though she was travelling economy, R\u00e9gine had demanded a first class upgrade, which the airline declined.<ref name=\"nymag\"/><ref name=\"lesoir\"/> In June 2011, she appeared as Solange in ''[[Follies]]'' at the ''Kennedy Center'' in Washington, D.C.

After the war, R\u00e9gine became a [[Torch song|torch singer]] and by 1953 was a nightclub manager in Paris. She is attributed with the invention of the modern-day [[discoth\u00e8que]], by virtue of creating a new, dynamic atmosphere at Paris' Whisky \u00e0 Gogo, with the ubiquitous [[jukebox]] replaced by [[disc jockey]]s utilising linked [[phonograph|turntables]].<ref name=\"Rock and Roll is a State of Mind\">[http://www.rockstateofmind.com/2009/12/whiskey-go-go-los-angeles-ca.html Rock and Roll is a State of Mind:]</ref> In 1957, she opened Chez R\u00e9gine in the [[Latin Quarter]], which became the place to be seen for playboys and princes. As Zylberberg's celebrity expanded she established other venues under the name Chez R\u00e9gine's in London, New York, Monte Carlo and elsewhere. These were ultra-selective venues in prime urban locations, all featuring her signature \"disco-style\" layout. Zylberberg's Paris Whisky \u00e0 Gogo became the inspiration for the later establishment of the [[Whisky a Go Go]] nightclub in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Rock and Roll is a State of Mind\"/> Her two attempts at opening clubs in London both failed within months and she blamed this on what she called the British \"lack of style\".<ref name=mail/> She also established [[Jimmy'z (nightclub)|Jimmy'z]], a nightclub in [[Monaco]], in 1974.<ref>[http://fr.jimmyzmontecarlo.com/Informations-pratiques,1723.html Jimmy'z: Informations pratiques]</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, Zylberberg moved to New York and lived in a suite of the [[Delmonico Hotel]] where she opened one of her clubs on the ground floor of the hotel. The club served food under the direction of French chef [[Michel Guerard]].<ref name=tribune>\"Regine\u2014Queen of the Discos\" (2 May 1976) ''[[Oakland Tribune]]''</ref> At this time there were 25 clubs bearing her name across three continents and it was said that one could party at a Zylberberg's somewhere in the world 17 hours out of every 24. She renovated the Kensington Roof gardens above Barkers and turned it into a night club named \"R\u00e9gine's\". In the 1970s, she designed a line of \"Ready-to-Dance\" evening clothes which were proof against wrinkling and so could be packed, which were sold at [[Bloomingdale's]].<ref name=tribune/>. In 1988, she was in charge of the Ledoyen Restaurant on the Champs Elys\u00e9es in Paris.<ref>\"R\u00e9gine : \"I want to bring some life into the real estate business!\", interview by [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], ''International Amiic Tribune'', March 1989. </ref>\n\nIn 1996 Zylberberg and her son were arrested for refusing to comply with crew requests and smoking on an [[American Airlines]] flight.

Three former AMNRL clubs joined the USARL; [[Bucks County Sharks]], [[Connecticut Wildcats]], and [[New York Knights]]. The [[Delaware Black Foxes]] also joined as an expansion squad.  For 2016, the Connecticut Wildcats left the competition and were replaced by the [[White Plains Wombats]].  Before the 2017 season, the D.C. Slayers and Bucks County Sharks left the competition, and the USARL abolished the division structure within the North Conference.  Before the 2018 season, the Central Florida Warriors left the competition and were replaced by [[Southwest Florida Copperheads]].  The Rhode Island Rebellion also left the competition. The New York Knights left the competition after the 2018 season.<ref>http://www.usarl.org/news/2018/2018-season-preview-at-a-glance</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nThe first event of the season is the [[rugby league nines]] tournament.\n\n===Regular season===\nThe USARL is split into two conferences, North and South.  In the South Conference, teams play a double round-robin schedule of 8 games.  In the North Conference, teams play a single round-robin schedule of 5 games plus an additional 3 games.  Teams qualify for the playoffs based on point differential, with a win counting for 2 points, a draw for 1, a loss for 0, and a forfeit for \u22122.  The regular season runs through May and July.\n\n===Play-offs===\nIn the South Conference, all four teams automatically make the playoffs.  The teams with the best and worst records, and the second- and third-best records, play each other in the South Conference semi-finals. The winners meet in the South Conference finals. In the North Conference, the teams with the six best records make the playoffs.  The winners of the South Conference finals meet the winners of the North Conference finals in the [[USARL Grand Final]].\n\n==Teams==\n{{Location map+ |United States |width=600 |float=center |caption={{resize|108%|Locations of teams for 2019 USARL season}}<br/>{{spaces|9}}[[File:Red pog.svg|8px]] South Conference<br />{{spaces|9}}[[File:Blue pog.svg|8px]] North Conference |places=\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=41.0340 |long=-73.7629 |label='''[[White Plains Wombats|White Plains]]''' |position=top |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=40.6782 |long=-73.9442 |label='''[[Brooklyn Kings (rugby league)|Brooklyn]]''' |position=right |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=42.35 |long=-71.06 |label='''[[Boston Thirteens|Boston]]'''|position=top |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=38.6987 |long=-77.5797 |label='''[[Northern Virginia Eagles|NOVA]]'''|position=bottom |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=39.7447 |long=-75.5484 |label='''[[Delaware Black Foxes|Delaware]]'''|position=right |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=39.9526 |long=-75.1652 |label='''[[Philadelphia Fight|Philadelphia]]'''|position=left |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=33.75 |long=-84.39 |label='''[[Atlanta Rhinos|Atlanta]]'''|position=top |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=30.3322 |long=-81.6557 |label='''[[Jacksonville Axemen|Jacksonville]]'''|position=top |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=28.0395 |long=-81.9498 |label='''[[Lakeland Renegades|Lakeland]]'''|position=right |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=26.6751 |long=-81.7320 |label='''[[Southwest Florida Copperheads|Southwest Florida]]''' |position=right |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=27.9506 |long=-82.4572 |label='''[[Tampa Mayhem|Tampa]]'''|position=left |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 99%\"\n|-\n|-\n| bgcolor=darkblue align=\"center\" colspan=\"7\"|'''<span style=\"color:white;\">North Conference</span>'''\n|-\n!style=\"background:white;

After the AMNRL/USARL split in 2011, the Immortals were transferred to the USARL and became the only form of representation for USARL clubs due to the [[Rugby League International Federation|RLIF]] regulation that USARL-based players could not represent the [[United States national rugby league team|Tomahawks]].  The Immortals took to the field for their second match since their inception, and despite putting up a hard fight, they were out classed by the more experienced Marines, losing by a score of 68\u201312. As of 2014, due to budgetary cuts and restructuring of the USARL competition, the Immortals have not played a match since their loss to the Royal Marines.\n\n'''USA Pioneers'''\n\nIn 2014, the league established a touring developmental side, the USA Pioneers, to play friendly matches against foreign nations.

The league consists of eleven teams located in [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] states, with a development conference in the [[Midwestern United States|Mid-West]] states consisting of three teams. The regular season is played in June and July.\n\nThe league was founded in 2011 by clubs that had broken with the established [[American National Rugby League]] (AMNRL), plus expansion franchises. The USARL began its inaugural season in [[2011 USARL season|2011]] with eight teams.

In the South Conference, teams play a double round-robin schedule of 8 games.  In the North Conference, teams play a single round-robin schedule of 5 games plus an additional 3 games.  Teams qualify for the playoffs based on point differential, with a win counting for 2 points, a draw for 1, a loss for 0, and a forfeit for \u22122.  The regular season runs through May and July.\n\n===Play-offs===\nIn the South Conference, all four teams automatically make the playoffs.  The teams with the best and worst records, and the second- and third-best records, play each other in the South Conference semi-finals. The winners meet in the South Conference finals. In the North Conference, the teams with the six best records make the playoffs.  The winners of the South Conference finals meet the winners of the North Conference finals in the [[USARL Grand Final]].\n\n==Teams==\n{{Location map+ |United States |width=600 |float=center |caption={{resize|108%|Locations of teams for 2019 USARL season}}<br/>{{spaces|9}}[[File:Red pog.svg|8px]] South Conference<br />{{spaces|9}}[[File:Blue pog.svg|8px]] North Conference |places=\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=41.0340 |long=-73.7629 |label='''[[White Plains Wombats|White Plains]]''' |position=top |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=40.6782 |long=-73.9442 |label='''[[Brooklyn Kings (rugby league)|Brooklyn]]''' |position=right |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=42.35 |long=-71.06 |label='''[[Boston Thirteens|Boston]]'''|position=top |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=38.6987 |long=-77.5797 |label='''[[Northern Virginia Eagles|NOVA]]'''|position=bottom |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=39.7447 |long=-75.5484 |label='''[[Delaware Black Foxes|Delaware]]'''|position=right |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=39.9526 |long=-75.1652 |label='''[[Philadelphia Fight|Philadelphia]]'''|position=left |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=33.75 |long=-84.39 |label='''[[Atlanta Rhinos|Atlanta]]'''|position=top |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=30.3322 |long=-81.6557 |label='''[[Jacksonville Axemen|Jacksonville]]'''|position=top |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=28.0395 |long=-81.9498 |label='''[[Lakeland Renegades|Lakeland]]'''|position=right |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=26.6751 |long=-81.7320 |label='''[[Southwest Florida Copperheads|Southwest Florida]]''' |position=right |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |United States |lat=27.9506 |long=-82.4572 |label='''[[Tampa Mayhem|Tampa]]'''|position=left |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 99%\"\n|-\n|-\n| bgcolor=darkblue align=\"center\" colspan=\"7\"|'''<span style=\"color:white;\">North Conference</span>'''\n|-\n!style=\"background:white;

They played their inaugural match against the [[Canada national rugby league team|Canadian National Team]], on July 31, 2010, defeating the Canadians 12\u20138 in a tightly contested match. After the AMNRL/USARL split in 2011, the Immortals were transferred to the USARL and became the only form of representation for USARL clubs due to the [[Rugby League International Federation|RLIF]] regulation that USARL-based players could not represent the [[United States national rugby league team|Tomahawks]].  The Immortals took to the field for their second match since their inception, and despite putting up a hard fight, they were out classed by the more experienced Marines, losing by a score of 68\u201312. As of 2014, due to budgetary cuts and restructuring of the USARL competition, the Immortals have not played a match since their loss to the Royal Marines.\n\n'''USA Pioneers'''\n\nIn 2014, the league established a touring developmental side, the USA Pioneers, to play friendly matches against foreign nations. They completed a two match tour in Jamaica in April 2014, winning their first game against a Jamaican domestic outfit, but fell short to the semi-professional [[Hurricanes Rugby League]] whilst still proving to be strong opposition for the Jamaicans.<ref>http://www.usarl.com/2014/03/usa-pioneers-begin-a-new-era-for-touring-development-teams/</ref> The Pioneers played a friendly against a touring [[New Zealand Police]] squad the following August, losing 6\u201362 against very strong opposition.\n\n'''Presidents Barbarians'''\n\nThe USARL established another team to play a second match against the New Zealand Police and to 'curtain-raise' the 2014 USARL National Championship between the [[Philadelphia Fight]] and the [[Jacksonville Axemen]]. This representative consisted of overseas-imports from Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and France; similar to [[Super League]]'s [[Exiles rugby league team|Exiles]].
