This character still belongs on this list, despite having his own page.-->\n'''Percy Jackson''' is a demigod, son of mortal Sally Jackson, who makes great blue cookies, and immortal Poseidon, who is the greek god of the sea and earthquakes. His mother, Sally was married to a man named Gabe Ugliano ,who was an abbusive alcoholic who played poker in the kitchen with his buddies and took Percy's money to bet with, because his repugnant mortal odour protects Percy, hiding him from any monsters. At the end of [[The Lightning Thief]], Sally turns Gabe into stone using Medusa's head. Later, she marries Paul Blofis, whom she really loves. \n\nPercy lives in [[Manhattan]], Upper East Side, and is a [[New York Yankees]] fan, before his life is uprooted upon discovering his true paternity. He has black hair and sea-green eyes. He has inherited special abilities from Poseidon which include the ability to control water, boats and ships; surf really well; to create small hurricanes; to breathe and see clearly underwater; and to talk to horse-like creatures. He is also a gifted swordsman. Throughout the series, Percy uses a ballpoint pen named Anaklusmos (Ancient Greek for \"Riptide\") for battle; the pen can change into a celestial bronze sword and if he loses it , it will always pop back up in his pocket. His fatal flaw is excessive loyalty. As the novels progress, Percy and [[Annabeth Chase]]'s friendship and camaraderie also inevitably develop into a romantic relationship by the end of The Last Olympian even though everyone already knew it would happen and that Grover is the ultimate third wheel. \n\nPercy is the first-person narrator in the ''Percy Jackson & the Olympians'' series. He appears in ''The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades, The Blood of Olympus, The Hidden Oracle''. In the films, he is portrayed by [[Logan Lerman]] although, the fandom does not like to hear about the movies as they are extremely innacurate. In the musical, he is portrayed by [[Chris McCarrell]].\n\n====Grover Underwood====\n'''Grover Underwood''' is a satyr and Percy's best friend. He appears in ''The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The House of Hades, The Blood of Olympus'' and ''The Burning Maze''.\n\nHe has curly reddish-brown hair and fur, acne, and a wispy goatee. His horns grow larger as the series progresses, and he must take increasingly careful measures to hide them and his goat legs while posing as human. In ''The Lightning Thief'', Chiron states that Grover is small even for his age: He is twenty-eight then, but because a satyr's lifespan is twice that of a human, he is considered a teenager. Grover is quite sensitive and attached to nature. A vegetarian, he is known to eat tin cans, furniture, and worships enchiladas. Like all satyrs, he can sense emotions and \"smell\" monsters and demigods. As the series progresses, his concern for his friends and pursuit of his goals lead him to take on leadership roles and become more confident. Unlike his demigod friends, Grover is not an orthodox fighter. Instead, he uses reed pipes or a cudgel. In ''The Battle of the Labyrinth'', Grover begins a relationship with the dryad Juniper.\n\nIn ''The Lightning Thief'', he gets a \"searcher's license\" after delivering Percy safely, allowing him to search for the lost god Pan. When Polyphemus captures him in ''The Sea of Monsters'', he activates an empathy link, a psychic bond with Percy created a year before, allowing them some telepathic communication across great distances. He uses this to guide Percy to his rescue. At the end of ''The Last Olympian'', he is named a Lord of the Wild and given a seat on the satyrs' ruling council, the Council of Cloven Elders.\n\n====Annabeth Chase====\n'''Annabeth Chase''' is the daughter of Athena and mortal history professor Frederick Chase, from whom she has an extensive paternal family including Magnus Chase. She is the girlfriend of Percy Jackson from book ''The Last Olympian'' She appears in ''The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Lost Hero, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades'' and ''The Blood of Olympus''. In the film adaptations, she is portrayed by [[Alexandra Daddario]]. In the musical, she is portrayed by Kristin Stokes. She is described by her teacher Chiron as \"territorial about her friends\", which is manifested in some moments of jealousy and distrust. In ''The Lightning Thief'', it is revealed that she also suffers from [[arachnophobia]], a fear shared by her siblings due to their mother's relationship with Arachne, whom Athena turned into a spider.\n\nAnnabeth ran away from her father and stepfamily at age seven and encounters Luke Castellan and Thalia Grace. They lived as runaways until they are found by Grover Underwood and taken to camp. Annabeth remains attached to Luke and convinced of his goodness even after his decision to support Kronos. Her attempts to bring Luke back into the fold are an important theme in the books. A crucial character to the novels' plots, Annabeth even spends some time in Tartarus with Percy and Bob the Titan during The House of Hades. At the end of the series, she and Percy plan to finish high school in New York and then attend college in New Rome. In The Hidden Oracle, Percy states that Annabeth had gone to Boston for \"some family emergency\" \u2014 searching for her cousin Magnus Chase. Annabeth's appearances in crossover shorts with ''The Kane Chronicles'', and in ''Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard'' make her the only character besides Percy Jackson to have appeared in all three of the Greco-Roman, Egyptian, and Norse mythology series by author Rick Riordan.\n\nHer main weapon is a short celestial bronze knife given to her by Luke. After losing it in The House of Hades, she uses a drakon-bone sword given to her by the giant Damasen. She also uses Sadie Kane's wand when it turned into a dagger like the one Luke gave her. Annabeth also owns an invisibility [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] cap, a gift from her mother. At the end of The Battle of the Labyrinth, Daedalus gives Annabeth his incredibly advanced laptop which she loses in Tartarus. In the third book of Magnus Chase series, Annabeth is wearing a [[UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design]] shirt, implying that is where she is going to college. Annabeth has [[dyslexia]] (because her brain is hardwired to be able to read Ancient Greek) and has [[ADHD]] (battle instincts).\n\n====Luke Castellan====\n'''Luke Castellan''' was a 19-year-old son of Hermes and May Castellan. He appears in ''The Lightning Thief'', ''The Sea of Monsters'', ''The Titan's Curse'', ''The Battle of the Labyrinth'' and ''The Last Olympian''. In the films, he is portrayed by [[Jake Abel]]. In the musical, he is portrayed by James Hayden Rodriguez.\n\nIntroduced initially as the friendly head counsellor of the Hermes cabin, Luke is soon revealed to serve Kronos. He is resentful of his father, who adhered to the gods' policy of non-interference despite May Castellan's mental illness. He ran away from home young and eventually arrived at camp. After the loss of Thalia, a failed quest and continued silence from Hermes, his ongoing resentment turns into a strong hatred of his father and the other gods. Described as decent and kind before Kronos, he behaves with volatility and violence upon his corruption. Though Luke originally serves Kronos willingly, the horrors he witnessed during the Battle of Manhattan convinces him to fight against his former master, eventually committing suicide to stop the Titan. When he dies, Luke reiterates what Ethan Nakamura tells Percy earlier: unclaimed children and unrecognized gods deserve more respect than they have been given.\n\nLuke is described as handsome with sandy hair, blue eyes, and a long scar on his cheek given to him by Ladon. Besides the ability to open locks with his mind inherited by his father, he is first and foremost an excellent swordsman. He even receives a sword named \"Backbiter\" from Kronos at the end of ''The Lightning Thief''. It is later reforged as Kronos's scythe and has the ability to harm both mortals and immortals. From Halcyon Green, he receives a diary he later entrusts to Chiron, and a celestial bronze knife he later gives to Annabeth with a promise to always remain her family. From his father, he receives a pair of magic flying shoes, which he later curses and gives to Percy. Just before giving himself over completely to host the spirit of Kronos, Luke bathes in the River Styx and obtains the invincibility of Achilles. Even though Luke is evil at one point in the series, he dies a hero.\n\n====Thalia Grace====\n'''Thalia Grace''' is the daughter of Zeus and Beryl Grace, a TV starlet. She is seven years older than her brother Jason Grace and appears in ''The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Last Olympian, The Lost Hero,The Blood of Olympus'' and the ''Dark Prophecy''. In the films, she is portrayed by [[Paloma Malinowski]].\n\nDue to her mother's abusive nature, Thalia had considered leaving home since she was little, but stayed to protect Jason. When Jason is apparently killed during a visit to Sonora (in actuality, he is just presented to Hera), Thalia finally runs away and stays with Luke and Annabeth until they meet Grover when she is 12. When they reach camp, Hades sends a horde of hell hounds that Thalia holds off, giving her life for her friends. Zeus pities his daughter and turns her into a pine tree where her spirit then provides a magical barrier around the camp. Seven years later, she is purged from the pine tree with the [[Golden Fleece]], applied to save it from poisons that were weakening and destroying the wards protecting the demigods. At the end of The Titan's Curse, she becomes the lieutenant of the Hunters of Artemis, a band of immortal female archers who serve the goddess Artemis, which freezes her age the night before her 16th birthday.\n\nThalia has blue eyes, spiky black hair, black eyeliner and punk style clothing. Annabeth and Chiron remark her personality and character traits (like her bravery and loyalty) being very similar to Percy's. She also shares some traits with her father, such as pride, confidence, and vehement reactions to betrayal or contradiction. An incredibly skilled warrior, she is willing to attack even Luke, who was known as the best swordsman of the last 300 years. Thalia's weapons are the shield Aegis disguised as a silver bracelet, and a spear disguised as a [[Mace (spray)|Mace can]]. After ''The Titan's Curse'', she also uses a bow and hunting knives. Her main \"power\" is the ability to summon lightning and generate electric shocks. In ''The Titan's Curse'', it is revealed that she has a rather ironic fear of heights, [[acrophobia]]. In ''The Lost Hero'', she embraces Jason for the first time in years, only to learn that he had lost his memory.\n\n====Tyson====\nIn The Sea of Monsters, '''Tyson''' is introduced as Percy's bullied, childish friend. When Percy is forced to take him to camp, it is revealed that he is a baby Cyclops and thus a son of Poseidon, making him Percy's half brother. He appears in The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena and The Blood of Olympus. In the films, he is portrayed by [[Douglas Smith (actor)|Douglas Smith]].\n\nTyson is tall with unkempt teeth and fingernails, brown hair and eye. He is mentally about 8 years old, but very intelligent and compassionate. As a son of Poseidon, he shares some of Percy's powers. As a Cyclops, he is immune to fire and has super strength, an uncanny ability to mimic voices, enhanced senses, and understands the \"old tongue\" (the language spoken by Gaia to her first children). Tyson also becomes an excellent smith with help from Charles Beckendorf. In The Last Olympian, he proves himself to be a capable fighter and is named a general of Poseidon's armies. Percy is at first resentful of him as a brother, while Annabeth is openly hostile towards him because she was almost killed by a cyclops, but both accept him after their quest together in the Sea of Monsters. Tyson is close with several characters and magical creatures in the series, including Rainbow the hippocampus, the hellhound Mrs O'Leary and the harpy Ella, who eventually becomes his girlfriend. In The Battle of the Labyrinth, Tyson is revealed to be afraid of satyrs, including Grover, he manages to conquer this fear after a quest and they become friends.\n\n====Nico Di Angelo====\n'''Nico Di Angelo''' is first seen in The Titan's Curse, as an unclaimed demigod rescued by Percy, Annabeth, Thalia, and Grover. At the end of the novel, it is revealed that Nico is a son of Hades. He appears in The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades, The Blood of Olympus and The Hidden Oracle.\nThe character Nico was named after one of Riordan's former students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/oct/04/rick-riordan-magnus-chase-interview-percy-jackson |title=Rick Riordan: 'I've loved mythology since I was a child' |last=Riordan |first=Rick |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 October 2015 |access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nThough he appears to be ten years old, in reality, he and his elder sister Bianca were born in the 1930s. After Zeus killed their mother Maria, daughter of an Italian diplomat, whilst trying to kill the children, Hades wiped their memories and places them in the Lotus Hotel, a place in Las Vegas where time stands still. He is a native of [[Venice]] and can speak [[Italian (language)|Italian]]. Nico is initially depicted as cheerful and childish, with olive skin and dark hair, and enjoys playing Mythomagic (a mythology-themed card game similar to [[Magic: The Gathering]]). He takes the death of Bianca very hard, becoming moody, secretive, and irritable. He becomes angry at Percy, who swore to protect Bianca, but later forgives him. Afterwards, he lived in the Underworld with Hades, where he becomes pale and shaggy-haired and begins wearing dark clothing. Nico, despite being very powerful, is extremely lonely, much like his father. He makes nearby people uncomfortable, partially due to his unnerving weapon of choice: a sword made of iron cooled in the Styx (\"Stygian iron\"), capable of absorbing monsters' essences rather than banishing them to Tartarus. Until meeting Cupid in The House of Hades, Nico also struggles hiding his homosexuality. During The Blood of Olympus, Nico, Reyna and Hedge transport the Athena Parthenos to Camp Half-Blood. Between The Blood of Olympus and The Hidden Oracle, he begins a relationship with Will Solace, a child of Apollo, after admitting to Percy that he had a crush on him.\n\nNico's suggestion that Percy takes on the curse of Achilles and his work to convince Hades to fight in The Last Olympian is crucial to the Olympians' success and earn him a short bout of fame. He is privy to the fact that there were two camps, one Greek and one Roman, before The Lost Hero, making him an important liaison between the two groups in the latter series. He brings his half sister Hazel back from the dead and establishes her at Camp Jupiter. At the end of The Son of Neptune, Nico travels through Tartarus to find the monstrous side of the Doors of Death, an experience which leaves him haunted and weak. In The Blood of Olympus, he nearly dies several times while \"shadow-traveling\", which involves melting into shadows and teleporting himself to different places. His sister whom he brought back from the dead, who goes by the name Hazel Levesque, is the daughter of Hades' Roman identity Pluto. He is a very moody character\n\n====Rachel Elizabeth Dare====\nRachel is a mortal girl who can see through the Mist, the force that obscures gods and monsters from most mortals. Her father, Will Dare, is a rich businessman, a fact which she is rather adverse to. She first meets Percy in The Titan's Curse at the Hoover Dam. In The Battle of the Labyrinth, she guides Annabeth and Percy through the Labyrinth to Daedalus's workshop. It is hinted that she has some romantic feelings for Percy which are noticed by Annabeth who becomes jealous. In The Last Olympian, she has strange visions and becomes the new Oracle of Delphi. Her first act as the Oracle is to deliver the next Great Prophecy, setting the plot of the Heroes of Olympus series. She is contacted by Annabeth in The House of Hades to ask for Reyna's assistance to bring the Athena Parthenos back to Camp Half-Blood.\n\nFollowing the loss of Delphi to Python, as revealed in The Hidden Oracle, Rachel stops visiting camp and begins a frenzied attempt to regain her foresight, not helped by Apollo's disappearance. Once informed of Apollo's arrival, Rachel returns and learns that not only Delphi is lost, but also three other Oracles, Only Rhea's Dodonian Oracle is still valid. She becomes upset upon learning of the existence of other Oracles, as Apollo hasn't told her before.\n\nShe has red hair and freckles, is skilled at painting and drawing (with both feet and hands) and occasionally shown as a non-ADHD foil for her demigod teammates. Percy remarks on her ability to stand still for a long time at a charity event. Due to her power of foresight, Rachel knows a great deal of knowledge before she learns it herself, during her meeting with Reyna, she states Reyna's full name, something only Reyna's best friends know.\n\n====Clarisse La Rue====\nA daughter of Ares and the former lead counselor of the Ares cabin at Camp Half-Blood, Clarisse is hot-tempered, courageous, strong, an incredible fighter, usually using an electric spear given to her by Ares, and a good military strategist. She can be stubborn and overconfident, much like her father. Despite their similarities, Clarisse has a fear of her father and his anger at her if she should ever disappoint him. This, along with a strong sense of honor and pride, often motivates her actions. She also fears the [[Labyrinth]] because of what happened to her boyfriend Chris Rodriguez before she saved him. She is aggressive towards most demigods, including Percy, though she does respect and make friends with a few, including Percy, Annabeth, and Silena Beauregard. \nClarisse makes frequent appearances throughout the novels. first seen just after Percy arrives at camp. In The Sea of Monsters, Clarisse is given the quest to find the [[Golden Fleece]]. She is a main character in the short story \"Percy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot\" (published in [[The Demigod Files]]). In The Last Olympian, Clarisse initially sits out the war for Olympus due to a personal feud. Enraged after the loss of her friend Silena, she later joins the battle with a fury reminiscent of her father's, slaying a [[dragon|drakon]] singlehandedly and receiving the blessing of Ares. In The Blood of Olympus, Clarisse leads the Greeks in battle to defend the camp. In The Hidden Oracle, it is stated that Clarisse has gone to attend the [[University of Arizona]] and her role as counselor is taken by her half-brother Sherman Yang.\n\nShe appears in The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades and The Blood of Olympus. In the film adaptations, she is portrayed by [[Leven Rambin]]. In the musical, she is portrayed by Sarah Beth Pfeifer.\n\n====Calypso====\n'''[[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]''' is the daughter of the titan Atlas who is imprisoned on the island of [[Ogygia]] for supporting her father during the first titan war.<ref name=\"labyrinth\"/> She first appears in ''The Battle of the Labyrinth'', where she nurses Percy back to health. She falls in love with Percy and is heartbroken when he has to leave. Percy asks the gods to release her at the end of ''The Last Olympian'',<ref name=\"LastOlympian\"/> but she is still residing there when Leo becomes trapped on Ogygia in ''The House of Hades'', having been released from the curse of being forced to fall in love with all those to fall upon the island rather than the island itself. Leo and Calypso subsequently fall in love legitimately. After Leo escapes, he swears on the River [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] that he will return for Calypso. At the end of ''The Blood of Olympus'', Leo gets back to Ogygia and frees Calypso although nobody can go to Ogygia twice.\n\nIn ''The Hidden Oracle'', Calypso comes to Camp Half-Blood with Leo and reveals that, due to her choice to leave Ogygia, she has become a mortal. She accompanies Leo and Apollo in the latter's quest to find the Oracles and stop the Three Emperors from conquering North America. Despite this, the two secretly attempt to find a normalcy for their lives and later announce to Apollo that they are going to settle in [[Indianapolis]], although they will continue to help him anyway they can. At the end of ''The Dark Prophecy'', Calypso stays at the Waystation, while Leo goes to warn Camp Jupiter of an impending invasion and Apollo travels with Meg to search for the Erythaean Sybil.\n\nAs a sorceress, Calypso can command wind spirits to do her bidding. She loses most of her control of them when she gives up her immortality; however, she is still capable of summoning them to a degree, though by consuming more power than usual. Also, due to spending a long time at Ogygia, she has mastered sewing and lock-picking, which she uses while finding the gryphons at Indianapolis Zoo. She is Leo\u2019s girlfriend as of \u201cThe Blood of Olympus\u201d, \u201cThe Hidden Oracle\u201d, \u201cThe Dark Prophecy\u201d, and \u201cThe Burning Maze\u201d.\n\n===Introduced in ''The Heroes of Olympus''===\n\n====Leo Valdez====\n'''Leo Valdez''' is a son of Hephaestus. He likes to joke around and is very humorous. Though he does this mostly to keep himself happy and not too caught up in his tragic past, as well as so that his friends don't guess how broken he is inside. He is described as having curly brown hair, brown eyes, a cheerful face, a slim (scrawny) build, and a mischievous smile. He is [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic-American]] and speaks Spanish and machine. Leo has the ability to create and manipulate fire, a skill no child of Hephaestus has had for 400 years. He also has severe [[ADHD]] even by demigod standards. An excellent mechanic, he repairs a bronze dragon running wild in the camp's woods, naming it Festus (which means \"Happy\" in Latin). Inspired by a blueprint in Bunker 9, an abandoned bunker in the camp's woods, and a picture he drew in his kindergarten time, he also creates the ''Argo II'', the ship the 7 of the Great Prophecy sail on to reach Greece.\n\nWhen Leo was eight, Gaia tricked him into burning down his mother Esperanza's machine shop in [[Houston]] resulting in her death. Leo's remaining family blamed him for killing her and left him a foster child and runaway. He meets Piper, his best friend, at the Wilderness School in Nevada. Later, In [[The Lost Hero]], he meets Jason Grace, who wakes up on a school bus headed to the Grand Canyon with no memories. However, Leo and Piper have Mist-induced memories of meeting and becoming friends with Jason. Leo uses his sarcasm and wit to hide his feelings, especially in regards of causing his mother's death. He sometimes thinks of himself as a seventh wheel, (as for the first three books of the Heroes of Olympus series he is the only person aboard the Argo II without a significant other) though he proves no less important or skilled than the others. In The Mark of Athena, Hazel learns her former boyfriend, Sammy Valdez, was Leo's great-grandfather. Until he falls in love with Calypso in The House of Hades, Leo flirts with almost every girl he meets in order to cover up his insecurities about never finding love. In The Blood of Olympus, Leo sacrifices himself to annihilate Gaia and dies in the process, but is brought back to life using the Physician's Cure and returns for Calypso on her island, Ogygia. This is an impressive feat, as nobody has ever found Ogygia twice. He and Calypso then journey back to Camp Half-Blood, sending a magic scroll ahead to let his friends know he's alive. When he does arrive at camp (at the end of The Hidden Oracle), everyone lines up to slap him for keeping them worried so long. As Leo is included in the prophecy of the Grove of Dodona, he and Calypso accept the task to accompany Apollo on his quests in The Dark Prophecy, at the end of which he announces that he and Calypso will be living at the Waystation and leading an ordinary life. When the prophecy of Trophonius requires that someone must warn Camp Jupiter from an invasion, Leo does the task alone.\n\n====Piper McLean====\n'''Piper McLean''' is a daughter of Aphrodite and the famous actor Tristan McLean. She is fifteen in ''The Lost Hero''. Unlike most children of Aphrodite, Piper is not particularly concerned with beauty or fashion. Piper is [[Cherokee]] on her father's side. She has tan skin, eyes that change color constantly, and choppy caramel/chocolate-colored hair which she cuts herself. She is slim build and of average height. Her demigod \"powers\" include \"charmspeak\" (essentially, magical persuasion) and the ability to speak French. She is also occasionally able to see visions in her magic [[dagger]] Katoptris (Ancient Greek for \"mirror\"), which once belonged to [[Helen of Troy]]. The dagger lost that power after the battle against the giants in Athens.\n\nPiper's relationship with her father is mutually affectionate but strained, in part because of the small amount of attention he spares for her. When she was young, Piper used her persuasive skills to \"borrow\" (ask for in charmspeak) things to earn a little of his time. After he is kidnapped by the giant Enceladus in ''The Lost Hero'' and subsequently rescued by Piper, Jason, and Leo, Mr McLean's relationship with his daughter begins to improve. Piper is also very close to Jason. Though she later learns it was all a trick of the Mist, she was once his girlfriend while they attended the same school. She works hard to recreate this relationship in real life when she comes to Camp Half-Blood. She is also friends with all of the seven quest members in ''The Heroes of Olympus'', especially Annabeth and Leo.\n\nPiper's main weapon is her dagger Katoptris, though she later acquires a magic [[cornucopia]] and uses it as a weapon. After being captured by pirates in ''The House of Hades'', Piper asks Hazel to teach her sword fighting, using a jagged celestial bronze sword taken from one of the Boreads.\n\nIn ''The Hidden Oracle'', Nico mentions that Piper is currently attending school in Los Angeles, together with Jason. In ''The Burning Maze'', it's revealed that she broke up with Jason a few months earlier because their relationship was forced, and Piper did not like that. Apollo, as Lester Papadopoulos, was confused because the cloud nymph, Mellie, had seemed angry at Jason. This leads him to believe that Jason had broken up with Piper, but it was actually Piper who had. It is later unveiled that she wanted to discover herself and who she really was without the pressure of being the daughter of Aphrodite. The trick of the Mist that Hera used at the beginning of their relationship also contributed to the breakup as that meant that their relationship was technically \"fake\". Still, she is heartbroken when he dies by sacrificing himself to save her, Apollo, and Meg from Caligula.\n\n====Jason Grace====\n<!--Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a fan page. The content in this section is already too detailed and extensive. BEFORE ADDING ADDITIONAL CONTENT, remove or condense less important content. Also provide a reliable source, particularly for any analysis or commentary. -->\n'''Jason Grace''' was a son of Jupiter and the mortal Beryl Grace, a TV star of the 1980s, and the younger brother of Thalia Grace (Hunter of Artemis). Jason has few memories of his mother, who was compelled to give him up when he was two, but he remembers enough about Thalia to not be surprised when he sees her again, in ''The Lost Hero''. Thalia reveals that their mother told her that Jason was dead, and that this was what finally drove her to leave home, after she run away from home and found Camp Half-Blood. In ''The Blood of Olympus'', that Beryl Grace had become a mania, or spirit of madness. He grew up at Camp Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Camp Half-Blood, where demigods born to the Olympians' Roman aspects receive their training. In ''The Lost Hero'', he begins a romantic relationship with Piper McLean.\n\nJason is described as having blond hair, blue eyes, and a scar above his upper lip (said to be a result of an attempt to eat a stapler). He is of above-average height, with an athletic build and muscular arms. By the age of fifteen, he has earned the rank of praetor and leads the legion with his longtime partner, Reyna. Jason also coordinated the Roman camp's attack on the Titan force. He led an assault against [[Mount Tamalpais]]/Othrys, a Titan stronghold near San Francisco, and defeated the Titan Krios in combat, much as Percy Jackson defeated Hyperion and helped to defeat Kronos. Of all the characters in the series, Jason is the one who struggles the most with the differences between the Greek and Roman perspectives. Piper McLean describes Jason as very rule- and duty-oriented, though Terminus describes him as a \"rule-flouter.\" When the ''Argo II'' is stuck in North Africa, he must choose one identity or the other. He chooses to consider himself a Greek, despite his parentage, and is later unable to command a legion of Roman ghosts. During ''The House of Hades'' it is revealed that Jason has plans to return to Camp Jupiter to improve it with things he learned at Camp Half-Blood, such as giving the fauns (the Roman equivalent of a satyr) more rights and responsibilities. Later, during ''The Blood of Olympus'', Jason decides to consider both the Greek and Roman traditions as part of his heritage. He becomes \"Pontifex Maximus\", a role which will see him travel between Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter to build shrines for every god and goddess in the pantheon.\n\nAlthough Jason and Percy immediately realize that it is best to work together, and become friends, their relationship is not without antagonism. As Percy puts it, it is natural for two powerful demigods to wonder which of them is stronger after a fight. Jason is a sword fighter like Percy, though they have different fighting styles. Jason uses an Imperial gold sword, styled as a Roman ''gladius'', which he can extend into a ''pilum'' (a spear) at will. Jason also has power over air currents and can fly. He can sense and control some air spirits and, like Thalia, call down lightning, which he conducts through his Imperial Gold weapons, and emit static shocks. Once, he and Percy together summon a hurricane in Charleston harbor. He is then killed during The Burning Maze, by Emperor Caligula. While other demigods, such as Frank, are rescued in later books, it seems that no such care was applied to Jason.\n\n====Hazel Levesque====\n'''Hazel Levesque''' is a thirteen-year-old demigod, a daughter of Pluto and Marie Levesque. She first appears in ''The Son of Neptune'', at Camp Jupiter. It is later revealed that she has returned from the dead, assisted by her half-brother Nico. She grew up in the 1940s in [[New Orleans]], where her mother had a ''[[Gris-gris (talisman)|gris-gris]]'' shop. When she was born, Pluto offered to grant her mother a wish, but her request for wealth backfired into an ability to control [[precious metals]] and [[Gemstone|gems]], which both first view as a curse. Hazel died after Gaea tries to use Hazel's power over earth to resurrect [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Alcyoneus|Alcyoneus]]. When Hazel's mother changes her mind about helping Gaea, Hazel buries herself and her mother under the earth, delaying Alcyoneus's rebirth and killing them both. While Hazel's spirit is being judged, she gives up the chance to go to [[Elysium]] to save her mother from punishment, and they are both sent to the [[Asphodel Meadows|Fields of Asphodel]] instead. At some point before ''The Lost Hero'', Nico finds Hazel in the Underworld while trying to visit Bianca di Angelo, only to find she has tried for rebirth. He helps her escape to the world of the living and arranges for her to join Camp Jupiter. Hazel and Nico are protective of each other, much as true half-siblings.\n\nHazel is described as [[African American]], having cocoa-colored skin, curly cinnamon-brown hair, and golden eyes. Her legion tattoo is described as looking like a cross with curved arms and a head. She is described as being very pretty, and is a strong female role model. She eventually learns to manipulate her curse, manipulating precious stones and metals and sensing structures underground. She is an accomplished horse-rider and skilled with a ''[[spatha]]''. She tames the horse Arion, who eats precious metals. She is unusually knowledgeable about the Underworld because of her time there. During ''The House of Hades'' the goddess Hecate insists Hazel learn to manipulate the Mist. Hazel becomes very gifted at this. After the Second Gigantomachy, Hazel is promoted to the rank of centurion of the Fifth Cohort, succeeding her boyfriend [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Frank Zhang|Frank]] Zhang. Though she is much cooler than her boyfriend, she finds his inability to be cool endearing.\n\n====Frank Zhang====\n'''Frank Zhang''', nick-named \"Chinese-Canadian baby man\", by Hazel's horse, Arion, is a 16-year-old demigod, son of Mars and Emily Zhang, a [[Chinese Canadians|Chinese-Canadian]] \"legacy\" (descendant of a demigod) who dies during military service in [[Afghanistan]]. He is taken care of by his grandmother after his mother's death, and makes his way to Camp Jupiter upon her insistence. Frank's family descends from [[Periclymenus]], a grandson of Poseidon, who had the power to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]]. Periclymenus's descendants were sold into [[slavery]] in China, and migrated to Canada many years later. While battling Alcyoneus (who is invincible within [[Alaska]]), Frank taps into his ancestral power and transforms into an elephant. However, his combined power of being a son of Mars ''and'' having the ability to shapeshift makes his life very fragile. The Fates tied his life force to a piece of firewood when he was a baby, so if the wood burns up, he will die (as in the ancient Greek legend of [[Meleager]]). The goddess Juno appears to his mother and grandmother while he is a baby to warn them of this fact, as he would be crucial to defeating the Giants. In all his life, Frank has ignited the wood twice, which he can do simply by thinking about it; the first time is while he is finding his way to Camp Jupiter, in bitter cold. The second time is when he, Percy, and Hazel travel to Alaska to free Thanatos. Eventually, Frank entrusts the firewood to Hazel, and in ''The House of Hades'', Calypso creates a fireproof pouch to contain it.\n\nFrank has a meek disposition and is uncomfortable upon learning his father's identity publicly in front of the whole of Camp Jupiter. He suspected himself a son of [[Apollo]], given his skill with a [[bow and arrow]]. On his quest in ''The Son of Neptune'', and later during the series as well, he uses an enchanted spear given to him by Mars. To Frank's surprise, the spear summons a skeleton warrior that defeats the basilisks. Frank calls this skeleton \"Gray\".\n\nAs he has been residing in Camp Jupiter for no more than a year, Frank is initially considered a ''probatio'', or rookie, of the Fifth Cohort. Before the quest to free Thanatos, however, his cohort's centurion, Gwen, decides to retire and give her position to Frank. Later, in ''The House of Hades'', Jason surrenders his praetorship to Frank, who uses its authority and the Diocletian's Scepter to lead an army of Roman skeleton soldiers against the monsters in the Necromanteion.\n\nFrank was described as 'cuddly' and 'fuzzy' and with a chubby, babyish face in ''The Mark of Athena'', but in ''The House of Hades'', after summoning the blessing of Mars to defeat a hoard of enemies, he transforms. He is then described as being taller, more muscular, and without all his childhood fat. Though now built like a professional football player, he is still as sensitive as before, and is embarrassed at his new appearance at first.\n\nInitially, he was wary of the tension between Hazel and Leo, as Leo reminded Hazel of her old boyfriend, Sammy Valdez. After Leo's encounter with Calypso, however, Leo became more relaxed around Hazel and there were no more signs of anything other than friendship, much to Frank's relief. He then pursues a relationship with Hazel.\n\n====Reyna Avila Ram\u00edrez-Arellano====\n'''Reyna Avila Ram\u00edrez-Arellano''' (also known as '''RARA''') is a 16-year-old [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] demigod. She is a daughter of Bellona, a Roman Goddess of War, and the younger sister of [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan Hylla|Queen Hylla]] of the Amazons. She and her sister worked for [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Circe|Circe]] during the events of ''The Sea of Monsters''. She is described as intimidating and a natural leader; she has glossy black hair and brown eyes so dark they look black. Reyna is generally more used to responsibility than other demigods, as she is a [[praetor]] at Camp Jupiter. (she left the camp in \"the tyrant's tomb\" and joined the hunters of Artemis)<ref name=losthero/> Reyna's demigod \"power\" is the ability to lend her energy, skills, and character traits to nearby demigods. Similar to Leo Valdez, she can speak b [[English (language)|English]] Latin and Spanish. Reyna is often accompanied by two magical dogs, Aurum and Argentum, or by her pegasus Scipio (\"Skippy\" dies after their trip from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Greece]] in ''The House of Hades'').<ref name=\"house\">{{cite book |title=The House of Hades |publisher=Disney Publishing Worldwide&ndash;Hyperion Books |author=Riordan, Rick |authorlink=Rick Riordan |year=2013 |location=New York City |isbn=978-1-4231-4672-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/houseofhades00rick }}</ref> The immortal winged horse, [[Pegasus]] awards her the title of \"Horse Friend\", because of her kindness towards Scipio and others of his descendants.\n\nIn ''The Blood of Olympus'' she, Nico, and [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Gleeson Hedge|Coach Hedge]] go on a quest to return the Athena Parthenos to Camp Half-Blood. While shadow-travelling to New York, the trio stops in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] and visits Reyna's former house, haunted by the ghosts of her relatives. There Reyna reveals that the Ram\u00edrez-Arellano family (which includes [[Roberto Cofresi]] and Captain [[Marion Frederic Ram\u00edrez de Arellano]]) has always been favored by Bellona. Reyna's father (an [[Iraq war|Iraq war veteran]]) deeply loved the goddess, but his [[PTSD]] turned this love into an unhealthy paranoia. When Reyna was ten years old, he became a ''mania'', or an evil insane ghost. When the mania attacked Hylla, young Reyna picked up the closest weapon and killed what remained of her father. Reyna is reluctant to discuss the incident because [[patricide]] is \"unforgivable\" in New Rome.<ref name=\"blood\">{{cite book |title=The Blood of Olympus |publisher=Disney Publishing Worldwide&ndash;Hyperion Books |author=Riordan, Rick |authorlink=Rick Riordan |year=2014 |location=Los Angeles |isbn=978-1-4231-4673-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/bloodofolympus00rick }}</ref>\n\n====Coach Gleeson Hedge====\n'''Gleeson Hedge''' is a satyr first mentioned in ''The Last Olympian'', as the author of a distress call sent to Grover Underwood. Like Grover, Hedge is also a demigod Protector; his proudest \"recruit\" being [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Clarisse La Rue|Clarisse La Rue]]. He disguises himself as a coach at the Wilderness School to escort [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Piper McLean|Piper McLean]] and [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Leo Valdez|Leo Valdez]] (and later, [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Jason Grace|Jason Grace]]) to Camp Half-Blood. He also serves as the adult chaperone for the ''Argo II'' and later accompanies the Athena Parthenos to camp. Despite his often warlike and often overly aggressive attitude, Hedge is kind and understanding to campers in need. He enjoys extreme sports and martial arts movies. In ''The Lost Hero'', Hedge falls in love with [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Mellie|Mellie]] the cloud nymph (assistant to [[Aeolus]]) and marries her; by the time of ''The House of Hades'', Mellie is pregnant with a satyr boy. Chuck, the baby, is born at the end of ''The Blood of Olympus'', with Clarisse as his godmother. In ''The Hidden Oracle'', Hedge, Mellie, Chuck, Piper, and Jason are spending the winter in Los Angeles. He had a child with Mellie named Chuck (a satyr).\n\n===Introduced in ''The Trials of Apollo''===\n\n====Apollo / Lester Papadopoulos====\n{{see also|List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Apollo}}\n'''Apollo''', in the mortal form of '''Lester Papadopoulos''', serves as the main protagonist of ''[[The Trials of Apollo]]'' series.\n\nIn ''The Heroes of Olympus'', Apollo's Roman descendant [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Octavian|Octavian]] promises the god many things for blessing his prophetic skills, which leads to the Olympians' distraction from the true threat of Gaia, and to the resurgence of Python. As a result, the Delphic Oracle ceases to function, effectively halting demigod quests, and Zeus punishes Apollo. Zeus's punishment consists of making Apollo mortal, though he retains most of his personality and some more minor powers. This punishment is revealed in ''The Trials of Apollo''. In his mortal form, Apollo's name is Lester Papadopoulos.\n\nFollowing a meeting with two thugs, Apollo encounters a demigod called [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Meg McCaffrey|Meg McCaffrey]] who claims him as her servant until he regains his godhood. There, Apollo has to adjust himself to a life of mortality and questing to regain his former powers and lifestyle. Apollo is released by Meg after the revelation of her alliance with [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Nero|his enemy]].\n\nAs Lester, Apollo is a 16-year-old teenager with curly brown hair, blue eyes, acne, and a flabby torso. He is narcissistic, prideful, and arrogant, but does his best to not be a burden on others. His mortal transformation makes him realize how miserable humans are in facing the gods. In particular, he grows to deeply care for Meg and resolves to be with her despite the difficulties involved.<ref name=\"ToA Bk1\">{{cite book |title=The Hidden Oracle |publisher=Disney Publishing Worldwide&ndash;Hyperion Books |author=Riordan, Rick |authorlink=Rick Riordan |year=2016 |location=Los Angeles |isbn=9781484732748}}</ref>\n\n====Meg McCaffrey====\n'''Margaret (Meg) McCaffrey''' is a 12-year-demigod daughter of Demeter and the main character in ''The Hidden Oracle''. Her father was murdered by \"the Beast\" (Emperor Nero) and she was subsequently adopted by Emperor Nero, considering them as two separate people. Nero taught her the arts of a demigod and gave her a pair of crescent rings which can transform into sickles made of imperial gold, before giving her a task to lure Apollo into the Grove of Dodona. Meg appears to Apollo at an alley of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan]] to defeat the thugs, also sent by Nero, to stage \"robbery\". Meg demands Apollo's servitude and with his travels to Camp Half-Blood with Percy's assistance. There, Meg displays unusual abilities even before Demeter claims her, and later goes with Apollo to search for missing demigods and the Grove in the nearby woods, having to endure a brief abduction in the process. Her relationship with Nero is revealed at the climax, but her growing doubtfulness regarding Nero's ways, not to mention her already familiar friendship with Apollo, leads her to rob Nero of his chance on burning the Grove. While she helps Apollo bring the Grove alive, she severs their bonding spell and leaves.\n\nIn the second book, ''The Dark Prophecy'', she returns to Apollo and helps him fight Commodus.\n\nMeg is described as small and pudgy, with dark hair chopped in a messy pageboy style and black cat-eye glasses with rhinestones glittering and shimmering in the corners. She is Free-spirited and adventurous, inquisitive, and is also confrontational. She poses questions with no subtlety, something that Apollo is annoyed with but later comes to regard as a unique trait. Her abilities as Demeter's daughter allows her to connect better with nature as well as summoning a [[karpos]] (crop spirit) called Peaches (a spirit of peach trees), a power that none of Demeter's other demigod children are known to possess.<ref name=\"ToA Bk1\" />\n\nEven though she is Demeter's daughter, not Ceres (the Roman manifestation of Demeter) she fights like a Roman, with two swords; one for offense and one for defense. She is also known for her liking of unicorns in the fourth book ''The Tyrant's Tomb''.\n\n====Hemithea====\n[[Hemithea (mythology)|Hemithea]], known as \"Emmie\", is a retired Hunter of Artemis and caretaker of the Waystation. She lives with her sister, Josephine, also an ex-Hunter, and their daughter Georgia at the Waystation in [[Indianapolis]]. She and her sister were granted immortality by Apollo after escaping from the wrath of their father, King Staphylus. She then joined the Hunters of Artemis and fell in love with fellow hunter Josephine, causing them to lose their immortality and to be kicked out of the Hunt. Sometime in the 1980s, Josephine and Emmie gave up their immortality in order to grow old together. In ''The Dark Prophecy'', she saves Calypso, Leo and Apollo from the Blemmyae with crossbow turrets and lets the trio stay at the Waystation. She comments on the similarities between Calypso and her half-sister Zo\u00eb Nightshade.\n\n====Triumvirate Holdings====\n'''Triumvirate Holdings''' is a company that is led by three beings who are said to be the worst Roman Emperors in history. They force other people to worship them. During the Second Titanomachy, Triumvirate Holdings was responsible for giving Luke (at the time under the influence of Kronos) and his allies the Princess Andromeda, weapons, helicopters, and top human mercenaries. During the Second Gigantomachy, Triumvirate Holdings supplied Octavian with different weapons. Rachel described Triumvirate Holdings to be so rich that they make her father's company \"look like a kid's lemonade stand.\" The trio have divided up North America into three major empires and are hunting for Oracles, which they plan to destroy.\n\nAmong the known members of Triumvirate Holdings are:\n\n* '''[[Nero|Emperor Nero]]''' \u2013 A legacy of Apollo and the main antagonist of ''The Hidden Oracle''. The last in the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], Nero is infamous for his tyranny and overindulgence in wealth and luxury with little regard to his subjects. He is the deified Roman Emperor, who has survived through the millennia along with two other deified Roman emperors\u2014the Triumvirate. He forms an alliance with Python, who holds Delphi, while he himself controls the other oracles and plans to destroy Dodona. As the Emperor of the East, Nero lives in [[New York City]], where he recruits and trains homeless demigods, and controls the eastern third of North America. He and the other two Roman Emperors have established Triumvirate Holdings. As \"the Beast\", Nero killed [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Meg|Meg]]'s father, but later adopted and trained her in demigod arts so she could eventually lure Apollo into the Grove of Dodona. After Rhea restores the Grove of Dodona at Camp Half-Blood, Nero tries to force Apollo and Meg to burn the trees; failing at that, he sends a giant statue of himself, the Colossus Neronis, which originally stood in Rome, against Camp Half-Blood and Apollo and the Greek demigods defend the camp against it.<ref name=\"ToA Bk1\" />\n* '''[[Commodus|Emperor Commodus]]''' - Commodus is the main antagonist of ''The Dark Prophecy'' and one of the three main antagonists in ''The Tyrant's Tomb'' alongside Caligula and Tarquin. The last in the [[Nerva-Antonine dynasty]], Commodus ascended as emperor at a young age and was known for his good looks and musculature, for which he was nicknamed the \"New Hercules\". In later life, he became increasingly dictatorial and paranoid as he suspected that people would overthrow him. He also had preferences for gladiatorial battles and would buy slaves and exotic animals to fight to the death. Eventually, Apollo, with whom he had an affair, assassinated him while taking the form of [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]], his wrestling partner. As a god, he reigned as the Emperor of the Middle, ruling from a base at [[Indianapolis]]. He sends many of his men, including a kidnapped Georgie, to seek the Oracle of Trophonius, as he himself fears the oracle's reputed ability to drive its seekers insane. At the end of ''The Dark Prophecy'', he launches an attack at the Waystation, but is defeated by Apollo and his group. Commodus manages to get away at the last second, having been blinded by Apollo's brief revelation of his true form. Later, Commodus joins forces with Caligula and Tarquin to destroy Camp Jupiter but ends up being killed by Apollo.\n* '''[[Caligula|Emperor Caligula]]''' - The main antagonist of ''The Burning Maze'' and one of the three main antagonists in ''The Tyrant's Tomb'' alongside Commodus and Tarquin. He was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire, conventionally known as the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Caligula was ambushed by his Germani guards which led to his mortal death. Following this incident, he employed the Strix and the Pandai to work for him while his fellow emperors continue to use Germani. Many years later, Apollo and Piper were brought to Caligula by his talking horse Incitatus as Caligula has the Pandai they subdued executed. Before he can have Meg and Jason Grace executed, Caligula is stunned when Apollo threatens to commit suicide. After Apollo stabs himself while Caligula kills Flange following the news of the attack on Camp Jupiter ending in failure, Caligula sails north with his guards. Medea meets with Caligula and advises that performs a ritual before Apollo dies. Caligula later fights Jason and Tempest on the back of Incitatus where he manages to kill Jason. After making sure that he is dead, Caligula sets sail for the Bay Area. Later, Caligula joins forces with Commodus and Tarquin to destroy Camp Jupiter but ends up being killed by Frank.\n* '''[[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|King Tarquin]]''' - One of the three main antagonists in ''The Tyrant's Tomb'' alongside Commodus and Caligula. Tarquin is the last king of Rome and is depicted as a zombie. He participated in the Battle of San Francisco Bay where he targeted the Sibyillin Books. Tarquin was killed by Hazel and Diana.\n\n===Greek-Roman deities===\n\n====Twelve Olympians====\nThough not all the gods who appear in [[Rick Riordan]]'s novels are truly ''[[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]]'' (that is, gods who live on [[Mount Olympus#Mythology|Mt. Olympus]]), all Greek and Roman gods are generally considered to be a subset of the '''[[Twelve Olympians]]'''. As such, most characters in the series refer to these immortals generally as the \"Olympian gods\", to distinguish them from the Greco-Roman [[#Primordial deities|primordial gods]] and [[#Titans|Titan]]s.\n\n* '''[[Zeus]]'''/'''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]''' \u2013 The king of the gods, Zeus is most prominent in ''The Lightning Thief''<ref name=\"lightningbook\" /> but has several roles throughout the rest of ''Percy Jackson & the Olympians''. Zeus is shown prominently throughout the series to be extremely narcissistic, paranoid and hypocritical. In ''The Lost Hero'', under the influence of Khione, Zeus forbids contact between gods and mortals and closes off Olympus (against the influence of Khione), although he indirectly helps the protagonists several times on their quests.<ref name=\"losthero\"/> As the primary Olympian god, his demigod children reside in Camp Half-Blood's biggest cabin, Cabin 1, although there is only one person who resides there at the end of ''The Heroes of Olympus'': Jason. In the film adaption, Zeus is played by [[Sean Bean]].\n* '''[[Hera]]'''/'''[[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]''' \u2013 The queen of the gods who plays a role in ''The Titan's Curse'',<ref name=\"Titan's Curse\" /> by helping Percy and the others on their quest in ''The Battle of the Labyrinth''.<ref name=\"labyrinth\" /> As Juno in ''The Lost Hero'', she is kidnapped by Gaea, and contacts Jason Grace to rescue her.

His major crimes involved cheating death twice. The first where he tricked Thanatos into showing him how the chains worked causing Thanatos to be trapped until Ares freed him (Thanatos being trapped displeased Ares since no one in battle could die). The second time was when he complained to Persephone that his wife Merope did not give him a proper funeral and sent Sisyphus' spirit to the living. Even when Sisyphus did not want to return to the Underworld, he was forcefully dragged back there by Hermes. His punishment in The Fields of Punishment was to push a boulder up a hill. When it got close to the top, the boulder would roll back to the bottom and Sisyphus was condemned to begin again. He appears in ''The Demigod Files'' in the story titled ''The Sword of Hades'' when Percy and Nico asked his advice while Thalia pushes the boulder up the hill. He does not really help them much, but he does say that he helped someone else. He said that he told that other person to go see Melinoe.

When he tried to pluck the fruit to eat, the branches of the tree rose out of his reach and when he bent down to drink the water, the level would retreat. Tantalus became \"tantalised\" by having food and drink close to him, but unable to enjoy either. He becomes the activities director at Camp Half-Blood after Chiron is fired. He appears in ''The Sea of Monsters'' as a minor character. Even when hired as the activities director, he could not eat or drink as the food kept evading him. Tantalus is shown to hate Percy and his friends even more than he hates most half-bloods, yet shows favoritism to Clarisse, as when naming her hero when the camp was attacked by Colchis Bulls or when she wins the chariot race and throwing a banquet in her honor. When Tyson is brought to camp, Tantalus insults and makes fun of him even when Tyson is claimed by Poseidon. When the camp is attacked by a large flock of Stymphalian birds, Tantalus blames it on Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson's \"bad chariot driving\" despite that they were the ones who defeated the birds.

Her magic causes Jason and Leo to become hostile to one another. Realizing Medea is an agent of Gaea, Piper brings them to their senses and leads their escape before Medea can do anything else to them by blowing up the mall and killing her again. In ''The Burning Maze'', Medea returned where she is now working for Caligula. When she engages Meg in a charmspeak battle, she announces her plans to take Apollo's essence, combine it with her grandfather's leftover power, and make Caligula the new God of the Sun.

He is the son of Julius and Ruby Kane. After the death of his mother (when he was eight years old), he spent six years travelling the world with his [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] father. His sister Sadie stays with their grandparents and they get to see each other once in a while. After his father is captured by the god [[Set (deity)|Set]] during ''[[The Red Pyramid (novel)|The Red Pyramid]]'', Carter spends most of his time with his sister Sadie and uncle Amos Kane. He becomes the host of Horus in the first novel, and often collaborates with and receives advice from the god. He also develops a romantic relationship with the ''[[ushabti|shabti]]'' of magician Zia Rashid, and subsequently spends much of his time trying to find the real Zia and demonstrate his feelings toward her. Like his father, Carter has dark skin and hair, quite different from both his mother and sister. When living with his father, Carter dressed \"impeccably\" like Julius even when relaxing, but adopts a much more casual style when he goes to live at Brooklyn House. Though he is not one to flout rules, Carter is brave and courageous enough to pursue the way of the gods despite the House of Life's disapproval. His specialty is combat magic; his preferred weapon a [[khopesh]], but loses it in ''The Throne of Fire''.<ref name=\"Book2\" /> He is often given leadership responsibilities and struggles to accept his role, until he willingly becomes pharaoh of the House of Life during ''[[The Serpent's Shadow (Riordan novel)|The Serpent's Shadow]]''.\n\n====Sadie Kane====\n'''Sadie Kane''' is one of two main protagonists and narrators; the younger sister of Carter Kane. She is left in the care of her non-magical grandparents in London after the death of their mother Ruby Kane. Though she is able to live a \"normal\" life, something her brother is occasionally jealous of, her unusual circumstances make her sometimes jealous of Carter (especially when she is reminded of his exotic lifestyle). Sadie has to abruptly leave her life in London when she goes to revive the twenty-first Nome and fight Set after the god captures her father, Julius Kane. Sadie becomes the host of Isis in ''The Red Pyramid'' and continues to study the goddess's path throughout the series. She also becomes romantically involved with one of the Brooklyn House initiates Walt Stone and also with the god Anubis, though her relationship with either is not formalized until after Walt becomes the \"eye\" of Anubis in ''The Serpent's Shadow''.\n\nShe has caramel-colored hair and fair skin, some traits inherited from her mother Ruby. Unlike Carter, Sadie is rebellious and bold (also like her mother) and acts the part; often making snap decisions, ignoring rules, and choosing to wear clothing to display her personality rather than to conform or aid her magic. Her magical specialty is with spells, potions, and [[hieroglyphics]].\n\n====Walt Stone====\n'''Walt Stone''' is one of the twenty-first Nome's initiates, who arrives at Brooklyn House sometime  in the second novel. He has dark skin and is from [[Seattle]], where he lived with his mother. Walt is a ''sau'', or charmmaker.<ref name=\"Book2\">{{cite book |title=The Throne of Fire |publisher=Disney-Hyperion |author=Riordan, Rick |year=2011 |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4231-4056-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/throneoffire00rior }}</ref> In ''The Throne of Fire'', it is revealed that Walt has inherited a deadly curse from his ancestor [[Akhenaten]], which will kill him before reaches adulthood, as it did to his father and their famous ancestor [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]]. The curse progresses more quickly when he uses magic, which is why he specializes in charms and also why he begins to call on the god Anubis for guidance. In ''The Serpent's Shadow'', Walt finally succumbs to the curse, but as he dies he allows himself to become the host of Anubis, whose spirit can essentially keep him alive. Both Anubis and Walt Stone have romantic feelings for Sadie Kane. Which makes it easier to host Anubis.\n\n====Zia Rashid====\n'''Zia Rashid''' is a magician from the first Nome who was born and raised in [[Egypt]]. She is found and raised by Iskandar, the [[lector priest|Chief Lector]], after the destruction of her hometown by Apophis. When Julius Kane released five gods through the [[Rosetta Stone]], she became the unexpected host of [[Nephthys]], and was subsequently placed by Iskandar in an underwater prison so the House of Life could not eliminate her. A ''shabti'' of her was created to take her place; it is destroyed during the fight with Set in ''The Red Pyramid''. Carter Kane falls in love with this shabti and seeks out the real Zia to free her and release Nephthys's spirit. Zia, who specializes in fire magic, later becomes the host of Ra and the two manage to destroy Apophis in ''The Serpent's Shadow''. Her initial indifference to Carter slowly evolves into romance, and the two begin dating at the end of the series when Ra ascends back to the heavens.\n\n====Amos Kane====\n'''Amos Kane''' is Julius Kane's younger brother, Carter and Sadie's uncle, and the leader of the twenty-first Nome (New York). He takes in Carter and Sadie after Julius hosts Osiris and is trapped by the god Set. During the first novel, Amos is possessed by Set and forced to lure his niece and nephew to the god's pyramid in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Once freed, Amos goes for healing at the first Nome, and does not return to Brooklyn House until the second novel. His experience hosting Set has changed him, however, and eventually leads to his highly controversial decision to voluntarily host the god during the final battle with Apophis. Amos succeeds Michel Desjardins when the former leader of the House of Life sacrifices himself fighting Apophis.\n\n====Iskandar====\n'''Iskandar''' is the Chief Lector of the House of Life. Born in the 1st century BCE, during the reign of [[Cleopatra]] VII, he witnessed the end of the Egyptian monarchy and the absorption of Egypt into the [[Roman Empire]]. He came to believe this was the fault of the gods and ended the House's policy of calling upon them; Ruby Kane's vision of Apophis rising changes his mind, but it is too late for him to make any real change. He was the one who saved Zia after her village's destruction and, sensing that she holds the power to host Ra, arranged for her confinement in an underwater prison under the watch of Nephthys while creating a ''shabti'' of her to protect Carter and Sadie, both of whom also hold the potential to become hosts of gods. Shortly after meeting them, he dies in his sleep, knowing that these three can make a change where he could not. He is succeeded by Michel Desjardins as the House's leader.\n\n====Michel Desjardins====\n'''Michel Desjardins''' is the lesser antagonist and leader of the House of Life after the death of Iskandar. Desjardins is the grandnephew of [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]] and approximately 200 years old, considered \"young\" for a magician. As such, he has known only the House policy forbidding the Path of the Gods. He is therefore at first opposed to cooperation with the gods and disagrees with the Kanes when they claim it is necessary to stop Apophis. He works with Vladimir Menshikov in the latter's attempt to hunt Sadie and Carter Kane, believing his lies about how the Kanes' efforts will empower Apophis. Upon discovering the truth, that the Kanes were right and Menshikov is trying to free Apophis, he journeys to the Duat to help Carter and Sadie and sacrifices himself to execrate Apophis, killing Menshikov and buying the Kanes more time. He is succeeded as leader of the House of Life by Amos Kane.\n<!-- (pronounced Dey-shard-dahn) Can we get a phonetic? -->\n\n===Egyptian deities===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian deities}}\n* '''[[Anubis]]''' \u2014 God of funerals and death and periodic advisor to Sadie Kane, for whom he has romantic feelings.

After a failed attempt to release the Egyptian goddess Bast back into the world results in the death of his wife, he works to find a way to release them again and become host to Osiris. He ultimately succeeds, dies of his own free will, and goes to \"live\" as the god's physical manifestation in the Underworld, overseeing the [[Ancient Egyptian religion#Judgment|Hall of Judgment]].\n* '''Ruby Kane''' \u2014 Carter and Sadie's late mother, who appears occasionally as a ''[[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ba (personality)|ba]]'' to advise her children. She was a magician and diviner who foresaw Apophis's rise and ultimate victory if the other gods were not there to stop him. As a result, she and her husband attempted to release Bast from her eternal battle with Apophis so the goddess could heal before his inevitable rise. She gave her life to close the portal they opened using [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]], because Apophis was fighting to get out. Ruby also communed with Isis at some point in her career as a magician, and attempted to convince then-Chief Lector Iskandar to remand his policy of fighting the gods.\n* '''Vladimir Menshikov''' \u2014 The antagonist of ''The Throne of Fire''. Menshikov's intense hatred of the gods and desire for power leads to his possession by Apophis. He manipulates Michel Desjardins into permitting him to hunt the Kane family. When Desjardins finally discovers his involvement, he uses up all his energy in an execration of the chaos demon and, by extension, Menshikov, who is then killed.

The ''Kane Chronicles'' present a different picture of Ammit than is typical, by portraying the demon as both no larger than a [[toy poodle]] and as a male.\n* '''Doughboy''' \u2014 Julius Kane's wax ''shabti''; comically resentful of Julius. He is used for many purposes by Carter and Sadie.\n* '''Egyptian [[Griffin]]''' - The sacred animals of Horus.

They have the ability to spit poison and are tremendously strong.\n\n==''Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard''==\n===Main characters===\n====Magnus Chase====\n'''Magnus Chase''' is the main protagonist of the series. A 16-year-old [[Boston]]ian teenager, Magnus lost his mother Natalie to a mysterious wolf attack two years prior to the events of ''The Sword of Summer'' and is forced to live in the streets with his homeless friends, Blitz and Hearth. On his 16th birthday, his uncle, Randolph informs him of his divine parentage as a son of a Norse god and his inheritance of ''Sumarbrander'', the sword that once belonged to his father Frey. After being killed by [[Surtr|Surt]], a fire giant, Magnus is then carried to [[Valhalla|Hotel Valhalla]] by Samirah Al-Abbas, a Valkyrie. He then finds out that his father is Frey, the god of peace, wealth and prosperity, who belongs to the Vanir tribe of Norse deities.\n\nMagnus is described as having blond hair that reaches his chin and haunting gray eyes that resemble his cousin, Annabeth's. He is said to look like [[Kurt Cobain]] and has [[asthma]]. His scrawny look is replaced by a more muscular persona after his death and acceptance to Valhalla. He is quite street smart due to the two years he spent as a homeless child and as a result, is not quick to trust people. Nevertheless, he considers Blitz and Hearth as the only friends he is completely loyal to, and after a while, also begins to ease up and trust Sam. He is also known to have a budding relationship with another child of [[Loki]] named Alex Fierro. He is not fiery nor quick to anger.\n\nAs a son of the god of fertility, Magnus does not excel in offensive power. Instead, he usually thinks strategically to safely escape from danger. When he does have to attack, he mainly uses the Sword of Summer, Jack, who attacks autonomously. Magnus' demigod abilities concern healing and warmth: through concentration, Magnus is able to heal even the mortally injured as well making a mortal see through Ginnungagap and thus the Norse world, though doing so often causes him to read the subject's memories.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\">{{cite book |title=The Sword of Summer |publisher=[[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Disney]]-[[Hachette Books#Hyperion Books|Hyperion]] |author=Riordan, Rick |authorlink=Rick Riordan |year=2015 |location=[[Los Angeles]] |isbn=978-1-4231-6091-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/swordofsummer0000rior }}</ref>\n\n====Blitzen====\n'''Blitzen (Blitz)''' is a 20-year-old [[Svart\u00e1lfar|dwarf]] or, more specifically, a svartalf from [[Ni\u00f0avellir|Nidavellir]]. He has dark skin and hair, and has a beard. He is the son of a Vanir, Freya, making him Magnus' cousin, and a dwarf, Bil\u00ec, who was eaten by Fenris Wolf while checking Fenris's prison rope. He is sent alongside Hearth by [[M\u00edmir|Mimir]] to watch and protect Magnus. Though he keeps it up for two years, the task fails when Magnus is killed, but Blitz continues to look for him until they are reunited in Valhalla. As a dwarf, Blitz is sensitive to sunlight and will slowly turn to stone if exposed too much, which is why he always wears a copious article of clothing whenever there is sunlight, except in [[Folkvangr|Folkvanger]], in which sunlight is replaced by an aura radiated by Freya instead. Instead of forging, Blitz excels in clothing design, making him a laughing stock among his fellow dwarfs, but after he wins a match against Eitri Junior, he becomes respected and eventually opens up a clothing shop. In battle, Blitz uses his creations to assist himself, including chain-mail gloves and vest. Blitz has had a strong relationship with Hearth ever since the former saved the latter's life, and the two are very protective of each other.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n\n====Hearthstone====\n'''Hearthstone (Hearth)''' is a [[D\u00f6kk\u00e1lfar and Lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar|light elf]] from [[\u00c1lfheimr|Alfheim]]. He is skinny with pale skin and with short spiky blond hair, which, when combined with his black leather jacket, jeans, and a red scarf, \"makes him look like a character from a Japanese ''anime''\". Hearth is deaf and can only communicate with ASL (Alf Sign Language), though he is able to read lips. Since his homeworld is always bright, he is sensitive to darkness. Like Blitz, Hearth makes a deal with Mimir to drink water from [[M\u00edmisbrunnr|Mimir's Well]] by one of the roots of Yggdrasil to gain knowledge about runes and in return has to work with him for several years. He becomes a companion and protector of Magnus from then on. Hearth is the first elf in a long time to focus on magic from runes, which he has studied extensively. He can cast various runes, though doing such consumes his energy. Eventually, he progresses to the rank of a full sorcerer.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n\nHearth has a traumatic past, as he is effectively unwanted by his parents, who shun him for being deaf and not as great as his brother, Andiron, who died young; he is forced to face his past in the second book, when he has to collect the Skofnung Stone from his father, Alderman, who wants him to finish the blood tax imposed on him as repentance for Andiron's death. He is also reminded that sooner or later, he will have to take the ''[[Odal (rune)|othala]]'' rune from Andiron's place of death, which he planted as a reminder of his past, to complete his magic arts. In the third book, Hearth decides to take ''othala'', using it to summon Andiron's spirit to distract his father long enough for Magnus to pierce his heart. His relationship with his friends helps him, though, and he even once calls Magnus \"brother\". At the end of the first book, Hearth is freed from servitude and begins learning runes at [[Asgard]] from Odin.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n\n====Samirah al-Abbas====\n'''Samirah (Sam) al-Abbas Bint Loki''' is a [[Valkyrie]] and a daughter of Loki who selects Magnus as an [[einherjar|einherji]] under [[Odin]]'s order. She is an [[Arab American]] who normally wears her Valkyrie armor and a green [[hijab]], which doubles as a [[Valkyrie#V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a|swan cloak]] ([[Metamaterial cloaking|camouflage cloak]]). She leads a double life as both a Valkyrie and a normal high schooler. She does not worship the Norse gods as she is [[Muslim]] and believes in [[Allah|God]]. Her family is from [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], but has been raised by her grandparents in [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] since the death of [[#The Al Abbas family|her mother]]. Sam's family already had a long history with the Vikings, even before her mother met Loki; [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]], an envoy of the [[Abbasid|Abbasid Caliph]] to the [[Kievan Rus']], is one of Sam's ancestors, and the [[Varangians]] have since intermarried with Sam's family. Her specific parentage is a shame to her mother's family as an out-of-[[Marriage|wedlock]] child; the Norse also distrust her for being Loki's daughter.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/> Sam is betrothed to her childhood crush, [[#Amir|Amir Fadlan]].<ref name=\"kirkus magnus1\">{{cite web |title=THE SWORD OF SUMMER by Rick Riordan {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|url = https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rick-riordan/sword-of-summer/|website = Kirkus Reviews|accessdate = 2015-10-10|language = en-us}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Sword of Summer'', Sam is expelled from Valhalla when her video of Magnus' heroic death is edited by Gunilla, but later joins Magnus, Blitz, and Hearth in stopping Fenris Wolf from breaking free. She is eventually reinstated as Valkyrie and gets another job as Odin's personal aide. In ''[[The Hammer of Thor]]'', Sam is unwillingly betrothed by Loki to [[Thrym]] in exchange for [[Mjolnir]]; in reality, Loki wants the [[Skofnung|Skofnung Sword]], with which he can finally free himself.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/> Sam is then given a task by Odin to head towards [[Scandinavia]] and personally imprison Loki back before he is able to invade [[Midgard]] and eventually [[Asgard]]. In ''The Ship of the Dead'', Sam participates in the quest to stop the Naglfar from sailing in Niflheim and has sufficiently trained with Alex enough that she is immune to Loki's influence. The quest is challenging for her not only because of its danger, but also because she is [[Sawm|fasting]] for [[Ramadan]].\n\nAs a fighter, Sam wields a Valkyrie axe or dagger. She has also inherited her father's ability to shapeshift into animals such as a horsefly or lion; however, shapeshifting makes her uncomfortable, as it causes her to become more like her father. Sam wants to become an [[aircraft pilot]] and enjoys being a Valkyrie because it affords her a chance to fly (albeit through levitation, not piloting).\n\n====Sumarbrander====\n'''The Sword of Summer (Jack)''' was Frey's weapon, currently wielded by Magnus Chase. After Magnus finds out that the sword is sentient, Sumarbrander decides to name itself Jack, and be referred to as a male. In battle Magnus can let the sword attack his enemies on its own or use his own strength and control the sword himself. Either way, it is Magnus who loses energy ultimately, though this loss is delayed until he next grips or sheathes Jack.\n\nHe bears a grudge against Frey, who 'abandoned' him, by giving him to [[Skirnir]] as a price for the latter bringing the former a Giantess with whom he fell in love; he summarises this by once admonishing Frey, saying 'blades before babes'.\n\nHe reached Boston with one of Skirnir's descendants during the Viking expansion, where he was lost for centuries till he was recovered by Magnus.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n\n====Alex Fierro====\n{{main|Alex Fierro}}\nIntroduced in ''Magnus Chase and the Hammer of Thor'', Alex Fierro is a child of Loki (mother) and Mr. Fierro (father). She/he is [[Genderqueer|gender-fluid]], similar to Loki, who was known to change genders in myths. She/he prefers pronouns coinciding with her/his gender at the moment rather than 'they'. When in Valhalla, she/he is referred to as an [[argr]], the [[Old Norse]] word for 'unmanly,' due to being assigned male but identifying as a woman most of the time. Unlike her/his half-sister, Sam, Alex was born via Loki's female form, thus making the god her/his mother rather than her/his father. Like Sam, she/he resents her/his mother; however, Alex seems to be able to resist Loki much easier than Sam. She/he, like Magnus, is homeless, in her/his case due to her/his father disagreeing with her/his gender-fluidity. Nevertheless, she/he treasures her/his Fierro heritage, an ancient family who had lived near [[Mexico City]] as potters since before the time of the [[Aztecs]].\n\nIn ''The Hammer of Thor'', Alex goes to Jotunheim alongside Magnus and the others to visit Utgard-Loki and find out about Loki's plan about Sam's betrothal. She/he becomes Sam's double during her betrothal and forms a friendship with Sif. In ''The Ship of the Dead'', Alex has trained Sam to resist Loki's influence and participates in the quest to Scandinavia to stop Naglfar from sailing. She/he grows closer with Magnus and kisses him when the group is struggling to reach Skadi's fortress in Niflheim. The kiss is recounted by Magnus during his fighting with Loki as the greatest thing to have ever happened to him. By the end of the book, she/he assists Magnus in running the Chase Space, a shelter for the homeless youth.\n\nAlex uses a gold [[Garrote|garrote wire]] as a weapon, which formally used to be a pottery wire. She/he can also shape-shift into things such as a bear and an elephant in combat, and is far more comfortable with embracing this power than her/his half-sister, Sam.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\">{{cite book |title=The Hammer of Thor |publisher=[[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Disney]]-[[Hachette Books#Hyperion Books|Hyperion]] |author=Riordan, Rick |authorlink=Rick Riordan |year=2016 |location=[[Los Angeles]] |isbn=978-1-4231-6092-2}}</ref>\n\n===Norse deities===\nThe Norse gods fall into two general groups: the [[\u00c6sir|Aesir]] and the [[Vanir]]. All are referred to generally as \"Asgardians\", but the Vanir inhabit [[Vanaheim]] as often as Asgard. The Aesir are more warlike, while the Vanir are peaceful. Specifically, however, the gods tend to be distinguished by what side they fought on during the [[\u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War|Aesir-vanir war]], and not by their personal temperaments.\n\n====Aesir====\nThe following [[Norse mythology|Norse gods]] are considered the more warlike of the two strains of immortals.\n\n* '''[[Frigg]]''' \u2013 The queen of the Aesir and wife of Odin, the goddess of knowledge, wisdom, and forethought. As Odin frequently travels through the Nine Worlds, Frigg is left in charge of Asgard most of the time. Sam idolizes her among the Aesir as she is the glue that keeps the gods together. According to Sam, no einherji or valkyrie have ever seen Frigg in person. ''The Ship of the Dead'' reveals that she is the mother of Mallory, whom she gives a walnut capable of trapping anything inside it.\n* '''[[Heimdallr|Heimdall]]''' \u2013 The all-seeing, all-hearing god of vigilance and guardian of [[Bifr\u00f6st|Bifrost]], the entrance of Asgard, who was born from [[Nine Mothers of Heimdallr|nine mothers]]. He has a hobby of taking [[selfies]], using his horn [[Gjallarhorn|Gjallar]] as a [[phablet]] and a [[selfie stick]], which tends to make him forget to directly oversee the Nine Worlds.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n* '''[[Kvasir]]''' \u2013 An Aesir born from the saliva of the gods, created as a peace treaty following the Aesir-Vanir war. He walked through the Nine Worlds giving advice to beings, but he fell to a trap by Fjalar and Galar, who killed him and drained his blood to create the [[Mead of Poetry]].\n* '''[[Loki]]''' \u2013 The god of evil and trickery. He is the father of Samirah Al Abbas. He can also become female, having turned into a mare to give birth to the eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]] and later into a red-haired woman to give birth to the demigod Alex Fierro, who like Loki, is [[gender-fluid]]. After tricking [[H\u00f6\u00f0r|Hod]] to kill [[Balder]], he is chained to a rock with the entrails of his sons as chains with poison from a snake dripping onto his face constantly. He makes it his personal goal to break free and take revenge against the gods in [[Ragnarok]], using his trickery to manipulate people around him even when he is incorporeal. He finally manages to break free at the end of ''[[The Hammer of Thor]]'' and begins the preparations to sail in the Naglfar to declare Ragnarok.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/> In ''The Ship of the Dead'', despite managing to shame Magnus greatly during their flyting duel, he is overpowered when Magnus flytes him with the power of his friends long enough for Mallory to trap him inside a magical walnut. Odin later sentences Loki to be chained again to the rock.\n* '''[[M\u00edmir]]''' \u2013 The god of knowledge and wisdom. He was beheaded during the [[\u00c6sir-Vanir War]] and only his head remains. He is the boss of Blitz and Hearth due to a deal they made, in order to drink from his well. The deal is nullified by Odin at the end of first book as their reward for dealing with the Fenris Wolf.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[Odin]]''' \u2013 The king of the Aesir, the god of royalty and magic. He is able to rewrite reality by spelling out runes, which he learned after hanging for nine days on a branch of Yggdrasil. Odin is the owner and proprietor of Hotel Valhalla where he is always away on important businesses where he searches for knowledge and leaves the important decisions to his management. His ravens and wolves represent him at meetings. In ''The Sword of Summer'', Odin is claimed to have disappeared two years before Magnus' acceptance as an einherji, but he actually disguises himself as X the Troll, and one of Magnus' floormates. At the end of the book, Odin reveals himself and rewards Magnus and his friends for their bravery against the Fenris Wolf. He likes to give presentations.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[R\u00e1n|Ran]]''' \u2013 The goddess of the sea, who operates a net that collects anything that falls into the sea. She has an apple of Idun, but forgets to consume it, which contributes to her elderly appearance. Magnus and Sam manage to convince her to give them the apple and Sumarbrander, but she warns that doing so has made her and Aegir bent on attacking Magnus.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[Sif]]''' \u2013 The goddess of the earth and Thor's self-proclaimed \"trophy wife\". After losing her hair due to Loki's trick, she now has golden hair that can be melded into precious objects, inspiring the legend of ''[[Rapunzel]]''. Sam and Alex, both Loki's children, do not like her; the former states that Sif is vain and accepts her hair replacement and title because she does not understand that Loki is merely playing with her. Alex, however, begins to have respect for her after she helps her dress for Thrym's wedding ceremony.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n* '''[[Sigyn]]''' \u2013 Sigyn is Loki's wife. She reduces his punishment by collecting venom dripped by the venomous snake in a bowl, though it is never enough to alleviate them from torturing him. When Loki is about to free himself in ''The Hammer of Thor'', she appears to make an attempt to delay the escape, but later goes with him anyway when the Asgardians come. She is present during Magnus and Loki's flyting duel; when Loki indirectly insults her by claiming that he stands by himself, she leaves the area, dealing the final blow to the flyting once Magnus points out that Loki has no one to care for him. She is described as having eyes that tear blood, as well as a perpetually blank expression.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n* '''[[Thor]]''' \u2013 The god of lightning, storms, and strength. He has an unkempt appearance, is lazy, and is also up-to-date with modern television shows. He has red hair, huge muscles and a dirty face. He wears a sleeveless, leather jerkin and is very loud. He tasks Magnus and his friends with retrieving his spear, which was stolen from him by Geirrod. He has two talking goats, [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjostr]], nicknamed Otis and Marvin. His hammer is currently missing, which becomes an important plot point in ''[[The Hammer of Thor]]'', where he regains it.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n* '''[[Tyr]]''' \u2013 The god of courage, law, and trial by combat. He lost his a hand due to Fenris Wolf's bite. All of his children, T.J. included, are naturally inclined to accept challenges. He appears at the end of ''The Ship of the Dead'', congratulating T.J. for stopping Loki from starting Ragnarok.\n* '''[[V\u00ed\u00f0arr|Vidar]]''' \u2013 The god of revenge, also called the \"Silent One\" due to his method of communicating with ASL. He is sensible and snarky, a complete opposite of his brother Thor.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n\n====Vanir====\nThese gods are generally more peaceful and dislike the warlike nature of the Aesir:\n\n* '''[[Freyr|Frey]]''' \u2013 The god of fertility, warmth, and healing, the twin brother of Freya, and the father of Magnus. Frey owned a sword, Sumarbrander, which was given to Skirnir in return for his help in wooing a beautiful giantess; as a result, he is unarmed by the time of Ragnarok and will be killed by Surt. Though Magnus never meets his father until the end of the first book, he realizes that all the times his mother took him hiking through the wilderness was a way for them to get closer to Frey.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[Freyja|Freya]]''' \u2013 The goddess of love and warmth and the twin sister of Frey. She is described as very beautiful. She presides over Vanaheim, where the other half of worthy souls go after death, and casts warmth that shines over it. Freya is the mother of most dwarves in Nidavellir, including Blitz, which happened because she bartered to (briefly) marry some dwarves in exchange for luxurious items. Freya tasks Blitz to get some earrings by challenging Junior.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|Njord]]''' \u2013 The god of fishery, seafaring, and crop fertility, the father of Frey and Freya, and Magnus' grandfather. He is a mortal enemy of Aegir and Ran, his influence stopping them from ravaging through the sea and reducing the mortal casualties. In ''The Ship of the Dead'', he saves Magnus and company from being killed by Aegir's nine daughters and tells them to seek his ex-wife, Skaldi, if they want to prevent Loki from sailing in the Naglfar.\n\n====Other Norse gods====\n* '''[[Hel (being)|Hel]]''' \u2013 The daughter of Loki who presides over [[Hel (location)|Helheim]], the realm where the unworthy dead go. One half of her is a very beautiful woman, while the other is a decaying corpse. She tries to persuade Magnus to give up Sumarbrander to Randolph, but he refuses.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[Norns]]''' \u2013 A trio of female figures who can see the past, present, and future. They recite a prophecy to Magnus that kickstarts his journey to stop Fenris Wolf from breaking free.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''Fear''' \u2013 A minor God who assists the Mountain Giants. In ''The Hammer of Thor'', it is sent to compete with Sam in a game of axe throwing under the guise of a Mountain Giant called Little Billy. Sam sees through the illusion and defeats it.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n\n===Hotel Valhalla residents and staff===\nThe following characters live and/or work in Hotel Valhalla and all answer to Odin. It is their duty to prepare an army for the day of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].\n\n====Einherjar====\n* '''Dede''' \u2013 Dede is one of Magnus' fellow new einherjar. She is the daughter of two mortals. Dede is prophesied to become a Thane of Valhalla.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n* '''Halfborn Gunderson''' \u2013 An einherji who has lived in Hotel Valhalla since the Age of the Vikings over 1,200 years ago. He originated from [[Fl\u00e5m]], a small village in [[Norway]] and died in [[East Anglia]] while protecting [[Ivar the Boneless]]. He is described as \"[[Robinson Crusoe]] on steroids.\" Having lived for a long time, Halfborn is extremely skilled and has learned many languages. He has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Germanic literature. He almost dies at the end of ''The Sword of Summer'', but is revived by Magnus' power of healing.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/> Since ''The Hammer of Thor'', Halfborn is dating Mallory.\n* '''[[Helgi Hundingsbane]]''' \u2013 A Viking from East Gothland who is the [[hotel manager]] of Hotel Valhalla and member of the Thanes where he mostly works at the reception desk.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''Hunding''' \u2013 The former King of the Saxons, the [[bellhop]] and [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]] of Hotel Valhalla, and Helgi Hundingsbane's servant. Back in the year 749 C.E., Hundling and Helgi were opponents on the battlefield. When they came to Valhalla, Helgi was made the manager. His first order was to have Hunding do all the menial labor. Hunding has been at the hotel for thousands of years and longs for his family.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''Lars Alhstrom''' \u2013 An einherji and son of Thor who comes to Hotel Valhalla alongside Magnus. He died trying to free trapped people at sea.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''Mallory Keen''' \u2013 An Irish einherji and a daughter of Frigg. A member of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], she died during [[The Troubles]] while attempting to deactivate a bomb she planted to a school bus due to Loki's trick.

Sam later states that the two have sorted the misunderstanding and retained their engagement.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n\n===Bullies===\nThe following people have picked on the main characters:\n\n* '''Nancy Bobofit''' - Percy and Grover's schoolmate in Yancy Academy in ''The Lightning Thief''. She is a bully who frequently torments Grover and gets into conflicts with Percy. However, she was favored by Mrs. Dodds/Alecto, which irritates Percy. In ''The Lightning Thief'', she was throwing food at Grover, when suddenly she was doused in water from the fountain (later revealed to be Percy's water powers). After the incident, she avoided Percy.\n* '''Matt Sloan''' - Percy and Tyson's schoolmate in Meriwether College Prep in ''The Sea of Monsters''. He frequently targets Tyson for his awkwardness and clumsiness, which comes into direct conflict with Percy. He instigated dangerous events during their English exam (which requires them to stay outside for 1.5 hours) and was the opposing team captain to Percy in the dodgeball game. He also made six friends on the last day of school, who were revealed as Laistrygonians. After Tyson defeats the monsters in the dodgeball game, Sloan blamed Percy for the incident, which gets him expelled and temporarily on the run from the police.\n* '''Isabel''' - Piper and Leo's schoolmate in the Wilderness School. She teases Piper for never meeting with her mother and for being a Cherokee, not knowing that Piper is the daughter of Hollywood star Tristan McLean.\n* '''Rufus''' - Hazel and Sammy's schoolmate in St. Agnes Academy for Colored Children and Indians during Hazel's first life. He was the leader of bullies who called Hazel a freak for summoning cursed stones and for being the daughter of a witch, but was always stopped by Sammy before he could hurt her even further.\n\n===Other mortals===\n* '''Barry al-Jabbar''' \u2013 A family friend of Sam and Amir who teaches the former piloting. In ''The Hammer of Thor'', he escorts Magnus and company to Boston from Cape Cod and is briefly possessed by Utgard-Loki, who tells Magnus to visit him.\n* '''Beryl Grace''' \u2013 Thalia and Jason Grace's mother was a television actress with whom Zeus broke his oath not to have more human children. Thalia describes her as flighty, demanding and neglectful of both her children, and she would have run away from home earlier had Jason not existed. Beryl offering Jason to Hera's patronage, however, was the last straw that led Thalia to abandon her. Her stress turned her into alcohol, and she died several years before ''The Lightning Thief'' in a car accident. Melinoe impersonates her to instill fear on Thalia in the short story \"Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades\" in ''The Demigod Files''. In ''The Blood of Olympus'', Jason encounters her mania, who wants her son to return to her so they can be a family again, an offer which Jason rejects. She then disappears in a hiss or a sigh of relief.\n* '''Cade and Mickey''' \u2014 A pair of thugs sent by Nero to rob Apollo, although Meg is able to easily drive them off. Cade is described as tall and red-haired, while Mickey is short and blond-haired.\n* '''Emma and Liz''' \u2014 Sadie Kane's human friends from London. The stay with Sadie in ''The Throne of Fire'' during Babi and Nekhbet's sudden attack. Sadie describes Emma as \"what an Indian daughter of the singer [[Elton John]] might look like\", and Liz as a \"boy-crazy redhead\".<ref name=\"Book2\" />\n* '''Esther''' \u2013 Esther is a librarian of the [[Jimmy Carter Presidential Library]] in [[Atlanta]]. She offers Percy, Frank, and Coach Hedge a ride to the [[Georgia Aquarium]] in ''The Mark of Athena''. Hedge describes her as having the scent of potpourri.\n* '''Officer G\u00f3mez''' \u2013 A Bostonian [[police officer]]. He wants to capture Magnus.\n* '''Howard Claymore''' \u2013 A mortal who appears in ''The Demigod Diaries'' story ''Son of Magic'', written by Rick Riordan's son Haley Riordan.<ref name=\"DisneyCP\">{{cite press release |title=Disney Publishing Worldwide Releases Today The Demigod Diaries by No. 1 Best-selling Author Rick Riordan Percy Jackson and the Olympians Meets The Heroes of Olympus in This Original Short-story Collection |publisher=[[Disney Consumer Products]] |date=14 August 2012 |url=https://www.disneyconsumerproducts.com/Home/display.jsp?contentId=dcp_home_pressroom_pressreleases_dcp_home_pr_dpw_demigod_diaries_08142012&forPrint=false&language=ja&preview=false&imageShow=0&pressRoom=DPW&translationOf=null&region=0&ccPK=dcp_home_pressroom_press_room_all_DPW |accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref> He is a scholar and author with theories about death; he is approached for help by a son of Hecate called Alabaster Torrington who is fleeing the consequences of siding with Kronos in ''The Last Olympian''. Claymore later sacrifices himself so Alabaster can use an incantation to destroy a monster who is chasing him. Hecate brings him back to life in an imitative human body so that he can live on as Alabaster's protector.\n* '''Julian Ramirez-Arellano''' \u2013 Julian is the father of Reyna and Hylla. Julian was a former soldier in Iraq before the birth of his eldest daughter. After he had Reyna, he started getting paranoid. He thought that his daughters were going after him and he eventually became a mania. One day, he attacked Hylla, knocking her out, and Reyna took a sword and killed what was left of him. Reyna and Hylla then fled from San Juan, Puerto Rico, soon after.\n* '''May Castellan''' \u2013 May is Luke's mother. Like Rachel Dare, she could see through the Mist. She went insane during a failed attempt to become the Oracle.<ref name=\"LastOlympian\"/> She lives in the house where she had raised Luke, alternating between cheerful expectation that he will return home and visions of his terrible fate. In ''The Last Olympian'', Hestia reveals to Percy that Luke's mother, May Castellan, was a mortal woman blessed with the rare ability to see through The Mist, a magic substance that keeps mortals from seeing the Gods. Because of this gift, she attempted to become the new [[Oracle of Delphi]], but was rejected. Chiron inferred that the Spirit of Delphi rejected her because she had already given birth to a child, and the Oracle was supposed to be a virgin (in reality it was due to the Curse of Delphi placed upon the former Oracle by Hades still being active). She survived her encounter, but became mentally unstable, seeing small pieces of Luke's future.\n* '''Maurice''' and '''Eddie''' \u2013 Two employees of Kindness International Humane Animal Transport, encountered by Percy, Annabeth, and Grover in ''The Lightning Thief''.\n* '''Mr. and Mrs. Faust''' \u2014 Ruby Kane's parents, Carter and Sadie's maternal grandparents. They live in London. The two shun the magical world and take custody of Sadie, blaming Julius Kane for Ruby's death. They raise Sadie in an apparent normalcy but do not like her father or brother. The two are possessed by the gods Nekhbet and Babi in an attempt to test Sadie's resolve when she begins to pursue the Book of Ra. Mrs. Faust, usually called \"Gran\" by Sadie, is described as frail with curly gray hair, and a terrible cook. \"Gramps\" is a large, loud former rugby player. Both have been kind to Sadie, though neither is much like their daughter Ruby, her mother.\n* '''Maria di Angelo''' \u2013 Maria di Angelo is Nico and Bianca's mother, an Italian diplomat's daughter. She died when Zeus struck the hotel she was staying in with lightning in an attempt to kill Bianca and Nico. Melinoe impersonated her to scare Nico.\n* '''Marie Levesque''' \u2013 Marie is Hazel's mother. She was manipulated by Gaea into helping raise Alcyoneus. She died in 1942 along with Hazel. She was sentenced to the Fields of Punishment but Hazel made a compromise with the judges so they could both be sent to the Fields of Asphodel. In ''The House of Hades'', Hecate reveals that she was Marie's mentor, teaching her magic.\n* '''Mr. Dare''' \u2013 Rachel's father. He is the very wealthy owner of a land development company, and he first appears in ''The Last Olympian''. Rachel hates her father because of his job, and he supported Rachel and loved her very dearly going to finishing school.<ref name=\"LastOlympian\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Camp Half-Blood}}\n{{Kane Chronicles |state=collapsed}}\n{{Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard |state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Camp Half-Blood Series}}\n[[Category:Rick Riordan]]\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Cleanup|reason=poor grammar, capitalisation, etc.|date=November 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2015}}\nThis is a '''list of characters''' that appear in the ''[[Camp Half-Blood Chronicles]]'' (which consists of the ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]]'' series, ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' series, and ''[[The Trials of Apollo]]'' series), ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]'', and ''[[Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard]]''.\n\n==Overview==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:98%; float:center; padding:5px; display:table;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">'''List indicator(s)'''</div>\n* A dark grey cell indicates that the character was not in the property or that the character's presence in the property has yet to be announced.\n* A '''Main''' indicates a character had a starring role in the property.\n* A '''Recurring''' indicates the character appeared in two or more times within the property.\n* A '''Guest''' indicates the character appeared once in the property.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n{{Scrolling table/mid}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" style=\"width:15%;\"| Character\n! colspan=\"17\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Camp Half-Blood Chronicles|''The Camp Half-Blood Chronicles'']]\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Camp Half-Blood Chronicles#Camp Half-Blood/Kane Chronicles crossovers (Demigods and Magicians)|''Demigods and Magicians'']]\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard|''Magnus Chase and<br>the Gods of Asgard'']]\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Percy Jackson & the Olympians|''Percy Jackson and the Olympians'']]\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]''\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''[[The Trials of Apollo]]''\n|-\n!

This character still belongs on this list, despite having his own page.-->\n'''Percy Jackson''' is a demigod, son of mortal Sally Jackson, who makes great blue cookies, and immortal Poseidon, who is the greek god of the sea and earthquakes. His mother, Sally was married to a man named Gabe Ugliano ,who was an abbusive alcoholic who played poker in the kitchen with his buddies and took Percy's money to bet with, because his repugnant mortal odour protects Percy, hiding him from any monsters. At the end of [[The Lightning Thief]], Sally turns Gabe into stone using Medusa's head. Later, she marries Paul Blofis, whom she really loves. \n\nPercy lives in [[Manhattan]], Upper East Side, and is a [[New York Yankees]] fan, before his life is uprooted upon discovering his true paternity. He has black hair and sea-green eyes. He has inherited special abilities from Poseidon which include the ability to control water, boats and ships; surf really well; to create small hurricanes; to breathe and see clearly underwater; and to talk to horse-like creatures. He is also a gifted swordsman. Throughout the series, Percy uses a ballpoint pen named Anaklusmos (Ancient Greek for \"Riptide\") for battle; the pen can change into a celestial bronze sword and if he loses it , it will always pop back up in his pocket. His fatal flaw is excessive loyalty. As the novels progress, Percy and [[Annabeth Chase]]'s friendship and camaraderie also inevitably develop into a romantic relationship by the end of The Last Olympian even though everyone already knew it would happen and that Grover is the ultimate third wheel. \n\nPercy is the first-person narrator in the ''Percy Jackson & the Olympians'' series. He appears in ''The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades, The Blood of Olympus, The Hidden Oracle''. In the films, he is portrayed by [[Logan Lerman]] although, the fandom does not like to hear about the movies as they are extremely innacurate. In the musical, he is portrayed by [[Chris McCarrell]].\n\n====Grover Underwood====\n'''Grover Underwood''' is a satyr and Percy's best friend. He appears in ''The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The House of Hades, The Blood of Olympus'' and ''The Burning Maze''.\n\nHe has curly reddish-brown hair and fur, acne, and a wispy goatee. His horns grow larger as the series progresses, and he must take increasingly careful measures to hide them and his goat legs while posing as human. In ''The Lightning Thief'', Chiron states that Grover is small even for his age: He is twenty-eight then, but because a satyr's lifespan is twice that of a human, he is considered a teenager. Grover is quite sensitive and attached to nature. A vegetarian, he is known to eat tin cans, furniture, and worships enchiladas. Like all satyrs, he can sense emotions and \"smell\" monsters and demigods. As the series progresses, his concern for his friends and pursuit of his goals lead him to take on leadership roles and become more confident. Unlike his demigod friends, Grover is not an orthodox fighter. Instead, he uses reed pipes or a cudgel. In ''The Battle of the Labyrinth'', Grover begins a relationship with the dryad Juniper.\n\nIn ''The Lightning Thief'', he gets a \"searcher's license\" after delivering Percy safely, allowing him to search for the lost god Pan. When Polyphemus captures him in ''The Sea of Monsters'', he activates an empathy link, a psychic bond with Percy created a year before, allowing them some telepathic communication across great distances. He uses this to guide Percy to his rescue. At the end of ''The Last Olympian'', he is named a Lord of the Wild and given a seat on the satyrs' ruling council, the Council of Cloven Elders.\n\n====Annabeth Chase====\n'''Annabeth Chase''' is the daughter of Athena and mortal history professor Frederick Chase, from whom she has an extensive paternal family including Magnus Chase. She is the girlfriend of Percy Jackson from book ''The Last Olympian'' She appears in ''The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Lost Hero, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades'' and ''The Blood of Olympus''. In the film adaptations, she is portrayed by [[Alexandra Daddario]]. In the musical, she is portrayed by Kristin Stokes. She is described by her teacher Chiron as \"territorial about her friends\", which is manifested in some moments of jealousy and distrust. In ''The Lightning Thief'', it is revealed that she also suffers from [[arachnophobia]], a fear shared by her siblings due to their mother's relationship with Arachne, whom Athena turned into a spider.\n\nAnnabeth ran away from her father and stepfamily at age seven and encounters Luke Castellan and Thalia Grace. They lived as runaways until they are found by Grover Underwood and taken to camp. Annabeth remains attached to Luke and convinced of his goodness even after his decision to support Kronos. Her attempts to bring Luke back into the fold are an important theme in the books. A crucial character to the novels' plots, Annabeth even spends some time in Tartarus with Percy and Bob the Titan during The House of Hades. At the end of the series, she and Percy plan to finish high school in New York and then attend college in New Rome. In The Hidden Oracle, Percy states that Annabeth had gone to Boston for \"some family emergency\" \u2014 searching for her cousin Magnus Chase. Annabeth's appearances in crossover shorts with ''The Kane Chronicles'', and in ''Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard'' make her the only character besides Percy Jackson to have appeared in all three of the Greco-Roman, Egyptian, and Norse mythology series by author Rick Riordan.\n\nHer main weapon is a short celestial bronze knife given to her by Luke. After losing it in The House of Hades, she uses a drakon-bone sword given to her by the giant Damasen. She also uses Sadie Kane's wand when it turned into a dagger like the one Luke gave her. Annabeth also owns an invisibility [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] cap, a gift from her mother. At the end of The Battle of the Labyrinth, Daedalus gives Annabeth his incredibly advanced laptop which she loses in Tartarus. In the third book of Magnus Chase series, Annabeth is wearing a [[UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design]] shirt, implying that is where she is going to college. Annabeth has [[dyslexia]] (because her brain is hardwired to be able to read Ancient Greek) and has [[ADHD]] (battle instincts).\n\n====Luke Castellan====\n'''Luke Castellan''' was a 19-year-old son of Hermes and May Castellan. He appears in ''The Lightning Thief'', ''The Sea of Monsters'', ''The Titan's Curse'', ''The Battle of the Labyrinth'' and ''The Last Olympian''. In the films, he is portrayed by [[Jake Abel]]. In the musical, he is portrayed by James Hayden Rodriguez.\n\nIntroduced initially as the friendly head counselor of the Hermes cabin, Luke is soon revealed to serve Kronos. He is resentful of his father, who adhered to the gods' policy of non-interference despite May Castellan's mental illness. He ran away from home young and eventually arrived at camp. After the loss of Thalia, a failed quest and continued silence from Hermes, his ongoing resentment turns into a strong hatred of his father and the other gods. Described as decent and kind before Kronos, he behaves with volatility and violence upon his corruption. Though Luke originally serves Kronos willingly, the horrors he witnesses during the Battle of Manhattan convinces him to fight against his former master, eventually committing suicide to stop the Titan. When he dies, Luke reiterates what Ethan Nakamura tells Percy earlier: unclaimed children and unrecognized gods deserve more respect than they have been given.\n\nLuke is described as handsome with sandy hair, blue eyes, and a long scar on his cheek given to him by Ladon. Besides the ability to open locks with his mind inherited by his father, he is first and foremost an excellent swordsman. He even receives a sword named \"Backbiter\" from Kronos at the end of ''The Lightning Thief''. It is later reforged as Kronos's scythe and has the ability to harm both mortals and immortals. From Halcyon Green, he receives a diary he later entrusts to Chiron, and a celestial bronze knife he later gives to Annabeth with a promise to always remain her family. From his father he receives a pair of magic flying shoes, which he later curses and gives to Percy. Just before giving himself over completely to host the spirit of Kronos, Luke bathes in the River Styx and obtains the invincibility of Achilles. Also, he is evil because he supports Kronos.\n\n====Thalia Grace====\n'''Thalia Grace''' is the daughter of Zeus and Beryl Grace, a TV starlet. She is seven years older than her brother Jason Grace and appears in ''The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Last Olympian, The Lost Hero,The Blood of Olympus'' and the ''Dark Prophecy''. In the films, she is portrayed by [[Paloma Malinowski]].\n\nDue to her mother's abusive nature, Thalia had considered leaving home since she was little, but stayed to protect Jason. When Jason is apparently killed during a visit to Sonora (in actuality, he is just presented to Hera), Thalia finally runs away and stays with Luke and Annabeth until they meet Grover when she is 12. When they reach camp, Hades sends a horde of hell hounds that Thalia holds off, giving her life for her friends. Zeus pities his daughter and turns her into a pine tree where her spirit then provides a magical barrier around the camp. Seven years later, she is purged from the pine tree with the [[Golden Fleece]], applied to save it from poisons that were weakening and destroying the wards protecting the demigods. At the end of The Titan's Curse, she becomes the lieutenant of the Hunters of Artemis, a band of immortal female archers who serve the goddess Artemis, which freezes her age the night before her 16th birthday.\n\nThalia has blue eyes, spiky black hair, black eyeliner and punk style clothing. Annabeth and Chiron remark her personality and character traits (like her bravery and loyalty) being very similar to Percy's. She also shares some traits with her father, such as pride, confidence, and vehement reactions to betrayal or contradiction. An incredibly skilled warrior, she is willing to attack even Luke, who was known as the best swordsman of the last 300 years. Thalia's weapons are the shield Aegis disguised as a silver bracelet, and a spear disguised as a [[Mace (spray)|Mace can]]. After ''The Titan's Curse'', she also uses a bow and hunting knives. Her main \"power\" is the ability to summon lightning and generate electric shocks. In ''The Titan's Curse'', it is revealed that she has a rather ironic fear of heights, [[acrophobia]]. In ''The Lost Hero'', she embraces Jason for the first time in years, only to learn that he had lost his memory.\n\n====Tyson====\nIn The Sea of Monsters, '''Tyson''' is introduced as Percy's bullied, childish friend. When Percy is forced to take him to camp, it is revealed that he is a baby Cyclops and thus a son of Poseidon, making him Percy's half brother. He appears in The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena and The Blood of Olympus. In the films, he is portrayed by [[Douglas Smith (actor)|Douglas Smith]].\n\nTyson is tall with unkempt teeth and fingernails, brown hair and eye. He is mentally about 8 years old, but very intelligent and compassionate. As a son of Poseidon, he shares some of Percy's powers. As a Cyclops, he is immune to fire and has super strength, an uncanny ability to mimic voices, enhanced senses, and understands the \"old tongue\" (the language spoken by Gaia to her first children). Tyson also becomes an excellent smith with help from Charles Beckendorf. In The Last Olympian, he proves himself to be a capable fighter and is named a general of Poseidon's armies. Percy is at first resentful of him as a brother, while Annabeth is openly hostile towards him because she was almost killed by a cyclops, but both accept him after their quest together in the Sea of Monsters. Tyson is close with several characters and magical creatures in the series, including Rainbow the hippocampus, the hellhound Mrs O'Leary and the harpy Ella, who eventually becomes his girlfriend. In The Battle of the Labyrinth, Tyson is revealed to be afraid of satyrs, including Grover, he manages to conquer this fear after a quest and they become friends.\n\n====Nico Di Angelo====\n'''Nico Di Angelo''' is first seen in The Titan's Curse, as an unclaimed demigod rescued by Percy, Annabeth, Thalia, and Grover. At the end of the novel, it is revealed that Nico is a son of Hades. He appears in The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades, The Blood of Olympus and The Hidden Oracle.\nThe character Nico was named after one of Riordan's former students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/oct/04/rick-riordan-magnus-chase-interview-percy-jackson |title=Rick Riordan: 'I've loved mythology since I was a child' |last=Riordan |first=Rick |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 October 2015 |access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nThough he appears to be ten years old, in reality, he and his elder sister Bianca were born in the 1930s. After Zeus killed their mother Maria, daughter of an Italian diplomat, whilst trying to kill the children, Hades wiped their memories and places them in the Lotus Hotel, a place in Las Vegas where time stands still. He is a native of [[Venice]] and can speak [[Italian (language)|Italian]]. Nico is initially depicted as cheerful and childish, with olive skin and dark hair, and enjoys playing Mythomagic (a mythology-themed card game similar to [[Magic: The Gathering]]). He takes the death of Bianca very hard, becoming moody, secretive, and irritable. He becomes angry at Percy, who swore to protect Bianca, but later forgives him. Afterwards, he lived in the Underworld with Hades, where he becomes pale and shaggy-haired and begins wearing dark clothing. Nico, despite being very powerful, is extremely lonely, much like his father. He makes nearby people uncomfortable, partially due to his unnerving weapon of choice: a sword made of iron cooled in the Styx (\"Stygian iron\"), capable of absorbing monsters' essences rather than banishing them to Tartarus. Until meeting Cupid in The House of Hades, Nico also struggles hiding his homosexuality. During The Blood of Olympus, Nico, Reyna and Hedge transport the Athena Parthenos to Camp Half-Blood. Between The Blood of Olympus and The Hidden Oracle, he begins a relationship with Will Solace, a child of Apollo, after admitting to Percy that he had a crush on him.\n\nNico's suggestion that Percy takes on the curse of Achilles and his work to convince Hades to fight in The Last Olympian is crucial to the Olympians' success and earn him a short bout of fame. He is privy to the fact that there were two camps, one Greek and one Roman, before The Lost Hero, making him an important liaison between the two groups in the latter series. He brings his half sister Hazel back from the dead and establishes her at Camp Jupiter. At the end of The Son of Neptune, Nico travels through Tartarus to find the monstrous side of the Doors of Death, an experience which leaves him haunted and weak. In The Blood of Olympus, he nearly dies several times while \"shadow-traveling\", which involves melting into shadows and teleporting himself to different places. His sister whom he brought back from the dead, who goes by the name Hazel Levesque, is the daughter of Hades' Roman identity Pluto. He is a very moody character\n\n====Rachel Elizabeth Dare====\nRachel is a mortal girl who can see through the Mist, the force that obscures gods and monsters from most mortals. Her father, Will Dare, is a rich businessman, a fact which she is rather adverse to. She first meets Percy in The Titan's Curse at the Hoover Dam. In The Battle of the Labyrinth, she guides Annabeth and Percy through the Labyrinth to Daedalus's workshop. It is hinted that she has some romantic feelings for Percy which are noticed by Annabeth who becomes jealous. In The Last Olympian, she has strange visions and becomes the new Oracle of Delphi. Her first act as the Oracle is to deliver the next Great Prophecy, setting the plot of the Heroes of Olympus series. She is contacted by Annabeth in The House of Hades to ask for Reyna's assistance to bring the Athena Parthenos back to Camp Half-Blood.\n\nFollowing the loss of Delphi to Python, as revealed in The Hidden Oracle, Rachel stops visiting camp and begins a frenzied attempt to regain her foresight, not helped by Apollo's disappearance. Once informed of Apollo's arrival, Rachel returns and learns that not only Delphi is lost, but also three other Oracles, Only Rhea's Dodonian Oracle is still valid. She becomes upset upon learning of the existence of other Oracles, as Apollo hasn't told her before.\n\nShe has red hair and freckles, is skilled at painting and drawing (with both feet and hands) and occasionally shown as a non-ADHD foil for her demigod teammates. Percy remarks on her ability to stand still for a long time at a charity event. Due to her power of foresight, Rachel knows a great deal of knowledge before she learns it herself, during her meeting with Reyna, she states Reyna's full name, something only Reyna's best friends know.\n\n====Clarisse La Rue====\nA daughter of Ares and the former lead counselor of the Ares cabin at Camp Half-Blood, Clarisse is hot-tempered, courageous, strong, an incredible fighter, usually using an electric spear given to her by Ares, and a good military strategist. She can be stubborn and overconfident, much like her father. Despite their similarities, Clarisse has a fear of her father and his anger at her if she should ever disappoint him. This, along with a strong sense of honor and pride, often motivates her actions. She also fears the [[Labyrinth]] because of what happened to her boyfriend Chris Rodriguez before she saved him. She is aggressive towards most demigods, including Percy, though she does respect and make friends with a few, including Percy, Annabeth, and Silena Beauregard. \nClarisse makes frequent appearances throughout the novels. first seen just after Percy arrives at camp. In The Sea of Monsters, Clarisse is given the quest to find the [[Golden Fleece]]. She is a main character in the short story \"Percy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot\" (published in [[The Demigod Files]]). In The Last Olympian, Clarisse initially sits out the war for Olympus due to a personal feud. Enraged after the loss of her friend Silena, she later joins the battle with a fury reminiscent of her father's, slaying a [[dragon|drakon]] singlehandedly and receiving the blessing of Ares. In The Blood of Olympus, Clarisse leads the Greeks in battle to defend the camp. In The Hidden Oracle, it is stated that Clarisse has gone to attend the [[University of Arizona]] and her role as counselor is taken by her half-brother Sherman Yang.\n\nShe appears in The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades and The Blood of Olympus. In the film adaptations, she is portrayed by [[Leven Rambin]]. In the musical, she is portrayed by Sarah Beth Pfeifer.\n\n====Calypso====\n'''[[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]''' is the daughter of the titan Atlas who is imprisoned on the island of [[Ogygia]] for supporting her father during the first titan war.<ref name=\"labyrinth\"/> She first appears in ''The Battle of the Labyrinth'', where she nurses Percy back to health. She falls in love with Percy and is heartbroken when he has to leave. Percy asks the gods to release her at the end of ''The Last Olympian'',<ref name=\"LastOlympian\"/> but she is still residing there when Leo becomes trapped on Ogygia in ''The House of Hades'', having been released from the curse of being forced to fall in love with all those to fall upon the island rather than the island itself. Leo and Calypso subsequently fall in love legitimately. After Leo escapes, he swears on the River [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] that he will return for Calypso. At the end of ''The Blood of Olympus'', Leo gets back to Ogygia and frees Calypso although nobody can go to Ogygia twice.\n\nIn ''The Hidden Oracle'', Calypso comes to Camp Half-Blood with Leo and reveals that, due to her choice to leave Ogygia, she has become a mortal. She accompanies Leo and Apollo in the latter's quest to find the Oracles and stop the Three Emperors from conquering North America. Despite this, the two secretly attempt to find a normalcy for their lives and later announce to Apollo that they are going to settle in [[Indianapolis]], although they will continue to help him anyway they can. At the end of ''The Dark Prophecy'', Calypso stays at the Waystation, while Leo goes to warn Camp Jupiter of an impending invasion and Apollo travels with Meg to search for the Erythaean Sybil.\n\nAs a sorceress, Calypso can command wind spirits to do her bidding. She loses most of her control of them when she gives up her immortality; however, she is still capable of summoning them to a degree, though by consuming more power than usual. Also, due to spending a long time at Ogygia, she has mastered sewing and lock-picking, which she uses while finding the gryphons at Indianapolis Zoo. She is Leo\u2019s girlfriend as of \u201cThe Blood of Olympus\u201d, \u201cThe Hidden Oracle\u201d, \u201cThe Dark Prophecy\u201d, and \u201cThe Burning Maze\u201d.\n\n===Introduced in ''The Heroes of Olympus''===\n\n====Leo Valdez====\n'''Leo Valdez''' is a son of Hephaestus. He likes to joke around and is very humorous. Though he does this mostly to keep himself happy and not too caught up in his tragic past, as well as so that his friends don't guess how broken he is inside. He is described as having curly brown hair, brown eyes, a cheerful face, a slim (scrawny) build, and a mischievous smile. He is [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic-American]] and speaks Spanish and machine. Leo has the ability to create and manipulate fire, a skill no child of Hephaestus has had for 400 years. He also has severe [[ADHD]] even by demigod standards. An excellent mechanic, he repairs a bronze dragon running wild in the camp's woods, naming it Festus (which means \"Happy\" in Latin). Inspired by a blueprint in Bunker 9, an abandoned bunker in the camp's woods, and a picture he drew in his kindergarten time, he also creates the ''Argo II'', the ship the 7 of the Great Prophecy sail on to reach Greece.\n\nWhen Leo was eight, Gaia tricked him into burning down his mother Esperanza's machine shop in [[Houston]] resulting in her death. Leo's remaining family blamed him for killing her and left him a foster child and runaway. He meets Piper, his best friend, at the Wilderness School in Nevada. Later, In [[The Lost Hero]], he meets Jason Grace, who wakes up on a school bus headed to the Grand Canyon with no memories. However, Leo and Piper have Mist-induced memories of meeting and becoming friends with Jason. Leo uses his sarcasm and wit to hide his feelings, especially in regards of causing his mother's death. He sometimes thinks of himself as a seventh wheel, (as for the first three books of the Heroes of Olympus series he is the only person aboard the Argo II without a significant other) though he proves no less important or skilled than the others. In The Mark of Athena, Hazel learns her former boyfriend, Sammy Valdez, was Leo's great-grandfather. Until he falls in love with Calypso in The House of Hades, Leo flirts with almost every girl he meets in order to cover up his insecurities about never finding love. In The Blood of Olympus, Leo sacrifices himself to annihilate Gaia and dies in the process, but is brought back to life using the Physician's Cure and returns for Calypso on her island, Ogygia. This is an impressive feat, as nobody has ever found Ogygia twice. He and Calypso then journey back to Camp Half-Blood, sending a magic scroll ahead to let his friends know he's alive. When he does arrive at camp (at the end of The Hidden Oracle), everyone lines up to slap him for keeping them worried so long. As Leo is included in the prophecy of the Grove of Dodona, he and Calypso accept the task to accompany Apollo on his quests in The Dark Prophecy, at the end of which he announces that he and Calypso will be living at the Waystation and leading an ordinary life. When the prophecy of Trophonius requires that someone must warn Camp Jupiter from an invasion, Leo does the task alone.\n\n====Piper McLean====\n'''Piper McLean''' is a daughter of Aphrodite and the famous actor Tristan McLean. She is fifteen in ''The Lost Hero''. Unlike most children of Aphrodite, Piper is not particularly concerned with beauty or fashion. Piper is [[Cherokee]] on her father's side. She has tan skin, eyes that change color constantly, and choppy caramel/chocolate-colored hair which she cuts herself. She is slim build and of average height. Her demigod \"powers\" include \"charmspeak\" (essentially, magical persuasion) and the ability to speak French. She is also occasionally able to see visions in her magic [[dagger]] Katoptris (Ancient Greek for \"mirror\"), which once belonged to [[Helen of Troy]]. The dagger lost that power after the battle against the giants in Athens.\n\nPiper's relationship with her father is mutually affectionate but strained, in part because of the small amount of attention he spares for her. When she was young, Piper used her persuasive skills to \"borrow\" (ask for in charmspeak) things to earn a little of his time. After he is kidnapped by the giant Enceladus in ''The Lost Hero'' and subsequently rescued by Piper, Jason, and Leo, Mr McLean's relationship with his daughter begins to improve. Piper is also very close to Jason. Though she later learns it was all a trick of the Mist, she was once his girlfriend while they attended the same school. She works hard to recreate this relationship in real life when she comes to Camp Half-Blood. She is also friends with all of the seven quest members in ''The Heroes of Olympus'', especially Annabeth and Leo.\n\nPiper's main weapon is her dagger Katoptris, though she later acquires a magic [[cornucopia]] and uses it as a weapon. After being captured by pirates in ''The House of Hades'', Piper asks Hazel to teach her sword fighting, using a jagged celestial bronze sword taken from one of the Boreads.\n\nIn ''The Hidden Oracle'', Nico mentions that Piper is currently attending school in Los Angeles, together with Jason. In ''The Burning Maze'', it's revealed that she broke up with Jason a few months earlier because their relationship was forced, and Piper did not like that. Apollo, as Lester Papadopoulos, was confused because the cloud nymph, Mellie, had seemed angry at Jason. This leads him to believe that Jason had broken up with Piper, but it was actually Piper who had. It is later unveiled that she wanted to discover herself and who she really was without the pressure of being the daughter of Aphrodite. The trick of the Mist that Hera used at the beginning of their relationship also contributed to the breakup as that meant that their relationship was technically \"fake\". Still, she is heartbroken when he dies by sacrificing himself to save her, Apollo, and Meg from Caligula.\n\n====Jason Grace====\n<!--Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a fan page. The content in this section is already too detailed and extensive. BEFORE ADDING ADDITIONAL CONTENT, remove or condense less important content. Also provide a reliable source, particularly for any analysis or commentary. -->\n'''Jason Grace''' was a son of Jupiter and the mortal Beryl Grace, a TV star of the 1980s, and the younger brother of Thalia Grace (Hunter of Artemis). Jason has few memories of his mother, who was compelled to give him up when he was two, but he remembers enough about Thalia to not be surprised when he sees her again, in ''The Lost Hero''. Thalia reveals that their mother told her that Jason was dead, and that this was what finally drove her to leave home, after she run away from home and found Camp Half-Blood. In ''The Blood of Olympus'', that Beryl Grace had become a mania, or spirit of madness. He grew up at Camp Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Camp Half-Blood, where demigods born to the Olympians' Roman aspects receive their training. In ''The Lost Hero'', he begins a romantic relationship with Piper McLean.\n\nJason is described as having blond hair, blue eyes, and a scar above his upper lip (said to be a result of an attempt to eat a stapler). He is of above-average height, with an athletic build and muscular arms. By the age of fifteen, he has earned the rank of praetor and leads the legion with his longtime partner, Reyna. Jason also coordinated the Roman camp's attack on the Titan force. He led an assault against [[Mount Tamalpais]]/Othrys, a Titan stronghold near San Francisco, and defeated the Titan Krios in combat, much as Percy Jackson defeated Hyperion and helped to defeat Kronos. Of all the characters in the series, Jason is the one who struggles the most with the differences between the Greek and Roman perspectives. Piper McLean describes Jason as very rule- and duty-oriented, though Terminus describes him as a \"rule-flouter.\" When the ''Argo II'' is stuck in North Africa, he must choose one identity or the other. He chooses to consider himself a Greek, despite his parentage, and is later unable to command a legion of Roman ghosts. During ''The House of Hades'' it is revealed that Jason has plans to return to Camp Jupiter to improve it with things he learned at Camp Half-Blood, such as giving the fauns (the Roman equivalent of a satyr) more rights and responsibilities. Later, during ''The Blood of Olympus'', Jason decides to consider both the Greek and Roman traditions as part of his heritage. He becomes \"Pontifex Maximus\", a role which will see him travel between Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter to build shrines for every god and goddess in the pantheon.\n\nAlthough Jason and Percy immediately realize that it is best to work together, and become friends, their relationship is not without antagonism. As Percy puts it, it is natural for two powerful demigods to wonder which of them is stronger after a fight. Jason is a sword fighter like Percy, though they have different fighting styles. Jason uses an Imperial gold sword, styled as a Roman ''gladius'', which he can extend into a ''pilum'' (a spear) at will. Jason also has power over air currents and can fly. He can sense and control some air spirits and, like Thalia, call down lightning, which he conducts through his Imperial Gold weapons, and emit static shocks. Once, he and Percy together summon a hurricane in Charleston harbor. He is then killed during The Burning Maze, by Emperor Caligula. While other demigods, such as Frank, are rescued in later books, it seems that no such care was applied to Jason.\n\n====Hazel Levesque====\n'''Hazel Levesque''' is a thirteen-year-old demigod, a daughter of Pluto and Marie Levesque. She first appears in ''The Son of Neptune'', at Camp Jupiter. It is later revealed that she has returned from the dead, assisted by her half-brother Nico. She grew up in the 1940s in [[New Orleans]], where her mother had a ''[[Gris-gris (talisman)|gris-gris]]'' shop. When she was born, Pluto offered to grant her mother a wish, but her request for wealth backfired into an ability to control [[precious metals]] and [[Gemstone|gems]], which both first view as a curse. Hazel died after Gaea tries to use Hazel's power over earth to resurrect [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Alcyoneus|Alcyoneus]]. When Hazel's mother changes her mind about helping Gaea, Hazel buries herself and her mother under the earth, delaying Alcyoneus's rebirth and killing them both. While Hazel's spirit is being judged, she gives up the chance to go to [[Elysium]] to save her mother from punishment, and they are both sent to the [[Asphodel Meadows|Fields of Asphodel]] instead. At some point before ''The Lost Hero'', Nico finds Hazel in the Underworld while trying to visit Bianca di Angelo, only to find she has tried for rebirth. He helps her escape to the world of the living and arranges for her to join Camp Jupiter. Hazel and Nico are protective of each other, much as true half-siblings.\n\nHazel is described as [[African American]], having cocoa-colored skin, curly cinnamon-brown hair, and golden eyes. Her legion tattoo is described as looking like a cross with curved arms and a head. She is described as being very pretty, and is a strong female role model. She eventually learns to manipulate her curse, manipulating precious stones and metals and sensing structures underground. She is an accomplished horse-rider and skilled with a ''[[spatha]]''. She tames the horse Arion, who eats precious metals. She is unusually knowledgeable about the Underworld because of her time there. During ''The House of Hades'' the goddess Hecate insists Hazel learn to manipulate the Mist. Hazel becomes very gifted at this. After the Second Gigantomachy, Hazel is promoted to the rank of centurion of the Fifth Cohort, succeeding her boyfriend [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Frank Zhang|Frank]] Zhang. Though she is much cooler than her boyfriend, she finds his inability to be cool endearing.\n\n====Frank Zhang====\n'''Frank Zhang''', nick-named \"Chinese-Canadian baby man\", by Hazel's horse, Arion, is a 16-year-old demigod, son of Mars and Emily Zhang, a [[Chinese Canadians|Chinese-Canadian]] \"legacy\" (descendant of a demigod) who dies during military service in [[Afghanistan]]. He is taken care of by his grandmother after his mother's death, and makes his way to Camp Jupiter upon her insistence. Frank's family descends from [[Periclymenus]], a grandson of Poseidon, who had the power to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]]. Periclymenus's descendants were sold into [[slavery]] in China, and migrated to Canada many years later. While battling Alcyoneus (who is invincible within [[Alaska]]), Frank taps into his ancestral power and transforms into an elephant. However, his combined power of being a son of Mars ''and'' having the ability to shapeshift makes his life very fragile. The Fates tied his life force to a piece of firewood when he was a baby, so if the wood burns up, he will die (as in the ancient Greek legend of [[Meleager]]). The goddess Juno appears to his mother and grandmother while he is a baby to warn them of this fact, as he would be crucial to defeating the Giants. In all his life, Frank has ignited the wood twice, which he can do simply by thinking about it; the first time is while he is finding his way to Camp Jupiter, in bitter cold. The second time is when he, Percy, and Hazel travel to Alaska to free Thanatos. Eventually, Frank entrusts the firewood to Hazel, and in ''The House of Hades'', Calypso creates a fireproof pouch to contain it.\n\nFrank has a meek disposition and is uncomfortable upon learning his father's identity publicly in front of the whole of Camp Jupiter. He suspected himself a son of [[Apollo]], given his skill with a [[bow and arrow]]. On his quest in ''The Son of Neptune'', and later during the series as well, he uses an enchanted spear given to him by Mars. To Frank's surprise, the spear summons a skeleton warrior that defeats the basilisks. Frank calls this skeleton \"Gray\".\n\nAs he has been residing in Camp Jupiter for no more than a year, Frank is initially considered a ''probatio'', or rookie, of the Fifth Cohort. Before the quest to free Thanatos, however, his cohort's centurion, Gwen, decides to retire and give her position to Frank. Later, in ''The House of Hades'', Jason surrenders his praetorship to Frank, who uses its authority and the Diocletian's Scepter to lead an army of Roman skeleton soldiers against the monsters in the Necromanteion.\n\nFrank was described as 'cuddly' and 'fuzzy' and with a chubby, babyish face in ''The Mark of Athena'', but in ''The House of Hades'', after summoning the blessing of Mars to defeat a hoard of enemies, he transforms. He is then described as being taller, more muscular, and without all his childhood fat. Though now built like a professional football player, he is still as sensitive as before, and is embarrassed at his new appearance at first.\n\nInitially, he was wary of the tension between Hazel and Leo, as Leo reminded Hazel of her old boyfriend, Sammy Valdez. After Leo's encounter with Calypso, however, Leo became more relaxed around Hazel and there were no more signs of anything other than friendship, much to Frank's relief. He then pursues a relationship with Hazel.\n\n====Reyna Avila Ram\u00edrez-Arellano====\n'''Reyna Avila Ram\u00edrez-Arellano''' (also known as '''RARA''') is a 16-year-old [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] demigod. She is a daughter of Bellona, a Roman Goddess of War, and the younger sister of [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan Hylla|Queen Hylla]] of the Amazons. She and her sister worked for [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Circe|Circe]] during the events of ''The Sea of Monsters''. She is described as intimidating and a natural leader; she has glossy black hair and brown eyes so dark they look black. Reyna is generally more used to responsibility than other demigods, as she is a [[praetor]] at Camp Jupiter. (she left the camp in \"the tyrant's tomb\" and joined the hunters of Artemis)<ref name=losthero/> Reyna's demigod \"power\" is the ability to lend her energy, skills, and character traits to nearby demigods. Similar to Leo Valdez, she can speak b [[English (language)|English]] Latin and Spanish. Reyna is often accompanied by two magical dogs, Aurum and Argentum, or by her pegasus Scipio (\"Skippy\" dies after their trip from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Greece]] in ''The House of Hades'').<ref name=\"house\">{{cite book |title=The House of Hades |publisher=Disney Publishing Worldwide&ndash;Hyperion Books |author=Riordan, Rick |authorlink=Rick Riordan |year=2013 |location=New York City |isbn=978-1-4231-4672-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/houseofhades00rick }}</ref> The immortal winged horse, [[Pegasus]] awards her the title of \"Horse Friend\", because of her kindness towards Scipio and others of his descendants.\n\nIn ''The Blood of Olympus'' she, Nico, and [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Gleeson Hedge|Coach Hedge]] go on a quest to return the Athena Parthenos to Camp Half-Blood. While shadow-travelling to New York, the trio stops in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] and visits Reyna's former house, haunted by the ghosts of her relatives. There Reyna reveals that the Ram\u00edrez-Arellano family (which includes [[Roberto Cofresi]] and Captain [[Marion Frederic Ram\u00edrez de Arellano]]) has always been favored by Bellona. Reyna's father (an [[Iraq war|Iraq war veteran]]) deeply loved the goddess, but his [[PTSD]] turned this love into an unhealthy paranoia. When Reyna was ten years old, he became a ''mania'', or an evil insane ghost. When the mania attacked Hylla, young Reyna picked up the closest weapon and killed what remained of her father. Reyna is reluctant to discuss the incident because [[patricide]] is \"unforgivable\" in New Rome.<ref name=\"blood\">{{cite book |title=The Blood of Olympus |publisher=Disney Publishing Worldwide&ndash;Hyperion Books |author=Riordan, Rick |authorlink=Rick Riordan |year=2014 |location=Los Angeles |isbn=978-1-4231-4673-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/bloodofolympus00rick }}</ref>\n\n====Coach Gleeson Hedge====\n'''Gleeson Hedge''' is a satyr first mentioned in ''The Last Olympian'', as the author of a distress call sent to Grover Underwood. Like Grover, Hedge is also a demigod Protector; his proudest \"recruit\" being [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Clarisse La Rue|Clarisse La Rue]]. He disguises himself as a coach at the Wilderness School to escort [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Piper McLean|Piper McLean]] and [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Leo Valdez|Leo Valdez]] (and later, [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Jason Grace|Jason Grace]]) to Camp Half-Blood. He also serves as the adult chaperone for the ''Argo II'' and later accompanies the Athena Parthenos to camp. Despite his often warlike and often overly aggressive attitude, Hedge is kind and understanding to campers in need. He enjoys extreme sports and martial arts movies. In ''The Lost Hero'', Hedge falls in love with [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Mellie|Mellie]] the cloud nymph (assistant to [[Aeolus]]) and marries her; by the time of ''The House of Hades'', Mellie is pregnant with a satyr boy. Chuck, the baby, is born at the end of ''The Blood of Olympus'', with Clarisse as his godmother. In ''The Hidden Oracle'', Hedge, Mellie, Chuck, Piper, and Jason are spending the winter in Los Angeles. He had a child with Mellie named Chuck (a satyr).\n\n===Introduced in ''The Trials of Apollo''===\n\n====Apollo / Lester Papadopoulos====\n{{see also|List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Apollo}}\n'''Apollo''', in the mortal form of '''Lester Papadopoulos''', serves as the main protagonist of ''[[The Trials of Apollo]]'' series.\n\nIn ''The Heroes of Olympus'', Apollo's Roman descendant [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Octavian|Octavian]] promises the god many things for blessing his prophetic skills, which leads to the Olympians' distraction from the true threat of Gaia, and to the resurgence of Python. As a result, the Delphic Oracle ceases to function, effectively halting demigod quests, and Zeus punishes Apollo. Zeus's punishment consists of making Apollo mortal, though he retains most of his personality and some more minor powers. This punishment is revealed in ''The Trials of Apollo''. In his mortal form, Apollo's name is Lester Papadopoulos.\n\nFollowing a meeting with two thugs, Apollo encounters a demigod called [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Meg McCaffrey|Meg McCaffrey]] who claims him as her servant until he regains his godhood. There, Apollo has to adjust himself to a life of mortality and questing to regain his former powers and lifestyle. Apollo is released by Meg after the revelation of her alliance with [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Nero|his enemy]].\n\nAs Lester, Apollo is a 16-year-old teenager with curly brown hair, blue eyes, acne, and a flabby torso. He is narcissistic, prideful, and arrogant, but does his best to not be a burden on others. His mortal transformation makes him realize how miserable humans are in facing the gods. In particular, he grows to deeply care for Meg and resolves to be with her despite the difficulties involved.<ref name=\"ToA Bk1\">{{cite book |title=The Hidden Oracle |publisher=Disney Publishing Worldwide&ndash;Hyperion Books |author=Riordan, Rick |authorlink=Rick Riordan |year=2016 |location=Los Angeles |isbn=9781484732748}}</ref>\n\n====Meg McCaffrey====\n'''Margaret (Meg) McCaffrey''' is a 12-year-demigod daughter of Demeter and the main character in ''The Hidden Oracle''. Her father was murdered by \"the Beast\" (Emperor Nero) and she was subsequently adopted by Emperor Nero, considering them as two separate people. Nero taught her the arts of a demigod and gave her a pair of crescent rings which can transform into sickles made of imperial gold, before giving her a task to lure Apollo into the Grove of Dodona. Meg appears to Apollo at an alley of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan]] to defeat the thugs, also sent by Nero, to stage \"robbery\". Meg demands Apollo's servitude and with his travels to Camp Half-Blood with Percy's assistance. There, Meg displays unusual abilities even before Demeter claims her, and later goes with Apollo to search for missing demigods and the Grove in the nearby woods, having to endure a brief abduction in the process. Her relationship with Nero is revealed at the climax, but her growing doubtfulness regarding Nero's ways, not to mention her already familiar friendship with Apollo, leads her to rob Nero of his chance on burning the Grove. While she helps Apollo bring the Grove alive, she severs their bonding spell and leaves.\n\nIn the second book, ''The Dark Prophecy'', she returns to Apollo and helps him fight Commodus.\n\nMeg is described as small and pudgy, with dark hair chopped in a messy pageboy style and black cat-eye glasses with rhinestones glittering and shimmering in the corners. She is Free-spirited and adventurous, inquisitive, and is also confrontational. She poses questions with no subtlety, something that Apollo is annoyed with but later comes to regard as a unique trait. Her abilities as Demeter's daughter allows her to connect better with nature as well as summoning a [[karpos]] (crop spirit) called Peaches (a spirit of peach trees), a power that none of Demeter's other demigod children are known to possess.<ref name=\"ToA Bk1\" />\n\nEven though she is Demeter's daughter, not Ceres (the Roman manifestation of Demeter) she fights like a Roman, with two swords; one for offense and one for defense. She is also known for her liking of unicorns in the fourth book ''The Tyrant's Tomb''.\n\n====Hemithea====\n[[Hemithea (mythology)|Hemithea]], known as \"Emmie\", is a retired Hunter of Artemis and caretaker of the Waystation. She lives with her sister, Josephine, also an ex-Hunter, and their daughter Georgia at the Waystation in [[Indianapolis]]. She and her sister were granted immortality by Apollo after escaping from the wrath of their father, King Staphylus. She then joined the Hunters of Artemis and fell in love with fellow hunter Josephine, causing them to lose their immortality and to be kicked out of the Hunt. Sometime in the 1980s, Josephine and Emmie gave up their immortality in order to grow old together. In ''The Dark Prophecy'', she saves Calypso, Leo and Apollo from the Blemmyae with crossbow turrets and lets the trio stay at the Waystation. She comments on the similarities between Calypso and her half-sister Zo\u00eb Nightshade.\n\n====Triumvirate Holdings====\n'''Triumvirate Holdings''' is a company that is led by three beings who are said to be the worst Roman Emperors in history. They force other people to worship them. During the Second Titanomachy, Triumvirate Holdings was responsible for giving Luke (at the time under the influence of Kronos) and his allies the Princess Andromeda, weapons, helicopters, and top human mercenaries. During the Second Gigantomachy, Triumvirate Holdings supplied Octavian with different weapons. Rachel described Triumvirate Holdings to be so rich that they make her father's company \"look like a kid's lemonade stand.\" The trio have divided up North America into three major empires and are hunting for Oracles, which they plan to destroy.\n\nAmong the known members of Triumvirate Holdings are:\n\n* '''[[Nero|Emperor Nero]]''' \u2013 A legacy of Apollo and the main antagonist of ''The Hidden Oracle''. The last in the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], Nero is infamous for his tyranny and overindulgence in wealth and luxury with little regard to his subjects. He is the deified Roman Emperor, who has survived through the millennia along with two other deified Roman emperors\u2014the Triumvirate. He forms an alliance with Python, who holds Delphi, while he himself controls the other oracles and plans to destroy Dodona. As the Emperor of the East, Nero lives in [[New York City]], where he recruits and trains homeless demigods, and controls the eastern third of North America. He and the other two Roman Emperors have established Triumvirate Holdings. As \"the Beast\", Nero killed [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Meg|Meg]]'s father, but later adopted and trained her in demigod arts so she could eventually lure Apollo into the Grove of Dodona. After Rhea restores the Grove of Dodona at Camp Half-Blood, Nero tries to force Apollo and Meg to burn the trees; failing at that, he sends a giant statue of himself, the Colossus Neronis, which originally stood in Rome, against Camp Half-Blood and Apollo and the Greek demigods defend the camp against it.<ref name=\"ToA Bk1\" />\n* '''[[Commodus|Emperor Commodus]]''' - Commodus is the main antagonist of ''The Dark Prophecy'' and one of the three main antagonists in ''The Tyrant's Tomb'' alongside Caligula and Tarquin. The last in the [[Nerva-Antonine dynasty]], Commodus ascended as emperor at a young age and was known for his good looks and musculature, for which he was nicknamed the \"New Hercules\". In later life, he became increasingly dictatorial and paranoid as he suspected that people would overthrow him. He also had preferences for gladiatorial battles and would buy slaves and exotic animals to fight to the death. Eventually, Apollo, with whom he had an affair, assassinated him while taking the form of [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]], his wrestling partner. As a god, he reigned as the Emperor of the Middle, ruling from a base at [[Indianapolis]]. He sends many of his men, including a kidnapped Georgie, to seek the Oracle of Trophonius, as he himself fears the oracle's reputed ability to drive its seekers insane. At the end of ''The Dark Prophecy'', he launches an attack at the Waystation, but is defeated by Apollo and his group. Commodus manages to get away at the last second, having been blinded by Apollo's brief revelation of his true form. Later, Commodus joins forces with Caligula and Tarquin to destroy Camp Jupiter but ends up being killed by Apollo.\n* '''[[Caligula|Emperor Caligula]]''' - The main antagonist of ''The Burning Maze'' and one of the three main antagonists in ''The Tyrant's Tomb'' alongside Commodus and Tarquin. He was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire, conventionally known as the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Caligula was ambushed by his Germani guards which led to his mortal death. Following this incident, he employed the Strix and the Pandai to work for him while his fellow emperors continue to use Germani. Many years later, Apollo and Piper were brought to Caligula by his talking horse Incitatus as Caligula has the Pandai they subdued executed. Before he can have Meg and Jason Grace executed, Caligula is stunned when Apollo threatens to commit suicide. After Apollo stabs himself while Caligula kills Flange following the news of the attack on Camp Jupiter ending in failure, Caligula sails north with his guards. Medea meets with Caligula and advises that performs a ritual before Apollo dies. Caligula later fights Jason and Tempest on the back of Incitatus where he manages to kill Jason. After making sure that he is dead, Caligula sets sail for the Bay Area. Later, Caligula joins forces with Commodus and Tarquin to destroy Camp Jupiter but ends up being killed by Frank.\n* '''[[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|King Tarquin]]''' - One of the three main antagonists in ''The Tyrant's Tomb'' alongside Commodus and Caligula. Tarquin is the last king of Rome and is depicted as a zombie. He participated in the Battle of San Francisco Bay where he targeted the Sibyillin Books. Tarquin was killed by Hazel and Diana.\n\n===Greek-Roman deities===\n\n====Twelve Olympians====\nThough not all the gods who appear in [[Rick Riordan]]'s novels are truly ''[[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]]'' (that is, gods who live on [[Mount Olympus#Mythology|Mt. Olympus]]), all Greek and Roman gods are generally considered to be a subset of the '''[[Twelve Olympians]]'''. As such, most characters in the series refer to these immortals generally as the \"Olympian gods\", to distinguish them from the Greco-Roman [[#Primordial deities|primordial gods]] and [[#Titans|Titan]]s.\n\n* '''[[Zeus]]'''/'''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]''' \u2013 The king of the gods, Zeus is most prominent in ''The Lightning Thief''<ref name=\"lightningbook\" /> but has several roles throughout the rest of ''Percy Jackson & the Olympians''. Zeus is shown prominently throughout the series to be extremely narcissistic, paranoid and hypocritical. In ''The Lost Hero'', under the influence of Khione, Zeus forbids contact between gods and mortals and closes off Olympus (against the influence of Khione), although he indirectly helps the protagonists several times on their quests.<ref name=\"losthero\"/> As the primary Olympian god, his demigod children reside in Camp Half-Blood's biggest cabin, Cabin 1, although there is only one person who resides there at the end of ''The Heroes of Olympus'': Jason. In the film adaption, Zeus is played by [[Sean Bean]].\n* '''[[Hera]]'''/'''[[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]''' \u2013 The queen of the gods who plays a role in ''The Titan's Curse'',<ref name=\"Titan's Curse\" /> by helping Percy and the others on their quest in ''The Battle of the Labyrinth''.<ref name=\"labyrinth\" /> As Juno in ''The Lost Hero'', she is kidnapped by Gaea, and contacts Jason Grace to rescue her.

In the film adaptation, Hera is played by [[Erica Cerra]].\n* '''[[Poseidon]]'''/'''[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]''' \u2013 The god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses who is the brother of Zeus and Hades. In ''The Lightning Thief'', he is suspected of having stolen Zeus's master bolt but is proven innocent after Percy recovers it from Ares.<ref name=\"lightningbook\" /> Poseidon fights Oceanus in the underwater [[Front (military)|front]] of the Titan war. He remains there in ''The Last Olympian'' while the other Olympians fight [[Typhon]], until Percy convinces him that his power is necessary to defeat Typhon. He was last seen fighting the Giants in the Second Gigantomachy alongside Percy and the other gods and demigods and mentioned Kymopoleia to the other gods as his daughter after Percy and Jason reported meeting her.<ref name=\"blood\"/> Though he is referred to as Neptune in the sequels of ''Percy Jackson and the Olympians'' when the Greeks and Romans are united, he has yet to appear in Roman form. His cabin in Camp Half-Blood is Cabin 3 in which Percy is the sole permanent occupant. In the film adaptation of ''The Lightning Thief'', Poseidon is played by [[Kevin McKidd]]. In the musical, he is portrayed by Jonathan Raviv.\n** '''[[Amphitrite|Amphitrite/Salacia]]''' \u2013 The wife of Poseidon/Neptune.

His major crimes involved cheating death twice. The first where he tricked Thanatos into showing him how the chains worked causing Thanatos to be trapped until Ares freed him (Thanatos being trapped displeased Ares since no one in battle could die). The second time was when he complained to Persephone that his wife Merope did not give him a proper funeral and sent Sisyphus' spirit to the living. Even when Sisyphus did not want to return to the Underworld, he was forcefully dragged back there by Hermes. His punishment in The Fields of Punishment was to push a boulder up a hill. When it got close to the top, the boulder would roll back to the bottom and Sisyphus was condemned to begin again. He appears in ''The Demigod Files'' in the story titled ''The Sword of Hades'' when Percy and Nico asked his advice while Thalia pushes the boulder up the hill. He does not really help them much, but he does say that he helped someone else. He said that he told that other person to go see Melinoe.

Tantalus became \"tantalised\" by having food and drink close to him, but unable to enjoy either. He becomes the activities director at Camp Half-Blood after Chiron is fired. He appears in ''The Sea of Monsters'' as a minor character. Even when hired as the activities director, he could not eat or drink as the food kept evading him. Tantalus is shown to hate Percy and his friends even more than he hates most half-bloods, yet shows favoritism to Clarisse, as when naming her hero when the camp was attacked by Colchis Bulls or when she wins the chariot race and throwing a banquet in her honor. When Tyson is brought to camp, Tantalus insults and makes fun of him even when Tyson is claimed by Poseidon. When the camp is attacked by a large flock of Stymphalian birds, Tantalus blames it on Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson's \"bad chariot driving\" despite that they were the ones who defeated the birds.

He is the son of Julius and Ruby Kane. After the death of his mother (when he was eight years old), he spent six years travelling the world with his [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] father. His sister Sadie stays with their grandparents and they get to see each other once in a while. After his father is captured by the god [[Set (deity)|Set]] during ''[[The Red Pyramid (novel)|The Red Pyramid]]'', Carter spends most of his time with his sister Sadie and uncle Amos Kane. He becomes the host of Horus in the first novel, and often collaborates with and receives advice from the god. He also develops a romantic relationship with the ''[[ushabti|shabti]]'' of magician Zia Rashid, and subsequently spends much of his time trying to find the real Zia and demonstrate his feelings toward her. Like his father, Carter has dark skin and hair, quite different from both his mother and sister. When living with his father, Carter dressed \"impeccably\" like Julius even when relaxing, but adopts a much more casual style when he goes to live at Brooklyn House. Though he is not one to flout rules, Carter is brave and courageous enough to pursue the way of the gods despite the House of Life's disapproval. His specialty is combat magic; his preferred weapon a [[khopesh]], but loses it in ''The Throne of Fire''.<ref name=\"Book2\" /> He is often given leadership responsibilities and struggles to accept his role, until he willingly becomes pharaoh of the House of Life during ''[[The Serpent's Shadow (Riordan novel)|The Serpent's Shadow]]''.\n\n====Sadie Kane====\n'''Sadie Kane''' is one of two main protagonists and narrators; the younger sister of Carter Kane. She is left in the care of her non-magical grandparents in London after the death of their mother Ruby Kane. Though she is able to live a \"normal\" life, something her brother is occasionally jealous of, her unusual circumstances make her sometimes jealous of Carter (especially when she is reminded of his exotic lifestyle). Sadie has to abruptly leave her life in London when she goes to revive the twenty-first Nome and fight Set after the god captures her father, Julius Kane. Sadie becomes the host of Isis in ''The Red Pyramid'' and continues to study the goddess's path throughout the series. She also becomes romantically involved with one of the Brooklyn House initiates Walt Stone and also with the god Anubis, though her relationship with either is not formalized until after Walt becomes the \"eye\" of Anubis in ''The Serpent's Shadow''.\n\nShe has caramel-colored hair and fair skin, some traits inherited from her mother Ruby. Unlike Carter, Sadie is rebellious and bold (also like her mother) and acts the part; often making snap decisions, ignoring rules, and choosing to wear clothing to display her personality rather than to conform or aid her magic. Her magical specialty is with spells, potions, and [[hieroglyphics]].\n\n====Walt Stone====\n'''Walt Stone''' is one of the twenty-first Nome's initiates, who arrives at Brooklyn House sometime  in the second novel. He has dark skin and is from [[Seattle]], where he lived with his mother. Walt is a ''sau'', or charmmaker.<ref name=\"Book2\">{{cite book |title=The Throne of Fire |publisher=Disney-Hyperion |author=Riordan, Rick |year=2011 |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4231-4056-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/throneoffire00rior }}</ref> In ''The Throne of Fire'', it is revealed that Walt has inherited a deadly curse from his ancestor [[Akhenaten]], which will kill him before reaches adulthood, as it did to his father and their famous ancestor [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]]. The curse progresses more quickly when he uses magic, which is why he specializes in charms and also why he begins to call on the god Anubis for guidance. In ''The Serpent's Shadow'', Walt finally succumbs to the curse, but as he dies he allows himself to become the host of Anubis, whose spirit can essentially keep him alive. Both Anubis and Walt Stone have romantic feelings for Sadie Kane. Which makes it easier to host Anubis.\n\n====Zia Rashid====\n'''Zia Rashid''' is a magician from the first Nome who was born and raised in [[Egypt]]. She is found and raised by Iskandar, the [[lector priest|Chief Lector]], after the destruction of her hometown by Apophis. When Julius Kane released five gods through the [[Rosetta Stone]], she became the unexpected host of [[Nephthys]], and was subsequently placed by Iskandar in an underwater prison so the House of Life could not eliminate her. A ''shabti'' of her was created to take her place; it is destroyed during the fight with Set in ''The Red Pyramid''. Carter Kane falls in love with this shabti and seeks out the real Zia to free her and release Nephthys's spirit. Zia, who specializes in fire magic, later becomes the host of Ra and the two manage to destroy Apophis in ''The Serpent's Shadow''. Her initial indifference to Carter slowly evolves into romance, and the two begin dating at the end of the series when Ra ascends back to the heavens.\n\n====Amos Kane====\n'''Amos Kane''' is Julius Kane's younger brother, Carter and Sadie's uncle, and the leader of the twenty-first Nome (New York). He takes in Carter and Sadie after Julius hosts Osiris and is trapped by the god Set. During the first novel, Amos is possessed by Set and forced to lure his niece and nephew to the god's pyramid in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Once freed, Amos goes for healing at the first Nome, and does not return to Brooklyn House until the second novel. His experience hosting Set has changed him, however, and eventually leads to his highly controversial decision to voluntarily host the god during the final battle with Apophis. Amos succeeds Michel Desjardins when the former leader of the House of Life sacrifices himself fighting Apophis.\n\n====Iskandar====\n'''Iskandar''' is the Chief Lector of the House of Life. Born in the 1st century BCE, during the reign of [[Cleopatra]] VII, he witnessed the end of the Egyptian monarchy and the absorption of Egypt into the [[Roman Empire]]. He came to believe this was the fault of the gods and ended the House's policy of calling upon them; Ruby Kane's vision of Apophis rising changes his mind, but it is too late for him to make any real change. He was the one who saved Zia after her village's destruction and, sensing that she holds the power to host Ra, arranged for her confinement in an underwater prison under the watch of Nephthys while creating a ''shabti'' of her to protect Carter and Sadie, both of whom also hold the potential to become hosts of gods. Shortly after meeting them, he dies in his sleep, knowing that these three can make a change where he could not. He is succeeded by Michel Desjardins as the House's leader.\n\n====Michel Desjardins====\n'''Michel Desjardins''' is the lesser antagonist and leader of the House of Life after the death of Iskandar. Desjardins is the grandnephew of [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]] and approximately 200 years old, considered \"young\" for a magician. As such, he has known only the House policy forbidding the Path of the Gods. He is therefore at first opposed to cooperation with the gods and disagrees with the Kanes when they claim it is necessary to stop Apophis. He works with Vladimir Menshikov in the latter's attempt to hunt Sadie and Carter Kane, believing his lies about how the Kanes' efforts will empower Apophis. Upon discovering the truth, that the Kanes were right and Menshikov is trying to free Apophis, he journeys to the Duat to help Carter and Sadie and sacrifices himself to execrate Apophis, killing Menshikov and buying the Kanes more time. He is succeeded as leader of the House of Life by Amos Kane.\n<!-- (pronounced Dey-shard-dahn) Can we get a phonetic? -->\n\n===Egyptian deities===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian deities}}\n* '''[[Anubis]]''' \u2014 God of funerals and death and periodic advisor to Sadie Kane, for whom he has romantic feelings.

Like Carter, he incarnates the power of Horus.\n* '''Sean''' \u2013 An Irish trainee at Brooklyn House.\n* '''Shelby''' \u2013 A young trainee at Brooklyn House, the ringleader of the group of toddler trainees known as the \"anklebiters\". Her magic is mostly impulsive.\n* '''Leonid''' \u2013 A young Russian magician who first encountered the Kanes when they visited [[Saint Petersburg]]. He [[defection|defects]] to the \"side\" of the gods and, with the help of the god [[Shu (Egyptian god)|Shu]], brings Sadie and Carter information during ''The Serpent's Shadow''.\n\n====Other magicians====\n* '''Julius Kane''' \u2014 Carter and Sadie's father, and a doctor of Egyptology. After a failed attempt to release the Egyptian goddess Bast back into the world results in the death of his wife, he works to find a way to release them again and become host to Osiris. He ultimately succeeds, dies of his own free will, and goes to \"live\" as the god's physical manifestation in the Underworld, overseeing the [[Ancient Egyptian religion#Judgment|Hall of Judgment]].\n* '''Ruby Kane''' \u2014 Carter and Sadie's late mother, who appears occasionally as a ''[[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ba (personality)|ba]]'' to advise her children. She was a magician and diviner who foresaw Apophis's rise and ultimate victory if the other gods were not there to stop him. As a result, she and her husband attempted to release Bast from her eternal battle with Apophis so the goddess could heal before his inevitable rise. She gave her life to close the portal they opened using [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]], because Apophis was fighting to get out. Ruby also communed with Isis at some point in her career as a magician, and attempted to convince then-Chief Lector Iskandar to remand his policy of fighting the gods.\n* '''Vladimir Menshikov''' \u2014 The antagonist of ''The Throne of Fire''. Menshikov's intense hatred of the gods and desire for power leads to his possession by Apophis. He manipulates Michel Desjardins into permitting him to hunt the Kane family. When Desjardins finally discovers his involvement, he uses up all his energy in an execration of the chaos demon and, by extension, Menshikov, who is then killed. Menshikov is described by Sadie and Carter Kane as an \"evil ice cream man\"<ref name=\"Book2\" /> because of his tendency to wear white suits and glasses because of his heavily scarred face.\n* '''Setne''' \u2013 An evil magician and son of Ramses the Great. He is also known as [[Khaemweset|Khaemwaset]]. He appears in ''The Serpent's Shadow'' as an evil ghost on trial for many crimes. Setne is freed by the protagonists Carter and Sadie to aid in the fight against Apophis. After the former's destruction, however, Setne escapes and becomes the main antagonist of the crossover series with the Camp Half-Blood chronicles, where he plans to amass the power of both the Egyptian and Greco-Roman worlds. He is finally trapped in a snow globe by Carter, Sadie, Percy Jackson, and Annabeth Chase.\n* '''Sarah Jacobi''' \u2013 The leader of a group of rebel magicians, a former House scribe imprisoned for causing the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]].

The ''Kane Chronicles'' present a different picture of Ammit than is typical, by portraying the demon as both no larger than a [[toy poodle]] and as a male.\n* '''Doughboy''' \u2014 Julius Kane's wax ''shabti''; comically resentful of Julius. He is used for many purposes by Carter and Sadie.\n* '''Egyptian [[Griffin]]''' - The sacred animals of Horus.

It was initially a statue brought to life by Sadie. Tamed by Carter in ''The Throne of Fire'', Freak became his pet and personal transportation thereafter.\n* '''Khufu''' \u2014 Amos's pet [[baboon]]. Like many baboons in the series, he loves basketball and speaks only in monosyllabic grunts. Khufu's other quirk is that he only eats things that end in the letter 'O', such as [[Cheerios]], [[Jell-O]], and [[flamingo]] meat.\n* '''Leroy''' \u2013 The [[Set animal]] that was destroyed and nicknamed by Carter Kane.\n* '''[[Mummy (monster)|Mummy]]''' \u2013 Undead bodies that are wrapped in bandages.

They have the ability to spit poison and are tremendously strong.\n\n==''Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard''==\n===Main characters===\n====Magnus Chase====\n'''Magnus Chase''' is the main protagonist of the series. A 16-year-old [[Boston]]ian teenager, Magnus lost his mother Natalie to a mysterious wolf attack two years prior to the events of ''The Sword of Summer'' and is forced to live in the streets with his homeless friends, Blitz and Hearth. On his 16th birthday, his uncle, Randolph informs him of his divine parentage as a son of a Norse god and his inheritance of ''Sumarbrander'', the sword that once belonged to his father Frey. After being killed by [[Surtr|Surt]], a fire giant, Magnus is then carried to [[Valhalla|Hotel Valhalla]] by Samirah Al-Abbas, a Valkyrie. He then finds out that his father is Frey, the god of peace, wealth and prosperity, who belongs to the Vanir tribe of Norse deities.\n\nMagnus is described as having blond hair that reaches his chin and haunting gray eyes that resemble his cousin, Annabeth's. He is said to look like [[Kurt Cobain]] and has [[asthma]]. His scrawny look is replaced by a more muscular persona after his death and acceptance to Valhalla. He is quite street smart due to the two years he spent as a homeless child and as a result, is not quick to trust people. Nevertheless, he considers Blitz and Hearth as the only friends he is completely loyal to, and after a while, also begins to ease up and trust Sam. He is also known to have a budding relationship with another child of [[Loki]] named Alex Fierro. He is not fiery nor quick to anger.\n\nAs a son of the god of fertility, Magnus does not excel in offensive power. Instead, he usually thinks strategically to safely escape from danger. When he does have to attack, he mainly uses the Sword of Summer, Jack, who attacks autonomously. Magnus' demigod abilities concern healing and warmth: through concentration, Magnus is able to heal even the mortally injured as well making a mortal see through Ginnungagap and thus the Norse world, though doing so often causes him to read the subject's memories.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\">{{cite book |title=The Sword of Summer |publisher=[[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Disney]]-[[Hachette Books#Hyperion Books|Hyperion]] |author=Riordan, Rick |authorlink=Rick Riordan |year=2015 |location=[[Los Angeles]] |isbn=978-1-4231-6091-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/swordofsummer0000rior }}</ref>\n\n====Blitzen====\n'''Blitzen (Blitz)''' is a 20-year-old [[Svart\u00e1lfar|dwarf]] or, more specifically, a svartalf from [[Ni\u00f0avellir|Nidavellir]]. He has dark skin and hair, and has a beard. He is the son of a Vanir, Freya, making him Magnus' cousin, and a dwarf, Bil\u00ec, who was eaten by Fenris Wolf while checking Fenris's prison rope. He is sent alongside Hearth by [[M\u00edmir|Mimir]] to watch and protect Magnus. Though he keeps it up for two years, the task fails when Magnus is killed, but Blitz continues to look for him until they are reunited in Valhalla. As a dwarf, Blitz is sensitive to sunlight and will slowly turn to stone if exposed too much, which is why he always wears a copious article of clothing whenever there is sunlight, except in [[Folkvangr|Folkvanger]], in which sunlight is replaced by an aura radiated by Freya instead. Instead of forging, Blitz excels in clothing design, making him a laughing stock among his fellow dwarfs, but after he wins a match against Eitri Junior, he becomes respected and eventually opens up a clothing shop. In battle, Blitz uses his creations to assist himself, including chain-mail gloves and vest. Blitz has had a strong relationship with Hearth ever since the former saved the latter's life, and the two are very protective of each other.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n\n====Hearthstone====\n'''Hearthstone (Hearth)''' is a [[D\u00f6kk\u00e1lfar and Lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar|light elf]] from [[\u00c1lfheimr|Alfheim]]. He is skinny with pale skin and with short spiky blond hair, which, when combined with his black leather jacket, jeans, and a red scarf, \"makes him look like a character from a Japanese ''anime''\". Hearth is deaf and can only communicate with ASL (Alf Sign Language), though he is able to read lips. Since his homeworld is always bright, he is sensitive to darkness. Like Blitz, Hearth makes a deal with Mimir to drink water from [[M\u00edmisbrunnr|Mimir's Well]] by one of the roots of Yggdrasil to gain knowledge about runes and in return has to work with him for several years. He becomes a companion and protector of Magnus from then on. Hearth is the first elf in a long time to focus on magic from runes, which he has studied extensively. He can cast various runes, though doing such consumes his energy. Eventually, he progresses to the rank of a full sorcerer.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n\nHearth has a traumatic past, as he is effectively unwanted by his parents, who shun him for being deaf and not as great as his brother, Andiron, who died young; he is forced to face his past in the second book, when he has to collect the Skofnung Stone from his father, Alderman, who wants him to finish the blood tax imposed on him as repentance for Andiron's death. He is also reminded that sooner or later, he will have to take the ''[[Odal (rune)|othala]]'' rune from Andiron's place of death, which he planted as a reminder of his past, to complete his magic arts. In the third book, Hearth decides to take ''othala'', using it to summon Andiron's spirit to distract his father long enough for Magnus to pierce his heart. His relationship with his friends helps him, though, and he even once calls Magnus \"brother\". At the end of the first book, Hearth is freed from servitude and begins learning runes at [[Asgard]] from Odin.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n\n====Samirah al-Abbas====\n'''Samirah (Sam) al-Abbas Bint Loki''' is a [[Valkyrie]] and a daughter of Loki who selects Magnus as an [[einherjar|einherji]] under [[Odin]]'s order. She is an [[Arab American]] who normally wears her Valkyrie armor and a green [[hijab]], which doubles as a [[Valkyrie#V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a|swan cloak]] ([[Metamaterial cloaking|camouflage cloak]]). She leads a double life as both a Valkyrie and a normal high schooler. She does not worship the Norse gods as she is [[Muslim]] and believes in [[Allah|God]]. Her family is from [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], but has been raised by her grandparents in [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] since the death of [[#The Al Abbas family|her mother]]. Sam's family already had a long history with the Vikings, even before her mother met Loki; [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]], an envoy of the [[Abbasid|Abbasid Caliph]] to the [[Kievan Rus']], is one of Sam's ancestors, and the [[Varangians]] have since intermarried with Sam's family. Her specific parentage is a shame to her mother's family as an out-of-[[Marriage|wedlock]] child; the Norse also distrust her for being Loki's daughter.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/> Sam is betrothed to her childhood crush, [[#Amir|Amir Fadlan]].<ref name=\"kirkus magnus1\">{{cite web |title=THE SWORD OF SUMMER by Rick Riordan {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|url = https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rick-riordan/sword-of-summer/|website = Kirkus Reviews|accessdate = 2015-10-10|language = en-us}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Sword of Summer'', Sam is expelled from Valhalla when her video of Magnus' heroic death is edited by Gunilla, but later joins Magnus, Blitz, and Hearth in stopping Fenris Wolf from breaking free. She is eventually reinstated as Valkyrie and gets another job as Odin's personal aide. In ''[[The Hammer of Thor]]'', Sam is unwillingly betrothed by Loki to [[Thrym]] in exchange for [[Mjolnir]]; in reality, Loki wants the [[Skofnung|Skofnung Sword]], with which he can finally free himself.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/> Sam is then given a task by Odin to head towards [[Scandinavia]] and personally imprison Loki back before he is able to invade [[Midgard]] and eventually [[Asgard]]. In ''The Ship of the Dead'', Sam participates in the quest to stop the Naglfar from sailing in Niflheim and has sufficiently trained with Alex enough that she is immune to Loki's influence. The quest is challenging for her not only because of its danger, but also because she is [[Sawm|fasting]] for [[Ramadan]].\n\nAs a fighter, Sam wields a Valkyrie axe or dagger. She has also inherited her father's ability to shapeshift into animals such as a horsefly or lion; however, shapeshifting makes her uncomfortable, as it causes her to become more like her father. Sam wants to become an [[aircraft pilot]] and enjoys being a Valkyrie because it affords her a chance to fly (albeit through levitation, not piloting).\n\n====Sumarbrander====\n'''The Sword of Summer (Jack)''' was Frey's weapon, currently wielded by Magnus Chase. After Magnus finds out that the sword is sentient, Sumarbrander decides to name itself Jack, and be referred to as a male. In battle Magnus can let the sword attack his enemies on its own or use his own strength and control the sword himself. Either way, it is Magnus who loses energy ultimately, though this loss is delayed until he next grips or sheathes Jack.\n\nHe bears a grudge against Frey, who 'abandoned' him, by giving him to [[Skirnir]] as a price for the latter bringing the former a Giantess with whom he fell in love; he summarises this by once admonishing Frey, saying 'blades before babes'.\n\nHe reached Boston with one of Skirnir's descendants during the Viking expansion, where he was lost for centuries till he was recovered by Magnus.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n\n====Alex Fierro====\n{{main|Alex Fierro}}\nIntroduced in ''Magnus Chase and the Hammer of Thor'', Alex Fierro is a child of Loki (mother) and Mr. Fierro (father). She/he is [[Genderqueer|gender-fluid]], similar to Loki, who was known to change genders in myths. She/he prefers pronouns coinciding with her/his gender at the moment rather than 'they'. When in Valhalla, she/he is referred to as an [[argr]], the [[Old Norse]] word for 'unmanly,' due to being assigned male but identifying as a woman most of the time. Unlike her/his half-sister, Sam, Alex was born via Loki's female form, thus making the god her/his mother rather than her/his father. Like Sam, she/he resents her/his mother; however, Alex seems to be able to resist Loki much easier than Sam. She/he, like Magnus, is homeless, in her/his case due to her/his father disagreeing with her/his gender-fluidity. Nevertheless, she/he treasures her/his Fierro heritage, an ancient family who had lived near [[Mexico City]] as potters since before the time of the [[Aztecs]].\n\nIn ''The Hammer of Thor'', Alex goes to Jotunheim alongside Magnus and the others to visit Utgard-Loki and find out about Loki's plan about Sam's betrothal. She/he becomes Sam's double during her betrothal and forms a friendship with Sif. In ''The Ship of the Dead'', Alex has trained Sam to resist Loki's influence and participates in the quest to Scandinavia to stop Naglfar from sailing. She/he grows closer with Magnus and kisses him when the group is struggling to reach Skadi's fortress in Niflheim. The kiss is recounted by Magnus during his fighting with Loki as the greatest thing to have ever happened to him. By the end of the book, she/he assists Magnus in running the Chase Space, a shelter for the homeless youth.\n\nAlex uses a gold [[Garrote|garrote wire]] as a weapon, which formally used to be a pottery wire. She/he can also shape-shift into things such as a bear and an elephant in combat, and is far more comfortable with embracing this power than her/his half-sister, Sam.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\">{{cite book |title=The Hammer of Thor |publisher=[[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Disney]]-[[Hachette Books#Hyperion Books|Hyperion]] |author=Riordan, Rick |authorlink=Rick Riordan |year=2016 |location=[[Los Angeles]] |isbn=978-1-4231-6092-2}}</ref>\n\n===Norse deities===\nThe Norse gods fall into two general groups: the [[\u00c6sir|Aesir]] and the [[Vanir]]. All are referred to generally as \"Asgardians\", but the Vanir inhabit [[Vanaheim]] as often as Asgard. The Aesir are more warlike, while the Vanir are peaceful. Specifically, however, the gods tend to be distinguished by what side they fought on during the [[\u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War|Aesir-vanir war]], and not by their personal temperaments.\n\n====Aesir====\nThe following [[Norse mythology|Norse gods]] are considered the more warlike of the two strains of immortals.\n\n* '''[[Frigg]]''' \u2013 The queen of the Aesir and wife of Odin, the goddess of knowledge, wisdom, and forethought. As Odin frequently travels through the Nine Worlds, Frigg is left in charge of Asgard most of the time. Sam idolizes her among the Aesir as she is the glue that keeps the gods together. According to Sam, no einherji or valkyrie have ever seen Frigg in person. ''The Ship of the Dead'' reveals that she is the mother of Mallory, whom she gives a walnut capable of trapping anything inside it.\n* '''[[Heimdallr|Heimdall]]''' \u2013 The all-seeing, all-hearing god of vigilance and guardian of [[Bifr\u00f6st|Bifrost]], the entrance of Asgard, who was born from [[Nine Mothers of Heimdallr|nine mothers]]. He has a hobby of taking [[selfies]], using his horn [[Gjallarhorn|Gjallar]] as a [[phablet]] and a [[selfie stick]], which tends to make him forget to directly oversee the Nine Worlds.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n* '''[[Kvasir]]''' \u2013 An Aesir born from the saliva of the gods, created as a peace treaty following the Aesir-Vanir war. He walked through the Nine Worlds giving advice to beings, but he fell to a trap by Fjalar and Galar, who killed him and drained his blood to create the [[Mead of Poetry]].\n* '''[[Loki]]''' \u2013 The god of evil and trickery. He is the father of Samirah Al Abbas. He can also become female, having turned into a mare to give birth to the eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]] and later into a red-haired woman to give birth to the demigod Alex Fierro, who like Loki, is [[gender-fluid]]. After tricking [[H\u00f6\u00f0r|Hod]] to kill [[Balder]], he is chained to a rock with the entrails of his sons as chains with poison from a snake dripping onto his face constantly. He makes it his personal goal to break free and take revenge against the gods in [[Ragnarok]], using his trickery to manipulate people around him even when he is incorporeal. He finally manages to break free at the end of ''[[The Hammer of Thor]]'' and begins the preparations to sail in the Naglfar to declare Ragnarok.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/> In ''The Ship of the Dead'', despite managing to shame Magnus greatly during their flyting duel, he is overpowered when Magnus flytes him with the power of his friends long enough for Mallory to trap him inside a magical walnut. Odin later sentences Loki to be chained again to the rock.\n* '''[[M\u00edmir]]''' \u2013 The god of knowledge and wisdom. He was beheaded during the [[\u00c6sir-Vanir War]] and only his head remains. He is the boss of Blitz and Hearth due to a deal they made, in order to drink from his well. The deal is nullified by Odin at the end of first book as their reward for dealing with the Fenris Wolf.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[Odin]]''' \u2013 The king of the Aesir, the god of royalty and magic. He is able to rewrite reality by spelling out runes, which he learned after hanging for nine days on a branch of Yggdrasil. Odin is the owner and proprietor of Hotel Valhalla where he is always away on important businesses where he searches for knowledge and leaves the important decisions to his management. His ravens and wolves represent him at meetings. In ''The Sword of Summer'', Odin is claimed to have disappeared two years before Magnus' acceptance as an einherji, but he actually disguises himself as X the Troll, and one of Magnus' floormates. At the end of the book, Odin reveals himself and rewards Magnus and his friends for their bravery against the Fenris Wolf. He likes to give presentations.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[R\u00e1n|Ran]]''' \u2013 The goddess of the sea, who operates a net that collects anything that falls into the sea. She has an apple of Idun, but forgets to consume it, which contributes to her elderly appearance. Magnus and Sam manage to convince her to give them the apple and Sumarbrander, but she warns that doing so has made her and Aegir bent on attacking Magnus.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[Sif]]''' \u2013 The goddess of the earth and Thor's self-proclaimed \"trophy wife\". After losing her hair due to Loki's trick, she now has golden hair that can be melded into precious objects, inspiring the legend of ''[[Rapunzel]]''. Sam and Alex, both Loki's children, do not like her; the former states that Sif is vain and accepts her hair replacement and title because she does not understand that Loki is merely playing with her. Alex, however, begins to have respect for her after she helps her dress for Thrym's wedding ceremony.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n* '''[[Sigyn]]''' \u2013 Sigyn is Loki's wife. She reduces his punishment by collecting venom dripped by the venomous snake in a bowl, though it is never enough to alleviate them from torturing him. When Loki is about to free himself in ''The Hammer of Thor'', she appears to make an attempt to delay the escape, but later goes with him anyway when the Asgardians come. She is present during Magnus and Loki's flyting duel; when Loki indirectly insults her by claiming that he stands by himself, she leaves the area, dealing the final blow to the flyting once Magnus points out that Loki has no one to care for him. She is described as having eyes that tear blood, as well as a perpetually blank expression.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n* '''[[Thor]]''' \u2013 The god of lightning, storms, and strength. He has an unkempt appearance, is lazy, and is also up-to-date with modern television shows. He has red hair, huge muscles and a dirty face. He wears a sleeveless, leather jerkin and is very loud. He tasks Magnus and his friends with retrieving his spear, which was stolen from him by Geirrod. He has two talking goats, [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjostr]], nicknamed Otis and Marvin. His hammer is currently missing, which becomes an important plot point in ''[[The Hammer of Thor]]'', where he regains it.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n* '''[[Tyr]]''' \u2013 The god of courage, law, and trial by combat. He lost his a hand due to Fenris Wolf's bite. All of his children, T.J. included, are naturally inclined to accept challenges. He appears at the end of ''The Ship of the Dead'', congratulating T.J. for stopping Loki from starting Ragnarok.\n* '''[[V\u00ed\u00f0arr|Vidar]]''' \u2013 The god of revenge, also called the \"Silent One\" due to his method of communicating with ASL. He is sensible and snarky, a complete opposite of his brother Thor.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n\n====Vanir====\nThese gods are generally more peaceful and dislike the warlike nature of the Aesir:\n\n* '''[[Freyr|Frey]]''' \u2013 The god of fertility, warmth, and healing, the twin brother of Freya, and the father of Magnus. Frey owned a sword, Sumarbrander, which was given to Skirnir in return for his help in wooing a beautiful giantess; as a result, he is unarmed by the time of Ragnarok and will be killed by Surt. Though Magnus never meets his father until the end of the first book, he realizes that all the times his mother took him hiking through the wilderness was a way for them to get closer to Frey.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[Freyja|Freya]]''' \u2013 The goddess of love and warmth and the twin sister of Frey. She is described as very beautiful. She presides over Vanaheim, where the other half of worthy souls go after death, and casts warmth that shines over it. Freya is the mother of most dwarves in Nidavellir, including Blitz, which happened because she bartered to (briefly) marry some dwarves in exchange for luxurious items. Freya tasks Blitz to get some earrings by challenging Junior.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|Njord]]''' \u2013 The god of fishery, seafaring, and crop fertility, the father of Frey and Freya, and Magnus' grandfather. He is a mortal enemy of Aegir and Ran, his influence stopping them from ravaging through the sea and reducing the mortal casualties. In ''The Ship of the Dead'', he saves Magnus and company from being killed by Aegir's nine daughters and tells them to seek his ex-wife, Skaldi, if they want to prevent Loki from sailing in the Naglfar.\n\n====Other Norse gods====\n* '''[[Hel (being)|Hel]]''' \u2013 The daughter of Loki who presides over [[Hel (location)|Helheim]], the realm where the unworthy dead go. One half of her is a very beautiful woman, while the other is a decaying corpse. She tries to persuade Magnus to give up Sumarbrander to Randolph, but he refuses.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''[[Norns]]''' \u2013 A trio of female figures who can see the past, present, and future. They recite a prophecy to Magnus that kickstarts his journey to stop Fenris Wolf from breaking free.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''Fear''' \u2013 A minor God who assists the Mountain Giants. In ''The Hammer of Thor'', it is sent to compete with Sam in a game of axe throwing under the guise of a Mountain Giant called Little Billy. Sam sees through the illusion and defeats it.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n\n===Hotel Valhalla residents and staff===\nThe following characters live and/or work in Hotel Valhalla and all answer to Odin. It is their duty to prepare an army for the day of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].\n\n====Einherjar====\n* '''Dede''' \u2013 Dede is one of Magnus' fellow new einherjar. She is the daughter of two mortals. Dede is prophesied to become a Thane of Valhalla.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n* '''Halfborn Gunderson''' \u2013 An einherji who has lived in Hotel Valhalla since the Age of the Vikings over 1,200 years ago. He originated from [[Fl\u00e5m]], a small village in [[Norway]] and died in [[East Anglia]] while protecting [[Ivar the Boneless]]. He is described as \"[[Robinson Crusoe]] on steroids.\" Having lived for a long time, Halfborn is extremely skilled and has learned many languages. He has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Germanic literature. He almost dies at the end of ''The Sword of Summer'', but is revived by Magnus' power of healing.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/> Since ''The Hammer of Thor'', Halfborn is dating Mallory.\n* '''[[Helgi Hundingsbane]]''' \u2013 A Viking from East Gothland who is the [[hotel manager]] of Hotel Valhalla and member of the Thanes where he mostly works at the reception desk.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''Hunding''' \u2013 The former King of the Saxons, the [[bellhop]] and [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]] of Hotel Valhalla, and Helgi Hundingsbane's servant. Back in the year 749 C.E., Hundling and Helgi were opponents on the battlefield. When they came to Valhalla, Helgi was made the manager. His first order was to have Hunding do all the menial labor. Hunding has been at the hotel for thousands of years and longs for his family.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''Lars Alhstrom''' \u2013 An einherji and son of Thor who comes to Hotel Valhalla alongside Magnus. He died trying to free trapped people at sea.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/>\n* '''Mallory Keen''' \u2013 An Irish einherji and a daughter of Frigg. A member of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], she died during [[The Troubles]] while attempting to deactivate a bomb she planted to a school bus due to Loki's trick. This incident sparked her hate of Loki. She is foul-mouthed and quick to criticize someone, though T.J. explains that those are her expressions of affection. She has a love/hate relationship with Halfborn Gunderson, criticizing him as a \"disgusting Swede\", yet is in tears when he almost dies at the end of ''The Sword of Summer.''<ref name=\"MCGA Bk1\"/> ''The Hammer of Thor'' reveals that the two are dating each other.<ref name=\"MCGA Bk2\"/>\n* '''[[Thane (social status)|Thanes]]''' \u2013 The Thanes are people who have been chosen to accompany Odin to Valhalla. In this franchise, they consist of historical figures who Odin has selected. When Hotel Valhalla was established, Odin made them Hotel Valhalla's [[board of directors]]. Besides Helgi and Gunilla, among the known Thanes are:\n** '''[[Crispus Attucks]]''' \u2013 Member of the Thanes.

Thalia describes her as flighty, demanding and neglectful of both her children, and she would have run away from home earlier had Jason not existed. Beryl offering Jason to Hera's patronage, however, was the last straw that led Thalia to abandon her. Her stress turned her into alcohol, and she died several years before ''The Lightning Thief'' in a car accident. Melinoe impersonates her to instill fear on Thalia in the short story \"Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades\" in ''The Demigod Files''. In ''The Blood of Olympus'', Jason encounters her mania, who wants her son to return to her so they can be a family again, an offer which Jason rejects. She then disappears in a hiss or a sigh of relief.\n* '''Cade and Mickey''' \u2014 A pair of thugs sent by Nero to rob Apollo, although Meg is able to easily drive them off. Cade is described as tall and red-haired, while Mickey is short and blond-haired.\n* '''Emma and Liz''' \u2014 Sadie Kane's human friends from London. The stay with Sadie in ''The Throne of Fire'' during Babi and Nekhbet's sudden attack.

She offers Percy, Frank, and Coach Hedge a ride to the [[Georgia Aquarium]] in ''The Mark of Athena''. Hedge describes her as having the scent of potpourri.\n* '''Officer G\u00f3mez''' \u2013 A Bostonian [[police officer]]. He wants to capture Magnus.\n* '''Howard Claymore''' \u2013 A mortal who appears in ''The Demigod Diaries'' story ''Son of Magic'', written by Rick Riordan's son Haley Riordan.<ref name=\"DisneyCP\">{{cite press release |title=Disney Publishing Worldwide Releases Today The Demigod Diaries by No. 1 Best-selling Author Rick Riordan Percy Jackson and the Olympians Meets The Heroes of Olympus in This Original Short-story Collection |publisher=[[Disney Consumer Products]] |date=14 August 2012 |url=https://www.disneyconsumerproducts.com/Home/display.jsp?contentId=dcp_home_pressroom_pressreleases_dcp_home_pr_dpw_demigod_diaries_08142012&forPrint=false&language=ja&preview=false&imageShow=0&pressRoom=DPW&translationOf=null&region=0&ccPK=dcp_home_pressroom_press_room_all_DPW |accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref> He is a scholar and author with theories about death; he is approached for help by a son of Hecate called Alabaster Torrington who is fleeing the consequences of siding with Kronos in ''The Last Olympian''. Claymore later sacrifices himself so Alabaster can use an incantation to destroy a monster who is chasing him. Hecate brings him back to life in an imitative human body so that he can live on as Alabaster's protector.\n* '''Julian Ramirez-Arellano''' \u2013 Julian is the father of Reyna and Hylla. Julian was a former soldier in Iraq before the birth of his eldest daughter. After he had Reyna, he started getting paranoid. He thought that his daughters were going after him and he eventually became a mania. One day, he attacked Hylla, knocking her out, and Reyna took a sword and killed what was left of him. Reyna and Hylla then fled from San Juan, Puerto Rico, soon after.\n* '''May Castellan''' \u2013 May is Luke's mother. Like Rachel Dare, she could see through the Mist. She went insane during a failed attempt to become the Oracle.<ref name=\"LastOlympian\"/> She lives in the house where she had raised Luke, alternating between cheerful expectation that he will return home and visions of his terrible fate. In ''The Last Olympian'', Hestia reveals to Percy that Luke's mother, May Castellan, was a mortal woman blessed with the rare ability to see through The Mist, a magic substance that keeps mortals from seeing the Gods. Because of this gift, she attempted to become the new [[Oracle of Delphi]], but was rejected. Chiron inferred that the Spirit of Delphi rejected her because she had already given birth to a child, and the Oracle was supposed to be a virgin (in reality it was due to the Curse of Delphi placed upon the former Oracle by Hades still being active). She survived her encounter, but became mentally unstable, seeing small pieces of Luke's future.\n* '''Maurice''' and '''Eddie''' \u2013 Two employees of Kindness International Humane Animal Transport, encountered by Percy, Annabeth, and Grover in ''The Lightning Thief''.\n* '''Mr. and Mrs. Faust''' \u2014 Ruby Kane's parents, Carter and Sadie's maternal grandparents.

The two are possessed by the gods Nekhbet and Babi in an attempt to test Sadie's resolve when she begins to pursue the Book of Ra. Mrs. Faust, usually called \"Gran\" by Sadie, is described as frail with curly gray hair, and a terrible cook. \"Gramps\" is a large, loud former rugby player. Both have been kind to Sadie, though neither is much like their daughter Ruby, her mother.\n* '''Maria di Angelo''' \u2013 Maria di Angelo is Nico and Bianca's mother, an Italian diplomat's daughter. She died when Zeus struck the hotel she was staying in with lightning in an attempt to kill Bianca and Nico. Melinoe impersonated her to scare Nico.\n* '''Marie Levesque''' \u2013 Marie is Hazel's mother. She was manipulated by Gaea into helping raise Alcyoneus. She died in 1942 along with Hazel. She was sentenced to the Fields of Punishment but Hazel made a compromise with the judges so they could both be sent to the Fields of Asphodel. In ''The House of Hades'', Hecate reveals that she was Marie's mentor, teaching her magic.\n* '''Mr. Dare''' \u2013 Rachel's father. He is the very wealthy owner of a land development company, and he first appears in ''The Last Olympian''. Rachel hates her father because of his job, and he supported Rachel and loved her very dearly going to finishing school.<ref name=\"LastOlympian\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Camp Half-Blood}}\n{{Kane Chronicles |state=collapsed}}\n{{Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard |state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Camp Half-Blood Series}}\n[[Category:Rick Riordan]]\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]\n", "name_user": "S189005", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLuke Castellan", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_characters_in_mythology_novels_by_Rick_Riordan"}
