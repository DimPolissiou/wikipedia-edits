Alumni of the school, commonly known as ''Modernites,'' include some of India's most prominent politicians, government officials, and business leaders. The best known alumnus is late author [[Khushwant Singh]], whose father and brother were closely involved in the founding of the school.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe founder, Lala Raghubir Singh, was an established businessman and philanthropist. He belonged to a [[Sikh]] [[Khatri]] family that had settled in [[Delhi]]. His father, Sardar Sultan Singh, an accountant and banker (''khazanchi'') with the [[Imperial Bank of India]], was well-regarded by both the British and the Indian aristocracy. To fulfill his son's dream of establishing a school that would combine Indian tradition with modern educational techniques, Sultan Singh bequeathed his mansion in [[Daryaganj]], [[New Delhi]] to the school. The first classes started here in 1920.\n\nA few years later, Lala Raghubir Singh partnered with Sardar [[Sobha Singh (builder)|Sobha Singh]], a well-known developer of the [[British Raj|Raj]] involved in the construction of Delhi landmarks including [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]], [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum]], [[South Block]] and [[India Gate]], in developing a new campus for the school. Since 1932 the Modern School has occupied a {{convert|27|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus in the heart of [[New Delhi]]. More importantly, to emphasize his commitment to Raghubir Singh's educational venture, Sobha Singh's two sons, Bhagwant Singh and [[Khushwant Singh]] were amongst the first students of Modern School.\n\n=== Founding Ethos ===\n\n=== The Founder ===\n\n===Principals===\nReflecting its founder's pan-India vision, Mrs. Kamala Bose, the school's first principal, was recruited from [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata). She championed the cause of better educational facilities in newly independent India, as she right noted, \"If the education imparted to the people has been seriously lacking in quantity, it has been still more sadly wanting in quality.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Dream Turns Seventy-Five|last=Bose|first=Kamala|publisher=Allied Publishers|year=1995|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=}}</ref>\n\nModern School's longest-serving principal, Mr. [[M.

Inside the triangle, there is a [[banyan]] tree to represent stability and firmness of character, the swan and the lotus represent refinement, culture, and the arts which are fundamental elements of progress in life.\n\n=== Raghubir Singh Junior Modern School ===\nMr. N.K. Bose was the First Headmaster of the school.<ref>http://www.modernschool.net/history-other-branches.html</ref>\n\n=== Modern School, Vasant Vihar ===\nIn 1975, fifty-five year after the establishment of the school, its first sister\n\n==Campus==\nThe school occupies a single campus covering approximately twenty-five acres and is flanked by Maharaja Ranjit Singh Marg and Barakhamba Road in central [[New Delhi]]. To house the school at its present location, Lala Raghubir Singh made an application with the government for a suitable site on 28 April 1921. In response to the application, the government allocated fifty acres of land in the [[Delhi Cantonment]] for the purposes of the school. Due to its location in [[Old Delhi]], the Cantonment was deemed far from the centre of the new city (at the time being constructed by [[Edwin Lutyens]] and [[Herbert Baker]]). Thus, after a second round of negotiations a twenty-five acre site was allotted in 1930 (the lease being finalized the same year on 4 August) to provide accommodation for 200 resident boys with staff quarters and ample play-fields.\n\nThe Main Building was designed by C.G. and F.B. Blomfield, architects on the team designing the [[Lutyens' Delhi|imperial capital of New Delhi]]. The white and red aesthetic of the Edwardian Classical building at Modern School resembles many [[Delhi]] structures of the period, such as [[Convent of Jesus and Mary, Delhi|Convent of Jesus and Mary]], [[St. Columba's School, Delhi|St. Columba's School]], [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, New Delhi|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] (designed by [[Henry Medd]]), Flagstaff House (now [[Teen Murti Bhavan]]), and [[Lady Irwin School]]. It is now classified as a heritage structure and is an excellent example of British colonial architecture in [[New Delhi]]. Mahatma Gandhi had visited the School building in 1935.\n\nApart from the Main Building the campus includes the following: Sir Sobha Singh Block, the Platinum Jubilee Block, the Baradari and Main Garden, which houses an [[Indian Air Force]] fighter jet donated by a Modernite, the Sir Shankar Lal Auditorium; the M.N. Kapur Hall, the Technology Block, the Principal's Bungalow, the Boys' Boarding House & Mess, Staff & Warden's Apartments, the Sanitarium, and the locus of student activity, the Banyan Tree.\n\n===Golden Jubilee Hostel===\nModern School has a student dormitory capable of housing 90 boys. The hostel is equipped with study rooms, a library, a gymnasium, a TV room, and a sanatorium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modernschool.net/|title=Modern School|publisher=Modern School|accessdate=23 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Houses ===\nIn keeping with its nationalist origins, the school's [[house system]] honours significant figures in the history of India, namely [[Akbar]], [[Ashoka]], [[Abul Kalam Azad|Azad]], [[Gandhi]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai|Lajpat]], [[Laxmibai]], [[Nehru]], [[Sardar Patel|Patel]], [[Maharana Pratap|Pratap]], [[Ranjit Singh|Ranjit]], [[Lal Bahadur Shastri|Shastri]], [[Shivaji]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose|Subhas]], [[Tagore]], and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]].\n\n==School Activities==\n\n===Sports===\nSports are an integral part of the school curriculum. The school has two large playing grounds, the Main Ground and the Cricket Field. Hockey, [[cricket]], athletics, [[basketball]], and [[association football]] are played throughout the school year. [[Tennis]], [[table tennis]], [[badminton]], squash, and swimming are also available. \nSport is dominated by Association Football or Soccer, Cricket, basketball, hockey, in which the schools competes nationally, at the state-level and Inter-school. Inter-house competitions stopped happening without ay explanation. Sports facilities include an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-size swimming pool, six [[Clay court|clay]] tennis courts, three squash courts, an indoor and two outdoor basketball courts, facilities for indoor badminton and table tennis, two cricket pitches, two fields for hockey and football (which can be converted to cricket pitches to accommodate seasonal sports), and an athletic track.\n\n===Clubs and Societies===\nExtracurricular activities are a compulsory element of school life at Modern. The school magazine, ''Sandesh'', is published each school term in English and Hindi (its sister publications include the ''Vasant Prayag'' at Modern School, [[Vasant Vihar, Delhi|Vasant Vihar]], and ''Prayas'' at Modern School, Kundli). There are around twenty clubs and societies, including photography, aero-modelling, drama, painting, sculpture, community service, carpentry, Dance, music, senior and junior English debating societies, economics, astronomy,<ref>{{cite web|title=Modern School Astronomy Club|url=http://www.modernschool.net/beyond-curriculum-astronomy-club.html|publisher=Modern School|accessdate=23 June 2018}}</ref> computer science, physics,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=Modern School: Physics Club|url=http://www.modernschool.net/beyond-curriculum-physics-club.html|publisher=Modern School|accessdate=23 June 2018}}</ref> and robotics. In many societies pupils come together to discuss a particular topic, presided over by a faculty member and often including a guest speaker. The school has often invited prominent figures to give speeches and talks to the students; these have included heads of state, politicians, ornithologists, naturalists, artists, writers, economists, diplomats, and industrialists. The Modern School Leadership lecture series invites prominent alumni to address the school assembly twice every school year.

Its activities include donations to orphanages, recycling drives, ant-piracy drives, and an annual blood donation camp. The club has been awarded a certificate in recognition of its services to the community by [[Chief Minister of Delhi]], [[Sheila Dikshit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Interact Club of Modern School|url=http://www.modernschool.net/beyond-curriculum-interact-club.html|accessdate=23 June 2018}}</ref> Interact Club occasionally nominates (99.9% of students don't even know when and where these so-called international programs happen or how to even be considered to be a part of these) some of its students to be selected by Rotary International for its international program to represent [[India]] as Ambassador of Goodwill to neighboring countries such as [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The selected students stay as guests with families who participate in this international youth exchange program.

Breaking all conventions, ModMUN 2011 which attracted over 100 international students from the world over, it went on to become not only the biggest MUN in Asia, but also one of great prestige. The following year ModMUN 2012 came back better than ever building on the success of ModMUN 2011, in 2013, ModMUN preceded their expectations achieving almost 900 students from around the globe. Modern School is also a leading member of the&nbsp;[[Model United Nations]]&nbsp;and its annual ModMUN conference is one of the biggest in Asia<ref name=\":1\"/>&nbsp;attracting as many as 1000 international students for the 2016 conference.<ref name=\":2\"/> Due to its size, prestige, and popularity, it is considered the largest student organized MUN in [[India]].\n\nParallel to the successes of the conferences, the society which hosts it has also redefined the arena of Model UN. Since its inception, the Model UN Society of Modern School, Barakhamba road has gone on to make its presence felt in the most prestigious of conferences in the city, the country, and the world.\n\n===School Magazine===\nThe school takes out three publications, namely Sandesh, a biennial magazine, Red Brick Times, a monthly feature and the Chronicle, a weekly publication which encapsulates the events and achievements of the school and the students.\n\n===Theatre, Music and Dance===\nThe school houses large venues for indoor productions; the Sir Shankar Lal Auditorium, the HLL (Hindustan Lever Limited) Auditorium and the M.N. Kapur Hall (formerly the gymnasium). The Amphitheatre adjoining the historic Banyan tree is used for common musical evenings, etc.\n\n==Traditions and Lore==\nLike any established institution, Modern School has its fair share of traditions. For instance, during his tenure, Principal M.N. Kapur insisted all students sit cross legged on ''darris'' during morning assembly, a tradition that continues to this day. Drawing upon the longstanding relationship between Modern School and [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi|St. Stephen's College]], the Rudra Prize, established in 1928, honours [[S. K. Rudra|S.K.

This ended in 1961 when Raghubir Singh Junior Modern School was established on Hanumanyu Road, New Delhi, as the school's primary wing.

Alumni of the school, commonly known as ''Modernites,'' include some of India's most prominent politicians, government officials, and business leaders. The best known alumnus is late author [[Khushwant Singh]], whose father and brother were closely involved in the founding of the school.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe founder, Lala Raghubir Singh, was an established businessman and philanthropist. He belonged to a [[Sikh]] [[Khatri]] family that had settled in [[Delhi]]. His father, Sardar Sultan Singh, an accountant and banker (''khazanchi'') with the [[Imperial Bank of India]], was well-regarded by both the British and the Indian aristocracy. To fulfill his son's dream of establishing a school that would combine Indian tradition with modern educational techniques, Sultan Singh bequeathed his mansion in [[Daryaganj]], [[New Delhi]] to the school. The first classes started here in 1920.\n\nA few years later, Lala Raghubir Singh partnered with Sardar [[Sobha Singh (builder)|Sobha Singh]], a well-known developer of the [[British Raj|Raj]] involved in the construction of Delhi landmarks including [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]], [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum]], [[South Block]] and [[India Gate]], in developing a new campus for the school. Since 1932 the Modern School has occupied a {{convert|27|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus in the heart of [[New Delhi]]. More importantly, to emphasize his commitment to Raghubir Singh's educational venture, Sobha Singh's two sons, Bhagwant Singh and [[Khushwant Singh]] were amongst the first students of Modern School.\n\n=== Founding Ethos ===\n\n=== The Founder ===\n\n===Principals===\nReflecting its founder's pan-India vision, Mrs. Kamala Bose, the school's first principal, was recruited from [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata). She championed the cause of better educational facilities in newly independent India, as she right noted, \"If the education imparted to the people has been seriously lacking in quantity, it has been still more sadly wanting in quality.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Dream Turns Seventy-Five|last=Bose|first=Kamala|publisher=Allied Publishers|year=1995|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=}}</ref>\n\nModern School's longest-serving principal, Mr. [[M.

To house the school at its present location, Lala Raghubir Singh made an application with the government for a suitable site on 28 April 1921. In response to the application, the government allocated fifty acres of land in the [[Delhi Cantonment]] for the purposes of the school. Due to its location in [[Old Delhi]], the Cantonment was deemed far from the centre of the new city (at the time being constructed by [[Edwin Lutyens]] and [[Herbert Baker]]). Thus, after a second round of negotiations a twenty-five acre site was allotted in 1930 (the lease being finalized the same year on 4 August) to provide accommodation for 200 resident boys with staff quarters and ample play-fields.\n\nThe Main Building was designed by C.G. and F.B. Blomfield, architects on the team designing the [[Lutyens' Delhi|imperial capital of New Delhi]]. The white and red aesthetic of the Edwardian Classical building at Modern School resembles many [[Delhi]] structures of the period, such as [[Convent of Jesus and Mary, Delhi|Convent of Jesus and Mary]], [[St. Columba's School, Delhi|St. Columba's School]], [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, New Delhi|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] (designed by [[Henry Medd]]), Flagstaff House (now [[Teen Murti Bhavan]]), and [[Lady Irwin School]]. It is now classified as a heritage structure and is an excellent example of British colonial architecture in [[New Delhi]]. Mahatma Gandhi had visited the School building in 1935.\n\nApart from the Main Building the campus includes the following: Sir Sobha Singh Block, the Platinum Jubilee Block, the Baradari and Main Garden, which houses an [[Indian Air Force]] fighter jet donated by a Modernite, the Sir Shankar Lal Auditorium; the M.N. Kapur Hall, the Technology Block, the Principal's Bungalow, the Boys' Boarding House & Mess, Staff & Warden's Apartments, the Sanitarium, and the locus of student activity, the Banyan Tree.\n\n===Golden Jubilee Hostel===\nModern School has a student dormitory capable of housing 90 boys. The hostel is equipped with study rooms, a library, a gymnasium, a TV room, and a sanatorium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modernschool.net/|title=Modern School|publisher=Modern School|accessdate=23 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Houses ===\nIn keeping with its nationalist origins, the school's [[house system]] honours significant figures in the history of India, namely [[Akbar]], [[Ashoka]], [[Abul Kalam Azad|Azad]], [[Gandhi]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai|Lajpat]], [[Laxmibai]], [[Nehru]], [[Sardar Patel|Patel]], [[Maharana Pratap|Pratap]], [[Ranjit Singh|Ranjit]], [[Lal Bahadur Shastri|Shastri]], [[Shivaji]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose|Subhas]], [[Tagore]], and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]].\n\n==School Activities==\n\n===Sports===\nSports are an integral part of the school curriculum. The school has two large playing grounds, the Main Ground and the Cricket Field. Hockey, [[cricket]], athletics, [[basketball]], and [[association football]] are played throughout the school year.

It had to do so because it made those amounts immediately available to the Treasury, wherever desired. Since settlement by the local banks was in specie i.e. silver and gold coin, the pressure for settlement automatically regulated local banking lending: for the more the local banks lent the larger amount of their notes and checks in use and the larger the sums they had to settle in specie. This loss of specie reduced their power to lend.<ref>Hammond, 1956, pp. 9\u201310</ref>}} \n  \nUnder this banking regime, the impulse towards over speculation, with the risks of creating a national financial crisis, would be avoided, or at least mitigated.<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 149-150, Wilentz, 2008, p. 205, Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56</ref> It was just this mechanism that the local private banks found objectionable, because it yoked their lending strategies to the fiscal operations of the national government, requiring them to maintain adequate gold and silver reserves to meet their debt obligations to the U.S. Treasury.<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 150\"/> The proliferation of private-sector banking institutions \u2013 from 31 banks in 1801 to 788 in 1837<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 153</ref> \u2013 meant that the Second Bank faced strong opposition from this sector during the Jackson administration.<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:United States Bank Philadelphia 1875.png|thumb|The building in a book published in 1875]]\nThe architect of the Second Bank of the United States was [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] (1788\u20131854), a former student of [[Benjamin Latrobe]] (1764\u20131820), the man who is often called the first professionally trained American [[architect]]. Latrobe and Strickland were both disciples of the [[Greek Revival]] style. Strickland went on to design many other American public buildings in this style, including financial structures such as the [[Mechanics National Bank]] (also in Philadelphia). He also designed the [[New Orleans Mint|New Orleans]], [[Dahlonega Mint|Dahlonega]], and [[Charlotte Mint|Charlotte]] branch mints in the mid-to-late 1830s, as well as the second building for the main [[Philadelphia Mint|U.S. Mint in Philadelphia]] in 1833.\n\nStrickland's design for the Second Bank of the United States is in essence based on the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens, Greece]], and is a significant early and monumental example of Greek Revival architecture.<ref name=\"nhlnom\">{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|87001293}}|title=NHL nomination for Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-03-26}}</ref> The hallmarks of the Greek Revival style can be seen immediately in the north and south fa\u00e7ades, which use a large set of steps leading up to the main level platform, known as the [[stylobate]]. On top of these, Strickland placed eight severe [[Doric order|Doric]] columns, which are crowned by an entablature containing a [[triglyph]] [[frieze]] and simple triangular [[pediment]]. The building appears much as an ancient Greek temple, hence the stylistic name. The interior consists of an entrance hallway in the center of the north fa\u00e7ade flanked by two rooms on either side. The entry leads into two central rooms, one after the other, that span the width of the structure east to west. The east and west sides of the first large room are each pierced by large arched fan window. The building's exterior uses Pennsylvania blue marble, which, due to the manner in which it was cut, has begun to deteriorate due to weak parts of the stone being exposed to the elements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania Blue Marble|work=Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604135141/http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|archivedate=2009-06-04}}</ref> This phenomenon is most visible on the Doric columns of the south fa\u00e7ade.  Construction lasted from 1819 to 1824.\n\nThe Greek Revival style used for the Second Bank contrasts with the earlier, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in architecture used for the [[First Bank of the United States]], which also still stands and is located nearby in Philadelphia. This can be seen in the more Roman-influenced Federal structure's ornate, colossal Corinthian columns of its fa\u00e7ade, which is also embellished by Corinthian pilasters and a symmetric arrangement of sash windows piercing the two stories of the fa\u00e7ade. The roofline is also topped by a balustrade and the heavy modillions adorning the pediment give the First Bank an appearance much more like a Roman villa than a Greek temple.\n\n===Current building use===\nSince the bank's closing in 1841, the edifice has performed a variety of functions.

Whereas other central banks of that era were wholly private, the BUS was more characteristic of a government bank.<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 140</ref>\n\nUnder its charter, the bank had a capital limit of $35&nbsp;million, $7.5&nbsp;million of which represented the government-owned share. The central bank was required to remit a \"bonus\" payment of $1.5 million, payable in three installments,<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/> to the government for the privilege of using the public funds, interest free, in its private banking ventures.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 364</ref> The institution was answerable for its performance to the U.S. Treasury and Congress<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 149\">Hammond, 1947, p. 149</ref> and subject to Treasury Department inspection.<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/>\n\nAs exclusive fiscal agent for the federal government,<ref>Wellman, 1966, p. 92, Hammond, 1947, p. 149</ref> it provided a number of services as part of its charter including: holding and transfer of all U.S. deposits, payment and receipt of all government transactions, and processing of tax payments.<ref>Wilentz, 2005, p. 365</ref> In other words, the BUS was \"the depository of the federal government, which was its principal stockholder and customer\".<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 149, Hammond, 1957, p. 9</ref>\n\nThe chief personnel for the bank comprised twenty-five directors, five of whom were appointed by the President of the United States, subject to Senate approval.<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/> Federally appointed directors were barred from acting as officials in other banks. Two of the three BUS presidents, William Jones and Nicholas Biddle, were chosen from among these government directors.<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 149\"/>\n\nHeadquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the bank was authorized to establish branch offices where it deemed suitable and these were [[McCulloch v. Maryland|immune from state taxation]].<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/>\n\n==BUS regulatory mechanisms==\n\nThe primary regulatory task of the Second Bank of the United States, as chartered by Congress in 1816, was to restrain the uninhibited proliferation of paper money (bank notes) by state or private lenders,<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 150\"/> which was highly profitable to these institutions.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, pp. 74\u201375</ref> \n  \nIn this capacity, the bank would preside over this democratization of credit,<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/><ref name=\"Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56\">Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56</ref> contributing to a vast and profitable disbursement of bank loans to farmers, small manufacturers and entrepreneurs, encouraging rapid and healthy economic expansion.<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/> \n  \nHistorian Bray Hammond describes the mechanism by which the Bank exerted its anti-inflationary influence: \n  \n{{Quote|Receiving the checks and notes of local banks deposited with the [BUS] by government collectors of revenue, the [BUS] had constantly to come back on the local banks for settlements of the amounts which the checks and notes called for. It had to do so because it made those amounts immediately available to the Treasury, wherever desired. Since settlement by the local banks was in specie i.e. silver and gold coin, the pressure for settlement automatically regulated local banking lending: for the more the local banks lent the larger amount of their notes and checks in use and the larger the sums they had to settle in specie. This loss of specie reduced their power to lend.<ref>Hammond, 1956, pp. 9\u201310</ref>}} \n  \nUnder this banking regime, the impulse towards over speculation, with the risks of creating a national financial crisis, would be avoided, or at least mitigated.<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 149-150, Wilentz, 2008, p. 205, Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56</ref> It was just this mechanism that the local private banks found objectionable, because it yoked their lending strategies to the fiscal operations of the national government, requiring them to maintain adequate gold and silver reserves to meet their debt obligations to the U.S. Treasury.<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 150\"/> The proliferation of private-sector banking institutions \u2013 from 31 banks in 1801 to 788 in 1837<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 153</ref> \u2013 meant that the Second Bank faced strong opposition from this sector during the Jackson administration.<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:United States Bank Philadelphia 1875.png|thumb|The building in a book published in 1875]]\nThe architect of the Second Bank of the United States was [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] (1788\u20131854), a former student of [[Benjamin Latrobe]] (1764\u20131820), the man who is often called the first professionally trained American [[architect]]. Latrobe and Strickland were both disciples of the [[Greek Revival]] style. Strickland went on to design many other American public buildings in this style, including financial structures such as the [[Mechanics National Bank]] (also in Philadelphia). He also designed the [[New Orleans Mint|New Orleans]], [[Dahlonega Mint|Dahlonega]], and [[Charlotte Mint|Charlotte]] branch mints in the mid-to-late 1830s, as well as the second building for the main [[Philadelphia Mint|U.S. Mint in Philadelphia]] in 1833.\n\nStrickland's design for the Second Bank of the United States is in essence based on the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens, Greece]], and is a significant early and monumental example of Greek Revival architecture.<ref name=\"nhlnom\">{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|87001293}}|title=NHL nomination for Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-03-26}}</ref> The hallmarks of the Greek Revival style can be seen immediately in the north and south fa\u00e7ades, which use a large set of steps leading up to the main level platform, known as the [[stylobate]]. On top of these, Strickland placed eight severe [[Doric order|Doric]] columns, which are crowned by an entablature containing a [[triglyph]] [[frieze]] and simple triangular [[pediment]]. The building appears much as an ancient Greek temple, hence the stylistic name. The interior consists of an entrance hallway in the center of the north fa\u00e7ade flanked by two rooms on either side. The entry leads into two central rooms, one after the other, that span the width of the structure east to west. The east and west sides of the first large room are each pierced by large arched fan window. The building's exterior uses Pennsylvania blue marble, which, due to the manner in which it was cut, has begun to deteriorate due to weak parts of the stone being exposed to the elements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania Blue Marble|work=Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604135141/http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|archivedate=2009-06-04}}</ref> This phenomenon is most visible on the Doric columns of the south fa\u00e7ade.  Construction lasted from 1819 to 1824.\n\nThe Greek Revival style used for the Second Bank contrasts with the earlier, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in architecture used for the [[First Bank of the United States]], which also still stands and is located nearby in Philadelphia. This can be seen in the more Roman-influenced Federal structure's ornate, colossal Corinthian columns of its fa\u00e7ade, which is also embellished by Corinthian pilasters and a symmetric arrangement of sash windows piercing the two stories of the fa\u00e7ade. The roofline is also topped by a balustrade and the heavy modillions adorning the pediment give the First Bank an appearance much more like a Roman villa than a Greek temple.\n\n===Current building use===\nSince the bank's closing in 1841, the edifice has performed a variety of functions. Today, it is part of [[Independence National Historical Park]] in Philadelphia.\nThe structure is open to the public free of charge and serves as an art gallery, housing a large collection of portraits of prominent early Americans painted by [[Charles Willson Peale]] and many others.\n\nThe building was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1987 for its architectural and historic significance.<ref name=\"nhlnom\"/>\n\nThe Wall Street branch in New York City was converted into the United States Assay Office before it was demolished in 1915. The federal-style fa\u00e7ade was saved and installed in the American Wing of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1924.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Banks|Philadelphia}}\n* [[Banking in the Jacksonian Era]]\n* [[Federal Reserve Act]]\n* [[Federal Reserve System]]\n* [[First Bank of the United States]]\n* [[History of central banking in the United States]]\n* ''[[McCulloch v.

The island of [[Leyte]] is to its west, across [[Surigao Strait]], and [[Mindanao]] is to its south. Its main island, [[Dinagat Island|Dinagat]], is about {{convert|60|km}} from north to south. Declared a province in 2006, the Dinagat Islands comprise the second newest province of the Philippines, with [[Davao Occidental]] (2013) being the newest.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Surigao province map 1918.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Surigao (province)|Surigao province]] map in 1918|alt=An old map showing the current territories of the province as part of the historical province of Surigao]]\n\nThe province is known as one of the archipelago's holiest sites in the Pre-Christian native religion. It is here where the God of Hurricanes was persuaded to relent his attacks on the islands by Da, the God of Peace. The province in pre-colonial times was much influenced by the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] which was nestled in present-day Agusan del Norte. It was also used as the entry point of the Rahajnate of Ternate, present-day Moluccas of Indonesia, to attack the Rajahnate of Butuan, Rajahnate of Cebu, the indigenous settlements in the Anda Peninsula of Bohol, and the Kingdom of Dapitan (located 'between Panglao and Bohol), which later moved in northern Zamboanga after the Kingdom of Dapitan was destroyed.\n\nAlthough one of the newest provinces of the country, settlements in the Dinagat Islands were already present during the Spanish regime as a result of migration of people from nearby provinces of Bohol and Leyte. The so-called mystical province played an important role in the country's history, particularly during World War II.\n\nThe municipality of [[Dinagat, Dinagat Islands|Dinagat]] is the oldest community in the province. In the early days, a story was told that a stranger reached the place in search of greener pastures. He approached a native and asked what the inhabitants do for a living. The natives said that they farm and fish to live. The stranger's interest in fishing prompted him to inquire where they fish, and the native replied and pointed to a place saying ''dinhi niini na dagat'' (here from this bountiful waters). Since then, the place was called \"Dinagat\".\n\nThe municipality was formally established in 1855. It occupies the territorial boundaries of the whole island. From 1890 to 1990 its boundaries were gradually reduced giving rise to six municipalities, [[Loreto, Dinagat Islands|Loreto]], [[Cagdianao, Dinagat Islands|Cagdianao]], [[Libjo, Dinagat Islands|Libjo]], [[Basilisa, Dinagat Islands|Basilisa]], [[Tubajon, Dinagat Islands|Tubajon]] and [[San Jose, Dinagat Islands|San Jose]].\n\n[[File:6th Ranger Battalion, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers of the 6th Ranger Battalion move through a village on Dinagat Island, 18 October 1944.]]\n\nLoreto became a Spanish ''[[pueblo]]'' on September 4, 1890 under the supervision of Governor General Manuel Sanchez by the virtue of ''Direccion General No. 30''. It was originally called ''Mabua'' due to the ever-foaming river that runs right into the center of the community. It was named ''Loreto'' in 1881 by the Spanish priest who frequents the town, in honor of the wife of the ''Alcalde Mayor'' of the Province of Surigao.\n\nThe province was the site of the historic [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] during the Second World War. The Municipality of Loreto became the entry point of the American Liberation Forces on October 17, 1944. It was on this shore that the 6th Ranger Battalion of the 6th U.S. Army under Col. Mucci landed at Sitio Campintac of Barangay Panamaon in Loreto. It was during this landing that the first American flag flew on Philippine soil since the Japanese invasion in 1941. The Americans named the place \"Black Beach No. 2.\"\n\nThe northern part of the island served as a refuge for the American soldiers, while the western border was held by Japanese forces. Capsized vessel structures are still found today in the waters of Basilisa.\n\nOn December 23, 1959, [[Cagdianao, Dinagat Islands|Cagdianao]] was created into a municipality under ''Executive Order No. 367''.<ref name=GovPH-EO367>{{cite web|title=Executive Order No. 367; Creating the Municipality of Cagdianao in the Province of Surigao|url=http://www.gov.ph/1959/12/23/executive-order-no-367-s-1959/|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref> Its name came from the Spanish word ''Cada dia linao'' meaning \"everyday peaceful and calm\". However some scholars say that its name came from the [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] word ''Taga Danaw'' meaning \"the lake people\".\n\n[[Libjo, Dinagat Islands|Libjo]] was created into a municipality and named ''Albor'' on February 29, 1960 under ''Executive Order No. 381''.<ref name=GovPH-EO381>{{cite web|title=Executive Order No. 381; Creating the Municipality of Albor in the Province of Surigao|url=http://www.gov.ph/1960/02/29/executive-order-no-381-s-1960/|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref> It was taken from the municipalities of [[Dinagat, Dinagat Islands|Dinagat]] and [[Loreto, Dinagat Islands|Loreto]]. ''Albor'' came from the surname of the mayors of Loreto and Dinagat \u2014 Alfaro and Borja. It was renamed as ''Libjo'' on June 17, 1967. The name came from the word ''Liboo'', a kind of mussel clam.\n\n[[File:PBMA Founder's Shrine.JPG|thumbnail|left|[[Philippine Benevolent Missionaries Association|Philippine Benevolent Missionaries Association Shrine]] built and maintained by members of the association in memory of [[Ruben Ecleo|Ruben Edera Ecleo Sr.]] the founder of the PBMA, Situated at Aurelio, San Jose.]]\n\nIn 1965, Ruben Edera Ecleo Sr. founded the Philippine Benevolent Missionaries Association (PBMA) at Sitio Puyange, now Poblacion in San Jose. PBMA is a non-sectarian organization bounded by a strong spirit of brotherhood. Not long after that, members from all over the Philippines migrated to the island to be in constant association with their founder.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nMeanwhile, [[Basilisa, Dinagat Islands|Basilisa]] became a municipality on June 17, 1967 under ''[[Republic Act]] No. 4986''. It was then named as ''Rizal'', after the country's [[Jose Rizal|national hero]].<ref name=ChanRobles-RA4986>{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 4986 - An Act Creating the Municipality of Rizal in the Province of Surigao del Norte|url=http://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/50_republicacts.php?id=4990|website=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref> The municipality was renamed as Basilisa on June 21, 1969 under ''Republic Act.

According to local folklore, during the Spanish regime, a ''banca'' boarded with ''Guardia Civil''s landed in the shores of Tubajon in search of a criminal. One of them came across a river and saw a man pounding leaves. Curious, he asked the man, \"What will you do with it?\" The man answered \"Akong Tubajon ang suba aron sayon dakpon ang mga isda\" (I will poison the river with Tuba leaves so that the fishes could be easily caught). When the man returned to the group, he narrated everything he saw and heard from the native to his companions. From then on, the place was called ''Tubajon''.\n\nThe newest municipality is [[San Jose, Dinagat Islands|San Jose]], created on November 15, 1989, under ''Republic Act No. 6769''.<ref name=LawPhilNet-RA6769>{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 6769; An Act Creating the Municipality of San Jose in the Province of Surigao del Norte|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1989/ra_6769_1989.html|website=The LawPhil Project|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref> The town was named in honor of Jose Ecleo who was its pioneer and father of then mayor of the municipality of Dinagat, Ruben Edera Ecleo Sr. The town is the seat of the PBMA.\n\nThe Dinagat Islands was part of the First District of Surigao del Norte Province until it became a province on December 2, 2006, with the approval of ''Republic Act No. 9355'' (authored by Rep.

Residents of the Dinagat Islands are called \"Dinagatnon\". The Dinagat Islands is predominantly a [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]-speaking province. However, towns facing the Surigao del Norte are [[Surigaonon language|Surigaonon]]-speaking, particularly the municipalities of Dinagat and Cagdianao due to their proximity to the province of Surigao del Norte. Influences of the Cebuano and [[Boholano dialect|Boholano]] languages with a [[Tausug language|Tausug]] accent can be traced. A majority speak [[Philippine English|English]].\n\n===Religion===\nReligious breakdown in the province shows [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholicism]] at majority with 53% adherence while [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]] or Aglipayan is the significant minority religion at 23%. Other minority religions are the [[Church_Body_of_Christ-_Filipinista]]s (12%), [[United Church of Christ in the Philippines]] (4%), [[Iglesia Ni Cristo]] (3%) and other smaller Christian groups (Dinagat Island Socio Economic Factbook, 2007).{{Full citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nRecent cultural, religious and socioeconomic changes of the province have allowed the rebound of Roman Catholics (and Aglipayans in some degree) and their numbers have constantly increased; the province had experienced a Catholic decline in several decades (1970s-early 2000s) due to immigration of the members of Philippine Benevolent Missionaries Association in the 1960s. There were some decades (1990s-2000s) where Roman Catholics became minority with as low as 37% of the population.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nSeveral religious conflicts{{elucidate|date=July 2016}} were recorded in the province. But at present, religious harmony is relatively observed in most parts of Dinagat Island.\n\n==Government==\nThe Governor of the Dinagat Islands is the local chief executive of the province of the Dinagat Islands.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | {{abbr|No.|Number of terms in office}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Took office\n! scope=\"col\" | Left office\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=2 | Party\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1\n| [[Geraldine Ecleo Villaroman|Geraldine B.

Many describe Dinagat Islands as a hidden gem of the [[Caraga Region|Caraga Region XIII]]. The Islands are enriched with great bio-diversity, abundant natural wonders and rich resources. Dinagat Islands has a multitude of fascinating white sandy beaches with arrays of colossal rock formations. These sites and attractions are as diverse as the topography of the islands and islets.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe province is known for its caves, resorts, and beaches. These include Bitaug Beach, Campintac Black Beach No. 2, Linao Spring Resort, and San Juan Cave (all in Loreto), Lake Bababu, Puerto Prinsesa Beach & Hagakhak Cave in Basilisa, Tagberayan Beach, Sayaw Beach, Legaspi Water Falls, Hinabyan and Leandro's Beach Resort in Cagdianao, Talisay Beach in Tubajon, Quano Blue Lagoon and Quano Cave, Ben Paz Mountain Resort and Oasis Islet Resort in Libjo, and the Cab-ilan Beach & Cab-ilan Gamay Beach in Dinagat.\n\n==Environment and wildlife==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nThe Dinagat Islands is one of the most environmentally-significant provinces in the Philippines, where [[endemism]] of fauna is unique in its region. Animals that are endemic to the province include the critically endangered [[Dinagat bushy-tailed cloud rat]] which was recently rediscovered after decades of disappearance, the endangered [[Dinagat hairy-tailed rat]], [[Dinagat Gymnure]] which has been declared by the EDGE Species Programme of the [[Zoological Society of London]] as one of the top 100 most evolutionary distinct and globally endangered species in the world, and a strange sub-species of the [[Philippine Tarsier]] which is unusually larger and darker in color than the common Philippine tarsier. The province is highly forested and is considered as a Key Biodiversity Area by [[Haribon Foundation]] and the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources]] of the Philippines because of its unique fauna and flora, along with its lush rainforest which are classified as primary forests, or forests which have never been fully obliterated since pre-colonial times.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{GeoGroup}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n* {{OSM relation|1507007}}\n* [http://www.senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%209355.pdf Charter of the Province of Dinagat Islands (Republic Act No. 9355)]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre = Dinagat Islands\n| North  = [[Eastern Samar]]<br />''[[Leyte Gulf]]''\n| East   = ''[[Philippine Sea]]''\n| South  = ''Hiniyuan Passage''<br />[[Surigao del Norte]]\n| West   = [[Southern Leyte]] / ''[[Surigao Strait]]''\n}}\n\n{{Dinagat Islands|state=expanded}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Articles related to Dinagat Islands\n|list1 =\n{{Caraga}}\n{{Philippines political divisions}}\n{{Philippines topics}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dinagat Islands| ]]\n[[Category:Provinces of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Archipelagoes of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Archipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean]]\n[[Category:Islands of Mindanao]]\n[[Category:Island provinces of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 2006]]\n[[Category:2006 establishments in the Philippines]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the province|the municipality|Dinagat, Dinagat Islands|the primary/main island of the province|Dinagat Island}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                            = Dinagat Islands\n| official_name                   = Province of Dinagat Islands<ref name=SenateGovPH-RA9355 />\n| native_name                     = \n| settlement_type                 = {{PH wikidata|settlement_type}}\n| image_skyline                   = [[File:Dinagat Islands Provincial Capitol.jpg|250px]]\n| image_caption                   = Provincial capitol\n| image_flag                      = PH-DIN Flag.png\n| image_seal                      = Ph seal dinagat islands.png\n| seal_size                       = 100x80px\n| image_map                       = {{PH wikidata|image_map}}\n| map_caption                     = Location in the Philippines\n| coordinates                     = {{PH wikidata|coordinates}}\n| subdivision_type                = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name                = {{PH wikidata|country}}\n| subdivision_type1               = [[Regions of the Philippines|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1               = {{PH wikidata|region}}\n| established_title               = Founded\n| established_date                = {{PH wikidata|founded}}\n| seat_type                       = Capital\n| seat                            = [[San Jose, Dinagat Islands|San Jose]]\n| government_type                 = {{PH wikidata|government_type}}\n| leader_title                    = [[Governor]]\n| leader_name                     = [[Kaka Bag-ao|Arlene \"Kaka\" J.

The island of [[Leyte]] is to its west, across [[Surigao Strait]], and [[Mindanao]] is to its south. Its main island, [[Dinagat Island|Dinagat]], is about {{convert|60|km}} from north to south. Declared a province in 2006, the Dinagat Islands comprise the second newest province of the Philippines, with [[Davao Occidental]] (2013) being the newest.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Surigao province map 1918.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Surigao (province)|Surigao province]] map in 1918|alt=An old map showing the current territories of the province as part of the historical province of Surigao]]\n\nThe province is known as one of the archipelago's holiest sites in the Pre-Christian native religion. It is here where the God of Hurricanes was persuaded to relent his attacks on the islands by Da, the God of Peace. The province in pre-colonial times was much influenced by the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] which was nestled in present-day Agusan del Norte. It was also used as the entry point of the Rahajnate of Ternate, present-day Moluccas of Indonesia, to attack the Rajahnate of Butuan, Rajahnate of Cebu, the indigenous settlements in the Anda Peninsula of Bohol, and the Kingdom of Dapitan (located 'between Panglao and Bohol), which later moved in northern Zamboanga after the Kingdom of Dapitan was destroyed.\n\nAlthough one of the newest provinces of the country, settlements in the Dinagat Islands were already present during the Spanish regime as a result of migration of people from nearby provinces of Bohol and Leyte. The so-called mystical province played an important role in the country's history, particularly during World War II.\n\nThe municipality of [[Dinagat, Dinagat Islands|Dinagat]] is the oldest community in the province. In the early days, a story was told that a stranger reached the place in search of greener pastures. He approached a native and asked what the inhabitants do for a living. The natives said that they farm and fish to live. The stranger's interest in fishing prompted him to inquire where they fish, and the native replied and pointed to a place saying ''dinhi niini na dagat'' (here from this bountiful waters). Since then, the place was called \"Dinagat\".\n\nThe municipality was formally established in 1855. It occupies the territorial boundaries of the whole island. From 1890 to 1990 its boundaries were gradually reduced giving rise to six municipalities, [[Loreto, Dinagat Islands|Loreto]], [[Cagdianao, Dinagat Islands|Cagdianao]], [[Libjo, Dinagat Islands|Libjo]], [[Basilisa, Dinagat Islands|Basilisa]], [[Tubajon, Dinagat Islands|Tubajon]] and [[San Jose, Dinagat Islands|San Jose]].\n\n[[File:6th Ranger Battalion, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers of the 6th Ranger Battalion move through a village on Dinagat Island, 18 October 1944.]]\n\nLoreto became a Spanish ''[[pueblo]]'' on September 4, 1890 under the supervision of Governor General Manuel Sanchez by the virtue of ''Direccion General No. 30''. It was originally called ''Mabua'' due to the ever-foaming river that runs right into the center of the community. It was named ''Loreto'' in 1881 by the Spanish priest who frequents the town, in honor of the wife of the ''Alcalde Mayor'' of the Province of Surigao.\n\nThe province was the site of the historic [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] during the Second World War. The Municipality of Loreto became the entry point of the American Liberation Forces on October 17, 1944. It was on this shore that the 6th Ranger Battalion of the 6th U.S. Army under Col.

There were some decades (1990s-2000s) where Roman Catholics became minority with as low as 37% of the population.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nSeveral religious conflicts{{elucidate|date=July 2016}} were recorded in the province.

Dinagat Islands has a multitude of fascinating white sandy beaches with arrays of colossal rock formations. These sites and attractions are as diverse as the topography of the islands and islets.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe province is known for its caves, resorts, and beaches. These include Bitaug Beach, Campintac Black Beach No. 2, Linao Spring Resort, and San Juan Cave (all in Loreto), Lake Bababu, Puerto Prinsesa Beach & Hagakhak Cave in Basilisa, Tagberayan Beach, Sayaw Beach, Legaspi Water Falls, Hinabyan and Leandro's Beach Resort in Cagdianao, Talisay Beach in Tubajon, Quano Blue Lagoon and Quano Cave, Ben Paz Mountain Resort and Oasis Islet Resort in Libjo, and the Cab-ilan Beach & Cab-ilan Gamay Beach in Dinagat.\n\n==Environment and wildlife==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nThe Dinagat Islands is one of the most environmentally-significant provinces in the Philippines, where [[endemism]] of fauna is unique in its region. Animals that are endemic to the province include the critically endangered [[Dinagat bushy-tailed cloud rat]] which was recently rediscovered after decades of disappearance, the endangered [[Dinagat hairy-tailed rat]], [[Dinagat Gymnure]] which has been declared by the EDGE Species Programme of the [[Zoological Society of London]] as one of the top 100 most evolutionary distinct and globally endangered species in the world, and a strange sub-species of the [[Philippine Tarsier]] which is unusually larger and darker in color than the common Philippine tarsier. The province is highly forested and is considered as a Key Biodiversity Area by [[Haribon Foundation]] and the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources]] of the Philippines because of its unique fauna and flora, along with its lush rainforest which are classified as primary forests, or forests which have never been fully obliterated since pre-colonial times.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{GeoGroup}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n* {{OSM relation|1507007}}\n* [http://www.senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%209355.pdf Charter of the Province of Dinagat Islands (Republic Act No. 9355)]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre = Dinagat Islands\n| North  = [[Eastern Samar]]<br />''[[Leyte Gulf]]''\n| East   = ''[[Philippine Sea]]''\n| South  = ''Hiniyuan Passage''<br />[[Surigao del Norte]]\n| West   = [[Southern Leyte]] / ''[[Surigao Strait]]''\n}}\n\n{{Dinagat Islands|state=expanded}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Articles related to Dinagat Islands\n|list1 =\n{{Caraga}}\n{{Philippines political divisions}}\n{{Philippines topics}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dinagat Islands| ]]\n[[Category:Provinces of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Archipelagoes of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Archipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean]]\n[[Category:Islands of Mindanao]]\n[[Category:Island provinces of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 2006]]\n[[Category:2006 establishments in the Philippines]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGeography:Typo fixing, replaced: point point \u2192 point", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinagat_Islands"}

There is not only discrimination for being a female scientist but also for being young. My merit and the value of my work were questioned several times because I am a young woman scientist.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTo see more young women in the conservation field, Barboza Marquez suggests that schools and universities \u201ccreate spaces for young girls to engage in conversations with women in the field.\u201d For girls interested in pursuing careers as conservationists, Barboza Marquez advises studying biology at university. In the fall of 2019, fires ravaged over 4.2 million acres of land in Bolivia, including the [[Chiquitano dry forests|Chiquitano]] forest, a unique ecoregion where Barboza Marquez worked for six years. From her current home in [[La Paz]], Barboza Marquez worked to assist the devastated lands, which included educating the public about the fires and their effects on Bolivian nature and wildlife. \u201cWe are gathering information so we can publish as much as possible about the problem and make people aware so we can unite in the efforts to save what\u2019s left,\u201d she shares. Barboza Marquez knows that there\u2019s a lot of work ahead in the fight to protect Bolivia\u2019s biodiversity and bats, but through her research and advocacy, she is making progress every day for the country\u2019s natural habitats and mammals, particularly her two-taloned friends. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNow with over a decade of experience under her belt, Barboza Marquez has taught bat bioacoustic courses across [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Peru]], [[Spain]] and [[Uruguay]]. She currently works as an associate investigator of [[mammalogy]], the study of mammals, at the Natural History Museum Alcide d\u2019Orbigny. She also teaches courses on fieldwork, flora and fauna inventories and biodiversity at the environmental education startup, Natural Zone. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn addition to biology, Barboza Marquez enjoys the practice of [[pilates]], to which she dedicates between four and seven hours a day. That activity that started accidentally, but has become another of her passions. She is currently an instructor and board member of Mundo Pilates, a center specialized in that technique in Cochabamba. \u201cI learned about Pilates because of an injury that I had in my back due to an accident that I suffered on one of my trips. I liked it, I was cured and began to become aware of the importance of good posture. It helps me clear my mind,\u201d she says. She also confesses his interest in baking and on her days off her greatest entertainment is watching a good movie at home. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Accomplishments==\nBarboza Marquez won a grant in 2007 from the [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]] to conduct research at [[Barro Colorado Island]] in Panama.<ref name=\"Los Tiempos\" /> Her project focused on the forest and island borders' effects on the habitat of the island bat population.<ref name=\"Smithsonian news\">{{cite journal|date=15 February 2008|title=Arrivals|url=http://www.stri.si.edu/sites/strinews/PDFs/February_15_2008.pdf|journal=STRI News|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref>  \n\nUpon completion of her work in Panama, Barboza Marquez won the 2009 National Georgraphic, Young Explorer Scholarship Grant. She used the scholarship funds to conduct research on the acoustics of bats in the [[Beni Savanna]] of northern Bolivia. She created one of the first libraries of [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] frequencies for insectivorous bats in Bolivia.<ref name=\"Pagina Siete\" /> \"Bats have taken me to many countries that I never expected to know. For me the most important thing in life is to be in touch with nature. Listening to them is an indescribable emotion, it is about making something that nobody can hear audible,\" concludes the biologist. <ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, she and other scientists conducted a study of [[ectoparasites]] on the bat population of the savanna. No comprehensive study had ever been conducted on parasitism of bat colonies. The scientists used mist nets to capture and release their study subjects over a five-month period at the Spirit Wildlife Refuge. As a result, they have cataloged more than 20 morphotypes of mites and ticks and studies are on-going to identify the remaining samples.<ref name=\"Bat Program of Bolivia\">{{cite web|url=http://murcielagosdebolivia.com/bienvenidos/page/15|title=Ectopar\u00e1sitos de los murci\u00e9lagos de Bolivia|date=15 June 2011|publisher=Programa para la Conservaci\u00f3n de los Murci\u00e9lagos de Bolivia|location=La Paz, Bolivia|language=Spanish|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> \n\nIn 2012, she was awarded one of the [[L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO For Women in Science Awards|L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO]] Fellowships for Women in Science and became the first Bolivian to win the award.<ref name=\"L'Oreal Prize\">{{cite news|url=http://lapatriaenlinea.com/?nota=102486|title=Joven cient\u00edfica boliviana gana una de las becas Unesco-L\u2019Oreal|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=31 October 2015|publisher=La Patria|location=La Paz, Bolivia|language=Spanish}}</ref>  \u201cI remember crying with happiness and pride for being able to represent Bolivia at an event of that magnitude because we know that science in Latin America is not valued.

The manner of the call, frequency, duration and pulse-intervals are recorded to determine whether bats are communicating or are searching for food. The recordings also help to determine which species live in certain areas.<ref name=\"Pagina Siete\" />  \n\nIn 2013, she was named as one of the ten leading women scientists of Latin America by the [[BBC]].<ref name=\"BBC\" /> \n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barboza Marquez, Kathrin}}\n[[Category:1983 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Bolivian biologists]]\n[[Category:21st-century women scientists]]\n[[Category:L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science fellows]]\n[[Category:Bolivian women scientists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Bolivian biologist|bot=PearBOT 5}}\n{{Spanish name|Barboza|Marquez}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name         = Kathrin Barboza Marquez\n| image        = \n| image_size   = \n| caption      = \n| birth_name   = \n| birth_date   = {{birth year and age|1983}}\n| birth_place  = [[Cochabamba, Bolivia]]\n| nationality  = \n| occupation   = Biologist\n| years_active = 2002\u2013\n| known_for    = Rediscovering the Bolivian Sword-nosed Bat\n}}\n'''Kathrin Barboza Marquez''' (born 1983) is a [[Bolivian people|Bolivian]] biologist who is an expert in [[bat]] research.

From her current home in [[La Paz]], Barboza Marquez worked to assist the devastated lands, which included educating the public about the fires and their effects on Bolivian nature and wildlife. \u201cWe are gathering information so we can publish as much as possible about the problem and make people aware so we can unite in the efforts to save what\u2019s left,\u201d she shares. Barboza Marquez knows that there\u2019s a lot of work ahead in the fight to protect Bolivia\u2019s biodiversity and bats, but through her research and advocacy, she is making progress every day for the country\u2019s natural habitats and mammals, particularly her two-taloned friends. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNow with over a decade of experience under her belt, Barboza Marquez has taught bat bioacoustic courses across [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Peru]], [[Spain]] and [[Uruguay]]. She currently works as an associate investigator of [[mammalogy]], the study of mammals, at the Natural History Museum Alcide d\u2019Orbigny. She also teaches courses on fieldwork, flora and fauna inventories and biodiversity at the environmental education startup, Natural Zone. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn addition to biology, Barboza Marquez enjoys the practice of [[pilates]], to which she dedicates between four and seven hours a day. That activity that started accidentally, but has become another of her passions. She is currently an instructor and board member of Mundo Pilates, a center specialized in that technique in Cochabamba. \u201cI learned about Pilates because of an injury that I had in my back due to an accident that I suffered on one of my trips. I liked it, I was cured and began to become aware of the importance of good posture. It helps me clear my mind,\u201d she says. She also confesses his interest in baking and on her days off her greatest entertainment is watching a good movie at home. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Accomplishments==\nBarboza Marquez won a grant in 2007 from the [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]] to conduct research at [[Barro Colorado Island]] in Panama.<ref name=\"Los Tiempos\" /> Her project focused on the forest and island borders' effects on the habitat of the island bat population.<ref name=\"Smithsonian news\">{{cite journal|date=15 February 2008|title=Arrivals|url=http://www.stri.si.edu/sites/strinews/PDFs/February_15_2008.pdf|journal=STRI News|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref>  \n\nUpon completion of her work in Panama, Barboza Marquez won the 2009 National Georgraphic, Young Explorer Scholarship Grant. She used the scholarship funds to conduct research on the acoustics of bats in the [[Beni Savanna]] of northern Bolivia. She created one of the first libraries of [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] frequencies for insectivorous bats in Bolivia.<ref name=\"Pagina Siete\" /> \"Bats have taken me to many countries that I never expected to know. For me the most important thing in life is to be in touch with nature. Listening to them is an indescribable emotion, it is about making something that nobody can hear audible,\" concludes the biologist. <ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, she and other scientists conducted a study of [[ectoparasites]] on the bat population of the savanna. No comprehensive study had ever been conducted on parasitism of bat colonies. The scientists used mist nets to capture and release their study subjects over a five-month period at the Spirit Wildlife Refuge. As a result, they have cataloged more than 20 morphotypes of mites and ticks and studies are on-going to identify the remaining samples.<ref name=\"Bat Program of Bolivia\">{{cite web|url=http://murcielagosdebolivia.com/bienvenidos/page/15|title=Ectopar\u00e1sitos de los murci\u00e9lagos de Bolivia|date=15 June 2011|publisher=Programa para la Conservaci\u00f3n de los Murci\u00e9lagos de Bolivia|location=La Paz, Bolivia|language=Spanish|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> \n\nIn 2012, she was awarded one of the [[L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO For Women in Science Awards|L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO]] Fellowships for Women in Science and became the first Bolivian to win the award.<ref name=\"L'Oreal Prize\">{{cite news|url=http://lapatriaenlinea.com/?nota=102486|title=Joven cient\u00edfica boliviana gana una de las becas Unesco-L\u2019Oreal|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=31 October 2015|publisher=La Patria|location=La Paz, Bolivia|language=Spanish}}</ref>  \u201cI remember crying with happiness and pride for being able to represent Bolivia at an event of that magnitude because we know that science in Latin America is not valued. So, for me, this reinforced how important it was to champion girls and women in science back in my country and in Latin America.\u201d <ref name=\":0\" /> She used her award to further her study of the ultrasound spectrum of bats, which is not within the human hearing range. The manner of the call, frequency, duration and pulse-intervals are recorded to determine whether bats are communicating or are searching for food. The recordings also help to determine which species live in certain areas.<ref name=\"Pagina Siete\" />  \n\nIn 2013, she was named as one of the ten leading women scientists of Latin America by the [[BBC]].<ref name=\"BBC\" /> \n\n<br />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barboza Marquez, Kathrin}}\n[[Category:1983 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Bolivian biologists]]\n[[Category:21st-century women scientists]]\n[[Category:L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science fellows]]\n[[Category:Bolivian women scientists]]\n", "name_user": "Kj cheetham", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathrin_Barboza_Marquez"}
