[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Altered States''''' is a 1980 American [[Science fiction film|science-fiction]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Ken Russell]] based on the novel of the same name by playwright and screenwriter [[Paddy Chayefsky]]. The film was adapted from Chayefsky's only novel and is his final screenplay. Both the novel and the film are based in part on [[John C. Lilly]]'s [[sensory deprivation]] research conducted in [[isolation tank]]s under the influence of [[psychoactive drugs]] like [[mescaline]], [[ketamine]], and [[LSD]].\n\nIt marked the film debut of [[William Hurt]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. Chayefsky withdrew from the project after disputes with Russell and took his name off the credits, substituting \"Sidney Aaron,\" his actual first and middle names.\n\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[John Corigliano]] (with [[Christopher Keene]] conducting). The film was nominated for the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].\n\n==Plot==\nEdward Jessup is a [[psychopathologist]] who, while studying [[schizophrenia]], begins to think that \"our [[Altered state of consciousness|other states of consciousness]] are as real as our waking states.\" Edward begins experimenting with [[sensory deprivation]] using a [[flotation tank]], aided by two like-minded researchers, Arthur Rosenberg and Mason Parrish. At a faculty party, he meets fellow \"whiz kid\" and [[biological anthropologist]] Emily, and the two eventually marry.\n\nSeven years later, Edward and Emily have two daughters, are on the brink of divorce, and reunite with the couple who first introduced them. When Edward hears of a Mexican tribe that experiences shared illusion states, he travels to Mexico to participate in what is apparently an [[Ayahuasca]] Ceremony. During the walk into the bush, his guide says that the indigenous tribe they are meeting works with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', which they are collecting for next year's ceremonies. The tribe calls one of the ingredients of the mixture they use \"First Flower.\"  An indigenous elder is seen with ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'' root in his hand before cutting Edward's hand, adding blood to the mixture he is preparing. Immediately after consuming the mixture, Edward experiences bizarre, intense hallucinations. He returns to the U.S. with a [[tincture]] and continues taking it to trigger altered states of consciousness.\n\nWhen toxic concentrations of the substance make increased dosage dangerous, Edward returns to sensory deprivation, believing it will enhance the effects of the substance at his current dose. Repairing a disused tank in a medical school, Edward uses it to experience a series of increasingly drastic visions, including one of early [[Hominidae]]. Monitored by his colleagues, Edward insists that his visions have \"externalized\". Emerging from the tank, his mouth bloody, frantically writing notes because he is unable to speak, Edward insists on being X-rayed before he \"reconstitutes.\" A radiologist inspecting the X-rays says they belong to a gorilla.\n\nIn later experiments, Edward experiences actual, physical [[biological devolution]]. At one stage he emerges from the isolation tank as a feral and curiously small-statured, light-skinned [[Human evolution|caveman]], going on a rampage through some streets in town before returning to his natural form. Despite his colleagues' concern, Edward stubbornly continues.\n\nIn the final experiment, Edward experiences a more profound regression, transforming into an amorphous mass of conscious, primordial matter. An energy wave released from the experiment stuns Edward's colleagues and destroys his tank. Emily arrives to find a swirling maelstrom where the tank had been. She searches the vortex for Edward, finding him as he is on the brink of becoming a non-physical form of proto-consciousness and possibly disappearing from our version of reality altogether.\n\nHis friends bring Edward home, hoping that the transformations will end. Watched over by Emily, Edward begins to uncontrollably regress again, the transformations no longer requiring the intake of \"first flower\" or sensory deprivation. Urging Edward to fight the change, Emily grabs his hand, immediately being enveloped by the primordial energy emanating from Edward. The sight of his wife apparently being consumed by the energy stirs the human consciousness in Edward's devolving form. He fights the transformation and returns to his human form.

They were feeling \"disgruntled\" and as a joke conceived a movie they could make together. They wanted to pitch something to [[Dino De Laurentiis]], who was making ''King Kong''.

Chayefsky reportedly tried to have Russell removed as director, but by then the film was already well under way, and the studio already had replaced one director (Penn).\n\nRussell said Chayefsky \"didn't like the color of the paint on the isolation tank. Then it went on to other things. He didn't like the lighting, then he didn't like the machinery, then he thought I was making the actors appear drunk in a scene where they were written to be slightly tipsy in a bar...

The direction, without being mocking or campy, treats outlandish material so matter-of-factly that it often has a facetious ring. The screenplay, on the other hand, cries out to be taken seriously, as it addresses, with no particular sagacity, the death of God and the [[origin of man|origins of man]].\n\nFilm critic [[Richard Corliss]] attributed Chayefsky's disavowal of the film to distress over \"the intensity of the performances and the headlong pace at which the actors read his dialogue.\"<ref name=\"time\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922287-1,00.html Invasion of the Mind Snatcher], a December 1980 review by [[Richard Corliss]] in [[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref>\n\n\"Paddy's hallucinations were impossible to film,\" said Russell later. \"He'd write a direction, something like Interstellar gas shot through 5 million miles of universe like a puff of cigarette smoke.'

If it is not wholly visionary at every juncture, it is at least dependably\u2014even exhilaratingly\u2014bizarre. Its strangeness, which borders cheerfully on the ridiculous, is its most enjoyable feature.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/> She also called it \"in fine shape as long as it revels in its own craziness, making no claims on the viewer's reason. But when it asks you to believe that what you're watching may really be happening, and to wonder what it means, it is asking far too much. By the time it begins straining for an ending both happy and hysterical, it has lost all of its mystery, and most of its magic.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nRichard Corliss began his review of the film thus:<ref name=\"time\"/>\n:This one has everything: sex, violence, comedy, thrills, tenderness. It's an anthology and apotheosis of American pop movies: ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''. It opens at fever pitch and then starts soaring\u2014into genetic fantasy, into a precognitive dream of delirium and delight. Madness is its subject and substance, style and spirit. The film changes tone, even form, with its hero's every new mood and mutation. It expands and contracts with his mind until both almost crack. It keeps threatening to go bonkers, then makes good on its threat, and still remains as lucid as an aerialist on a [[high wire]]. It moves with the loping energy of a crafty psychopath, or of film makers gripped with the potential of blowing the moviegoer's mind out through his eyes and ears. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ''Altered States''.\n\nCorliss calls the film a \"dazzling piece of science fiction\"; he recognizes the film's dialogue as clearly Chayefsky's, with characters that are \"endlessly reflective and articulate, spitting out litanies of adjectives, geysers of abstract nouns, chemical chains of relative clauses\", dialogue that's a \"welcome antidote to all those recent...movies in which brutal characters speak only words of one syllable and four letters.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>  But the film is ultimately Russell's, who inherited a \"cast of unknowns\" chosen by its original director and \"gets an erotic, neurotic charge from the talking-heads scenes that recall [[Arthur Penn|Penn]] at his best.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>\n\nPauline Kael, on the other hand, wrote that the \"grotesquely inspired\" combination of \"Russell, with his show-biz-Catholic glitz mysticism, and Chayefsky, with his show-biz-Jewish ponderousness\" results in an \"aggressively silly picture\" that \"isn't really enjoyable.\"<ref name=Kael>{{cite book|last=Kael|first=Pauline|title=Taking It All In|url=https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich|url-access=registration|year=1984|publisher=Holt, Rinhart and Winstone|location=New York|isbn=0-03-069361-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich/page/127 127\u2013132]}}</ref>\n\n[[John C. Lilly]] liked the film, and noted the following in an ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine interview published in January 1983:\n:The scene in which the scientist becomes cosmic energy and his wife grabs him and brings him back to human form is straight out of my ''Dyadic Cyclone'' (1976)...As for the scientist's regression into an ape-like being, the late Dr. Craig Enright, who started me on K (ketamine) while taking a trip with me here by the isolation tank, suddenly \"became\" a chimp, jumping up and down and hollering for twenty-five minutes. Watching him, I was frightened. I asked him later, \"Where the hell were you?\" He said, \"I became a pre-hominid, and I was in a tree. A leopard was trying to get me. So I was trying to scare him away.\"  The manuscript of ''The Scientist'' (1978) was in the hands of Bantam, the publishers. The head of Bantam called and said, \"Paddy Chayefsky would like to read your manuscript. Will you give him your permission?\" I said, \"Only if he calls me and asks permission.\" He didn't call.

The film was adapted from Chayefsky's only novel and is his final screenplay. Both the novel and the film are based in part on [[John C. Lilly]]'s [[sensory deprivation]] research conducted in [[isolation tank]]s under the influence of [[psychoactive drugs]] like [[mescaline]], [[ketamine]], and [[LSD]].\n\nIt marked the film debut of [[William Hurt]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. Chayefsky withdrew from the project after disputes with Russell and took his name off the credits, substituting \"Sidney Aaron,\" his actual first and middle names.\n\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[John Corigliano]] (with [[Christopher Keene]] conducting). The film was nominated for the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].\n\n==Plot==\nEdward Jessup is a [[psychopathologist]] who, while studying [[schizophrenia]], begins to think that \"our [[Altered state of consciousness|other states of consciousness]] are as real as our waking states.\" Edward begins experimenting with [[sensory deprivation]] using a [[flotation tank]], aided by two like-minded researchers, Arthur Rosenberg and Mason Parrish. At a faculty party, he meets fellow \"whiz kid\" and [[biological anthropologist]] Emily, and the two eventually marry.\n\nSeven years later, Edward and Emily have two daughters, are on the brink of divorce, and reunite with the couple who first introduced them. When Edward hears of a Mexican tribe that experiences shared illusion states, he travels to Mexico to participate in what is apparently an [[Ayahuasca]] Ceremony. During the walk into the bush, his guide says that the indigenous tribe they are meeting works with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', which they are collecting for next year's ceremonies. The tribe calls one of the ingredients of the mixture they use \"First Flower.\"  An indigenous elder is seen with ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'' root in his hand before cutting Edward's hand, adding blood to the mixture he is preparing. Immediately after consuming the mixture, Edward experiences bizarre, intense hallucinations. He returns to the U.S. with a [[tincture]] and continues taking it to trigger altered states of consciousness.\n\nWhen toxic concentrations of the substance make increased dosage dangerous, Edward returns to sensory deprivation, believing it will enhance the effects of the substance at his current dose. Repairing a disused tank in a medical school, Edward uses it to experience a series of increasingly drastic visions, including one of early [[Hominidae]]. Monitored by his colleagues, Edward insists that his visions have \"externalized\". Emerging from the tank, his mouth bloody, frantically writing notes because he is unable to speak, Edward insists on being X-rayed before he \"reconstitutes.\" A radiologist inspecting the X-rays says they belong to a gorilla.\n\nIn later experiments, Edward experiences actual, physical [[biological devolution]]. At one stage he emerges from the isolation tank as a feral and curiously small-statured, light-skinned [[Human evolution|caveman]], going on a rampage through some streets in town before returning to his natural form. Despite his colleagues' concern, Edward stubbornly continues.\n\nIn the final experiment, Edward experiences a more profound regression, transforming into an amorphous mass of conscious, primordial matter. An energy wave released from the experiment stuns Edward's colleagues and destroys his tank. Emily arrives to find a swirling maelstrom where the tank had been. She searches the vortex for Edward, finding him as he is on the brink of becoming a non-physical form of proto-consciousness and possibly disappearing from our version of reality altogether.\n\nHis friends bring Edward home, hoping that the transformations will end. Watched over by Emily, Edward begins to uncontrollably regress again, the transformations no longer requiring the intake of \"first flower\" or sensory deprivation. Urging Edward to fight the change, Emily grabs his hand, immediately being enveloped by the primordial energy emanating from Edward. The sight of his wife apparently being consumed by the energy stirs the human consciousness in Edward's devolving form. He fights the transformation and returns to his human form. In the final scene, Edward embraces Emily, and she returns to normal.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[William Hurt]] as Dr. Edward \"Eddie\" Jessup\n* [[Blair Brown]] as Emily Jessup\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Arthur Rosenberg\n* [[Charles Haid]] as Mason Parrish\n* [[Thaao Penghlis]] as Eduardo Echeverria\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Margaret Jessup\n* Megan Jeffers as Grace Jessup\n* [[Dori Brenner]] as Sylvia Rosenberg\n* Peter Brandon as Alan Hobart\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Dr. Wissenschaft\n* [[Jack Murdock (actor)|Jack Murdock]] as Hector Orteco\n* [[John Larroquette]] as X-ray technician\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film had its origins with a meeting Paddy Chayefsky had with his friends [[Bob Fosse]] and [[Herb Gardner]] at the Russian Tea Room in 1975.

Chayefsky reportedly tried to have Russell removed as director, but by then the film was already well under way, and the studio already had replaced one director (Penn).\n\nRussell said Chayefsky \"didn't like the color of the paint on the isolation tank. Then it went on to other things. He didn't like the lighting, then he didn't like the machinery, then he thought I was making the actors appear drunk in a scene where they were written to be slightly tipsy in a bar... There was a lot of embarrassing dialogue, and there was a hell of a lot more in the original script than there is now; it was a verbose script.\"<ref name=\"jay\">'Mad doctor' Russell creates a monster hit.

The direction, without being mocking or campy, treats outlandish material so matter-of-factly that it often has a facetious ring. The screenplay, on the other hand, cries out to be taken seriously, as it addresses, with no particular sagacity, the death of God and the [[origin of man|origins of man]].\n\nFilm critic [[Richard Corliss]] attributed Chayefsky's disavowal of the film to distress over \"the intensity of the performances and the headlong pace at which the actors read his dialogue.\"<ref name=\"time\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922287-1,00.html Invasion of the Mind Snatcher], a December 1980 review by [[Richard Corliss]] in [[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref>\n\n\"Paddy's hallucinations were impossible to film,\" said Russell later. \"He'd write a direction, something like Interstellar gas shot through 5 million miles of universe like a puff of cigarette smoke.'

If it is not wholly visionary at every juncture, it is at least dependably\u2014even exhilaratingly\u2014bizarre. Its strangeness, which borders cheerfully on the ridiculous, is its most enjoyable feature.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/> She also called it \"in fine shape as long as it revels in its own craziness, making no claims on the viewer's reason. But when it asks you to believe that what you're watching may really be happening, and to wonder what it means, it is asking far too much. By the time it begins straining for an ending both happy and hysterical, it has lost all of its mystery, and most of its magic.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nRichard Corliss began his review of the film thus:<ref name=\"time\"/>\n:This one has everything: sex, violence, comedy, thrills, tenderness. It's an anthology and apotheosis of American pop movies: ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''. It opens at fever pitch and then starts soaring\u2014into genetic fantasy, into a precognitive dream of delirium and delight. Madness is its subject and substance, style and spirit. The film changes tone, even form, with its hero's every new mood and mutation. It expands and contracts with his mind until both almost crack. It keeps threatening to go bonkers, then makes good on its threat, and still remains as lucid as an aerialist on a [[high wire]]. It moves with the loping energy of a crafty psychopath, or of film makers gripped with the potential of blowing the moviegoer's mind out through his eyes and ears. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ''Altered States''.\n\nCorliss calls the film a \"dazzling piece of science fiction\"; he recognizes the film's dialogue as clearly Chayefsky's, with characters that are \"endlessly reflective and articulate, spitting out litanies of adjectives, geysers of abstract nouns, chemical chains of relative clauses\", dialogue that's a \"welcome antidote to all those recent...movies in which brutal characters speak only words of one syllable and four letters.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>  But the film is ultimately Russell's, who inherited a \"cast of unknowns\" chosen by its original director and \"gets an erotic, neurotic charge from the talking-heads scenes that recall [[Arthur Penn|Penn]] at his best.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>\n\nPauline Kael, on the other hand, wrote that the \"grotesquely inspired\" combination of \"Russell, with his show-biz-Catholic glitz mysticism, and Chayefsky, with his show-biz-Jewish ponderousness\" results in an \"aggressively silly picture\" that \"isn't really enjoyable.\"<ref name=Kael>{{cite book|last=Kael|first=Pauline|title=Taking It All In|url=https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich|url-access=registration|year=1984|publisher=Holt, Rinhart and Winstone|location=New York|isbn=0-03-069361-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich/page/127 127\u2013132]}}</ref>\n\n[[John C. Lilly]] liked the film, and noted the following in an ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine interview published in January 1983:\n:The scene in which the scientist becomes cosmic energy and his wife grabs him and brings him back to human form is straight out of my ''Dyadic Cyclone'' (1976)...As for the scientist's regression into an ape-like being, the late Dr. Craig Enright, who started me on K (ketamine) while taking a trip with me here by the isolation tank, suddenly \"became\" a chimp, jumping up and down and hollering for twenty-five minutes. Watching him, I was frightened. I asked him later, \"Where the hell were you?\" He said, \"I became a pre-hominid, and I was in a tree. A leopard was trying to get me. So I was trying to scare him away.\"  The manuscript of ''The Scientist'' (1978) was in the hands of Bantam, the publishers. The head of Bantam called and said, \"Paddy Chayefsky would like to read your manuscript. Will you give him your permission?\" I said, \"Only if he calls me and asks permission.\" He didn't call.

The singer also remarked that \"whilst \u2018''Virus''\u2019 can absolutely be enjoyed as a stand-alone work, it is thematically and conceptually linked with \u2018[[Vector (Haken album)|''Vector'']]\u2019.\nThe band comments<ref>https://www.facebook.com/HakenOfficial/photos/a.102809109743/10158394245824744/?type=3&theater</ref>:\n{{cquote|Prosthetic was the first song we completed during the \u2018Virus\u2019 writing sessions and we always felt it would be the perfect opener for the album. It\u2019s a very guitar heavy track with its roots in 80s [[Thrash metal|thrash]] riffing, but with the unconventional rhythmic twists and turns we often like to explore in Haken.

According to the band's singer, Ross Jennnings, the album is loosely connected to their 2018 release ''[[Vector (Haken album)|Vector]]''<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XMWVUQ93io</ref>. As well as the latter, ''Virus'' was mixed by ex-[[Periphery (band)|Periphery]] bassist Adam \"Nolly\" Getgood and the artwork was created by long-time collaborators Blacklake<ref>https://www.facebook.com/HakenOfficial/photos/a.102809109743/10158394245824744/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARByaP8_YE6yLvyRYrTiwZiRQuKPBKtI425KDFad1Xim4d2ZAIwNA8ZGHC00i5M4dkqDuwW95_Ski56LSM_cByQuWAnIrsRUG6wR7sXAH3_lTnkvRlKbOO9UUT_RI653kHcuSjLaopYq7jhEoj25w2gCbkxzk8ggucpjkicXqAtTquQvB_YMYqTKZ0tgYBTqdSzgwa7gk0-62K3TzpitgpBd_pTHqY_YfoR_6NQ54t-N6tkbLAvGwa7awJVeaPHtlEzI0n_xc_JbpG1NyzZSOjVZEUt_-snrJ90JQRAPUgOELiNuUejbde0Dltw7Kuge2w9xTSHg4xpi_9LkrCQs&__tn__=-R</ref>.\n\nThe first single, \"Prosthetic\" was released on 3 April 2020, along with a music video<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EmbYo65Pbs</ref>.\n\n== Background ==\n\nHaken had been secretly writing the music for ''Virus'' and all the initial ideas were created back when they were writing ''Vector'' at the end of 2017. The album title generated surprise as it was announced amidst the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]], but Jennings said it was just coincidental<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XMWVUQ93io</ref>. The singer also remarked that \"whilst \u2018''Virus''\u2019 can absolutely be enjoyed as a stand-alone work, it is thematically and conceptually linked with \u2018[[Vector (Haken album)|''Vector'']]\u2019.\nThe band comments<ref>https://www.facebook.com/HakenOfficial/photos/a.102809109743/10158394245824744/?type=3&theater</ref>:\n{{cquote|Prosthetic was the first song we completed during the \u2018Virus\u2019 writing sessions and we always felt it would be the perfect opener for the album. It\u2019s a very guitar heavy track with its roots in 80s [[Thrash metal|thrash]] riffing, but with the unconventional rhythmic twists and turns we often like to explore in Haken. We sadly never had a [[Jeff Hanneman]] and [[Robert Fripp]] collaboration, but this song at least draws on inspiration from them both!

The initial popularity of the network was spurred on by Napster's threatened legal demise in early 2001. This growing surge in popularity revealed the limits of the initial protocol's scalability. In early 2001, variations on the protocol (first implemented in [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and [[closed source software|closed source]] clients) allowed an improvement in scalability. Instead of treating every user as client and server, some users were now treated as ''ultrapeers'', routing search requests and responses for users connected to them.\n\nThis allowed the network to grow in popularity. In late 2001, the Gnutella client [[LimeWire]] Basic became free and open source. In February 2002, [[Morpheus (software)|Morpheus]], a commercial file sharing group, abandoned its FastTrack-based peer-to-peer software and released a new client based on the free and open source Gnutella client [[GnucDNA#Gnucleus|Gnucleus]].\n\nThe word ''Gnutella'' today refers not to any one project or piece of software, but to the open protocol used by the various clients.\n\nThe name is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[GNU]]'' and ''[[Nutella]]'', the brand name of an Italian hazelnut flavored spread: supposedly, Frankel and Pepper ate a lot of Nutella working on the original project, and intended to license their finished program under the GNU General Public License. Gnutella is not associated with the [[GNU]] project<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gnutella.html|title=Regarding Gnutella (www.gnu.org)|publisher=}}</ref> or GNU's own peer-to-peer network, [[GNUnet]].\n\nOn October 26, 2010, the popular Gnutella [[client (computing)|client]] [[LimeWire]] was ordered shut down by Judge [[Kimba Wood]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] when she signed a [[Consent Decree]] to which recording industry plaintiffs and LimeWire had agreed. This event was the likely cause of a notable drop<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388627,00.asp |title=Indie Labels Sue LimeWire Over Failed Copyright Deal |author=Chloe Albanesius |date=18 July 2011 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff-Davis |quote=In the wake of the LimeWire shutdown, the percentage of U.S. Internet users who access P2P file-sharing services dropped about 7 percent from [its] all-time high in 2007... |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> in the size of the network, because, while negotiating the [[injunction]], [[LimeWire]] staff had inserted remote-disabling [[Software|code]] into the software. As the injunction came into force, users who had installed affected versions (newer than 5.5.10) were cut off from the [[Peer-to-peer|P2P network]]. Since LimeWire was [[free software]], nothing had prevented the creation of [[Fork (software development)|forks]] that omitted the disabling code, as long as LimeWire trademarks were not used. The shutdown did not affect, for example, [[FrostWire]], a fork of LimeWire created in 2004 that carries neither the remote-disabling code nor [[adware]].\n\nOn November 9, 2010, LimeWire was resurrected by a secret team of developers and named [[LimeWire Pirate Edition]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372412,00.asp |title=Report: LimeWire 'Resurrected' by Secret Dev Team |author=Chloe Albanesius |date=9 November 2010 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff-Davis |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> It was based on LimeWire 5.6 BETA. This version had its server dependencies removed and all the PRO features enabled for free.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:GnutellaQuery.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=A diagram of Gnutella nodes and their connections.|The gnutella search and retrieval protocol]]\nTo envision how Gnutella originally worked, imagine a large circle of users ''(called nodes),'' each of whom has Gnutella client software. On initial startup, the client software must [[Bootstrapping#Computing|bootstrap]] and find at least one other node.  Various methods have been used for this, including a pre-existing address list of possibly working nodes shipped with the software, using updated web caches of known nodes (called ''Gnutella Web Caches''), UDP host caches and, rarely, even [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]. Once connected, the client requests a list of working addresses. The client tries to connect to the nodes it was shipped with, as well as nodes it receives from other clients until it reaches a certain quota. It connects to only that many nodes, locally caching the addresses it has not yet tried and discards the addresses it tried that were invalid.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWhen the user wants to do a search, the client sends the request to each actively connected node. In version 0.4 of the protocol, the number of actively connected nodes for a client was quite small (around 5), so each node then forwarded the request to all its actively connected nodes, and they, in turn, forwarded the request, and so on, until the packet reached a predetermined number of ''hops'' from the sender (maximum 7).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nSince version 0.6 (2002<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rfc-gnutella.sourceforge.net/src/rfc-0_6-draft.html|title=Gnutella Protocol Development|website=rfc-gnutella.sourceforge.net|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref>), Gnutella is a composite network made of leaf nodes and ultra nodes (also called ultrapeers). The leaf nodes are connected to a small number of ultrapeers (typically 3) while each ultrapeer is connected to more than 32 other ultrapeers. With this higher [[outdegree]], the maximum number of ''hops'' a query can travel was lowered to 4.\n\nLeaves and ultrapeers use the Query Routing Protocol to exchange a Query Routing Table (QRT), a table of 64 [[Binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|Ki]]-slots and up to 2 [[Binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|Mi]]-slots consisting of hashed keywords. A leaf node sends its QRT to each of the ultrapeers it is connected to, and ultrapeers merge the QRT of all their leaves (downsized to 128 [[binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|Ki]]-slots) plus their own QRT (if they share files) and exchange that with their own neighbors. Query routing is then done by hashing the words of the query and seeing whether all of them match in the QRT. Ultrapeers do that check before forwarding a query to a leaf node, and also before forwarding the query to a peer ultra node provided this is the last hop the query can travel.\n\nIf a search request turns up a result, the node that has the result contacts the searcher. In the classic Gnutella protocol, response messages were sent back along the route the query came through, as the query itself did not contain identifying information of the node. This scheme was later revised, so that search results now are delivered over [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) directly to the node that initiated the search, usually an ultrapeer of the node. Thus, in the current protocol, the queries carry the [[IP address]] and port number of either node. This lowers the amount of traffic routed through the Gnutella network, making it significantly more scalable.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIf the user decides to download the file, they negotiate the [[file transfer]]. If the node which has the requested file is not [[Firewall (computing)|firewalled]], the querying node can connect to it directly. However, if the node is firewalled, stopping the source node from receiving incoming connections, the client wanting to download a file sends it a so-called ''push request'' to the server for the remote client to initiate the connection instead (to ''push'' the file). At first, these push requests were routed along the original chain it used to send the query. This was rather unreliable because routes would often break and routed packets are always subject to flow control. Therefore, so-called ''push proxies'' were introduced. These are usually the ultrapeers of a leaf node and they are announced in search results. The client connects to one of these ''push proxies'' using an HTTP request and the proxy sends a ''push request'' to leaf on behalf of the client. Normally, it is also possible to send a push request over UDP to the push proxy which is more efficient than using TCP. Push proxies have two advantages: First, ultrapeer-leaf connections are more stable than routes which makes push requests much more reliable. Second, it reduces the amount of traffic routed through the Gnutella network.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nFinally, when a user disconnects, the client software saves the list of nodes that it was actively connected to and those collected from pong packets for use the next time it attempts to connect so that it becomes independent from any kind of bootstrap services.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn practice, this method of searching on the Gnutella network was often unreliable. Each node is a regular computer user; as such, they are constantly connecting and disconnecting, so the network is never completely stable. Also, the bandwidth cost of searching on Gnutella grew exponentially to the number of connected users,<ref>[http://www.darkridge.com/~jpr5/doc/gnutella.html Why Gnutella Can't Scale. No, Really.] February 2001.</ref> often saturating connections and rendering slower nodes useless. Therefore, search requests would often be dropped, and most queries reached only a very small part of the network. This observation identified the Gnutella network as an [[Scalability|unscalable]] distributed system, and inspired the development of [[distributed hash table]]s, which are much more scalable but support only exact-match, rather than keyword, search.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nTo address the problems of [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]]s, Gnutella developers implemented a tiered system of ''ultrapeers'' and ''leaves''. Instead of all nodes being considered equal, nodes entering into the network were kept at the 'edge' of the network as a leaf, not responsible for any routing, and nodes which were capable of routing messages were promoted to ultrapeers, which would accept leaf connections and route searches and network maintenance messages. This allowed searches to propagate further through the network, and allowed for numerous alterations in the topology which have improved the efficiency and scalability greatly.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAdditionally, gnutella adopted a number of other techniques to reduce traffic overhead and make searches more efficient. Most notable are Query Routing Protocol (QRP) and Dynamic Querying (DQ). With QRP a search reaches only those clients which are likely to have the files, so rare files searches grow vastly more efficient, and with DQ the search stops as soon as the program has acquired enough search results, which vastly reduces the amount of traffic caused by popular searches. [http://gnufu.net Gnutella For Users] has a vast amount of information about these and other improvements to Gnutella in user-friendly style.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nOne of the benefits of having Gnutella so decentralized is to make it very difficult to shut the network down and to make it a network in which the users are the only ones who can decide which content will be available. Unlike [[Napster]], where the entire network relied on the central server, Gnutella cannot be shut down by shutting down any one node. A decentralized network prevents bad actors from taking control of the contents of the network and/or manipulating data by controlling the central server.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berkes.ca/archive/berkes_gnutella_freenet.pdf |title=Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Network Architecture: Gnutella and Freenet |last=Berkes |first=Jem |publisher=University of Manitoba |date=April 9, 2003 |website=https://www.berkes.ca/ |access-date=October 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808170634/http://www.berkes.ca/archive/berkes_gnutella_freenet.pdf |archive-date=August 8, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Protocol features and extensions ==\nGnutella did once operate on a purely [[query flooding]]-based protocol. The outdated Gnutella version 0.4 [[network protocol]] employs five different packet types, namely<ref>Dye, Mark. McDonald, Rick. Rufi, Antoon W., 'Network Fundamentals', Cisco Networking Academy, Cisco Press, Ch 3. p91</ref>\n\n* ping: discover hosts on network\n* pong: reply to ping\n* query: search for a file\n* query hit: reply to query\n* push: download request for firewalled servants\n\nThese are mainly concerned with searching the Gnutella network. File transfers are handled using [[HTTP]].<ref name=\"Dye, Mark p90\">Dye, Mark. McDonald, Rick. Rufi, Antoon W., 'Network Fundamentals', Cisco Networking Academy, Cisco Press, Ch 3. p90</ref>\n\nThe development of the Gnutella protocol is currently led by the Gnutella Developers Forum (The GDF). Many protocol extensions have been and are being developed by the software vendors and free Gnutella developers of the GDF. These extensions include intelligent query routing, [[SHA-1]] checksums, query hit transmission via [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]], querying via UDP, dynamic queries via [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], file transfers via UDP, [[XML]] metadata, source exchange (also termed ''the download mesh'') and parallel downloading in slices (swarming).<ref name=\"Dye, Mark p90\"/>\n\nThere are efforts to finalize these protocol extensions in the Gnutella 0.6 specification at the Gnutella protocol development website. The Gnutella 0.4 standard, although still being the latest protocol specification since all extensions only exist as proposals so far, is outdated. In fact, it is hard or impossible to connect today with the 0.4 handshakes and according to developers in the GDF, version 0.6 is what new developers should pursue using the [http://gnet-specs.gnufu.net work-in-progress specifications].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe Gnutella protocol remains under development and in spite of attempts to make a clean break with the complexity inherited from the old Gnutella 0.4 and to design a clean new message architecture, it is still one of the most successful file-sharing protocols to date.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n== Software ==\nThe following tables compare general and technical information for a number of applications supporting the Gnutella network.

A sore point with many Gnutella developers is that the ''Gnutella2'' name conveys an upgrade or superiority, which led to a flame war. Other criticism included the use of the Gnutella network to bootstrap G2 peers and poor documentation of the G2 protocol. Additionally, the more frequent search retries of the [[Shareaza]] client, one of the initial G2 clients, could unnecessarily burden the Gnutella network.<ref>[http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=100 Gnutella vs. Gnutella2, Part 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305053853/http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=100 |date=2016-03-05 }} Thomas Mennecke for [[Slyck.com]], February 25, 2003</ref>\n\nBoth protocols have undergone significant changes since the fork in 2002. G2 has advantages and disadvantages compared to Gnutella. An advantage often cited is Gnutella2's hybrid search is more efficient than the original Gnutella's [[query flooding]], which was later replaced by more efficient search methods, starting with Query Routing in 2002, which was proposed in 2001 by Limewire developers.<ref>[http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/~fwitschel/vorlP2P/literatur/search_methods.pdf A comparison of Peer-to-Peer search methods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926110918/http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/~fwitschel/vorlP2P/literatur/search_methods.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }} Dimitrios Tsoumakos, 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~celio/peer2peer/gnutella-related/query-routing-protocol.htm Query Routing for the Gnutella Network proposal] Christopher Rohrs, 2001-12-18</ref><ref>[http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~celio/peer2peer/gnutella-related/query-routing-protocol.htm Query Routing for the Gnutella Network 1.0] Christopher Rohrs, 2002-05-16</ref> An advantage for Gnutella is that its users number in the millions,<ref name=\"population\"/> whereas the G2 network is approximately an order of magnitude smaller.<ref>[http://crawler.trillinux.org/ G2 Network Statistics] Population ~200,000 January 2010.</ref>  It is difficult to compare the protocols in their current form; the individual client choice will probably have as much of an effect to an end user on either network.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bitzi]]\n* [[Gnutella crawler]]\n* [[GNUnet]]\n\n== References ==\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2013}}\n{{Reflist}}\n* Dye, Mark.

The initial popularity of the network was spurred on by Napster's threatened legal demise in early 2001. This growing surge in popularity revealed the limits of the initial protocol's scalability. In early 2001, variations on the protocol (first implemented in [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and [[closed source software|closed source]] clients) allowed an improvement in scalability. Instead of treating every user as client and server, some users were now treated as ''ultrapeers'', routing search requests and responses for users connected to them.\n\nThis allowed the network to grow in popularity. In late 2001, the Gnutella client [[LimeWire]] Basic became free and open source. In February 2002, [[Morpheus (software)|Morpheus]], a commercial file sharing group, abandoned its FastTrack-based peer-to-peer software and released a new client based on the free and open source Gnutella client [[GnucDNA#Gnucleus|Gnucleus]].\n\nThe word ''Gnutella'' today refers not to any one project or piece of software, but to the open protocol used by the various clients.\n\nThe name is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[GNU]]'' and ''[[Nutella]]'', the brand name of an Italian hazelnut flavored spread: supposedly, Frankel and Pepper ate a lot of Nutella working on the original project, and intended to license their finished program under the GNU General Public License. Gnutella is not associated with the [[GNU]] project<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gnutella.html|title=Regarding Gnutella (www.gnu.org)|publisher=}}</ref> or GNU's own peer-to-peer network, [[GNUnet]].\n\nOn October 26, 2010, the popular Gnutella [[client (computing)|client]] [[LimeWire]] was ordered shut down by Judge [[Kimba Wood]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] when she signed a [[Consent Decree]] to which recording industry plaintiffs and LimeWire had agreed. This event was the likely cause of a notable drop<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388627,00.asp |title=Indie Labels Sue LimeWire Over Failed Copyright Deal |author=Chloe Albanesius |date=18 July 2011 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff-Davis |quote=In the wake of the LimeWire shutdown, the percentage of U.S. Internet users who access P2P file-sharing services dropped about 7 percent from [its] all-time high in 2007... |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> in the size of the network, because, while negotiating the [[injunction]], [[LimeWire]] staff had inserted remote-disabling [[Software|code]] into the software. As the injunction came into force, users who had installed affected versions (newer than 5.5.10) were cut off from the [[Peer-to-peer|P2P network]]. Since LimeWire was [[free software]], nothing had prevented the creation of [[Fork (software development)|forks]] that omitted the disabling code, as long as LimeWire trademarks were not used. The shutdown did not affect, for example, [[FrostWire]], a fork of LimeWire created in 2004 that carries neither the remote-disabling code nor [[adware]].\n\nOn November 9, 2010, LimeWire was resurrected by a secret team of developers and named [[LimeWire Pirate Edition]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372412,00.asp |title=Report: LimeWire 'Resurrected' by Secret Dev Team |author=Chloe Albanesius |date=9 November 2010 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff-Davis |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> It was based on LimeWire 5.6 BETA. This version had its server dependencies removed and all the PRO features enabled for free.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:GnutellaQuery.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=A diagram of Gnutella nodes and their connections.|The gnutella search and retrieval protocol]]\nTo envision how Gnutella originally worked, imagine a large circle of users ''(called nodes),'' each of whom has Gnutella client software. On initial startup, the client software must [[Bootstrapping#Computing|bootstrap]] and find at least one other node.  Various methods have been used for this, including a pre-existing address list of possibly working nodes shipped with the software, using updated web caches of known nodes (called ''Gnutella Web Caches''), UDP host caches and, rarely, even [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]. Once connected, the client requests a list of working addresses. The client tries to connect to the nodes it was shipped with, as well as nodes it receives from other clients until it reaches a certain quota. It connects to only that many nodes, locally caching the addresses it has not yet tried and discards the addresses it tried that were invalid.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWhen the user wants to do a search, the client sends the request to each actively connected node. In version 0.4 of the protocol, the number of actively connected nodes for a client was quite small (around 5), so each node then forwarded the request to all its actively connected nodes, and they, in turn, forwarded the request, and so on, until the packet reached a predetermined number of ''hops'' from the sender (maximum 7).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nSince version 0.6 (2002<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rfc-gnutella.sourceforge.net/src/rfc-0_6-draft.html|title=Gnutella Protocol Development|website=rfc-gnutella.sourceforge.net|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref>), Gnutella is a composite network made of leaf nodes and ultra nodes (also called ultrapeers). The leaf nodes are connected to a small number of ultrapeers (typically 3) while each ultrapeer is connected to more than 32 other ultrapeers. With this higher [[outdegree]], the maximum number of ''hops'' a query can travel was lowered to 4.\n\nLeaves and ultrapeers use the Query Routing Protocol to exchange a Query Routing Table (QRT), a table of 64 [[Binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|Ki]]-slots and up to 2 [[Binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|Mi]]-slots consisting of hashed keywords. A leaf node sends its QRT to each of the ultrapeers it is connected to, and ultrapeers merge the QRT of all their leaves (downsized to 128 [[binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|Ki]]-slots) plus their own QRT (if they share files) and exchange that with their own neighbors. Query routing is then done by hashing the words of the query and seeing whether all of them match in the QRT. Ultrapeers do that check before forwarding a query to a leaf node, and also before forwarding the query to a peer ultra node provided this is the last hop the query can travel.\n\nIf a search request turns up a result, the node that has the result contacts the searcher. In the classic Gnutella protocol, response messages were sent back along the route the query came through, as the query itself did not contain identifying information of the node. This scheme was later revised, so that search results now are delivered over [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) directly to the node that initiated the search, usually an ultrapeer of the node. Thus, in the current protocol, the queries carry the [[IP address]] and port number of either node. This lowers the amount of traffic routed through the Gnutella network, making it significantly more scalable.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIf the user decides to download the file, they negotiate the [[file transfer]]. If the node which has the requested file is not [[Firewall (computing)|firewalled]], the querying node can connect to it directly. However, if the node is firewalled, stopping the source node from receiving incoming connections, the client wanting to download a file sends it a so-called ''push request'' to the server for the remote client to initiate the connection instead (to ''push'' the file). At first, these push requests were routed along the original chain it used to send the query. This was rather unreliable because routes would often break and routed packets are always subject to flow control. Therefore, so-called ''push proxies'' were introduced. These are usually the ultrapeers of a leaf node and they are announced in search results. The client connects to one of these ''push proxies'' using an HTTP request and the proxy sends a ''push request'' to leaf on behalf of the client. Normally, it is also possible to send a push request over UDP to the push proxy which is more efficient than using TCP. Push proxies have two advantages: First, ultrapeer-leaf connections are more stable than routes which makes push requests much more reliable. Second, it reduces the amount of traffic routed through the Gnutella network.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nFinally, when a user disconnects, the client software saves the list of nodes that it was actively connected to and those collected from pong packets for use the next time it attempts to connect so that it becomes independent from any kind of bootstrap services.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn practice, this method of searching on the Gnutella network was often unreliable. Each node is a regular computer user; as such, they are constantly connecting and disconnecting, so the network is never completely stable. Also, the bandwidth cost of searching on Gnutella grew exponentially to the number of connected users,<ref>[http://www.darkridge.com/~jpr5/doc/gnutella.html Why Gnutella Can't Scale. No, Really.] February 2001.</ref> often saturating connections and rendering slower nodes useless. Therefore, search requests would often be dropped, and most queries reached only a very small part of the network. This observation identified the Gnutella network as an [[Scalability|unscalable]] distributed system, and inspired the development of [[distributed hash table]]s, which are much more scalable but support only exact-match, rather than keyword, search.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nTo address the problems of [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]]s, Gnutella developers implemented a tiered system of ''ultrapeers'' and ''leaves''. Instead of all nodes being considered equal, nodes entering into the network were kept at the 'edge' of the network as a leaf, not responsible for any routing, and nodes which were capable of routing messages were promoted to ultrapeers, which would accept leaf connections and route searches and network maintenance messages. This allowed searches to propagate further through the network, and allowed for numerous alterations in the topology which have improved the efficiency and scalability greatly.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAdditionally, gnutella adopted a number of other techniques to reduce traffic overhead and make searches more efficient. Most notable are Query Routing Protocol (QRP) and Dynamic Querying (DQ). With QRP a search reaches only those clients which are likely to have the files, so rare files searches grow vastly more efficient, and with DQ the search stops as soon as the program has acquired enough search results, which vastly reduces the amount of traffic caused by popular searches. [http://gnufu.net Gnutella For Users] has a vast amount of information about these and other improvements to Gnutella in user-friendly style.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nOne of the benefits of having Gnutella so decentralized is to make it very difficult to shut the network down and to make it a network in which the users are the only ones who can decide which content will be available. Unlike [[Napster]], where the entire network relied on the central server, Gnutella cannot be shut down by shutting down any one node. A decentralized network prevents bad actors from taking control of the contents of the network and/or manipulating data by controlling the central server.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berkes.ca/archive/berkes_gnutella_freenet.pdf |title=Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Network Architecture: Gnutella and Freenet |last=Berkes |first=Jem |publisher=University of Manitoba |date=April 9, 2003 |website=https://www.berkes.ca/ |access-date=October 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808170634/http://www.berkes.ca/archive/berkes_gnutella_freenet.pdf |archive-date=August 8, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Protocol features and extensions ==\nGnutella did once operate on a purely [[query flooding]]-based protocol. The outdated Gnutella version 0.4 [[network protocol]] employs five different packet types, namely<ref>Dye, Mark. McDonald, Rick. Rufi, Antoon W., 'Network Fundamentals', Cisco Networking Academy, Cisco Press, Ch 3. p91</ref>\n\n* ping: discover hosts on network\n* pong: reply to ping\n* query: search for a file\n* query hit: reply to query\n* push: download request for firewalled servants\n\nThese are mainly concerned with searching the Gnutella network. File transfers are handled using [[HTTP]].<ref name=\"Dye, Mark p90\">Dye, Mark. McDonald, Rick. Rufi, Antoon W., 'Network Fundamentals', Cisco Networking Academy, Cisco Press, Ch 3. p90</ref>\n\nThe development of the Gnutella protocol is currently led by the Gnutella Developers Forum (The GDF). Many protocol extensions have been and are being developed by the software vendors and free Gnutella developers of the GDF. These extensions include intelligent query routing, [[SHA-1]] checksums, query hit transmission via [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]], querying via UDP, dynamic queries via [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], file transfers via UDP, [[XML]] metadata, source exchange (also termed ''the download mesh'') and parallel downloading in slices (swarming).<ref name=\"Dye, Mark p90\"/>\n\nThere are efforts to finalize these protocol extensions in the Gnutella 0.6 specification at the Gnutella protocol development website. The Gnutella 0.4 standard, although still being the latest protocol specification since all extensions only exist as proposals so far, is outdated. In fact, it is hard or impossible to connect today with the 0.4 handshakes and according to developers in the GDF, version 0.6 is what new developers should pursue using the [http://gnet-specs.gnufu.net work-in-progress specifications].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe Gnutella protocol remains under development and in spite of attempts to make a clean break with the complexity inherited from the old Gnutella 0.4 and to design a clean new message architecture, it is still one of the most successful file-sharing protocols to date.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n== Software ==\nThe following tables compare general and technical information for a number of applications supporting the Gnutella network.

A sore point with many Gnutella developers is that the ''Gnutella2'' name conveys an upgrade or superiority, which led to a flame war. Other criticism included the use of the Gnutella network to bootstrap G2 peers and poor documentation of the G2 protocol. Additionally, the more frequent search retries of the [[Shareaza]] client, one of the initial G2 clients, could unnecessarily burden the Gnutella network.<ref>[http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=100 Gnutella vs. Gnutella2, Part 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305053853/http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=100 |date=2016-03-05 }} Thomas Mennecke for [[Slyck.com]], February 25, 2003</ref>\n\nBoth protocols have undergone significant changes since the fork in 2002. G2 has advantages and disadvantages compared to Gnutella. An advantage often cited is Gnutella2's hybrid search is more efficient than the original Gnutella's [[query flooding]], which was later replaced by more efficient search methods, starting with Query Routing in 2002, which was proposed in 2001 by Limewire developers.<ref>[http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/~fwitschel/vorlP2P/literatur/search_methods.pdf A comparison of Peer-to-Peer search methods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926110918/http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/~fwitschel/vorlP2P/literatur/search_methods.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }} Dimitrios Tsoumakos, 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~celio/peer2peer/gnutella-related/query-routing-protocol.htm Query Routing for the Gnutella Network proposal] Christopher Rohrs, 2001-12-18</ref><ref>[http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~celio/peer2peer/gnutella-related/query-routing-protocol.htm Query Routing for the Gnutella Network 1.0] Christopher Rohrs, 2002-05-16</ref> An advantage for Gnutella is that its users number in the millions,<ref name=\"population\"/> whereas the G2 network is approximately an order of magnitude smaller.<ref>[http://crawler.trillinux.org/ G2 Network Statistics] Population ~200,000 January 2010.</ref>  It is difficult to compare the protocols in their current form; the individual client choice will probably have as much of an effect to an end user on either network.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bitzi]]\n* [[Gnutella crawler]]\n* [[GNUnet]]\n\n== References ==\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2013}}\n{{Reflist}}\n* Dye, Mark.

The first jobs she found were in teaching. At a family gathering in 1952, a relative mentioned that the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) was hiring mathematicians.<ref name=\"NASA bio\" /> At the [[Langley Research Center|Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]], based in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], Virginia, near [[Langley Field]], NACA hired African-American mathematicians as well as whites for their Guidance and Navigation Department. Johnson accepted a job offer from the agency in June 1953.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />\n\nAccording to an oral history archived by the National Visionary Leadership Project:\n\n<blockquote>At first she [Johnson] worked in a pool of women performing math calculations. Katherine has referred to the women in the pool as virtual \"computers who wore skirts\". Their main job was to read the data from the black boxes of planes and carry out other precise mathematical tasks. Then one day, Katherine (and a colleague) were temporarily assigned to help the all-male flight research team. Katherine's knowledge of [[analytic geometry]] helped make quick allies of male bosses and colleagues to the extent that, \"they forgot to return me to the pool\".  While the racial and gender barriers were always there, Katherine says she ignored them. Katherine was assertive, asking to be included in editorial meetings (where no women had gone before). She simply told people she had done the work and that she belonged.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nFrom 1953 to 1958, Johnson worked as a [[Human computer|computer]],<ref name=\"Jim Hodges\">{{cite web |title=She Was a Computer When Computers Wore Skirts |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |first=Jim |last=Hodges |publisher=NASA |work=Langley Research Center |date=August 26, 2008 |access-date=December 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124545/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft.

Their office was labeled as \"Colored Computers\". In an interview with [[WHRO-TV]], Johnson stated that she \"didn't feel the segregation at NASA, because everybody there was doing research. You had a mission and you worked on it, and it was important to you to do your job&nbsp;... and play bridge at lunch.\" She added: \"I didn't feel any segregation.

The first jobs she found were in teaching. At a family gathering in 1952, a relative mentioned that the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) was hiring mathematicians.<ref name=\"NASA bio\" /> At the [[Langley Research Center|Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]], based in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], Virginia, near [[Langley Field]], NACA hired African-American mathematicians as well as whites for their Guidance and Navigation Department. Johnson accepted a job offer from the agency in June 1953.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />\n\nAccording to an oral history archived by the National Visionary Leadership Project:\n\n<blockquote>At first she [Johnson] worked in a pool of women performing math calculations. Katherine has referred to the women in the pool as virtual \"computers who wore skirts\". Their main job was to read the data from the black boxes of planes and carry out other precise mathematical tasks. Then one day, Katherine (and a colleague) were temporarily assigned to help the all-male flight research team. Katherine's knowledge of [[analytic geometry]] helped make quick allies of male bosses and colleagues to the extent that, \"they forgot to return me to the pool\".  While the racial and gender barriers were always there, Katherine says she ignored them. Katherine was assertive, asking to be included in editorial meetings (where no women had gone before). She simply told people she had done the work and that she belonged.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nFrom 1953 to 1958, Johnson worked as a [[Human computer|computer]],<ref name=\"Jim Hodges\">{{cite web |title=She Was a Computer When Computers Wore Skirts |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |first=Jim |last=Hodges |publisher=NASA |work=Langley Research Center |date=August 26, 2008 |access-date=December 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124545/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft. Originally assigned to the [[West Area Computers]] section supervised by mathematician [[Dorothy Vaughan]], Johnson was reassigned to the Guidance and Control Division of Langley's Flight Research Division. It was staffed by white male engineers.<ref name=\"buckley\" /> In keeping with state racial segregation laws, and federal workplace segregation introduced under President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in the early 20th&nbsp;century, Johnson and the other African-American women in the computing pool were required to work, eat, and use restrooms that were separate from those of their white peers. Their office was labeled as \"Colored Computers\". In an interview with [[WHRO-TV]], Johnson stated that she \"didn't feel the segregation at NASA, because everybody there was doing research. You had a mission and you worked on it, and it was important to you to do your job&nbsp;... and play bridge at lunch.\" She added: \"I didn't feel any segregation.

I had to be. In the early days of NASA women were not allowed to put their names on the reports&nbsp;\u2013 no woman in my division had had her name on a report.

Student numbers continued to increase, and the Faculty of Engineering eventually needed the new premises that were to become Queen's Building in 1955. This substantial building housed all of the university's engineers until 1996, when the department of [[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol|Department of Computer Science]] moved over the road into the new Merchant Venturers' Building to make space for these rapidly expanding fields. Today, Queen's Building caters for most of the teaching needs of the Faculty and provides academic space for the \"heavy\" engineering subjects ([[civil engineering|civil]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], and [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]]).\n\nWith unprecedented growth in the 1960s, particularly in undergraduate numbers, the Students' Union eventually acquired larger premises in a new building in the [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] area of the city, in 1965. This building was more spacious than the Victoria Rooms, which were now given over to the Department of Music. The [[University of Bristol Union|new Union]] provides many practice and performance rooms, some specialist rooms, as well as three bars: Bar 100; the Mandela (also known as AR2) and the Avon Gorge.

In 1968, many students marched in support of the [[Anderson Report (British Education)|Anderson Report]], which called for higher student grants. This discontent culminated in an 11-day sit-in at the Senate House (the administrative headquarters of the university).<ref name=\"BristolUniversityHistory\" /> A series of chancellors and vice-chancellors led the university through these decades, with [[Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort]] taking over from Churchill as chancellor in 1965 before being succeeded by [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] in 1970 who spent the next 18 years in the office.<ref name=\"past-officers\" />\n\nAs the age of mass higher education dawned, Bristol continued to build its student numbers. The various undergraduate residences were repeatedly expanded and, more recently, some postgraduate residences have been constructed. These more recent ventures have been funded (and are run) by external companies in agreement with the university.\n\nSince 1988, there have been only three further chancellors; Sir [[Jeremy Morse]], then chairman of [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] who handed over in 2003 to [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Brenda Hale]], the first female [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]].<ref name=\"archives-hub\" /><ref name=\"past-officers\" /> [[Paul Nurse|Sir Paul Nurse]] succeeded Lady Hale as Chancellor on 1 January 2017.\n\n[[File:Victoria Rooms (750px).jpg|thumb|The Victoria Rooms, housing the School of Music]]\nOne of the few [[Centre for Deaf Studies, Bristol|Centres for Deaf Studies]] in the United Kingdom was established in Bristol in 1981, followed in 1988 by the Norah Fry Centre for research into learning difficulties.

These buildings were designed by [[Charles Hansom]], the younger brother of [[Joseph Hansom]], Joseph being the inventor of the [[Hansom Cab]]. These buildings suffered being built in stages due to financial pressure. George Oatley added to them a tower in memory of Albert Fry which can still be seen on University Road. The first large scale building project the University of Bristol undertook on gaining a charter was the Wills Memorial Building which it was hoped would be a symbol of academic permanence for the university and a memorial to the chief benefactor of the university, [[Henry Overton Wills]]. It was requested to the architect [[George Oatley]] that the building be built to last at least 400 years but the site purchased, at the top of [[Park Street, Bristol|Park Street]] suffered from an awkward slope and a desirability to link the building with the Museum and Art Gallery situated adjacent to the plot. The architecture critic [[Roger Gill (architecture critic)|Roger Gill]] has stated that the building is \"remarkable in size\" but noted that the \"ambience of a medieval University was strangely lacking\". He goes on to criticise the building as a \"sham\" and a \"folly\".<ref>Carleton (1984), p129</ref> The armorials on the Founder's Window represent all of the interests present at the founding of the University of Bristol including the Wills and Fry families. The [[Tyndalls Park]] Estate and [[Royal Fort House]] were also purchased from the trustees of the Tyndall family allowing the university to expand. Many Departments in the Faculty of Arts are housed in large Victorian houses which have been converted for teaching.<ref>Higher Education Quality Council (1993), p2</ref>\n\n[[Goldney gardens]] entered the property of the University of Bristol through [[George Alfred Wills|George Wills]] who had hoped to build an all-male hall of residence there. This was prevented due to the moral objection of the then warden of Clifton Hall House who objected to the idea of male and female residences being in such close proximity. University records show that Miss Starvey was prepared to resign over the issue and that she had the support of the then Chancellor [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]].<ref>Carleton (1984), p132</ref> Eventually land was purchased in [[Stoke Bishop]] allowing [[Wills Hall]] to be bought, allowing the building of what has been described as a \"quasi-[[Oxbridge]]\" hall, to which was added the Dame Monica Wills Chapel by George Wills' widow after his death. [[File:Goldney2.jpg|thumb|200px|The Gardens of Goldney Hall were acquired by the Wills family]]Burwalls, a mansion house on the other side of the [[Avon Gorge]], was used as a halls of residence in the past and was a home of [[Sir George Oatley]].

It has since been restored to its former glory, complete with oak panelled walls and a new organ.\n\n==== Post-war development ====\n\nIn 1946, the university established the first drama department in the country.<ref name=\"BristolUniversityHistory\" /> In the same year, Bristol began offering special entrance [[exam]]s and [[Grant (money)|grants]] to aid the resettlement of servicemen returning home. Student numbers continued to increase, and the Faculty of Engineering eventually needed the new premises that were to become Queen's Building in 1955. This substantial building housed all of the university's engineers until 1996, when the department of [[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol|Department of Computer Science]] moved over the road into the new Merchant Venturers' Building to make space for these rapidly expanding fields. Today, Queen's Building caters for most of the teaching needs of the Faculty and provides academic space for the \"heavy\" engineering subjects ([[civil engineering|civil]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], and [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]]).\n\nWith unprecedented growth in the 1960s, particularly in undergraduate numbers, the Students' Union eventually acquired larger premises in a new building in the [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] area of the city, in 1965. This building was more spacious than the Victoria Rooms, which were now given over to the Department of Music. The [[University of Bristol Union|new Union]] provides many practice and performance rooms, some specialist rooms, as well as three bars: Bar 100; the Mandela (also known as AR2) and the Avon Gorge. Whilst spacious, the Union building is thought by many to be ugly<ref>{{cite web | title = The Students' Union | publisher = University of Bristol Union | accessdate =6 December 2007 | url = http://www.bristol.ac.uk/union/altprospectus/unilife/union |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126124416/http://www.bristol.ac.uk/union/altprospectus/unilife/union |archivedate = 26 November 2007}}</ref> and out of character compared to the architecture of the rest of the Clifton area, having been mentioned in a [[BBC]] poll to find the worst architectural eyesores in Britain.<ref>{{cite news | title = What is the worst eyesore in the UK? |work=BBC News | date = 21 November 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/3266673.stm}}</ref> The university has proposed relocating the Union to a more central location as part of its development 'masterplan'.<ref>{{cite web | title = University of Bristol Strategic Masterplan | publisher = University of Bristol | page = 64 | accessdate =6 December 2007 | url = http://www.bristol.ac.uk/Depts/Bursar/masterplan06/1masterplan.pdf |date=July 2006 }}</ref> More recently, plans for redevelopment of the current building have been proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ubu.org.uk/build |title=Building Project \u2013 A Better Building for the Students' Union |publisher=Ubu.org.uk |accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe 1960s were a time of considerable student activism in the United Kingdom, and Bristol was no exception. In 1968, many students marched in support of the [[Anderson Report (British Education)|Anderson Report]], which called for higher student grants. This discontent culminated in an 11-day sit-in at the Senate House (the administrative headquarters of the university).<ref name=\"BristolUniversityHistory\" /> A series of chancellors and vice-chancellors led the university through these decades, with [[Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort]] taking over from Churchill as chancellor in 1965 before being succeeded by [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] in 1970 who spent the next 18 years in the office.<ref name=\"past-officers\" />\n\nAs the age of mass higher education dawned, Bristol continued to build its student numbers. The various undergraduate residences were repeatedly expanded and, more recently, some postgraduate residences have been constructed. These more recent ventures have been funded (and are run) by external companies in agreement with the university.\n\nSince 1988, there have been only three further chancellors; Sir [[Jeremy Morse]], then chairman of [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] who handed over in 2003 to [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Brenda Hale]], the first female [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]].<ref name=\"archives-hub\" /><ref name=\"past-officers\" /> [[Paul Nurse|Sir Paul Nurse]] succeeded Lady Hale as Chancellor on 1 January 2017.\n\n[[File:Victoria Rooms (750px).jpg|thumb|The Victoria Rooms, housing the School of Music]]\nOne of the few [[Centre for Deaf Studies, Bristol|Centres for Deaf Studies]] in the United Kingdom was established in Bristol in 1981, followed in 1988 by the Norah Fry Centre for research into learning difficulties.

On both occasions, however, the subsequent referendum of all students reversed that decision and Bristol remains affiliated to the NUS.\n\nIn 2002, the university was involved in an argument over press intrusion after details of then-prime minister [[Tony Blair]]'s son's application to university were published in national newspapers.\n\nAs the number of postgraduate students has grown (particularly the numbers pursuing taught master's degrees), there eventually became a need for separate representation on university bodies and the Postgraduate Union (PGU) was established in 2000.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.pgu.org.uk/yourpgu/| title = General introduction of the PGU| accessdate =20 December 2007| publisher = University of Bristol Postgraduate Union|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227191758/http://www.pgu.org.uk/yourpgu/ |archivedate = 27 December 2007}}</ref>\nUniversities are increasingly expected to exploit the intellectual property generated by their research activities and, in 2000, Bristol established the Research and Enterprise Division (RED) to further this cause (particularly for technology-based businesses).

These buildings were designed by [[Charles Hansom]], the younger brother of [[Joseph Hansom]], Joseph being the inventor of the [[Hansom Cab]]. These buildings suffered being built in stages due to financial pressure. George Oatley added to them a tower in memory of Albert Fry which can still be seen on University Road. The first large scale building project the University of Bristol undertook on gaining a charter was the Wills Memorial Building which it was hoped would be a symbol of academic permanence for the university and a memorial to the chief benefactor of the university, [[Henry Overton Wills]]. It was requested to the architect [[George Oatley]] that the building be built to last at least 400 years but the site purchased, at the top of [[Park Street, Bristol|Park Street]] suffered from an awkward slope and a desirability to link the building with the Museum and Art Gallery situated adjacent to the plot. The architecture critic [[Roger Gill (architecture critic)|Roger Gill]] has stated that the building is \"remarkable in size\" but noted that the \"ambience of a medieval University was strangely lacking\". He goes on to criticise the building as a \"sham\" and a \"folly\".<ref>Carleton (1984), p129</ref> The armorials on the Founder's Window represent all of the interests present at the founding of the University of Bristol including the Wills and Fry families. The [[Tyndalls Park]] Estate and [[Royal Fort House]] were also purchased from the trustees of the Tyndall family allowing the university to expand. Many Departments in the Faculty of Arts are housed in large Victorian houses which have been converted for teaching.<ref>Higher Education Quality Council (1993), p2</ref>\n\n[[Goldney gardens]] entered the property of the University of Bristol through [[George Alfred Wills|George Wills]] who had hoped to build an all-male hall of residence there. This was prevented due to the moral objection of the then warden of Clifton Hall House who objected to the idea of male and female residences being in such close proximity. University records show that Miss Starvey was prepared to resign over the issue and that she had the support of the then Chancellor [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]].<ref>Carleton (1984), p132</ref> Eventually land was purchased in [[Stoke Bishop]] allowing [[Wills Hall]] to be bought, allowing the building of what has been described as a \"quasi-[[Oxbridge]]\" hall, to which was added the Dame Monica Wills Chapel by George Wills' widow after his death. [[File:Goldney2.jpg|thumb|200px|The Gardens of Goldney Hall were acquired by the Wills family]]Burwalls, a mansion house on the other side of the [[Avon Gorge]], was used as a halls of residence in the past and was a home of [[Sir George Oatley]].

He is also responsible for the extension to the Wills Memorial Building library which was completed to such standard that few now realise that is an extension to the original building.<ref>Carleton (1984), p138</ref> Brentnall oversaw the rebuilding of the Great Hall of the Wills Memorial Building after it was partly destroyed during the [[Bristol Blitz]] of World War II.

The lake is surrounded with pine forests. The [[Narach River]] flows out of it.\n\nNarach is an abode of 22 genera of fish, as the [[eel]], [[Esox|pike]], [[burbot]], etc. The shore and islets are nested by different birds, as the [[mute swan]], [[fish hawk]], [[tarrock]], [[Little grebe|dabchick]].\n\n==History==\nPeople settled near the lake about 10 thousand years ago. Linguists think that its name is probably from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *''nar''- often found in names of bodies of water (e.g., the [[Nara River|Nara]] and [[Neris]] rivers).<ref>E.M. Pospelov, ''Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira'' (Moscow: Russkie slovari, 1998), p. 283.</ref> Archaeologists have excavated many burial mounds of the [[Baltic people|Baltic]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] people that lived around Narach.\n\nSince the [[Middle Ages]], the local inhabitants have lived mainly by fishing and farming. In the 19th century, the most profitable work was fishing of crayfish.
