It was almost precisely three years later, in May 1863, that the bill to authorise construction of the first railway was introduced. It was passed in September of that year and provided for the construction of a line by the government from [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] to [[Toowoomba]], [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]] and [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]] - the [[Southern railway line|Southern]] and [[Western railway line, Queensland|Western Railway]] as it was first called.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 71911 Passenger train crossing Swanson's Bridge in the Toowoomba Range, ca. 1912.jpg|thumb|left|A passenger train speeds across the bridge circa 1912]]\nConstruction of Swanson's Bridge was commenced in 1899 and was completed in 1900. The new Swanson's Bridge replaced a former bridge of deck-type metal truss construction built in 1867 with the initial construction of the Main Range railway now known as the [[Main Line railway, Queensland|Main Line railway]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} As built, the Main Range railway had a considerable number of bridges which over the years were replaced by embankments and culverts so that the number of original bridges became fewer. But in 1899 an official three-year program was commenced to ease curves on the railway and replace high timber bridges with concrete culverts due to the increasing weight of rolling stock.

It was almost precisely three years later, in May 1863, that the bill to authorise construction of the first railway was introduced. It was passed in September of that year and provided for the construction of a line by the government from [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] to [[Toowoomba]], [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]] and [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]] - the [[Southern railway line|Southern]] and [[Western railway line, Queensland|Western Railway]] as it was first called.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 71911 Passenger train crossing Swanson's Bridge in the Toowoomba Range, ca. 1912.jpg|thumb|left|A passenger train speeds across the bridge circa 1912]]\nConstruction of Swanson's Bridge was commenced in 1899 and was completed in 1900. The new Swanson's Bridge replaced a former bridge of deck-type metal truss construction built in 1867 with the initial construction of the Main Range railway now known as the [[Main Line railway, Queensland|Main Line railway]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} As built, the Main Range railway had a considerable number of bridges which over the years were replaced by embankments and culverts so that the number of original bridges became fewer. But in 1899 an official three-year program was commenced to ease curves on the railway and replace high timber bridges with concrete culverts due to the increasing weight of rolling stock. The construction of Swanson's Bridge was a part of this program. The Commissioner's Annual Report for 1900 (p 76) notes:<ref name=qhr/><blockquote>Deviations on the Main Range for the purpose of easing curves and substituting earth embankments and concrete works for the iron bridges, which have been condemned as being too light for the increasing weight of rolling stock, have been carried on continuously by day labour.

It concerns an unnamed young woman who impetuously marries a wealthy widower, only to discover that he and his household are haunted by the memory of his late first wife, the title character. A best-seller which has never gone out of print, ''Rebecca'' sold 2.8&nbsp;million copies between its publication in 1938 and 1965. It has been adapted numerous times for stage and screen, including a 1939 play by du Maurier herself, and the film, ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile working as the companion to a rich American woman on holiday in [[Monte Carlo]], the unnamed narrator, a na\u00efve young woman in her early 20s, becomes acquainted with a wealthy Englishman, George Fortescue Maximilian \"Maxim\" de Winter, a 42-year-old widower. After a fortnight of courtship, she agrees to marry him and, after the wedding and honeymoon, accompanies him to his mansion in [[Cornwall]], the beautiful estate [[Manderley]].\n\nMrs Danvers, the sinister housekeeper, was profoundly devoted to the first Mrs de Winter, Rebecca, who died in a boating accident about a year before Maxim and the second Mrs de Winter met. She continually attempts to undermine the new Mrs de Winter psychologically, subtly suggesting to her that she will never attain the beauty, [[urbanity]], and charm her predecessor possessed. Whenever the new Mrs de Winter attempts to make changes at Manderley, Mrs Danvers describes how Rebecca ran it when she was alive. Each time Mrs Danvers does this, she implies that the new Mrs de Winter lacks the experience and knowledge necessary for running an important estate. Cowed by Mrs Danvers' imposing manner, and the other members of West Country society's unwavering reverence for Rebecca, the new mistress becomes isolated.\n\nShe is soon convinced that Maxim regrets his impetuous decision to marry her and is still deeply in love with the seemingly perfect Rebecca. The climax occurs at Manderley's annual costume ball. Mrs Danvers manipulates the protagonist into wearing a replica of the dress shown in a portrait of one of the former inhabitants of the house\u2014hiding the fact that the same costume was worn by Rebecca to much acclaim shortly before her death. The narrator has a drummer announce her entrance using the name of the lady in the portrait: Caroline de Winter. When the narrator shows Maxim the dress, he gets very angry at her and orders her to change.\n\nShortly after the ball, Mrs Danvers reveals her contempt for the second Mrs de Winter, believing she is trying to replace Rebecca, and reveals her deep, unhealthy obsession with the dead woman. Mrs Danvers tries to get Mrs de Winter to commit suicide by encouraging her to jump out of the window. However, she is thwarted at the last moment by the disturbance occasioned by a nearby shipwreck. A diver investigating the condition of the wrecked ship's hull also discovers the remains of Rebecca's sailing boat, with her decomposed body still on board.\n\nThis discovery causes Maxim to confess the truth to the second Mrs de Winter. He tells her how his marriage to Rebecca was nothing but a sham: how from the very first days husband and wife loathed each other. Rebecca, Maxim reveals, was a cruel and selfish woman who manipulated everyone around her into believing her to be the perfect wife and a paragon of virtue. She repeatedly taunted Maxim with sordid tales of her numerous love affairs. The night of her death, she told Maxim that she was pregnant with another man's child, which she would raise under the pretense that it was Maxim's and he would be [[Presumption of legitimacy|powerless to stop her]]. In a rage, he had shot her through the heart, then disposed of her body by placing it in her boat and sinking it at sea. The second Mrs de Winter thinks little of Maxim's murder confession, but instead is relieved to hear that Maxim has always loved her and never Rebecca.\n\nRebecca's boat is raised and it is discovered that it was deliberately sunk. An [[inquest]] brings a verdict of suicide. However, Rebecca's first cousin, and lover, Jack Favell, attempts to blackmail Maxim, claiming to have proof that Rebecca could not have intended suicide based on a note she sent to him the night she died.\n\nIt is revealed that Rebecca had had an appointment with a Doctor Baker in London shortly before her death, presumably to confirm her pregnancy. When the doctor is found, he reveals that Rebecca had been suffering from [[cancer]] and would have died within a few months. Furthermore, due to the malformation of her [[uterus]], she could never have been pregnant. Maxim assumes that Rebecca, knowing that she was going to die, manipulated him into killing her quickly. Mrs Danvers had said after the inquiry that Rebecca feared nothing except dying a lingering death.\n\nMaxim feels a great sense of foreboding, and insists on driving through the night to return to Manderley. However, before he comes in sight of the house, it is clear from a glow on the horizon and wind-borne ashes that it is ablaze.\n\nThe novel is remembered especially<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.strandmag.com/the-magazine/articles/daphne-du-mauriers-rebecca/|author=Charles L.P. Silet|title=Daphne DuMaurier's Rebecca|journal=The Strand Magazine}}</ref> for the character [[Mrs. Danvers]], the fictional estate [[Manderley]], and its opening line: {{Quote|\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\" |The second Mrs de Winter}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n* '''The Narrator/the Second Mrs de Winter''': A timid, na\u00efve, middle-class woman in her early twenties, who enjoys sketching. Neither the narrator's first nor maiden name is revealed. She is referred to as \"my wife\", Mrs de Winter, \"my dear\", and so on. The one time she is introduced with a name is during a fancy dress ball, in which she dresses as a de Winter ancestor and is introduced as \"Caroline de Winter\", although this is clearly not her own name. She signs her name as \"Mrs M. de Winter\", using Maxim's initial. Early in the novel she receives a letter and remarks that her name was correctly spelled, which is \"an unusual thing,\" suggesting her name is uncommon, foreign or complex. While courting her, Maxim compliments her on her \"lovely and unusual name\". Despite her timidity, she gradually matures throughout the novel, refusing to be a victim of Rebecca's phantom-like influence any longer and becoming a strong, assertive woman in her own right.\n* '''George Fortescue Maximilian \"Maxim\" de Winter''': The reserved, unemotional owner of Manderley. He marries his new wife after a brief courtship, yet displays little affection toward her after the marriage. Emotionally scarred by his traumatic marriage to Rebecca, his distance toward his new wife causes her to fear he regrets his marriage to her and is still broken-hearted over Rebecca's death. Maxim killed Rebecca in a blind rage after she pushed him over the edge with her lie that she was carrying the child of one of her lovers and would force him to raise it as his own. He does eventually reveal to his new wife that he does love her, but not until several months of marriage have passed. His full name is tauntingly revealed, by Jack Favell, to be '''George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter'''.\n* '''Mrs Danvers''': The cold, creepy, overbearing housekeeper of Manderley. Danvers was Rebecca's family maid when she was a child and has lived with her for years. She is unhealthily obsessed with Rebecca and preserving Rebecca's memory. She resents the new Mrs de Winter, convinced she is trying to \"take Rebecca's place\". She tries to destroy the marriage, but her efforts fail and only serve to bring Maxim and his new wife closer together. After her scheme is ruined, Mrs Danvers apparently burns Manderley to the ground, preferring to destroy it than allow Maxim to share his home with another lover and wife. She is nicknamed '''Danny''' which is derived from her last name; her first name being unknown or unimportant, but in [[Sally Beauman]]'s sequel ''[[Rebecca's Tale]]'' it was said to be '''Edith'''.\n* '''Rebecca de Winter''': The unseen, deceased titular character, who has been dead for less than a year. A famous beauty, and on the surface a devoted wife and perfect hostess, Rebecca was actually a compulsive liar and an openly promiscuous woman who tormented her husband Maxim with lurid tales of her nonstop affairs. Her lingering presence overwhelms Manderley, dominating the visitors, the staff and the new Mrs de Winter. Through dialogue, it is slowly revealed that Rebecca possessed all the signs of a [[psychopath]]: habitual lying, superficial charm, expert manipulation, no conscience and no remorse. She was also revealed to be somewhat sadistic \u2014 Danvers tells a story of Rebecca, during her teenage years, cruelly whipping a horse until it bled. In the [[Rebecca (1940 film)|1940 film adaptation]], her maiden name was said to be '''Henrich'''.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* '''Frank Crawley:''' The hard-working, dutiful [[Estate agent|agent]] of Manderley. He is said to be Maxim's trusted advisor and faithful confidant. He soon becomes a good friend to the second Mrs de Winter, and helps her in the self-doubt of her inability to rule Manderley as its mistress.\n* '''Beatrice Lacy (formerly de Winter):''' Maxim's wilful and quick-witted sister, who develops an immediate fondness for the new Mrs de Winter. Prior to the novel, she had married Giles Lacy. She, along with her brother, is one of the few people who knew Rebecca's true, vile nature, and was one of her victims: Beatrice's husband was seduced by her.\n* '''Giles Lacy:''' The slightly slow-witted husband of Beatrice, and Maxim's brother-in-law. He was one of the many men who fell for Rebecca's charms.\n* '''Frith:''' The middle-aged, kind and devoted butler at Manderley. He had worked for the de Winters when Maxim's late father was a boy.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n* '''Robert:''' A footman.\n* '''Clarice:''' Mrs de Winter's faithful and trusted [[Lady's maid|maid]]. She aided her lady and mistress in fitting her white, frilly gown for the fancy dress ball. She replaces the original maid, Alice, later on.\n* '''Jack Favell:''' The crafty and sneaky first cousin of the late Rebecca de Winter and her most frequent [[boyfriend]]/[[sexual partner|lover]]. He and Rebecca had grown up together as children, causing mayhem, and he shares many of her worst traits, suggesting insanity runs in their family. He is strongly disliked by Maxim and several other characters. Since Rebecca's untimely demise, his one and only true friend and [[confidant]]e is Mrs Danvers, whom he calls \"Danny\", just as Rebecca had done.\n* '''Colonel Julyan:''' The investigator of the inquest of the true cause of Rebecca's untimely demise.\n* '''Dr. Baker:''' A doctor who specialises in the feminine problems of women. A few hours prior to her death, Rebecca went to see him in secret, when he diagnosed her with an unspecified type of [[cancer]].\n\n==Location==\n* The fictional H\u00f4tel C\u00f4te d'Azur, Monte Carlo\n* The fictional [[Manderley]], a country estate which du Maurier's editor noted \"is as much an atmosphere as a tangible erection of stones and mortar\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Development==\nIn 1937, Daphne du Maurier signed a three-book deal with Victor Gollancz and accepted an advance of \u00a31,000.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=Dennison|first=Matthew|date=19 April 2008|title=How Daphne Du Maurier Wrote Rebecca|newspaper=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3672739/How-Daphne-du-Maurier-wrote-Rebecca.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227063201/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3672739/How-Daphne-du-Maurier-wrote-Rebecca.html|archivedate=27 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}.</ref> A 2008 article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' indicates she had been toying with the theme of jealousy for the five years since her marriage in 1932.<ref name=\":0\" /> She started \"sluggishly\" and wrote a desperate apology to Gollancz: \"The first 15,000 words I tore up in disgust and this literary miscarriage has cast me down rather.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHer husband, [[Frederick Browning|Tommy \"Boy\" Browning]], was Lieutenant Colonel of the Grenadier Guards and they were posted to Alexandria, Egypt, with the Second Battalion, leaving Britain on 30 July 1937.<ref name=\":0\" /> Gollancz expected her manuscript on their return to Britain in December but she wrote that she was \"ashamed to tell you that progress is slow on the new novel....There is little likelihood of my bringing back a finished manuscript in December.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn returning to Britain in December 1937, du Maurier decided to spend Christmas away from her family to write the book and she successfully delivered it to her publisher less than four months later.<ref name=\":0\" /> Du Maurier described the plot as \"a sinister tale about a woman who marries a widower....Psychological and rather macabre.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Derivation and inspiration===\nSome commentators have noted parallels with [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Du Maurier's 'Rebecca,' A Worthy 'Eyre' Apparent |work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61821-2004Mar15.html |accessdate=12 December 2006 |first=Jonathan |last=Yardley |date=16 March 2004 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68H11m0Tb |archivedate=8 June 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite news | title=Presence of Orson Welles in Robert Stevenson's Jane Eyre (1944) | work=Literature Film Quarterly | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3768/is_200301/ai_n9228494/print| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124114310/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3768/is_200301/ai_n9228494/print| url-status=dead| archive-date=2007-01-24}}</ref> Another of du Maurier's works, ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]],'' is also linked to one of the Bront\u00eb sisters' works, Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''.

In the book, Mrs Danvers serves as something of a [[bogeyman]] for the main character Mike Noonan. King also uses the character name for the chilly, obedient servant in \"Father's Day\", a tale in his 1982 film ''[[Creepshow]]''.\n\nIn [[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series, in the bookworld, they have accidentally made thousands of Mrs Danvers clones, which they use as troops against The Mispeling Vyrus and other threats.\n\nIn ''[[The Maxx]]'' issue No. 31, a teenage Julie Winters watches a black-and-white version of the movie.\n\nIn  ''[[Fifty Shades Darker]]'' by [[E.L. James]], Anastasia Steele reads ''Rebecca'' after an argument with Christian Grey. Anastasia is haunted by Christian's previous relationships with his \"submissives\" and like the second Mrs de Winters, is fearful she doesn't measure up.\n\nIn [[Danielle Steel]]'s novel ''Vanished'', it is mentioned that the main character is reading ''Rebecca''. This was most likely deliberate on Steele's part, considering that the novel has many of the same elements as ''Rebecca''.\n\nIn [[Linda Howard]]'s 2010 novel ''Veil of Night'', Eric compares an assistant to Danvers as well as stating he read the book under protest to pass a high school literature class.\n\n===Film===\nThe 1983 science fiction comedy film ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'' gives a brief nod to aspects of ''Rebecca.'' After falling for Dolores Benedict, Dr Hfuhruhurr ([[Steve Martin]]) intends to marry her and seeks a sign from the portrait of his deceased wife, Rebecca. The supernatural reaction of the portrait doesn't convince him and so he places her in a cupboard.\n\n===Television===\nThe 1970 Parallel Time storyline of the Gothic soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' was heavily inspired by ''Rebecca'' including the costume ball scene. Also the second ''Dark Shadows'' motion picture, ''[[Night of Dark Shadows]]'' took inspiration from the novel including a mention by Kate Jackson's character who hopes the housekeeper is not like Mrs Danvers\n\nThe film was parodied on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' in a 1972 skit called \"Rebecky\", with [[Carol Burnett]] as the heroine, Daphne; [[Harvey Korman]] as Max \"de Wintry\" and in the guise of Mother Marcus as Rebecky de Wintry; and [[Vicki Lawrence]] as Mrs Dampers. The story was again referenced in an episode of the series \"Mama's Family\" (a spinoff of the Burnett show) titled \"I Do, I Don't.\" In it, Bubba, Iola, and Mama each have nightmares about married life. Mama's dream is a parody of the ''Rebecca'' scenario.\n<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1787561 The Carol Burnett Show: Episode No. 6.3 (27 September 1972)], Internet Movie Database.

It concerns an unnamed young woman who impetuously marries a wealthy widower, only to discover that he and his household are haunted by the memory of his late first wife, the title character. A best-seller which has never gone out of print, ''Rebecca'' sold 2.8&nbsp;million copies between its publication in 1938 and 1965. It has been adapted numerous times for stage and screen, including a 1939 play by du Maurier herself, and the film, ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile working as the companion to a rich American woman on holiday in [[Monte Carlo]], the unnamed narrator, a na\u00efve young woman in her early 20s, becomes acquainted with a wealthy Englishman, George Fortescue Maximilian \"Maxim\" de Winter, a 42-year-old widower. After a fortnight of courtship, she agrees to marry him and, after the wedding and honeymoon, accompanies him to his mansion in [[Cornwall]], the beautiful estate [[Manderley]].\n\nMrs Danvers, the sinister housekeeper, was profoundly devoted to the first Mrs de Winter, Rebecca, who died in a boating accident about a year before Maxim and the second Mrs de Winter met. She continually attempts to undermine the new Mrs de Winter psychologically, subtly suggesting to her that she will never attain the beauty, [[urbanity]], and charm her predecessor possessed. Whenever the new Mrs de Winter attempts to make changes at Manderley, Mrs Danvers describes how Rebecca ran it when she was alive. Each time Mrs Danvers does this, she implies that the new Mrs de Winter lacks the experience and knowledge necessary for running an important estate. Cowed by Mrs Danvers' imposing manner, and the other members of West Country society's unwavering reverence for Rebecca, the new mistress becomes isolated.\n\nShe is soon convinced that Maxim regrets his impetuous decision to marry her and is still deeply in love with the seemingly perfect Rebecca. The climax occurs at Manderley's annual costume ball. Mrs Danvers manipulates the protagonist into wearing a replica of the dress shown in a portrait of one of the former inhabitants of the house\u2014hiding the fact that the same costume was worn by Rebecca to much acclaim shortly before her death. The narrator has a drummer announce her entrance using the name of the lady in the portrait: Caroline de Winter. When the narrator shows Maxim the dress, he gets very angry at her and orders her to change.\n\nShortly after the ball, Mrs Danvers reveals her contempt for the second Mrs de Winter, believing she is trying to replace Rebecca, and reveals her deep, unhealthy obsession with the dead woman. Mrs Danvers tries to get Mrs de Winter to commit suicide by encouraging her to jump out of the window. However, she is thwarted at the last moment by the disturbance occasioned by a nearby shipwreck. A diver investigating the condition of the wrecked ship's hull also discovers the remains of Rebecca's sailing boat, with her decomposed body still on board.\n\nThis discovery causes Maxim to confess the truth to the second Mrs de Winter. He tells her how his marriage to Rebecca was nothing but a sham: how from the very first days husband and wife loathed each other. Rebecca, Maxim reveals, was a cruel and selfish woman who manipulated everyone around her into believing her to be the perfect wife and a paragon of virtue. She repeatedly taunted Maxim with sordid tales of her numerous love affairs. The night of her death, she told Maxim that she was pregnant with another man's child, which she would raise under the pretense that it was Maxim's and he would be [[Presumption of legitimacy|powerless to stop her]]. In a rage, he had shot her through the heart, then disposed of her body by placing it in her boat and sinking it at sea. The second Mrs de Winter thinks little of Maxim's murder confession, but instead is relieved to hear that Maxim has always loved her and never Rebecca.\n\nRebecca's boat is raised and it is discovered that it was deliberately sunk. An [[inquest]] brings a verdict of suicide. However, Rebecca's first cousin, and lover, Jack Favell, attempts to blackmail Maxim, claiming to have proof that Rebecca could not have intended suicide based on a note she sent to him the night she died.\n\nIt is revealed that Rebecca had had an appointment with a Doctor Baker in London shortly before her death, presumably to confirm her pregnancy. When the doctor is found, he reveals that Rebecca had been suffering from [[cancer]] and would have died within a few months. Furthermore, due to the malformation of her [[uterus]], she could never have been pregnant. Maxim assumes that Rebecca, knowing that she was going to die, manipulated him into killing her quickly. Mrs Danvers had said after the inquiry that Rebecca feared nothing except dying a lingering death.\n\nMaxim feels a great sense of foreboding, and insists on driving through the night to return to Manderley. However, before he comes in sight of the house, it is clear from a glow on the horizon and wind-borne ashes that it is ablaze.\n\nThe novel is remembered especially<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.strandmag.com/the-magazine/articles/daphne-du-mauriers-rebecca/|author=Charles L.P. Silet|title=Daphne DuMaurier's Rebecca|journal=The Strand Magazine}}</ref> for the character [[Mrs. Danvers]], the fictional estate [[Manderley]], and its opening line: {{Quote|\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\" |The second Mrs de Winter}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n* '''The Narrator/the Second Mrs de Winter''': A timid, na\u00efve, middle-class woman in her early twenties, who enjoys sketching. Neither the narrator's first nor maiden name is revealed. She is referred to as \"my wife\", Mrs de Winter, \"my dear\", and so on. The one time she is introduced with a name is during a fancy dress ball, in which she dresses as a de Winter ancestor and is introduced as \"Caroline de Winter\", although this is clearly not her own name. She signs her name as \"Mrs M. de Winter\", using Maxim's initial. Early in the novel she receives a letter and remarks that her name was correctly spelled, which is \"an unusual thing,\" suggesting her name is uncommon, foreign or complex. While courting her, Maxim compliments her on her \"lovely and unusual name\". Despite her timidity, she gradually matures throughout the novel, refusing to be a victim of Rebecca's phantom-like influence any longer and becoming a strong, assertive woman in her own right.\n* '''George Fortescue Maximilian \"Maxim\" de Winter''': The reserved, unemotional owner of Manderley. He marries his new wife after a brief courtship, yet displays little affection toward her after the marriage. Emotionally scarred by his traumatic marriage to Rebecca, his distance toward his new wife causes her to fear he regrets his marriage to her and is still broken-hearted over Rebecca's death. Maxim killed Rebecca in a blind rage after she pushed him over the edge with her lie that she was carrying the child of one of her lovers and would force him to raise it as his own. He does eventually reveal to his new wife that he does love her, but not until several months of marriage have passed. His full name is tauntingly revealed, by Jack Favell, to be '''George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter'''.\n* '''Mrs Danvers''': The cold, creepy, overbearing housekeeper of Manderley. Danvers was Rebecca's family maid when she was a child and has lived with her for years. She is unhealthily obsessed with Rebecca and preserving Rebecca's memory. She resents the new Mrs de Winter, convinced she is trying to \"take Rebecca's place\". She tries to destroy the marriage, but her efforts fail and only serve to bring Maxim and his new wife closer together. After her scheme is ruined, Mrs Danvers apparently burns Manderley to the ground, preferring to destroy it than allow Maxim to share his home with another lover and wife. She is nicknamed '''Danny''' which is derived from her last name; her first name being unknown or unimportant, but in [[Sally Beauman]]'s sequel ''[[Rebecca's Tale]]'' it was said to be '''Edith'''.\n* '''Rebecca de Winter''': The unseen, deceased titular character, who has been dead for less than a year. A famous beauty, and on the surface a devoted wife and perfect hostess, Rebecca was actually a compulsive liar and an openly promiscuous woman who tormented her husband Maxim with lurid tales of her nonstop affairs. Her lingering presence overwhelms Manderley, dominating the visitors, the staff and the new Mrs de Winter. Through dialogue, it is slowly revealed that Rebecca possessed all the signs of a [[psychopath]]: habitual lying, superficial charm, expert manipulation, no conscience and no remorse. She was also revealed to be somewhat sadistic \u2014 Danvers tells a story of Rebecca, during her teenage years, cruelly whipping a horse until it bled. In the [[Rebecca (1940 film)|1940 film adaptation]], her maiden name was said to be '''Henrich'''.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* '''Frank Crawley:''' The hard-working, dutiful [[Estate agent|agent]] of Manderley. He is said to be Maxim's trusted advisor and faithful confidant. He soon becomes a good friend to the second Mrs de Winter, and helps her in the self-doubt of her inability to rule Manderley as its mistress.\n* '''Beatrice Lacy (formerly de Winter):''' Maxim's wilful and quick-witted sister, who develops an immediate fondness for the new Mrs de Winter. Prior to the novel, she had married Giles Lacy. She, along with her brother, is one of the few people who knew Rebecca's true, vile nature, and was one of her victims: Beatrice's husband was seduced by her.\n* '''Giles Lacy:''' The slightly slow-witted husband of Beatrice, and Maxim's brother-in-law. He was one of the many men who fell for Rebecca's charms.\n* '''Frith:''' The middle-aged, kind and devoted butler at Manderley. He had worked for the de Winters when Maxim's late father was a boy.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n* '''Robert:''' A footman.\n* '''Clarice:''' Mrs de Winter's faithful and trusted [[Lady's maid|maid]]. She aided her lady and mistress in fitting her white, frilly gown for the fancy dress ball. She replaces the original maid, Alice, later on.\n* '''Jack Favell:''' The crafty and sneaky first cousin of the late Rebecca de Winter and her most frequent [[boyfriend]]/[[sexual partner|lover]].

The best known of these is the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]\u2013winning 1940 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film version ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'', the first film Hitchcock made under his contract with [[David O. Selznick]]. The film, which starred [[Laurence Olivier]] as Max, [[Joan Fontaine]] as the heroine, and [[Judith Anderson]] as Mrs Danvers, was based on the novel. However, the Hollywood [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] required that if Max had murdered his wife, he would have to be punished for his crime.

In the book, Mrs Danvers serves as something of a [[bogeyman]] for the main character Mike Noonan. King also uses the character name for the chilly, obedient servant in \"Father's Day\", a tale in his 1982 film ''[[Creepshow]]''.\n\nIn [[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series, in the bookworld, they have accidentally made thousands of Mrs Danvers clones, which they use as troops against The Mispeling Vyrus and other threats.\n\nIn ''[[The Maxx]]'' issue No. 31, a teenage Julie Winters watches a black-and-white version of the movie.\n\nIn  ''[[Fifty Shades Darker]]'' by [[E.L. James]], Anastasia Steele reads ''Rebecca'' after an argument with Christian Grey. Anastasia is haunted by Christian's previous relationships with his \"submissives\" and like the second Mrs de Winters, is fearful she doesn't measure up.\n\nIn [[Danielle Steel]]'s novel ''Vanished'', it is mentioned that the main character is reading ''Rebecca''. This was most likely deliberate on Steele's part, considering that the novel has many of the same elements as ''Rebecca''.\n\nIn [[Linda Howard]]'s 2010 novel ''Veil of Night'', Eric compares an assistant to Danvers as well as stating he read the book under protest to pass a high school literature class.\n\n===Film===\nThe 1983 science fiction comedy film ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'' gives a brief nod to aspects of ''Rebecca.'' After falling for Dolores Benedict, Dr Hfuhruhurr ([[Steve Martin]]) intends to marry her and seeks a sign from the portrait of his deceased wife, Rebecca. The supernatural reaction of the portrait doesn't convince him and so he places her in a cupboard.\n\n===Television===\nThe 1970 Parallel Time storyline of the Gothic soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' was heavily inspired by ''Rebecca'' including the costume ball scene. Also the second ''Dark Shadows'' motion picture, ''[[Night of Dark Shadows]]'' took inspiration from the novel including a mention by Kate Jackson's character who hopes the housekeeper is not like Mrs Danvers\n\nThe film was parodied on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' in a 1972 skit called \"Rebecky\", with [[Carol Burnett]] as the heroine, Daphne; [[Harvey Korman]] as Max \"de Wintry\" and in the guise of Mother Marcus as Rebecky de Wintry; and [[Vicki Lawrence]] as Mrs Dampers. The story was again referenced in an episode of the series \"Mama's Family\" (a spinoff of the Burnett show) titled \"I Do, I Don't.\" In it, Bubba, Iola, and Mama each have nightmares about married life. Mama's dream is a parody of the ''Rebecca'' scenario.\n<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1787561 The Carol Burnett Show: Episode No. 6.3 (27 September 1972)], Internet Movie Database.

It includes day-to-day care, [[selective breeding]] and the raising of [[livestock]].\n\nHusbandry has a long history, starting with the [[Neolithic revolution]] when animals were first [[Domestication|domesticated]], from around 13,000 BC onwards, antedating farming of the [[History of agriculture|first crops]]. By the time of early civilisations such as [[ancient Egypt]], [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s and [[pig]]s were being raised on farms.\n\nMajor changes took place in the [[Columbian Exchange]] when Old World livestock were brought to the New World, and then in the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the [[English Longhorn|Dishley Longhorn]] cattle and [[Lincoln (sheep)|Lincoln Longwool]] sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists such as [[Robert Bakewell (agriculturalist)|Robert Bakewell]] to yield more meat, milk, and [[wool]].\n\nA wide range of other species such as [[horse]], [[water buffalo]], [[llama]], [[rabbit]] and [[guinea pig]] are used as livestock in some parts of the world. [[Insect farming]], as well as [[aquaculture]] of [[fish]], [[mollusc]]s, and [[crustacean]]s, is widespread.\n\nModern animal husbandry relies on [[Agriculture#Livestock production systems|production systems]] adapted to the type of land available. [[Subsistence farming]] is being superseded by [[intensive animal farming]] in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density [[feedlots]], and thousands of [[chicken]]s may be raised in broiler houses or [[battery farm|batteries]]. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves.\n\nMost livestock are [[herbivore]]s, except for pigs and chickens which are [[omnivore]]s. [[Ruminantia|Ruminants]] like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the [[cellulose]] in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe verb ''to husband'', meaning \"to manage carefully,\" derives from an older meaning of ''[[husband]]'', which in the 14th century referred to the ownership and care of a household or farm, but today means the \"control or judicious use of resources,\" and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants or animals.<ref>Merriam\u2013Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</ref> [[Farmer]]s and [[rancher]]s who raise livestock are considered to practice ''animal husbandry''; in modern times, large [[agribusiness|agricultural companies]] relying on mass production and advanced technology have largely superseded individual farmers as the chief food-animal producers in [[developed country|developed countries]].\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of agriculture}}\n\n===Birth of husbandry===\n{{main|Neolithic Revolution|Domestication of animals}}\n[[File:Fat tailed sheep, Afghanistan, 1976.jpg|thumb|left|The domestication of ruminants, like these [[fat-tailed sheep]] in Afghanistan, provided [[pastoral nomad|nomads]] across the Middle East and central Asia with a reliable source of food.|alt=Fat-tailed sheep in Afghanistan]]\n\nThe [[domestication]] of livestock was driven by the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to the domesticator, should be able to thrive in his or her company, should breed freely, and be easy to tend.<ref name=Clutton-Brock>{{cite book|last=Clutton-Brock|first=Juliet|author-link=Juliet Clutton-Brock|title=A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgL-EbbB8a0C&pg=PR1|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63495-3|pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nDomestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places.

The great majority of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The [[battery cage]]s are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm-animals/chickens/egg-laying-hens|title=About egg laying hens|publisher=Compassion in World Farming|access-date=26 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the developed world, the majority of the poultry reared for meat is raised indoors in big sheds, with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions. Chickens raised in this way are known as broilers, and genetic improvements have meant that they can be grown to slaughter weight within six or seven weeks of hatching. Newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating. Litter on the floor absorbs the droppings and the area occupied is expanded as they grow. Feed and water is supplied automatically and the lighting is controlled.

It includes day-to-day care, [[selective breeding]] and the raising of [[livestock]].\n\nHusbandry has a long history, starting with the [[Neolithic revolution]] when animals were first [[Domestication|domesticated]], from around 13,000 BC onwards, antedating farming of the [[History of agriculture|first crops]]. By the time of early civilisations such as [[ancient Egypt]], [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s and [[pig]]s were being raised on farms.\n\nMajor changes took place in the [[Columbian Exchange]] when Old World livestock were brought to the New World, and then in the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the [[English Longhorn|Dishley Longhorn]] cattle and [[Lincoln (sheep)|Lincoln Longwool]] sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists such as [[Robert Bakewell (agriculturalist)|Robert Bakewell]] to yield more meat, milk, and [[wool]].\n\nA wide range of other species such as [[horse]], [[water buffalo]], [[llama]], [[rabbit]] and [[guinea pig]] are used as livestock in some parts of the world. [[Insect farming]], as well as [[aquaculture]] of [[fish]], [[mollusc]]s, and [[crustacean]]s, is widespread.\n\nModern animal husbandry relies on [[Agriculture#Livestock production systems|production systems]] adapted to the type of land available. [[Subsistence farming]] is being superseded by [[intensive animal farming]] in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density [[feedlots]], and thousands of [[chicken]]s may be raised in broiler houses or [[battery farm|batteries]]. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves.\n\nMost livestock are [[herbivore]]s, except for pigs and chickens which are [[omnivore]]s. [[Ruminantia|Ruminants]] like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the [[cellulose]] in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe verb ''to husband'', meaning \"to manage carefully,\" derives from an older meaning of ''[[husband]]'', which in the 14th century referred to the ownership and care of a household or farm, but today means the \"control or judicious use of resources,\" and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants or animals.<ref>Merriam\u2013Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</ref> [[Farmer]]s and [[rancher]]s who raise livestock are considered to practice ''animal husbandry''; in modern times, large [[agribusiness|agricultural companies]] relying on mass production and advanced technology have largely superseded individual farmers as the chief food-animal producers in [[developed country|developed countries]].\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of agriculture}}\n\n===Birth of husbandry===\n{{main|Neolithic Revolution|Domestication of animals}}\n[[File:Fat tailed sheep, Afghanistan, 1976.jpg|thumb|left|The domestication of ruminants, like these [[fat-tailed sheep]] in Afghanistan, provided [[pastoral nomad|nomads]] across the Middle East and central Asia with a reliable source of food.|alt=Fat-tailed sheep in Afghanistan]]\n\nThe [[domestication]] of livestock was driven by the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive.

Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly in line with the most widely held position in the western world, a form of [[utilitarianism]]: that it is [[moral philosophy|morally acceptable]] for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock.
