Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\nThe [[Hardal]] (\u200e \u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9 \u1e24aredi Le'umi, lit.\u2009\"Nationalist [[Haredi]]\") are a sub-community; stricter in observance, and more \"statist\" in their politics.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''Hardal'' community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \nStudents at Mercaz HaRav, and some Hardal yeshivot, undertake their Service through a modified form of Hesder.\n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF.

(Many wear other types of headcoverings, such as black velvet ''kippot''.) \nTheir dress, otherwise, is largely the same as for secular Israelis; beards are uncommon, although mustaches are often seen in the older generations.\nWomen usually wear skirts, and often cover their hair.\nSee under [[Tzniut]]: [[Tzniut#Dress|#Dress]] and [[Tzniut#Hair covering|#Hair covering]].\n\nIn the ''Hardal'' community, the dress is generally more formal, with an emphasis on appearing neat.  \nThe Kippot, also knitted, are significantly larger, and it is common for [[tzitzit]] to be worn visibly, as is the [[Haredi]] practice; ''[[Payot]]'' (sidelocks) are similarly common, as is an (untrimmed) beard.\nWomen invariably cover their hair - usually with a [[snood]], or a ''mitpachat'' (Hebrew for \"kerchief\") - and often wear sandals.\n\nAt prayer, members of the community use the [[Koren Siddur]] or ''[[Rinat Yisrael]]''.\n\n== Notable figures ==\n* [[Yehuda Amital]]\n* [[Eli Sadan]] \n* [[Shlomo Aviner]]\n* [[Naftali Bennett]]\n* [[Yosef Burg]]\n* [[She'ar Yashuv Cohen]]\n* [[Haim Druckman]]\n* [[Effi Eitam]]\n* [[Mordechai Eliyahu]]\n* [[Moshe Feiglin]]\n* [[Shlomo Goren]]\n* [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]]\n* [[Meir Kahane]]\n* [[Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane]]\n* [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]\n* [[Avraham Yitzchak Kook]]\n* [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]]\n* [[Dov Lior]]\n* [[Rafi Peretz]]\n* [[Zevulun Orlev]]\n* [[Shlomo Riskin]]\n* [[Avraham Shapira]]\n* [[Shaul Yisraeli]]\n* [[Oury Amos Cherki]]\n* [[Bezalel Smotrich]]\n* [[Baruch Marzel]]\n* [[Michael Ben-Ari]]\n* [[Baruch Goldstein]]\n* [[Yisrael Ariel]]\n* [[Yehuda Glick]]\n* [[Aharon Lichtenstein]]\n* [[Yaakov Ariel]]\n* [[Jonathan Sacks]]\n* [[Hanan Porat]]\n* [[Zvi Thau]]\n* [[Yaaqov Medan]]\n* [[Haim Sabato]]\n* [[Nahum Rabinovitch]]\n* [[Robert Aumann]]\n* [[Uri Orbach]]\n* [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]\n* [[Shimon Gershon Rosenberg]]\n* [[Joseph B.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\nThe [[Hardal]] (\u200e \u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9 \u1e24aredi Le'umi, lit.\u2009\"Nationalist [[Haredi]]\") are a sub-community; stricter in observance, and more \"statist\" in their politics.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''Hardal'' community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \nStudents at Mercaz HaRav, and some Hardal yeshivot, undertake their Service through a modified form of Hesder.\n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF. The IDF undertook that all modesty and kosher issues will be handled in order to make female Religious Zionists comfortable.\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', or \"sruggim\", referring to the knitted or crocheted ''[[kippot]]'' (skullcaps) worn by the men.

As a result of the war, the eastern third of Sweden was established as the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] within the Russian Empire.  Other notable effects were the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Swedish parliament]]'s adoption of a [[Instrument of Government (1809)|new constitution]] and the establishment of the [[House of Bernadotte]], the new [[Swedish Act of Succession|Swedish royal house]], in 1818.\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Chronology of battles and events of the Finnish War}}\n[[File:Alexander I of Russia by G.Dawe (1826, Peterhof).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Alexander I, Emperor of Russia]]\n[[File:Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gustav IV Adolf, King of Sweden]]\nAfter the Russian Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] concluded the 1807 [[Treaty of Tilsit]] with [[Napoleon]], Alexander, in his letter on 24 September 1807 to the Swedish King [[Gustav IV Adolf]], informed the king that the peaceful relations between Russia and Sweden depended on Swedish agreement to abide by the limitations of the Treaty of Tilsit which in practice meant that Sweden would have been required to follow the [[Continental System]].{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=222}} The king, who viewed [[Napoleon]] as the [[Antichrist]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] as his ally against Napoleon's France, was apprehensive of the system's ruinous consequences for Sweden's maritime commerce.  He instead entered into negotiations with Britain in order to prepare a joint attack against [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Denmark]], whose Norwegian possessions he coveted.\n\nIn the meantime, the [[Royal Navy]] [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|attacked Copenhagen]] and the [[Anglo-Russian War (1807\u20131812)]] was declared. Referring to the treaties of 1780 and 1800, the emperor demanded that Gustav Adolf close the [[Baltic Sea]] to all foreign warships. Although he reiterated his demand on November 16, 1807, it took two months before the king responded that it was impossible to honor the previous arrangements as long as the French were in control of the major Baltic ports. King Gustav Adolf did this after securing an alliance with Britain on 8 February 1808. Meanwhile, on 30 December 1807 Russia announced that should Sweden not give a clear reply Russia would be forced to act.\n\nAlthough most Swedish officers were skeptical about their chances in fighting the larger and more experienced Russian army, Gustav Adolf had an unrealistic view of Sweden's ability to defend itself against Russia. In [[Saint Petersburg]], his stubbornness was viewed as a convenient pretext to occupy [[Finland]], thus pushing the Russo-Swedish frontier considerably to the west of the Russian capital and safeguarding it in case of any future hostilities between the two powers.\n\nThe situation was problematic for Sweden, since it once again faced both Denmark and Russia as potential enemies requiring the Swedes to split their forces.  The king had thought it impossible to defend Finland should the enemy attack during the winter and chose largely to ignore the repeated warnings of the Russian threat he received in early 1808. Most of the Swedish plans assumed that warfare would be impossible during winter, disregarding the lessons from recent wars. In addition, several new good roads had been built into Finland greatly reducing the earlier dependency on naval support for any large operation in Finland.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=223-225}}\n\nThe Swedish plan was to first passively defend and hold on to the fortifications in the southern coast of Finland, in which Sweden had strong garrisons, while the rest of the Swedish army retreated to the north. Then in the spring, counterattack simultaneously from north and south, when the Swedish army would have naval support and the Russian army would be spread over Finland and thus have long supply lines. The basic reason for the plan was to avoid major decisive battles. \n\nSome advocates existed for taking a more active approach immediately, namely Lieutenant Colonel Samuel M\u00f6ller (fi) who advocated for taking an immediate offensive and [[Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt]] who supported actively delaying the advancing enemies in co-operation with the garrisons in the southern coast. \n\nIn the end instructions which the new Swedish commander in Finland, General [[Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor]], received from the king were an unsuccessful and open-ended mixture of ideas from these very different plans.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=223-226}}\n\nRussia had gathered a wealth of information from Finland using spies and other sources.  The level of detail was so great that Russian maps of Finland were in many respects more accurate than their Swedish counterparts. The Russians used the services of General [[Georg Magnus Sprengtporten]] when forming their plans. Sprengtporten suggested going on to an offensive during the winter since Finland would be mostly isolated when seas were frozen. His ideas were further developed by General [[Jan Pieter van Suchtelen]] before General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden]] was appointed as the commander of the Russian army in Finland in December 1807.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=226-230}}\n\nThe plan involved using the series of fortifications built after 1790 as staging grounds for the Russian advances into Finland. In southern Finland, armies were to isolate the fortifications and first take control of the whole of southern Finland before advancing further to the north. Forces in [[Savonia (historical province)|Savolax]] (Finnish: ''Savo'') were to press hard against the Swedes and reach the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] towards [[Oulu|Ule\u00e5borg]] (Finnish: ''Oulu'') and [[Vaasa|Vasa]] (Finnish: ''Vaasa'') to cut off the retreat of the main body of the Swedish army.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=228-230}}\n\n== February \u2013 May 1808 ==\n[[File:The Finnish war map1.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, February 1808 at the outbreak of the war]]\nOn February 21, 1808, 24,000 Russian troops under [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoevden]] crossed the border in [[Ahvenkoski]] and took the town of [[Loviisa|Lovisa]] (Finnish: ''Loviisa'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/southern_towns_mark_war_of_finland_bicentennial/5823726|title=Southern Towns Mark War of Finland Bicentennial|author=|publisher=Yle News|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=1 September 2017|language=}}</ref> Since Klingspor had not arrived, Lieutenant General [[Karl Nathanael af Klercker]] acted as Swedish commander in Finland. He was notified of the Russian invasion already on 21 February and since it was impossible to hold the predefined defense lines as the army had not yet fully assembled he ordered the army to assemble at [[H\u00e4meenlinna|Tavastehus]] (Finnish: ''H\u00e4meenlinna''). Before the engagement started Klingspor finally arrived on 2 March and assumed command. Instead of facing the Russians at Tavastehus he ordered the army to withdraw. In [[Savonia (historical province)|Savolax]] the Russians also forced the Swedes to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=234-235}} The king was quite unprepared for the attack, especially as war was not declared until April. About 21,000 Swedish troops were stationed in various fortresses in Finland, while the rest of his army was unable to leave southern Sweden for fear of Danish attack.\n\nThe Russian advance was swift. On the first day of the war they had captured the town of Lovisa and besieged the Swedish sea fortress of [[Svartholm fortress|Svartholm]]. [[Porvoo|Borg\u00e5]] (Finnish: ''Porvoo'') was captured on 24 February and [[Helsinki|Helsingfors]] (Finnish: ''Helsinki'') on 2 March. Abandoned Swedish fortifications on the [[Hang\u00f6 Peninsula]] (Finnish: ''Hanko'') were taken and manned on 21 March and on the same day the Russian army took [[Turku|\u00c5bo]] (Finnish: ''Turku'') while a small detachment was sent to [[\u00c5land]]. Before the end of March 1808 even [[Vaasa|Vasa]] was taken. In Savolax, Russians also advanced rapidly and took [[Kuopio]] on 16 March. Swedish forces had mostly just withdrawn before the advancing Russian often destroying usable materials. For example, the Swedish [[archipelago fleet]]'s ships that been docked in \u00c5bo (nearly 50 gun sloops) were torched to prevent their capture.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=234-235}}\n\nThe Swedish fortress of [[Svartholm fortress|Svartholm]], commanded by Major [[Carl Magnus Gripenberg]], was ill-prepared for a war. While the garrison was 700 men strong, only a third of the men had actually functioning weapons, while most of the fortress' guns had no carriages. The fortress had fallen into disrepair and lacked both adequate food and ammunition stores. Even the wells were found to be unusable. After starting the siege on 21 February, the Russians issued a surrender demand for the fort, but this was refused by the Swedes. The demand was repeated on 2 March but without success. After a meager Russian bombardment, Gripenberg agreed to negotiations on 10 March. The fortress surrendered to the Russians on 18 March after a siege that had lasted roughly a month, with just one man having been wounded in action.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=232,235-238}}\n\n[[Sveaborg]] (Finnish: ''Suomenlinna'') under Admiral [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]] had been well prepared for the war with a garrison of 6,000 men, over 700 cannons, and enough stores to last until the summer of 1808. Defenses were strong enough to prevent the Russians from trying to storm the fortress by surprise. Instead the Russians [[Siege of Sveaborg|laid siege against Sveaborg]]. The fortress surrendered on 6 May 1808 after prolonged negotiations with the Russians as the commanding officer [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]] and his council believed that resistance was futile. The Russians gained the main body of the Swedish archipelago fleet intact as well as large stores of supplies and munitions.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=232-233,238-244}}\n\nThe Russians had advanced considerably but they had also gained the long and vulnerable coastline with it. After the sea would be clear of ice there would be nothing to prevent Swedish forces from landing troops on the shore. With the Royal Navy supporting the Swedish battle fleet there was little the Russian battle fleet could accomplish. Capture of the main body of the Swedish archipelago fleet had resulted in a real advantage to the Russians since it allowed them to gain superiority in the narrow waters of the Finnish archipelago where large ships of the line could not operate. Even the powerful explosion at Sveaborg which destroyed several of the captured ships did little to change Russian superiority in the Finnish archipelago. The Russians utilized the guns from the burned ships, and from those which burned during the winter, and constructed several fortifications on the coast, both in Hang\u00f6 as well as along narrow passages leading to \u00c5bo.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=245-248}}\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map2.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, March - May 1808]]\nUnder Colonel [[Carl Johan Adlercreutz]] the Swedish army [[Battle of Siikajoki|counter-attacked at Siikajoki]] and began to halt the Russian offensive. Soon after at the [[Battle of Revolax]] (Finnish: ''Revonlahti''), the Swedish army under Colonel [[Johan Adam Cronstedt]] started an advance towards the south. These successes yielded a promotion to Field Marshal for [[Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor]]. The Swedish advance was very slow however, as operations were often halted due to the thaw. An exception was the brigade under Colonel [[Johan August Sandels]], which swiftly advanced towards [[Kuopio]]. [[Nikolay Tuchkov]], a Russian general who was dispatched to the north of Finland, left garrisons in every fort along his way. This reduced his unit to 4,000 troops, which proved insufficient to pacify the hostile country. The Finns rose up in guerrilla fighting as far east as Frederikshamn (Finnish: ''[[Hamina]]'') within the [[Old Finland]] province of Russia.\n\nIn May, the Russians suffered further setbacks when they were driven from [[Gotland]] and \u00c5land, where a Swedish [[flotilla]], supported by the local population, compelled the small Russian force left on the main island of [[Fasta \u00c5land]] to surrender, and then invaded the island of [[Kumlinge]] where the bulk of the Russian garrison on the [[\u00c5land Islands]] was based. After a two-hour-long battle, the local militia, together with the Swedish landing force, overwhelmed their enemies and Colonel Vuich and his garrison were compelled to surrender. \n\nOn May 26, a British fleet carrying 14,000 troops under [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]] entered the [[port of Gothenburg]]. Due to various disagreements with the Swedish king, however, they never landed and sailed off to fight the French in [[Spain]] after leaving 16 battleships and 20 other ships at Sweden's disposal.\n\n== June \u2013 July 1808 ==\nThe Swedish battlefleet which had been expelling Russians from [[Gotland]] was ordered to blockade the [[Hang\u00f6 Peninsula]] and reached the cape on 10 June. Due to bad weather and poor visibility the fleet under [[Rudolf Cederstr\u00f6m|Admiral Rudolph Cederstr\u00f6m]] chose to stay relatively far from the coast. Upon approaching the coast on 21 June, Cederstr\u00f6m learned that the Russians had already passed the cape some time earlier. Attempts to stop the Russians deeper in the archipelago were also unsuccessful. Failure to block the Russians led the king to relieve Cederstr\u00f6m of his duties and replace him with Commander Henrik Johan Nauckhoff.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=256-258}}\n\nMajor General Eberhard Ernst von Vegesack was chosen to lead the first Swedish army to Finland. He was to lead a force of 2,600 men, land somewhere between [[Uusikaupunki|Nystad]] (Finnish: ''Uusikaupunki'') and [[Turku|\u00c5bo]], and then capture the latter. Von Vegesack instead chose to land his force at the Lemo (Finnish: ''Lemu'') manor house a few kilometers south of [[Turku|\u00c5bo]]. [[Battle of Lemo|The landing]] began on 19 June and was initially successful. The surprised Russians garrisoned at \u00c5bo reacted quickly, however, and deployed over 3,000 men to stop the landing force. By the morning of 20 June, the Swedish forces were forced to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=258-262}}  In addition, Colonel Johan Bergenstr\u00e5hle landed 1,100 Swedes just a few kilometers northeast of [[Vaasa|Vasa]] on 25 June and managed to quickly advance to the town. The Russians, however, managed to gather a force of 3,000 men which was able to force the ill-trained Swedes to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=262-264}}\n\nThe advance of the Russian coastal squadron beyond Hang\u00f6 created difficulties for the Swedes. The strength of the Swedish coastal forces deployed to the Finnish archipelago was equal in size to the coastal fleet that the Russians had obtained by the Sveaborg surrender. To prevent the Russians from gaining strength, the Swedish coastal fleet's unit under Rear Admiral Claes Hjelmstjerna tried to engage them twice in battle. The first was at the [[Battle of Rimito Kramp]] on 30 June, and after Russians withdrew closer to [[Turku|\u00c5bo]], the second was a battle at Pukkisaari on 4 July. Fighting ended in a stalemate, but can be viewed as a Swedish failure since they failed to decisively defeat the Russians.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=266-269}}\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map3.svg|thumb|left|Finnish War, May - October 1808]]\nHaving been alerted to the approach of additional Russian coastal units from Sveaborg, the Swedish forces moved to intercept them before they could link up with the Russian coastal unit now bottled up at \u00c5bo. Learning that the Russians intended to go around the island of [[Kimito\u00f6n (island)|Kimito]] (Finnish: ''Kimito\u00f6n''), a Swedish force of gunboats was deployed to the narrows. They met the Russians first at [[Battle of Sand\u00f6str\u00f6m|Tallholmen]] on 21 July and again on 2 August in the [[Battle of Sand\u00f6str\u00f6m]]. Swedish attempts to land troops and artillery in support of the gunboats at Vestank\u00e4rr on 2 August ended in failure, though the attempt came very close to capturing General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden]]. While none of the fights ended with a decisive winner, the overall strategic victory went to Russia, who gained advantage in the Finnish archipelago by managing to link up their separate coastal units.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=270-276}}\n\nSweden performed several small landings along the coast near [[Kristinestad]] (Finnish: ''Kristiinankaupunki'') and [[Kaskinen|Kask\u00f6]] (Finnish: ''Kaskinen'') and managed to raise local men to oppose the Russians. The first occurred on 3 July with several others taking place soon after. Altogether the Swedes had several hundred local men-in-arms. The Russians, however, were able to send reinforcements to the area which were, in addition to being numerically superior, both far better trained and equipped than the peasants and militia the Swedes had raised. By the end of July the small forces Sweden had landed and the men that had supported them were either beaten or withdrawn back to their ships.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=279-280}}\n\n== August \u2013 September 1808 ==\nAfter the Russians were driven from Central Finland, their forces stretched along the line of [[Pori]] \u2014 [[Tampere]] \u2014 [[Mikkeli]]. Having received considerable reinforcements, their numbers increased to 55,000, as opposed to the 36,000 estimated for Sweden. On 14 August, Count [[Nikolay Kamensky]] decided to use this numerical superiority to launch a new offensive.\n\nKamensky's 11,000-strong corps achieved important victories at [[Battle of Kuortane|Kuortane]] (1 September) and [[Salmi (rural locality)|Salmi]] (2 September), and although [[Georg Carl von D\u00f6beln]] won the [[Battle of Jutas]] for Sweden on 13 September, Kamensky gained the most important victory at [[Battle of Oravais|Oravais]] on 14 September. Swedish attempts to land more troops near [[\u00c5bo|Turku]] were stalled by Lieutenant-General [[Pyotr Bagration]]'s prompt actions. In Eastern Finland, the guerrilla movement was gradually extinguished. As a consequence, Russia's situation in Southern Finland improved significantly.\n\nIn the north, the situation was more complicated. Tuchkov's battered unit strained to hold its own against Sandels, while the progress of a relief force under General Alekseyev was contained by guerrilla fighters. It was not until 26 September that Prince [[Mikhail Petrovich Dolgorukov|Dolgorukov]] (Alekseyev's replacement) managed to join his forces with Tuchkov's, inducing Sandels to retreat. Three days later, Buxhoeveden \u2014 pressed by the early onset of winter weather \u2014 signed an armistice, much to the dismay of Alexander I. The emperor refused to ratify the truce and replaced Buxhoeveden with a new commander-in-chief, [[Bogdan von Knorring]], in December of that year.\n\nIn the south, the Swedish battle fleet remained anchored within the Finnish archipelago, blocking some of the deeper coastal sea routes from Hang\u00f6 towards \u00c5bo. Russian ships continued to arrive from the east but remained within the shallow narrows where the Swedish ships of the line could not reach. Small boat actions took place during the night time of 17\u201318 July which became known as the ''skirmish at L\u00f6v\u00f6'' ({{lang-fi|L\u00f6v\u00f6n kahakka}}). However, the Swedish fleet dropped its blockade on 22 August, allowing the Russian coastal units to unite. Odds were very much against the Swedes as the Russians had nearly one hundred coastal ships in the Finnish archipelago, against which Sweden could deploy only 7 galleys and 30 gun sloops.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=277-279}}\n\nSwedish efforts to harass the Russians with landings continued, with roughly 1,000 volunteers under Captain Anders Gyllenb\u00f6gel landing on 1 August to support Swedish-led uprisings on the coast south of Vasa. The landing succeeded, and together with Swedish troops advancing from the north, they managed to drive the Russians towards [[Pori|Bj\u00f6rneborg]] (Finnish: ''Pori''). Swedish patrol ships (consisting of armed merchant vessels) scouted and raided the coast, taking Russians prisoners to \u00c5land. These raids caused much confusion, and Russian responses to them thinned their strength along the coast. Also the Swedish southern army of Finland, consisting of roughly 4,000 men under Major General von Vegesack, was moved from \u00c5land to Finland, and landed at [[Kristinestad]] in late autumn, joining with von D\u00f6beln's forces. However, since von Vegesack had been ordered to land his men at [[Pori|Bj\u00f6rneborg]], the king, after pursuing the matter unsuccessfully in military tribunals, condemned von Vegesack to lose his rank and title.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=281-283}}\n\nA Russian battle fleet under Admiral Pyotr Khanikov (also ''Chanikoff'') sortied in late July to clear the Swedish blockades in the archipelago, to cut contact between \u00c5land and Sweden, and to stop Swedish supply transports sailing in the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. The Russian fleet reached Hang\u00f6 on 6 August and chose not to engage the scattered Swedish fleet elements in the vicinity. On 20 August, two British ships of the line ([[HMS Implacable (1805)|HMS ''Implacable'']] and [[HMS Centaur (1797)|''Centaur'']]) joined the Swedish fleet. The allied fleet moved on 25 August 1808 to engage the Russian fleet, which turned and attempted to reach the relative safety of [[Paldiski|Baltiyskiy Port]]. The British ships were far superior sailing ships compared to those of either the Swedes or Russians, and engaged the withdrawing Russian squadron (nine ships of the line and several frigates) on their own. The last of the Russian ships of the line was disabled and then captured and burned by the British ships. More Royal Navy ships (including [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], [[HMS Mars (1794)|''Mars'']], [[HMS Goliath (1781)|''Goliath'']], and [[HMS Africa (1781)|''Africa'']]) arrived to oversee a blockade of the Russian fleet at Baltiyskiy Port which continued until the sea started to freeze. The Swedish fleet suffered from outbreaks of scurvy and had been unable to maintain the blockade on its own.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=284-287}}\n\nSkirmishes and landings continued in the Finnish archipelago from late summer into autumn. On 30 August, the Swedish coastal fleet defeated its Russian adversaries at the [[Battle of Gr\u00f6nvikssund]], forcing the Russians to abandon their plans to invade \u00c5land and concentrate on defense. On 17 September, the Swedes [[Battle of Palva Sund|landed again]], this time at Lokalax (Finnish: ''Lokalahti''), while the coastal fleet covering the landing managed to keep the Russians away in the [[Battle of Palva Sund]] on 18 September. The troops that landed were forced to withdraw to their ships on 18 September, but [[Helsinki village landing|landed in Finland]] again on 26 September. However, owing to bad weather, only a portion of the troops that had been intended to participate in the landing actually reached the Finnish coast, and this resulted in another withdrawal on 28 September.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=287-298}}\n\nThe Swedish situation was further weakened by being at war with France and Denmark, both of whom threatened Sweden's possessions, with a joint invasion force of 45,000 troops in Denmark (under French general [[Charles XIV of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]]) and a further 36,000 in Norway. This forced the Swedes to allocate forces to southern Sweden and along the Norwegian border (23,000 troops). Denmark had declared war on Sweden on 14 March but no serious hostilities occurred, except for a series of inconclusive minor skirmishes along the [[Norway|Norwegian]] border, as in April Napoleon began to devote more attention to the situation in Spain, and the British navy remained a continuous threat for troop movements between Denmark and Sweden.\n\n== Winter 1808 ==\n[[File:The Finnish war map4.svg|thumb|Finnish War, Winter 1808 - Summer 1809]]\nBy November 1808, Russian forces had overrun all of Finland. On 19 November, the [[Convention of Olkijoki]] was signed and the Swedish army was forced to leave the Finnish countryside. The Russian emperor was, however, now eager to bring hostilities to the territory of Sweden proper, which was certain to bring the war to a victorious end.\n\nWith this objective in mind, Kamensky suggested a daring plan, whereby the Russian army was to cross the frozen [[Gulf of Bothnia]] at two locations: one unit was to march from [[Vaasa|Vasa]] towards [[Ume\u00e5]] and the other from [[Turku|\u00c5bo]] to the [[\u00c5land Islands]] and thence towards the vicinity of [[Stockholm]]. A third unit was to advance into Sweden by land, going around the gulf and through the town of [[Tornio|Torne\u00e5]] (Finnish: ''Tornio'').\n\nAlthough Knorring was urged to execute the plan as quickly as possible, he regarded the idea as unrealistic and procrastinated until March, when the emperor dispatched the War Minister [[Count Arakcheyev|Arakcheyev]] to Finland in order to pressure Knorring into action before joining the army himself.\n\n== Spring 1809 ==\n[[File:Gustavarrest.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Arrest of [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV]].]]\nAs Russian forces embarked upon their unprecedented march across the frozen gulf, King Gustav IV \u2014 accused of fatal mistakes leading to the loss of Finland \u2014 was dethroned in Stockholm on 13 March, and his uncle was proclaimed [[Charles XIII of Sweden]]. Four days later, Bagration's corps of 17,000 men occupied the strategic [[\u00c5land Islands]], while Kulnev led a vanguard further across the frozen sea that on 19 March reached the Swedish shore within 70&nbsp;km from Stockholm.\n\nWhen news of Kulnev's incursion spread to the Swedish capital, the new king sent an embassy to Knorring, proposing a truce. The Russian commander agreed and speedily recalled Kulnev back to \u00c5land. Meanwhile, the other Russian contingent \u2014 5,000 men under [[Barclay de Tolly]] \u2014 endured great hardship in crossing the frozen gulf further north; they entered Ume\u00e5 on 24 March.\n\nThe third force, commanded by Count {{ill|Pavel Andreyevich Shuvalov (1776-1823)|lt=Shuvalov|ru|\u0428\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 (1776)}}, struck against Torne\u00e5 and, braving fierce frost, encircled a Swedish army, which capitulated on 25 March. Six days later, the czar arrived in \u00c5bo and, on learning about the truce, not only revoked Knorring's signature but named Barclay de Tolly as the new Commander-in-Chief. Hostilities thus continued until May, when Shuvalov finally reached Ume\u00e5, where he was succeeded by Kamensky.\n\n== Summer 1809 and conclusion ==\n[[File:Ratan battle.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Last battle of the war at [[Battle of Ratan and S\u00e4var|Ratan]] near [[Ume\u00e5]] in Swedish [[V\u00e4sterbotten]]]]\nA British Royal Navy fleet under [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Admiral James Saumarez]] had arrived in Sweden in May and he concentrated his ships, 10 ship of the line and 17 smaller ships, to the Gulf of Finland. The presence of the British naval units kept the Russian battlefleet strictly confined to [[Kronstadt]], and after the British constructed artillery batteries to the [[Porkkala]] cape they cut off the coastal sea route from Russian ships. Total British control of the Gulf of Finland was a large obstacle to the Russian supply network and required sizable garrisons to be posted all along the Finnish coast. The Royal Navy captured 35 Russian ships and burnt 20 others before leaving the Baltic Sea on 28 September 1809.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=308-309}}\n\nIn August, Charles XIII, anxious to improve his position at a peace settlement, ordered General [[Gustav Wachtmeister]] to land in the north of Sweden and to attack Kamensky's rear. The last engagements of the war, [[Battle of S\u00e4var|at S\u00e4var]] and [[Battle of Ratan|Ratan]], proved inconclusive and Kamensky succeeded in neutralizing this belated counter-offensive.\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map5.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, aftermath]]\nWachtmeister's action was only a prelude to the peace negotiations that opened in August and resulted in the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] (17 September), in which Sweden ceded the whole of Finland and all of its domains east of the [[Torne River]] (the north-eastern parts of what was then called ''[[V\u00e4sterbotten]]'', today ''[[Norrbotten|Norrbottens l\u00e4n]]'') to Russia. Sweden then joined the [[Continental System]] and closed its harbours to British ships, leading to a formal declaration of [[Anglo-Swedish War (1810\u20131812)|war on Great Britain]]. A few months later, on 6 January 1810, the Russian government mediated the [[Treaty of Paris (1810)|Treaty of Paris]] between Sweden and France.\n\nRussia would create the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] from the territory obtained from Sweden, and would attach the areas gained from Sweden in the 18th century (including so-called [[Old Finland]]) to the new Grand Duchy. The Grand Duchy of Finland was to retain the [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustavian]] [[Constitution of 1772 (Finland)|constitution of 1772]] with only slight modifications until 1919. Almost all Finnish soldiers in Sweden (most of them in the Ume\u00e5 area) were [[Repatriation|repatriated]] after the war.\n\n==Analysis==\nSufficient stocks of supplies had not been prepared for the army, since the King [[Gustaf IV Adolf]] thought it might be taken as provocation by the Russians. Furthermore, Swedish strategy relied on the outdated plans for Finland which took into account neither the advances in weaponry, mobility of the armed forces or the greatly improved road networks of Finland. Most of the fortifications in Finland had not been completed and those that were completed had mostly fallen into neglect and disrepair. Even the strongest of the Swedish fortresses, Sveaborg, still had several of its planned fortifications missing, most notably all the land side fortifications designed to protect against besieging enemy.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=225,230,249,311}}\n\nIn 1808 a British expeditionary force under [[John Moore (British Army officer)|John Moore]] arrived in Sweden, but after months of idleness departed for the beginning of what became known as the [[Peninsular War]]. Had the king accepted the landing of 10,000 British troops in [[Sk\u00e5ne]], where the expeditionary force had been authorized to disembark, it would have enabled the Swedes to release at least 10,000 trained soldiers for the Finnish War. As it happened, the bulk of the Swedish army, including the best units, were kept out of the Finnish War by the king, who reserved them for his plans for conquering either Sj\u00e6lland or Norway. Swedish landings were invariably made with poorly equipped and trained forces, often with troops who had very low morale. Landings were further complicated by the Swedish Navy's failure to tightly block the coastal sea route past [[Hang\u00f6]].{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=311-312}}\n\n==Commemoration==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nThe 200th anniversary of the Finnish War was selected as the main motif for a high value commemorative coin, the \u20ac100 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)#2008 coinage|200th Anniversary of Finnish War commemorative coin]], minted in 2008.

As a result of the war, the eastern third of Sweden was established as the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] within the Russian Empire.  Other notable effects were the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Swedish parliament]]'s adoption of a [[Instrument of Government (1809)|new constitution]] and the establishment of the [[House of Bernadotte]], the new [[Swedish Act of Succession|Swedish royal house]], in 1818.\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Chronology of battles and events of the Finnish War}}\n[[File:Alexander I of Russia by G.Dawe (1826, Peterhof).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Alexander I, Emperor of Russia]]\n[[File:Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gustav IV Adolf, King of Sweden]]\nAfter the Russian Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] concluded the 1807 [[Treaty of Tilsit]] with [[Napoleon]], Alexander, in his letter on 24 September 1807 to the Swedish King [[Gustav IV Adolf]], informed the king that the peaceful relations between Russia and Sweden depended on Swedish agreement to abide by the limitations of the Treaty of Tilsit which in practice meant that Sweden would have been required to follow the [[Continental System]].{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=222}} The king, who viewed [[Napoleon]] as the [[Antichrist]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] as his ally against Napoleon's France, was apprehensive of the system's ruinous consequences for Sweden's maritime commerce.  He instead entered into negotiations with Britain in order to prepare a joint attack against [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Denmark]], whose Norwegian possessions he coveted.\n\nIn the meantime, the [[Royal Navy]] [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|attacked Copenhagen]] and the [[Anglo-Russian War (1807\u20131812)]] was declared. Referring to the treaties of 1780 and 1800, the emperor demanded that Gustav Adolf close the [[Baltic Sea]] to all foreign warships. Although he reiterated his demand on November 16, 1807, it took two months before the king responded that it was impossible to honor the previous arrangements as long as the French were in control of the major Baltic ports. King Gustav Adolf did this after securing an alliance with Britain on 8 February 1808. Meanwhile, on 30 December 1807 Russia announced that should Sweden not give a clear reply Russia would be forced to act.\n\nAlthough most Swedish officers were skeptical about their chances in fighting the larger and more experienced Russian army, Gustav Adolf had an unrealistic view of Sweden's ability to defend itself against Russia. In [[Saint Petersburg]], his stubbornness was viewed as a convenient pretext to occupy [[Finland]], thus pushing the Russo-Swedish frontier considerably to the west of the Russian capital and safeguarding it in case of any future hostilities between the two powers.\n\nThe situation was problematic for Sweden, since it once again faced both Denmark and Russia as potential enemies requiring the Swedes to split their forces.  The king had thought it impossible to defend Finland should the enemy attack during the winter and chose largely to ignore the repeated warnings of the Russian threat he received in early 1808. Most of the Swedish plans assumed that warfare would be impossible during winter, disregarding the lessons from recent wars. In addition, several new good roads had been built into Finland greatly reducing the earlier dependency on naval support for any large operation in Finland.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=223-225}}\n\nThe Swedish plan was to first passively defend and hold on to the fortifications in the southern coast of Finland, in which Sweden had strong garrisons, while the rest of the Swedish army retreated to the north. Then in the spring, counterattack simultaneously from north and south, when the Swedish army would have naval support and the Russian army would be spread over Finland and thus have long supply lines. The basic reason for the plan was to avoid major decisive battles. \n\nSome advocates existed for taking a more active approach immediately, namely Lieutenant Colonel Samuel M\u00f6ller (fi) who advocated for taking an immediate offensive and [[Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt]] who supported actively delaying the advancing enemies in co-operation with the garrisons in the southern coast. \n\nIn the end instructions which the new Swedish commander in Finland, General [[Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor]], received from the king were an unsuccessful and open-ended mixture of ideas from these very different plans.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=223-226}}\n\nRussia had gathered a wealth of information from Finland using spies and other sources.  The level of detail was so great that Russian maps of Finland were in many respects more accurate than their Swedish counterparts. The Russians used the services of General [[Georg Magnus Sprengtporten]] when forming their plans. Sprengtporten suggested going on to an offensive during the winter since Finland would be mostly isolated when seas were frozen. His ideas were further developed by General [[Jan Pieter van Suchtelen]] before General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden]] was appointed as the commander of the Russian army in Finland in December 1807.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=226-230}}\n\nThe plan involved using the series of fortifications built after 1790 as staging grounds for the Russian advances into Finland. In southern Finland, armies were to isolate the fortifications and first take control of the whole of southern Finland before advancing further to the north. Forces in [[Savonia (historical province)|Savolax]] (Finnish: ''Savo'') were to press hard against the Swedes and reach the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] towards [[Oulu|Ule\u00e5borg]] (Finnish: ''Oulu'') and [[Vaasa|Vasa]] (Finnish: ''Vaasa'') to cut off the retreat of the main body of the Swedish army.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=228-230}}\n\n== February \u2013 May 1808 ==\n[[File:The Finnish war map1.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, February 1808 at the outbreak of the war]]\nOn February 21, 1808, 24,000 Russian troops under [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoevden]] crossed the border in [[Ahvenkoski]] and took the town of [[Loviisa|Lovisa]] (Finnish: ''Loviisa'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/southern_towns_mark_war_of_finland_bicentennial/5823726|title=Southern Towns Mark War of Finland Bicentennial|author=|publisher=Yle News|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=1 September 2017|language=}}</ref> Since Klingspor had not arrived, Lieutenant General [[Karl Nathanael af Klercker]] acted as Swedish commander in Finland. He was notified of the Russian invasion already on 21 February and since it was impossible to hold the predefined defense lines as the army had not yet fully assembled he ordered the army to assemble at [[H\u00e4meenlinna|Tavastehus]] (Finnish: ''H\u00e4meenlinna''). Before the engagement started Klingspor finally arrived on 2 March and assumed command. Instead of facing the Russians at Tavastehus he ordered the army to withdraw. In [[Savonia (historical province)|Savolax]] the Russians also forced the Swedes to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=234-235}} The king was quite unprepared for the attack, especially as war was not declared until April. About 21,000 Swedish troops were stationed in various fortresses in Finland, while the rest of his army was unable to leave southern Sweden for fear of Danish attack.\n\nThe Russian advance was swift. On the first day of the war they had captured the town of Lovisa and besieged the Swedish sea fortress of [[Svartholm fortress|Svartholm]]. [[Porvoo|Borg\u00e5]] (Finnish: ''Porvoo'') was captured on 24 February and [[Helsinki|Helsingfors]] (Finnish: ''Helsinki'') on 2 March. Abandoned Swedish fortifications on the [[Hang\u00f6 Peninsula]] (Finnish: ''Hanko'') were taken and manned on 21 March and on the same day the Russian army took [[Turku|\u00c5bo]] (Finnish: ''Turku'') while a small detachment was sent to [[\u00c5land]]. Before the end of March 1808 even [[Vaasa|Vasa]] was taken. In Savolax, Russians also advanced rapidly and took [[Kuopio]] on 16 March. Swedish forces had mostly just withdrawn before the advancing Russian often destroying usable materials. For example, the Swedish [[archipelago fleet]]'s ships that been docked in \u00c5bo (nearly 50 gun sloops) were torched to prevent their capture.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=234-235}}\n\nThe Swedish fortress of [[Svartholm fortress|Svartholm]], commanded by Major [[Carl Magnus Gripenberg]], was ill-prepared for a war. While the garrison was 700 men strong, only a third of the men had actually functioning weapons, while most of the fortress' guns had no carriages. The fortress had fallen into disrepair and lacked both adequate food and ammunition stores. Even the wells were found to be unusable. After starting the siege on 21 February, the Russians issued a surrender demand for the fort, but this was refused by the Swedes. The demand was repeated on 2 March but without success. After a meager Russian bombardment, Gripenberg agreed to negotiations on 10 March. The fortress surrendered to the Russians on 18 March after a siege that had lasted roughly a month, with just one man having been wounded in action.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=232,235-238}}\n\n[[Sveaborg]] (Finnish: ''Suomenlinna'') under Admiral [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]] had been well prepared for the war with a garrison of 6,000 men, over 700 cannons, and enough stores to last until the summer of 1808. Defenses were strong enough to prevent the Russians from trying to storm the fortress by surprise. Instead the Russians [[Siege of Sveaborg|laid siege against Sveaborg]]. The fortress surrendered on 6 May 1808 after prolonged negotiations with the Russians as the commanding officer [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]] and his council believed that resistance was futile. The Russians gained the main body of the Swedish archipelago fleet intact as well as large stores of supplies and munitions.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=232-233,238-244}}\n\nThe Russians had advanced considerably but they had also gained the long and vulnerable coastline with it. After the sea would be clear of ice there would be nothing to prevent Swedish forces from landing troops on the shore. With the Royal Navy supporting the Swedish battle fleet there was little the Russian battle fleet could accomplish. Capture of the main body of the Swedish archipelago fleet had resulted in a real advantage to the Russians since it allowed them to gain superiority in the narrow waters of the Finnish archipelago where large ships of the line could not operate. Even the powerful explosion at Sveaborg which destroyed several of the captured ships did little to change Russian superiority in the Finnish archipelago. The Russians utilized the guns from the burned ships, and from those which burned during the winter, and constructed several fortifications on the coast, both in Hang\u00f6 as well as along narrow passages leading to \u00c5bo.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=245-248}}\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map2.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, March - May 1808]]\nUnder Colonel [[Carl Johan Adlercreutz]] the Swedish army [[Battle of Siikajoki|counter-attacked at Siikajoki]] and began to halt the Russian offensive. Soon after at the [[Battle of Revolax]] (Finnish: ''Revonlahti''), the Swedish army under Colonel [[Johan Adam Cronstedt]] started an advance towards the south. These successes yielded a promotion to Field Marshal for [[Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor]]. The Swedish advance was very slow however, as operations were often halted due to the thaw. An exception was the brigade under Colonel [[Johan August Sandels]], which swiftly advanced towards [[Kuopio]]. [[Nikolay Tuchkov]], a Russian general who was dispatched to the north of Finland, left garrisons in every fort along his way. This reduced his unit to 4,000 troops, which proved insufficient to pacify the hostile country. The Finns rose up in guerrilla fighting as far east as Frederikshamn (Finnish: ''[[Hamina]]'') within the [[Old Finland]] province of Russia.\n\nIn May, the Russians suffered further setbacks when they were driven from [[Gotland]] and \u00c5land, where a Swedish [[flotilla]], supported by the local population, compelled the small Russian force left on the main island of [[Fasta \u00c5land]] to surrender, and then invaded the island of [[Kumlinge]] where the bulk of the Russian garrison on the [[\u00c5land Islands]] was based. After a two-hour-long battle, the local militia, together with the Swedish landing force, overwhelmed their enemies and Colonel Vuich and his garrison were compelled to surrender. \n\nOn May 26, a British fleet carrying 14,000 troops under [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]] entered the [[port of Gothenburg]]. Due to various disagreements with the Swedish king, however, they never landed and sailed off to fight the French in [[Spain]] after leaving 16 battleships and 20 other ships at Sweden's disposal.\n\n== June \u2013 July 1808 ==\nThe Swedish battlefleet which had been expelling Russians from [[Gotland]] was ordered to blockade the [[Hang\u00f6 Peninsula]] and reached the cape on 10 June. Due to bad weather and poor visibility the fleet under [[Rudolf Cederstr\u00f6m|Admiral Rudolph Cederstr\u00f6m]] chose to stay relatively far from the coast. Upon approaching the coast on 21 June, Cederstr\u00f6m learned that the Russians had already passed the cape some time earlier. Attempts to stop the Russians deeper in the archipelago were also unsuccessful. Failure to block the Russians led the king to relieve Cederstr\u00f6m of his duties and replace him with Commander Henrik Johan Nauckhoff.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=256-258}}\n\nMajor General Eberhard Ernst von Vegesack was chosen to lead the first Swedish army to Finland. He was to lead a force of 2,600 men, land somewhere between [[Uusikaupunki|Nystad]] (Finnish: ''Uusikaupunki'') and [[Turku|\u00c5bo]], and then capture the latter. Von Vegesack instead chose to land his force at the Lemo (Finnish: ''Lemu'') manor house a few kilometers south of [[Turku|\u00c5bo]]. [[Battle of Lemo|The landing]] began on 19 June and was initially successful. The surprised Russians garrisoned at \u00c5bo reacted quickly, however, and deployed over 3,000 men to stop the landing force. By the morning of 20 June, the Swedish forces were forced to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=258-262}}  In addition, Colonel Johan Bergenstr\u00e5hle landed 1,100 Swedes just a few kilometers northeast of [[Vaasa|Vasa]] on 25 June and managed to quickly advance to the town. The Russians, however, managed to gather a force of 3,000 men which was able to force the ill-trained Swedes to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=262-264}}\n\nThe advance of the Russian coastal squadron beyond Hang\u00f6 created difficulties for the Swedes. The strength of the Swedish coastal forces deployed to the Finnish archipelago was equal in size to the coastal fleet that the Russians had obtained by the Sveaborg surrender. To prevent the Russians from gaining strength, the Swedish coastal fleet's unit under Rear Admiral Claes Hjelmstjerna tried to engage them twice in battle. The first was at the [[Battle of Rimito Kramp]] on 30 June, and after Russians withdrew closer to [[Turku|\u00c5bo]], the second was a battle at Pukkisaari on 4 July. Fighting ended in a stalemate, but can be viewed as a Swedish failure since they failed to decisively defeat the Russians.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=266-269}}\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map3.svg|thumb|left|Finnish War, May - October 1808]]\nHaving been alerted to the approach of additional Russian coastal units from Sveaborg, the Swedish forces moved to intercept them before they could link up with the Russian coastal unit now bottled up at \u00c5bo. Learning that the Russians intended to go around the island of [[Kimito\u00f6n (island)|Kimito]] (Finnish: ''Kimito\u00f6n''), a Swedish force of gunboats was deployed to the narrows. They met the Russians first at [[Battle of Sand\u00f6str\u00f6m|Tallholmen]] on 21 July and again on 2 August in the [[Battle of Sand\u00f6str\u00f6m]]. Swedish attempts to land troops and artillery in support of the gunboats at Vestank\u00e4rr on 2 August ended in failure, though the attempt came very close to capturing General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden]]. While none of the fights ended with a decisive winner, the overall strategic victory went to Russia, who gained advantage in the Finnish archipelago by managing to link up their separate coastal units.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=270-276}}\n\nSweden performed several small landings along the coast near [[Kristinestad]] (Finnish: ''Kristiinankaupunki'') and [[Kaskinen|Kask\u00f6]] (Finnish: ''Kaskinen'') and managed to raise local men to oppose the Russians. The first occurred on 3 July with several others taking place soon after. Altogether the Swedes had several hundred local men-in-arms. The Russians, however, were able to send reinforcements to the area which were, in addition to being numerically superior, both far better trained and equipped than the peasants and militia the Swedes had raised. By the end of July the small forces Sweden had landed and the men that had supported them were either beaten or withdrawn back to their ships.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=279-280}}\n\n== August \u2013 September 1808 ==\nAfter the Russians were driven from Central Finland, their forces stretched along the line of [[Pori]] \u2014 [[Tampere]] \u2014 [[Mikkeli]]. Having received considerable reinforcements, their numbers increased to 55,000, as opposed to the 36,000 estimated for Sweden. On 14 August, Count [[Nikolay Kamensky]] decided to use this numerical superiority to launch a new offensive.\n\nKamensky's 11,000-strong corps achieved important victories at [[Battle of Kuortane|Kuortane]] (1 September) and [[Salmi (rural locality)|Salmi]] (2 September), and although [[Georg Carl von D\u00f6beln]] won the [[Battle of Jutas]] for Sweden on 13 September, Kamensky gained the most important victory at [[Battle of Oravais|Oravais]] on 14 September. Swedish attempts to land more troops near [[\u00c5bo|Turku]] were stalled by Lieutenant-General [[Pyotr Bagration]]'s prompt actions. In Eastern Finland, the guerrilla movement was gradually extinguished. As a consequence, Russia's situation in Southern Finland improved significantly.\n\nIn the north, the situation was more complicated. Tuchkov's battered unit strained to hold its own against Sandels, while the progress of a relief force under General Alekseyev was contained by guerrilla fighters. It was not until 26 September that Prince [[Mikhail Petrovich Dolgorukov|Dolgorukov]] (Alekseyev's replacement) managed to join his forces with Tuchkov's, inducing Sandels to retreat. Three days later, Buxhoeveden \u2014 pressed by the early onset of winter weather \u2014 signed an armistice, much to the dismay of Alexander I. The emperor refused to ratify the truce and replaced Buxhoeveden with a new commander-in-chief, [[Bogdan von Knorring]], in December of that year.\n\nIn the south, the Swedish battle fleet remained anchored within the Finnish archipelago, blocking some of the deeper coastal sea routes from Hang\u00f6 towards \u00c5bo. Russian ships continued to arrive from the east but remained within the shallow narrows where the Swedish ships of the line could not reach. Small boat actions took place during the night time of 17\u201318 July which became known as the ''skirmish at L\u00f6v\u00f6'' ({{lang-fi|L\u00f6v\u00f6n kahakka}}). However, the Swedish fleet dropped its blockade on 22 August, allowing the Russian coastal units to unite. Odds were very much against the Swedes as the Russians had nearly one hundred coastal ships in the Finnish archipelago, against which Sweden could deploy only 7 galleys and 30 gun sloops.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=277-279}}\n\nSwedish efforts to harass the Russians with landings continued, with roughly 1,000 volunteers under Captain Anders Gyllenb\u00f6gel landing on 1 August to support Swedish-led uprisings on the coast south of Vasa. The landing succeeded, and together with Swedish troops advancing from the north, they managed to drive the Russians towards [[Pori|Bj\u00f6rneborg]] (Finnish: ''Pori''). Swedish patrol ships (consisting of armed merchant vessels) scouted and raided the coast, taking Russians prisoners to \u00c5land. These raids caused much confusion, and Russian responses to them thinned their strength along the coast. Also the Swedish southern army of Finland, consisting of roughly 4,000 men under Major General von Vegesack, was moved from \u00c5land to Finland, and landed at [[Kristinestad]] in late autumn, joining with von D\u00f6beln's forces. However, since von Vegesack had been ordered to land his men at [[Pori|Bj\u00f6rneborg]], the king, after pursuing the matter unsuccessfully in military tribunals, condemned von Vegesack to lose his rank and title.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=281-283}}\n\nA Russian battle fleet under Admiral Pyotr Khanikov (also ''Chanikoff'') sortied in late July to clear the Swedish blockades in the archipelago, to cut contact between \u00c5land and Sweden, and to stop Swedish supply transports sailing in the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. The Russian fleet reached Hang\u00f6 on 6 August and chose not to engage the scattered Swedish fleet elements in the vicinity. On 20 August, two British ships of the line ([[HMS Implacable (1805)|HMS ''Implacable'']] and [[HMS Centaur (1797)|''Centaur'']]) joined the Swedish fleet. The allied fleet moved on 25 August 1808 to engage the Russian fleet, which turned and attempted to reach the relative safety of [[Paldiski|Baltiyskiy Port]]. The British ships were far superior sailing ships compared to those of either the Swedes or Russians, and engaged the withdrawing Russian squadron (nine ships of the line and several frigates) on their own. The last of the Russian ships of the line was disabled and then captured and burned by the British ships. More Royal Navy ships (including [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], [[HMS Mars (1794)|''Mars'']], [[HMS Goliath (1781)|''Goliath'']], and [[HMS Africa (1781)|''Africa'']]) arrived to oversee a blockade of the Russian fleet at Baltiyskiy Port which continued until the sea started to freeze. The Swedish fleet suffered from outbreaks of scurvy and had been unable to maintain the blockade on its own.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=284-287}}\n\nSkirmishes and landings continued in the Finnish archipelago from late summer into autumn. On 30 August, the Swedish coastal fleet defeated its Russian adversaries at the [[Battle of Gr\u00f6nvikssund]], forcing the Russians to abandon their plans to invade \u00c5land and concentrate on defense. On 17 September, the Swedes [[Battle of Palva Sund|landed again]], this time at Lokalax (Finnish: ''Lokalahti''), while the coastal fleet covering the landing managed to keep the Russians away in the [[Battle of Palva Sund]] on 18 September. The troops that landed were forced to withdraw to their ships on 18 September, but [[Helsinki village landing|landed in Finland]] again on 26 September. However, owing to bad weather, only a portion of the troops that had been intended to participate in the landing actually reached the Finnish coast, and this resulted in another withdrawal on 28 September.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=287-298}}\n\nThe Swedish situation was further weakened by being at war with France and Denmark, both of whom threatened Sweden's possessions, with a joint invasion force of 45,000 troops in Denmark (under French general [[Charles XIV of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]]) and a further 36,000 in Norway. This forced the Swedes to allocate forces to southern Sweden and along the Norwegian border (23,000 troops). Denmark had declared war on Sweden on 14 March but no serious hostilities occurred, except for a series of inconclusive minor skirmishes along the [[Norway|Norwegian]] border, as in April Napoleon began to devote more attention to the situation in Spain, and the British navy remained a continuous threat for troop movements between Denmark and Sweden.\n\n== Winter 1808 ==\n[[File:The Finnish war map4.svg|thumb|Finnish War, Winter 1808 - Summer 1809]]\nBy November 1808, Russian forces had overrun all of Finland. On 19 November, the [[Convention of Olkijoki]] was signed and the Swedish army was forced to leave the Finnish countryside. The Russian emperor was, however, now eager to bring hostilities to the territory of Sweden proper, which was certain to bring the war to a victorious end.\n\nWith this objective in mind, Kamensky suggested a daring plan, whereby the Russian army was to cross the frozen [[Gulf of Bothnia]] at two locations: one unit was to march from [[Vaasa|Vasa]] towards [[Ume\u00e5]] and the other from [[Turku|\u00c5bo]] to the [[\u00c5land Islands]] and thence towards the vicinity of [[Stockholm]]. A third unit was to advance into Sweden by land, going around the gulf and through the town of [[Tornio|Torne\u00e5]] (Finnish: ''Tornio'').\n\nAlthough Knorring was urged to execute the plan as quickly as possible, he regarded the idea as unrealistic and procrastinated until March, when the emperor dispatched the War Minister [[Count Arakcheyev|Arakcheyev]] to Finland in order to pressure Knorring into action before joining the army himself.\n\n== Spring 1809 ==\n[[File:Gustavarrest.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Arrest of [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV]].]]\nAs Russian forces embarked upon their unprecedented march across the frozen gulf, King Gustav IV \u2014 accused of fatal mistakes leading to the loss of Finland \u2014 was dethroned in Stockholm on 13 March, and his uncle was proclaimed [[Charles XIII of Sweden]]. Four days later, Bagration's corps of 17,000 men occupied the strategic [[\u00c5land Islands]], while Kulnev led a vanguard further across the frozen sea that on 19 March reached the Swedish shore within 70&nbsp;km from Stockholm.\n\nWhen news of Kulnev's incursion spread to the Swedish capital, the new king sent an embassy to Knorring, proposing a truce. The Russian commander agreed and speedily recalled Kulnev back to \u00c5land. Meanwhile, the other Russian contingent \u2014 5,000 men under [[Barclay de Tolly]] \u2014 endured great hardship in crossing the frozen gulf further north; they entered Ume\u00e5 on 24 March.\n\nThe third force, commanded by Count {{ill|Pavel Andreyevich Shuvalov (1776-1823)|lt=Shuvalov|ru|\u0428\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 (1776)}}, struck against Torne\u00e5 and, braving fierce frost, encircled a Swedish army, which capitulated on 25 March. Six days later, the czar arrived in \u00c5bo and, on learning about the truce, not only revoked Knorring's signature but named Barclay de Tolly as the new Commander-in-Chief. Hostilities thus continued until May, when Shuvalov finally reached Ume\u00e5, where he was succeeded by Kamensky.\n\n== Summer 1809 and conclusion ==\n[[File:Ratan battle.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Last battle of the war at [[Battle of Ratan and S\u00e4var|Ratan]] near [[Ume\u00e5]] in Swedish [[V\u00e4sterbotten]]]]\nA British Royal Navy fleet under [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Admiral James Saumarez]] had arrived in Sweden in May and he concentrated his ships, 10 ship of the line and 17 smaller ships, to the Gulf of Finland. The presence of the British naval units kept the Russian battlefleet strictly confined to [[Kronstadt]], and after the British constructed artillery batteries to the [[Porkkala]] cape they cut off the coastal sea route from Russian ships. Total British control of the Gulf of Finland was a large obstacle to the Russian supply network and required sizable garrisons to be posted all along the Finnish coast. The Royal Navy captured 35 Russian ships and burnt 20 others before leaving the Baltic Sea on 28 September 1809.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=308-309}}\n\nIn August, Charles XIII, anxious to improve his position at a peace settlement, ordered General [[Gustav Wachtmeister]] to land in the north of Sweden and to attack Kamensky's rear. The last engagements of the war, [[Battle of S\u00e4var|at S\u00e4var]] and [[Battle of Ratan|Ratan]], proved inconclusive and Kamensky succeeded in neutralizing this belated counter-offensive.\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map5.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, aftermath]]\nWachtmeister's action was only a prelude to the peace negotiations that opened in August and resulted in the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] (17 September), in which Sweden ceded the whole of Finland and all of its domains east of the [[Torne River]] (the north-eastern parts of what was then called ''[[V\u00e4sterbotten]]'', today ''[[Norrbotten|Norrbottens l\u00e4n]]'') to Russia. Sweden then joined the [[Continental System]] and closed its harbours to British ships, leading to a formal declaration of [[Anglo-Swedish War (1810\u20131812)|war on Great Britain]]. A few months later, on 6 January 1810, the Russian government mediated the [[Treaty of Paris (1810)|Treaty of Paris]] between Sweden and France.\n\nRussia would create the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] from the territory obtained from Sweden, and would attach the areas gained from Sweden in the 18th century (including so-called [[Old Finland]]) to the new Grand Duchy. The Grand Duchy of Finland was to retain the [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustavian]] [[Constitution of 1772 (Finland)|constitution of 1772]] with only slight modifications until 1919. Almost all Finnish soldiers in Sweden (most of them in the Ume\u00e5 area) were [[Repatriation|repatriated]] after the war.\n\n==Analysis==\nSufficient stocks of supplies had not been prepared for the army, since the King [[Gustaf IV Adolf]] thought it might be taken as provocation by the Russians. Furthermore, Swedish strategy relied on the outdated plans for Finland which took into account neither the advances in weaponry, mobility of the armed forces or the greatly improved road networks of Finland. Most of the fortifications in Finland had not been completed and those that were completed had mostly fallen into neglect and disrepair. Even the strongest of the Swedish fortresses, Sveaborg, still had several of its planned fortifications missing, most notably all the land side fortifications designed to protect against besieging enemy.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=225,230,249,311}}\n\nIn 1808 a British expeditionary force under [[John Moore (British Army officer)|John Moore]] arrived in Sweden, but after months of idleness departed for the beginning of what became known as the [[Peninsular War]]. Had the king accepted the landing of 10,000 British troops in [[Sk\u00e5ne]], where the expeditionary force had been authorized to disembark, it would have enabled the Swedes to release at least 10,000 trained soldiers for the Finnish War. As it happened, the bulk of the Swedish army, including the best units, were kept out of the Finnish War by the king, who reserved them for his plans for conquering either Sj\u00e6lland or Norway. Swedish landings were invariably made with poorly equipped and trained forces, often with troops who had very low morale. Landings were further complicated by the Swedish Navy's failure to tightly block the coastal sea route past [[Hang\u00f6]].{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=311-312}}\n\n==Commemoration==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nThe 200th anniversary of the Finnish War was selected as the main motif for a high value commemorative coin, the \u20ac100 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)#2008 coinage|200th Anniversary of Finnish War commemorative coin]], minted in 2008.

A special hosted by [[Joel McHale]] was released on April 12, 2020, with McHale interviewing several of the stars about Exotic and the series itself.\n\nThe series received acclaim from critics, and according to [[Nielsen ratings]], was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date.\n\n==Summary==\n{{more sources|date=April 2020|section}}\n[[File:Tiger_at_Big_Cat_Rescue.jpg|right|thumb|[[Big cat|Big cats]], like this [[tiger]] seen at Florida\u2019s [[Big Cat Rescue]] in 2012 run by activist and conservationist [[Carole Baskin]], cannot be ethically released to the wild and instead spend the rest of their lives in cages.]]\nThe series explores the little-known, deeply interconnected society of [[big cat]] conservationists and collectors in America, and the private [[zoo]]s and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary subject is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park|G.W. Zoo]] in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his bitter years-long feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin presents herself as an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic maintains that she is simply a rival zookeeper whose aim is to eliminate her competition. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to allege that Baskin  [[Disappearance of Don Lewis|murdered her second husband Don Lewis]], who has been [[Missing person|missing]] since 1997.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, particularly his unofficial [[Polygamy|three-way]] [[same-sex marriage]] to Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and future husband Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election#Libertarian_primary|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal breeder accused of leading a personality cult; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic. Former G.W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |DirectedBy = {{TableTBA|N/A}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]].\n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

A special hosted by [[Joel McHale]] was released on April 12, 2020, with McHale interviewing several of the stars about Exotic and the series itself.\n\nThe series received acclaim from critics, and according to [[Nielsen ratings]], was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date.\n\n==Summary==\n{{more sources|date=April 2020|section}}\n[[File:Tiger_at_Big_Cat_Rescue.jpg|right|thumb|[[Big cat|Big cats]], like this [[tiger]] seen at Florida\u2019s [[Big Cat Rescue]] in 2012 run by activist and conservationist [[Carole Baskin]], cannot be ethically released to the wild and instead spend the rest of their lives in cages.]]\nThe series explores the little-known, deeply interconnected society of [[big cat]] conservationists and collectors in America, and the private [[zoo]]s and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary subject is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park|G.W. Zoo]] in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his bitter years-long feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin presents herself as an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic maintains that she is simply a rival zookeeper whose aim is to eliminate her competition. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to allege that Baskin  [[Disappearance of Don Lewis|murdered her second husband Don Lewis]], who has been [[Missing person|missing]] since 1997.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, particularly his unofficial [[Polygamy|three-way]] [[same-sex marriage]] to Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and future husband Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election#Libertarian_primary|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal breeder accused of leading a personality cult; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic.

Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |DirectedBy = {{TableTBA|N/A}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]].\n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

Iraqis remained divided over provisions allowing regional governments to enter into contracts directly with foreign companies; while strongly supported by Kurds, Sunni Arabs wanted the Oil Ministry to retain signing power.

Geologists and consultants have estimated that relatively unexplored territory in the western and southern deserts may contain an estimated additional 45 to 100 billion barrels (bbls) of recoverable oil. Iraqi Oil Minister [[Hussain al-Shahristani]] said that Iraq is re-evaluating its estimate of proven oil reserves, and expects to revise them upwards. A major challenge to Iraq's development of the oil sector is that resources are not evenly divided across sectarian-demographic lines. Most known hydrocarbon resources are concentrated in the Shiite areas of the south and the ethnically Kurdish north, with few resources in control of the [[Sunni]] minority. The majority of the known oil and gas reserves in Iraq form a belt that runs along the eastern edge of the country. Iraq has 9 fields that are considered super giants (over 5 billion bbls) as well as 22 known giant fields (over 1 billion bbls). According to independent consultants, the cluster of super-giant fields of southeastern Iraq forms the largest known concentration of such fields in the world and accounts for 70 to 80 percent of the country's proven oil reserves. An estimated 20 percent of oil reserves are in the north of Iraq, near [[Kirkuk]], [[Mosul]] and [[Khanaqin]]. Control over rights to reserves is a source of controversy between the ethnic [[Kurd]]s and other groups in the area.<ref name=Industry>{{cite web|title=Industry in Iraq|url=http://middleeastarab.com/iq/industry-iraq.html|publisher=Middleeast Arab|accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Production====\nIn 2009, Iraq's crude oil production averaged 2.4 million barrels per day (mbd), about the same as 2008 levels, and below its pre-war production capacity level of 2.8 million mbd After the end of the US invasion the production increased on a high level, even though a new invasion from the so-called [[ISIL]] started.

Passage of the proposed Hydrocarbons Law, which would provide a legal framework for investment in the hydrocarbon sector, remains a main policy objective. Despite the absence of the [[Iraq oil law (2007)|Hydrocarbons Law]], the [[Ministry of Oil (Iraq)]] signed 12 long-term contracts between November 2008 and May 2010 with international oil companies to develop 14 oil fields. Under the first phase, companies bid to further develop 6 giant oil fields that were already producing with proven oil reserves of over 43 billion barrels. Phase two contracts were signed to develop oil fields that were already explored but not fully developed or producing commercially. Together, these contracts cover oil fields with proven reserves of over 60 billion barrels, or more than half of Iraq's current proven oil reserves. As a result of these contract awards, Iraq expects to boost production by 200,000 bbl/d by the end of 2010, and to increase production capacity by an additional 400,000 bbl/d by the end of 2011. When these fields are fully developed, they will increase total Iraqi production capacity to almost 12 million bbl/d, or 9.6 million bbl/d above current production levels. The contracts call for Iraq to reach this production target by 2017.\n\n=====Infrastructure constraints=====\nIraq faces many challenges in meeting this timetable. One of the most significant is the lack of an outlet for significant increases in crude oil production. Both Iraqi refining and export infrastructure are currently bottlenecks and need to be upgraded to process much more crude oil. Iraqi oil exports are currently running at near full capacity in the south, while export capacity in the north has been restricted by sabotage, and would need to be expanded in any case to export significantly higher volumes. Production increases of the scale planned will also require substantial increases in natural gas and/or water injection to maintain oil reservoir pressure and boost oil production.\n\nIraq has associated gas that could be used, but it is currently being flared. Another option is to use water for re-injection, and locally available water is currently being used in the south of Iraq. However, fresh water is an important commodity in the Middle East, and large amounts of seawater will likely have to be pumped in via pipelines that have yet to be built. [[ExxonMobil]] has coordinated initial studies at water injection plans for many of the fields under development. According to their estimate, 10\u201315 million bbl/d of seawater could be necessary for Iraq's expansion plans, at a cost of over $10 billion.\n\nFurthermore, Iraq's oil and gas industry is the largest industrial customer of electricity, with over 10 percent of total demand. Large-scale increases in oil production would also require large increases in power generation. However, Iraq has struggled to keep up with the demand for power, with shortages common across Iraq. Significant upgrades to the electricity sector would be needed to supply additional power. Iraq also plans to sign delineation agreements on shared oil fields with [[Kuwait]] and Iran. Iraq would like to set up joint committees with its neighbors on how to share the oil.\n\nAccording to the Oil and Gas Journal, Iraq's proven natural gas reserves are 112 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), the tenth largest in the world. An estimated 70 percent of these lie in [[Basra]] governorate in the south of Iraq. Probable Iraqi reserves have been estimated at 275\u2013300 Tcf, and work is currently underway by several IOCs and independents to accurately update hydrocarbon reserve numbers. Two-thirds of Iraq's natural gas resources are associated with oil fields including, Kirkuk, as well as the southern Nahr Bin) Umar, Majnoon, Halfaya, [[Nassiriya]], the Rumaila fields, West [[Al-Qurnah]], and [[Az Zubayr|Zubair]]. Just under 20 percent of known gas reserves are non-associated; around 10 percent is salt dome gas. The majority of non-associated reserves are concentrated in several fields in the North including: Ajil, Bai Hassan, Jambur, Chemchemal, Kor Mor, Khashem al-Ahmar, and Khashem al-Ahmar.\n\n=====Service contracts licensing results=====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

This pipeline has been subject to repeated disruptions this decade, limiting exports from the northern fields. Iraq signed an agreement with Turkey to extend the operation of the 1.6 million bbl/d pipeline, as well as to upgrade its capacity by 1 million bbl/d.\nIn order for this pipeline to reach its design capacity, Iraq would need to receive oil from the south via the Strategic Pipeline, which was designed to allow flows of crude oil from the south of Iraq to go north via Turkey, and vice versa. Iraq has proposed building a new strategic line from Basra to the northern city of [[Kirkuk]], with the line consisting of two additional crude oil pipelines. To the West: The Kirkuk-Banias Oil Pipeline has been closed and the Iraqi portion reported unusable since the 2003 war in Iraq. Discussions were held between Iraqi and Syrian government officials to re-open the pipeline, which had a design capacity of 700,000 bbl/d, although actual volumes never reached this level. The Russian company [[Stroytransgaz]] accepted an offer to fix the pipeline in December 2007, but no follow-up was made. Iraq and Syria have discussed building several new pipelines, including a 1.5 million bbl/d pipeline carrying heavy crude oil, and a 1.25 million bbl/d pipeline for carrying light crudes. To the South: The 1.65 million bbl/d Iraq Pipeline to Saudi Arabia (IPSA) has been closed since 1991 following the Persian Gulf War. There are no plans to reopen this line.\nIraq has also held discussions to build a crude oil pipeline from [[Haditha]] to Jordan's [[port of Aqaba]].\n\n====Ports====\n[[File:Iraq seaborne crude oil exports by destination in 2017 (31760972217).png|upright=1.4|thumb|Destination of Iraqi seaborne exports of crude oil in 2017]]\nThe [[Basra Oil Terminal]] on the Persian Gulf has an effective capacity to load 1.3 million bbl/d and support [[Very Large Crude Carriers]]. In February 2009, the South Oil Company commissioned Foster Wheeler to carry out the basic engineering design to rehabilitate and expand capacity of the terminal by building four single point mooring systems with a capacity of 800,000 bbl/d each. According to former Minister of Oil Issam al-Chalabi, it would take at least until 2013 to complete the project if financing is found. There are five smaller ports on the Persian Gulf, all functioning at less than full capacity, including the Khor al-Amaya terminal.\n\n====Overland export routes====\nOverland routes are used to export limited amounts of crude from small fields bordering Syria. In addition, Iraq has resumed shipping oil to Jordan's [[Zarqa]]\nrefinery by road tankers at a rate of 10,000 bbl/d.\n\n===Downstream===\nEstimates of Iraqi nameplate refining capacity vary, from 637,500 bbl/d according to the Oil and Gas Journal to 790,000 bbl/d according to the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction. Iraqi refineries have antiquated infrastructure and only half run at utilization rates of 50 percent or more. Despite improvements in recent years, the sector has not been able to meet domestic demand of about 600,000 bbl/d, and the refineries produce too much heavy fuel oil and not enough other refined products. As a result, Iraq relies on imports for 30 percent of its gasoline and 17 percent of its LPG.\nTo alleviate product shortages, Iraq's 10-year strategic plan for 2008-2017 set a goal of increasing refining capacity to 1.5 million bbl/d, and is seeking $20 billion in investments to achieve this target. Iraq has plans for 4 new refineries, as well as plans for expanding the existing Daura and Basra refineries.\n\n== Natural gas ==\n\n=== Upstream ===\n\n====Gas production====\nIraqi natural gas production rose from to 81 (billion) Bcf in 2003 to 522 Bcf in 2008. Some is used as fuel for power generation, and some is re-injected to enhance oil recovery. Over 40 percent of the production in 2008 was flared due to a lack of sufficient infrastructure to utilize it for consumption and export, although [[Royal Dutch Shell]] estimated that flaring losses were even greater at 1 Bcf per day. As a result, Iraq's five natural gas processing plants, which can process over 773 billion cubic feet per year, sit mostly idle. To reduce flaring, Iraq has been working on an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell to implement a 25-year project to capture flared gas and provide it for domestic use. Iraq's cabinet gave preliminary approval for the $17 billion deal covering development of 25\u201330 Tcf of associated natural gas reserves in Basra province through a new joint venture, [[Basra Gas Company]]. The agreement, which originally was to cover all of [[Basra Governorate]], has been modified to include only the associated gas from the Rumaila, Zubair, and West Qurna Phase I projects. Implementation of this agreement is necessary for the new oil development projects to go forward.\n\n====Upstream development====\nIraq has planned an upstream bidding round in late 2010 for three non-associated natural gas fields with combined reserves of over 7.5 Tcf. This will be the third hydrocarbon bidding round conducted by Iraq, following two earlier rounds that were held to develop Iraq's oil fields. All of the companies that prequalified to bid in the two earlier rounds will be invited. Iraq has committed to purchasing 100 percent of the gas.\n\n=== Midstream ===\nPlans to export natural gas remain controversial due to the amount of idle and sub-optimally fired electricity generation capacity in Iraq\u2014much a result of a lack of adequate gas feedstock. Prior to the 1990\u20131991 [[Gulf War]], Iraq exported natural gas to Kuwait. The gas came from Rumaila through a {{convert|105|mile|km}} pipeline with a capacity of {{convert|400|e6ft3|e6m3|abbr=off}} per day to Kuwait's central processing center at [[Al Ahmadi, Kuwait|Kuwait]]. In 2007, the Ministry of Oil announced an agreement to fund a feasibility study on the revival of the mothballed pipeline. Iraq has eyed northern export routes such as the proposed [[Nabucco pipeline]] through Turkey to [[Europe]], and in July 2009 Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] suggested that Iraq could be exporting 530 Bcf per year to Europe by 2015. A second option is the [[Arab Gas Pipeline]] (AGP) project. The proposed AGP pipeline would deliver gas from Iraq's Akkas field to Syria and then on to [[Lebanon]] and the Turkish border sometime in 2010, and then on to Europe. Other proposals have included building LNG exporting facilities in the Basra region.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Iraq|Energy|Companies}}\n*[[Economy of Iraq]]\n*[[Energy in Iraq]]\n*[[Oil reserves in Iraq]]\n*[[Iraq National Oil Company]]\n*[[South Oil Company]]\n*[[Missan Oil Company]]\n*[[Midland Oil Company]]\n*[[North Oil Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Middle East topic|Petroleum industry in}}\n[[Category:Petroleum industry in Iraq]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[File:OilProduction.Iraq1990-2015.png|thumb|300px|Iraqi oil production has surged after years of disorder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=IRQ |title=Country Analysis Brief: Iraq |work=US Energy Information Administration |date=28 April 2016 |accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Iraq]] was the world's 5th largest oil producer in 2009, and has the world's fifth [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|largest proven petroleum reserves]]. Just a fraction of Iraq's known fields are in development, and Iraq may be one of the few places left where vast reserves, proven and unknown, have barely been exploited. Iraq's energy sector is heavily based upon oil, with approximately 94 percent of its energy needs met with petroleum. In addition, crude oil export revenues accounted for over two-thirds of [[GDP]] in 2009. Iraq's oil sector has suffered over the past several decades from sanctions and wars, and its oil infrastructure is in need of modernization and investment.

Iraqis remained divided over provisions allowing regional governments to enter into contracts directly with foreign companies; while strongly supported by Kurds, Sunni Arabs wanted the Oil Ministry to retain signing power.

Geologists and consultants have estimated that relatively unexplored territory in the western and southern deserts may contain an estimated additional 45 to 100 billion barrels (bbls) of recoverable oil. Iraqi Oil Minister [[Hussain al-Shahristani]] said that Iraq is re-evaluating its estimate of proven oil reserves, and expects to revise them upwards. A major challenge to Iraq's development of the oil sector is that resources are not evenly divided across sectarian-demographic lines. Most known hydrocarbon resources are concentrated in the Shiite areas of the south and the ethnically Kurdish north, with few resources in control of the [[Sunni]] minority. The majority of the known oil and gas reserves in Iraq form a belt that runs along the eastern edge of the country. Iraq has 9 fields that are considered super giants (over 5 billion bbls) as well as 22 known giant fields (over 1 billion bbls). According to independent consultants, the cluster of super-giant fields of southeastern Iraq forms the largest known concentration of such fields in the world and accounts for 70 to 80 percent of the country's proven oil reserves. An estimated 20 percent of oil reserves are in the north of Iraq, near [[Kirkuk]], [[Mosul]] and [[Khanaqin]]. Control over rights to reserves is a source of controversy between the ethnic [[Kurd]]s and other groups in the area.<ref name=Industry>{{cite web|title=Industry in Iraq|url=http://middleeastarab.com/iq/industry-iraq.html|publisher=Middleeast Arab|accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Production====\nIn 2009, Iraq's crude oil production averaged 2.4 million barrels per day (mbd), about the same as 2008 levels, and below its pre-war production capacity level of 2.8 million mbd After the end of the US invasion the production increased on a high level, even though a new invasion from the so-called [[ISIL]] started.

Passage of the proposed Hydrocarbons Law, which would provide a legal framework for investment in the hydrocarbon sector, remains a main policy objective. Despite the absence of the [[Iraq oil law (2007)|Hydrocarbons Law]], the [[Ministry of Oil (Iraq)]] signed 12 long-term contracts between November 2008 and May 2010 with international oil companies to develop 14 oil fields. Under the first phase, companies bid to further develop 6 giant oil fields that were already producing with proven oil reserves of over 43 billion barrels. Phase two contracts were signed to develop oil fields that were already explored but not fully developed or producing commercially. Together, these contracts cover oil fields with proven reserves of over 60 billion barrels, or more than half of Iraq's current proven oil reserves. As a result of these contract awards, Iraq expects to boost production by 200,000 bbl/d by the end of 2010, and to increase production capacity by an additional 400,000 bbl/d by the end of 2011. When these fields are fully developed, they will increase total Iraqi production capacity to almost 12 million bbl/d, or 9.6 million bbl/d above current production levels. The contracts call for Iraq to reach this production target by 2017.\n\n=====Infrastructure constraints=====\nIraq faces many challenges in meeting this timetable. One of the most significant is the lack of an outlet for significant increases in crude oil production. Both Iraqi refining and export infrastructure are currently bottlenecks and need to be upgraded to process much more crude oil. Iraqi oil exports are currently running at near full capacity in the south, while export capacity in the north has been restricted by sabotage, and would need to be expanded in any case to export significantly higher volumes. Production increases of the scale planned will also require substantial increases in natural gas and/or water injection to maintain oil reservoir pressure and boost oil production.\n\nIraq has associated gas that could be used, but it is currently being flared. Another option is to use water for re-injection, and locally available water is currently being used in the south of Iraq. However, fresh water is an important commodity in the Middle East, and large amounts of seawater will likely have to be pumped in via pipelines that have yet to be built. [[ExxonMobil]] has coordinated initial studies at water injection plans for many of the fields under development. According to their estimate, 10\u201315 million bbl/d of seawater could be necessary for Iraq's expansion plans, at a cost of over $10 billion.\n\nFurthermore, Iraq's oil and gas industry is the largest industrial customer of electricity, with over 10 percent of total demand. Large-scale increases in oil production would also require large increases in power generation. However, Iraq has struggled to keep up with the demand for power, with shortages common across Iraq. Significant upgrades to the electricity sector would be needed to supply additional power. Iraq also plans to sign delineation agreements on shared oil fields with [[Kuwait]] and Iran. Iraq would like to set up joint committees with its neighbors on how to share the oil.\n\nAccording to the Oil and Gas Journal, Iraq's proven natural gas reserves are 112 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), the tenth largest in the world. An estimated 70 percent of these lie in [[Basra]] governorate in the south of Iraq. Probable Iraqi reserves have been estimated at 275\u2013300 Tcf, and work is currently underway by several IOCs and independents to accurately update hydrocarbon reserve numbers. Two-thirds of Iraq's natural gas resources are associated with oil fields including, Kirkuk, as well as the southern Nahr Bin) Umar, Majnoon, Halfaya, [[Nassiriya]], the Rumaila fields, West [[Al-Qurnah]], and [[Az Zubayr|Zubair]]. Just under 20 percent of known gas reserves are non-associated; around 10 percent is salt dome gas. The majority of non-associated reserves are concentrated in several fields in the North including: Ajil, Bai Hassan, Jambur, Chemchemal, Kor Mor, Khashem al-Ahmar, and Khashem al-Ahmar.\n\n=====Service contracts licensing results=====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

This pipeline has been subject to repeated disruptions this decade, limiting exports from the northern fields. Iraq signed an agreement with Turkey to extend the operation of the 1.6 million bbl/d pipeline, as well as to upgrade its capacity by 1 million bbl/d.\nIn order for this pipeline to reach its design capacity, Iraq would need to receive oil from the south via the Strategic Pipeline, which was designed to allow flows of crude oil from the south of Iraq to go north via Turkey, and vice versa. Iraq has proposed building a new strategic line from Basra to the northern city of [[Kirkuk]], with the line consisting of two additional crude oil pipelines. To the West: The Kirkuk-Banias Oil Pipeline has been closed and the Iraqi portion reported unusable since the 2003 war in Iraq. Discussions were held between Iraqi and Syrian government officials to re-open the pipeline, which had a design capacity of 700,000 bbl/d, although actual volumes never reached this level. The Russian company [[Stroytransgaz]] accepted an offer to fix the pipeline in December 2007, but no follow-up was made. Iraq and Syria have discussed building several new pipelines, including a 1.5 million bbl/d pipeline carrying heavy crude oil, and a 1.25 million bbl/d pipeline for carrying light crudes. To the South: The 1.65 million bbl/d Iraq Pipeline to Saudi Arabia (IPSA) has been closed since 1991 following the Persian Gulf War. There are no plans to reopen this line.\nIraq has also held discussions to build a crude oil pipeline from [[Haditha]] to Jordan's [[port of Aqaba]].\n\n====Ports====\n[[File:Iraq seaborne crude oil exports by destination in 2017 (31760972217).png|upright=1.4|thumb|Destination of Iraqi seaborne exports of crude oil in 2017]]\nThe [[Basra Oil Terminal]] on the Persian Gulf has an effective capacity to load 1.3 million bbl/d and support [[Very Large Crude Carriers]]. In February 2009, the South Oil Company commissioned Foster Wheeler to carry out the basic engineering design to rehabilitate and expand capacity of the terminal by building four single point mooring systems with a capacity of 800,000 bbl/d each. According to former Minister of Oil Issam al-Chalabi, it would take at least until 2013 to complete the project if financing is found.\nThere are five smaller ports on the Persian Gulf, all functioning at less than full capacity, including the Khor al-Amaya terminal.\n\n====Overland export routes====\nOverland routes are used to export limited amounts of crude from small fields bordering Syria. In addition, Iraq has resumed shipping oil to Jordan's [[Zarqa]]\nrefinery by road tankers at a rate of 10,000 bbl/d.\n\n===Downstream===\nEstimates of Iraqi nameplate refining capacity vary, from 637,500 bbl/d according to the Oil and Gas Journal to 790,000 bbl/d according to the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction. Iraqi refineries have antiquated infrastructure and only half run at utilization rates of 50 percent or more. Despite improvements in recent years, the sector has not been able to meet domestic demand of about 600,000 bbl/d, and the refineries produce too much heavy fuel oil and not enough other refined products. As a result, Iraq relies on imports for 30 percent of its gasoline and 17 percent of its LPG.\nTo alleviate product shortages, Iraq's 10-year strategic plan for 2008-2017 set a goal of increasing refining capacity to 1.5 million bbl/d, and is seeking $20 billion in investments to achieve this target. Iraq has plans for 4 new refineries, as well as plans for expanding the existing Daura and Basra refineries.\n\n== Natural gas ==\n\n=== Upstream ===\n\n====Gas production====\nIraqi natural gas production rose from to 81 (billion) Bcf in 2003 to 522 Bcf in 2008. Some is used as fuel for power generation, and some is re-injected to enhance oil recovery. Over 40 percent of the production in 2008 was flared due to a lack of sufficient infrastructure to utilize it for consumption and export, although [[Royal Dutch Shell]] estimated that flaring losses were even greater at 1 Bcf per day. As a result, Iraq's five natural gas processing plants, which can process over 773 billion cubic feet per year, sit mostly idle. To reduce flaring, Iraq has been working on an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell to implement a 25-year project to capture flared gas and provide it for domestic use. Iraq's cabinet gave preliminary approval for the $17 billion deal covering development of 25\u201330 Tcf of associated natural gas reserves in Basra province through a new joint venture, [[Basra Gas Company]]. The agreement, which originally was to cover all of [[Basra Governorate]], has been modified to include only the associated gas from the Rumaila, Zubair, and West Qurna Phase I projects. Implementation of this agreement is necessary for the new oil development projects to go forward.\n\n====Upstream development====\nIraq has planned an upstream bidding round in late 2010 for three non-associated natural gas fields with combined reserves of over 7.5 Tcf. This will be the third hydrocarbon bidding round conducted by Iraq, following two earlier rounds that were held to develop Iraq's oil fields. All of the companies that prequalified to bid in the two earlier rounds will be invited. Iraq has committed to purchasing 100 percent of the gas.\n\n=== Midstream ===\nPlans to export natural gas remain controversial due to the amount of idle and sub-optimally fired electricity generation capacity in Iraq\u2014much a result of a lack of adequate gas feedstock. Prior to the 1990\u20131991 [[Gulf War]], Iraq exported natural gas to Kuwait. The gas came from Rumaila through a {{convert|105|mile|km}} pipeline with a capacity of {{convert|400|e6ft3|e6m3|abbr=off}} per day to Kuwait's central processing center at [[Al Ahmadi, Kuwait|Kuwait]]. In 2007, the Ministry of Oil announced an agreement to fund a feasibility study on the revival of the mothballed pipeline. Iraq has eyed northern export routes such as the proposed [[Nabucco pipeline]] through Turkey to [[Europe]], and in July 2009 Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] suggested that Iraq could be exporting 530 Bcf per year to Europe by 2015. A second option is the [[Arab Gas Pipeline]] (AGP) project. The proposed AGP pipeline would deliver gas from Iraq's Akkas field to Syria and then on to [[Lebanon]] and the Turkish border sometime in 2010, and then on to Europe. Other proposals have included building LNG exporting facilities in the Basra region.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Iraq|Energy|Companies}}\n*[[Economy of Iraq]]\n*[[Energy in Iraq]]\n*[[Oil reserves in Iraq]]\n*[[Iraq National Oil Company]]\n*[[South Oil Company]]\n*[[Missan Oil Company]]\n*[[Midland Oil Company]]\n*[[North Oil Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Middle East topic|Petroleum industry in}}\n[[Category:Petroleum industry in Iraq]]\n", "name_user": "Januarythefifteenth", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed some punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry_in_Iraq"}
