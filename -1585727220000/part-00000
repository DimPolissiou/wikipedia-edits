In 1988, she released her self-titled album, ''[[Lucinda Williams (album)|Lucinda Williams]]''. This release featured \"[[Passionate Kisses]],\" a song later recorded by [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], which garnered Williams her first [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1994.\n\nKnown for working slowly, Williams recorded and released only one other album in the next several years, ''[[Sweet Old World]]'', in 1992. Her commercial breakthrough came in 1998 with ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', an album presenting a broader scope of songs that fused rock, blues, country and [[Americana music|Americana]] into a distinctive style that remained consistent and commercial in sound. ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'', which includes the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy nominated]] track \"Can't Let Go\", became Williams' greatest commercial success to date. The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and earned Williams a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], while being universally acclaimed by critics. Williams released the critically acclaimed ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'' three years later, and the album also became a commercial success. One of the album's tracks, \"Get Right with God,\" earned Williams the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] in 2002.\n\nWilliams has released a string of albums since that have earned her more critical acclaim and commercial success. She has won 3 [[Grammy Awards]], from 15 nominations, and received 2 [[Americana Music Honors & Awards|Americana Awards]], from 12 nominations.

Her parents divorced in the mid-1960s. Williams's father gained custody of her and her younger brother, Robert Miller, and sister, Karyn Elizabeth.

Retrieved on January 11, 2000.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nBy her early 20s, Williams was playing publicly in [[Austin]] and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], concentrating on a folk-rock-country blend. She moved to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]], in 1978 to record her first album, for [[Smithsonian]]/[[Folkways Records]]. Titled ''[[Ramblin' on My Mind]]'', it was a collection of country and [[blues]] covers. The album title was shortened to ''[[Ramblin']]'' when it was reissued. She followed it up in 1980 with ''[[Happy Woman Blues]]'', which consisted of her own material. Neither album received much attention.\n\nIn the 1980s, Williams moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] (before finally settling in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]), where, at times backed by a rock band and at others performing in acoustic settings, she developed a following and a critical reputation. While based in Los Angeles, she was briefly married to [[The Long Ryders|Long Ryders]] drummer [[Greg Sowders]], whom she had met in a club. In 1988 [[Rough Trade Records]] released the self-titled ''[[Lucinda Williams (album)|Lucinda Williams]]'', which was produced by [[Gurf Morlix]]. The single \"Changed the Locks\", about a broken relationship, received radio play around the country and gained fans among music insiders, including [[Tom Petty]], who would later cover the song.\n\nIts follow-up, ''[[Sweet Old World]]'' (Chameleon, 1992), also produced by Morlix, is a melancholy album dealing with themes of suicide and death. Williams' biggest success during the early 1990s was as a songwriter. [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] recorded a cover of \"[[Passionate Kisses]]\" (from ''Lucinda Williams'') in 1992, and the song became a smash country hit for which Williams received the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1994. Carpenter also received a Grammy for her performance of the song. She duetted with [[Steve Earle]] on the song \"You're Still Standin' There\" from his album ''[[I Feel Alright]]''. In 1991, the song \"Lucinda Williams\" appeared on [[Vic Chesnutt]]'s album ''West of Rome''.\n\nWilliams had garnered considerable critical acclaim, but her commercial success was moderate. [[Emmylou Harris]] said of Williams, \"She is an example of the best of what country at least says it is, but, for some reason, she's completely out of the loop and I feel strongly that that's country music's loss.\" Harris recorded the title track from Williams's ''Sweet Old World'' for her career-redefining 1995 album, ''[[Wrecking Ball (Emmylou Harris album)|Wrecking Ball]]''.\n\nWilliams also gained a reputation as a perfectionist and slow worker when it came to recording; six years would pass before her next album release, though she appeared as a guest on other artists' albums and contributed to several tribute compilations during this period.\n\n===''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road''===\nThe long-awaited release, 1998's ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', was Williams' breakthrough into the mainstream and received a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Containing the single \"Still I Long for Your Kiss\" from the [[Robert Redford]] film ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'', the album received wide critical notice and soon went gold. The single \"Can't Let Go\" also enjoyed considerable crossover radio play. Williams toured with [[Bob Dylan]], the [[The Allman Brothers|Allman Brothers]] and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], and on her own in support of the album.  An expanded edition of the album, including three additional studio recordings and a second CD documenting a 1998 concert, was released in 2006.\n\nIn 1999, she appeared on ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'', duetting with [[David Crosby]] on the title track of the tribute album.\n\nWilliams followed up the success of ''Car Wheels'' with ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'' (2001). This release features a less produced, more down-tuned approach both musically and lyrically, and moved Williams further from the country music establishment while winning fans in the alternative music world. She won the 2001 [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for the single \"Get Right with God,\" an atypically uptempo gospel-rock tune from the otherwise rather low-key release.  The title track includes a contribution on a Hammond organ by [[alternative country]] musician [[Ryan Adams]].\n\nHer seventh album, ''[[World Without Tears]]'', was released in 2003. A musically adventurous though lyrically downbeat album, this release found Williams experimenting with talking blues stylings and electric blues.\n\n===Recent work===\n\n[[File:Lucinda Williams at a Lincoln Center Out Of Doors concert in New York City, August 2016.jpg|thumb|438x438px|Lucinda Williams at a Lincoln Center Out Of Doors concert in New York City, August 2016]]\n\nWilliams was a guest vocalist on the song \"Factory Girls\" from Irish punk-folk band [[Flogging Molly]]'s 2004 album, \"[[Within a Mile of Home]],\" and appeared on [[Elvis Costello]]'s ''[[The Delivery Man]]''. She sings with folk legend [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] on the track \"Careless Darling\" from his 2006 release \"I Stand Alone.\"\n\nIn 2006, Williams recorded a version of the [[John Hartford]] classic \"[[Gentle on My Mind (song)|Gentle on My Mind]],\" which played over the [[closing credits]] of the [[Will Ferrell]] film ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]]''.\n\nIn 2007, Williams released ''[[West (Lucinda Williams album)|West]]'', for which she wrote more than 27 songs. The album was released on February 13, 2007. It addresses her mother's death and a tumultuous relationship break-up. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' praised it, saying \"Lucinda Williams has made the record of a lifetime\u2014part [[Hank Williams]], part Bob Dylan, part [[Keith Richards]] circa ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' ...\"\n\nIn the fall of 2007, Williams announced a series of shows in Los Angeles and New York. Playing five nights in each city, she performed her entire catalog on consecutive nights.  These albums include the self-titled ''Lucinda Williams'', ''Sweet Old World'', ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'', ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'', and ''[[World Without Tears]]''. Each night also featured a second set with special guest stars. Some of the many special guests included [[Steve Earle]], [[Allison Moorer]], [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], [[Greg Dulli]], [[Mark Oliver Everett|E]], [[Ann Wilson]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[David Byrne]], [[David Johansen]], [[Yo la Tengo]], [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]], [[Chuck Prophet]], [[Jim Lauderdale]] and [[Shelby Lynne]]. In addition, each night's album set was recorded and made available to the attendees that night. These live recordings are currently available on her website and at her shows.\n\nThe next album from Williams wrapped recording in March 2008. Titled ''[[Little Honey]]'', it was released on October 14 of that year. It includes 13 songs\u2014among them, \"Real Love\" and \"Little Rock Star,\" the latter inspired by music celebrities in the press, like [[Pete Doherty]] and [[Amy Winehouse]]. \"Little Honey\" also includes a cover of AC/DC's \"Long Way to the Top\" and \"Rarity,\" inspired by singer-songwriter Mia Doi Todd.<ref>Gamboa, Glenn.

In 1988, she released her self-titled album, ''[[Lucinda Williams (album)|Lucinda Williams]]''. This release featured \"[[Passionate Kisses]],\" a song later recorded by [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], which garnered Williams her first [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1994.\n\nKnown for working slowly, Williams recorded and released only one other album in the next several years, ''[[Sweet Old World]]'', in 1992. Her commercial breakthrough came in 1998 with ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', an album presenting a broader scope of songs that fused rock, blues, country and [[Americana music|Americana]] into a distinctive style that remained consistent and commercial in sound. ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'', which includes the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy nominated]] track \"Can't Let Go\", became Williams' greatest commercial success to date. The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and earned Williams a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], while being universally acclaimed by critics. Williams released the critically acclaimed ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'' three years later, and the album also became a commercial success. One of the album's tracks, \"Get Right with God,\" earned Williams the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] in 2002.\n\nWilliams has released a string of albums since that have earned her more critical acclaim and commercial success. She has won 3 [[Grammy Awards]], from 15 nominations, and received 2 [[Americana Music Honors & Awards|Americana Awards]], from 12 nominations.

She moved to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]], in 1978 to record her first album, for [[Smithsonian]]/[[Folkways Records]]. Titled ''[[Ramblin' on My Mind]]'', it was a collection of country and [[blues]] covers. The album title was shortened to ''[[Ramblin']]'' when it was reissued. She followed it up in 1980 with ''[[Happy Woman Blues]]'', which consisted of her own material. Neither album received much attention.\n\nIn the 1980s, Williams moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] (before finally settling in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]), where, at times backed by a rock band and at others performing in acoustic settings, she developed a following and a critical reputation. While based in Los Angeles, she was briefly married to [[The Long Ryders|Long Ryders]] drummer [[Greg Sowders]], whom she had met in a club. In 1988 [[Rough Trade Records]] released the self-titled ''[[Lucinda Williams (album)|Lucinda Williams]]'', which was produced by [[Gurf Morlix]]. The single \"Changed the Locks\", about a broken relationship, received radio play around the country and gained fans among music insiders, including [[Tom Petty]], who would later cover the song.\n\nIts follow-up, ''[[Sweet Old World]]'' (Chameleon, 1992), also produced by Morlix, is a melancholy album dealing with themes of suicide and death. Williams' biggest success during the early 1990s was as a songwriter. [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] recorded a cover of \"[[Passionate Kisses]]\" (from ''Lucinda Williams'') in 1992, and the song became a smash country hit for which Williams received the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1994. Carpenter also received a Grammy for her performance of the song. She duetted with [[Steve Earle]] on the song \"You're Still Standin' There\" from his album ''[[I Feel Alright]]''. In 1991, the song \"Lucinda Williams\" appeared on [[Vic Chesnutt]]'s album ''West of Rome''.\n\nWilliams had garnered considerable critical acclaim, but her commercial success was moderate. [[Emmylou Harris]] said of Williams, \"She is an example of the best of what country at least says it is, but, for some reason, she's completely out of the loop and I feel strongly that that's country music's loss.\" Harris recorded the title track from Williams's ''Sweet Old World'' for her career-redefining 1995 album, ''[[Wrecking Ball (Emmylou Harris album)|Wrecking Ball]]''.\n\nWilliams also gained a reputation as a perfectionist and slow worker when it came to recording; six years would pass before her next album release, though she appeared as a guest on other artists' albums and contributed to several tribute compilations during this period.\n\n===''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road''===\nThe long-awaited release, 1998's ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', was Williams' breakthrough into the mainstream and received a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Containing the single \"Still I Long for Your Kiss\" from the [[Robert Redford]] film ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'', the album received wide critical notice and soon went gold. The single \"Can't Let Go\" also enjoyed considerable crossover radio play. Williams toured with [[Bob Dylan]], the [[The Allman Brothers|Allman Brothers]] and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], and on her own in support of the album.  An expanded edition of the album, including three additional studio recordings and a second CD documenting a 1998 concert, was released in 2006.\n\nIn 1999, she appeared on ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'', duetting with [[David Crosby]] on the title track of the tribute album.\n\nWilliams followed up the success of ''Car Wheels'' with ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'' (2001). This release features a less produced, more down-tuned approach both musically and lyrically, and moved Williams further from the country music establishment while winning fans in the alternative music world. She won the 2001 [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for the single \"Get Right with God,\" an atypically uptempo gospel-rock tune from the otherwise rather low-key release.  The title track includes a contribution on a Hammond organ by [[alternative country]] musician [[Ryan Adams]].\n\nHer seventh album, ''[[World Without Tears]]'', was released in 2003. A musically adventurous though lyrically downbeat album, this release found Williams experimenting with talking blues stylings and electric blues.\n\n===Recent work===\n\n[[File:Lucinda Williams at a Lincoln Center Out Of Doors concert in New York City, August 2016.jpg|thumb|438x438px|Lucinda Williams at a Lincoln Center Out Of Doors concert in New York City, August 2016]]\n\nWilliams was a guest vocalist on the song \"Factory Girls\" from Irish punk-folk band [[Flogging Molly]]'s 2004 album, \"[[Within a Mile of Home]],\" and appeared on [[Elvis Costello]]'s ''[[The Delivery Man]]''. She sings with folk legend [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] on the track \"Careless Darling\" from his 2006 release \"I Stand Alone.\"\n\nIn 2006, Williams recorded a version of the [[John Hartford]] classic \"[[Gentle on My Mind (song)|Gentle on My Mind]],\" which played over the [[closing credits]] of the [[Will Ferrell]] film ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]]''.\n\nIn 2007, Williams released ''[[West (Lucinda Williams album)|West]]'', for which she wrote more than 27 songs. The album was released on February 13, 2007. It addresses her mother's death and a tumultuous relationship break-up. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' praised it, saying \"Lucinda Williams has made the record of a lifetime\u2014part [[Hank Williams]], part Bob Dylan, part [[Keith Richards]] circa ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' ...\"\n\nIn the fall of 2007, Williams announced a series of shows in Los Angeles and New York. Playing five nights in each city, she performed her entire catalog on consecutive nights.  These albums include the self-titled ''Lucinda Williams'', ''Sweet Old World'', ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'', ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'', and ''[[World Without Tears]]''. Each night also featured a second set with special guest stars. Some of the many special guests included [[Steve Earle]], [[Allison Moorer]], [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], [[Greg Dulli]], [[Mark Oliver Everett|E]], [[Ann Wilson]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[David Byrne]], [[David Johansen]], [[Yo la Tengo]], [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]], [[Chuck Prophet]], [[Jim Lauderdale]] and [[Shelby Lynne]]. In addition, each night's album set was recorded and made available to the attendees that night. These live recordings are currently available on her website and at her shows.\n\nThe next album from Williams wrapped recording in March 2008. Titled ''[[Little Honey]]'', it was released on October 14 of that year. It includes 13 songs\u2014among them, \"Real Love\" and \"Little Rock Star,\" the latter inspired by music celebrities in the press, like [[Pete Doherty]] and [[Amy Winehouse]]. \"Little Honey\" also includes a cover of AC/DC's \"Long Way to the Top\" and \"Rarity,\" inspired by singer-songwriter Mia Doi Todd.<ref>Gamboa, Glenn.

This plan was signed by all parties on May 6, 2002, in the so-called \"Prague Agreement\". The Kramnik-Leko match took place (the match was drawn, with Kramnik retaining his title); the Kasparov-Ponomariov match was canceled in 2003, and this particular plan became moot when Kasparov retired in 2005. In the end the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2006]] between Kramnik and [[Veselin Topalov]] reunited the world championship title.\n\nFollowing a series of events Seirawan participated in China during September 2003, there were reports that he would be retiring as a professional player. In the July 2007 [[FIDE]] list, Seirawan had an [[Elo rating]] of 2634, placing him in the top 100 chess players in the world, and America's number four (behind [[Hikaru Nakamura]], [[Gata Kamsky]] and [[Alexander Onischuk]]). He played six games in the July 2007 FIDE update.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 2007, Seirawan unveiled his [[chess variant|enhanced chess game]] called [[Seirawan chess]]. The first ever event was a 12-board simultaneous exhibition held March 31, 2007 in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessmastery.com/seirawan-simul.html |title=GM Yasser Seirawan Gives Seirawan Chess Simultaneous |work=Chessmastery.com}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, Seirawan returned from hiatus to competitive chess, playing for the U.S. team in the world team championship in China. He had wins versus top GMs [[Judit Polgar]] and [[Shakhriyar Mamedyarov]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chess-results.com/tnr53136.aspx?art=9&lan=1&snr=38 |title=Yinzhou Cup 2011 World ChessTeam Championship \u2013 Player Info: Seirawan Yasser|website=Chess-Results.com |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSeirawan won the 2011 and 2012 Dutch Open Blitz championship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snelschaakmarathon.nl/SSM2011/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=151&Itemid=98 |title=Hall of fame (list of winners Dutch Open Blitzchess championship) |work=Snelschaakmarathon.nl}}</ref>\n\nSeirawan is widely known for his expert commentary in live broadcasts on the Internet during important events.

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2020. This was the second season with [[Rik van de Westelaken]] as host. The location of the season was the [[Henan]] province in [[China|The People's Republic of China]], the second time the series had filmed in China, following [[Hong Kong]] in season 14. The season premiered on January 11, 2020. While the originally planned Live Finale aired with no audience on March 14, 2020. During the Reunion, Buddy Vedder was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac13,400.-. Vedder, alongside his runner-ups Miljuschka Witzenhausen and Nathan Rutjes, had successfully unmasked Rob Dekay as the Mole.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Mexico]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are 3 remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith the exception of the Black Exemption, that has been included throughout the series since its introduction in Season 14, there were no major twists added to the season. However, after 13 years since Season 7, this season was the second to end with four candidates competing in the Finale to unmask the Mole.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|{{ill|Rob Dekay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Buddy Vedder|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Miljuschka Witzenhausen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|[[Nathan Rutjes]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|{{nowrap|Second Runner-Up}}\n|-\n|{{ill|Leonie ter Braak|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|16\n|4th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Claes Iversen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|12\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Johan Goossens|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|10\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Jaike Belfor|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|6\n|7th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Tina de Bruin|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|8th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Anita Witzier|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|3\n|9th place\n|}\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

After the assignment was complete, the group found out that they had 49 successful transactions at \u20ac25 per transaction, however, as the game has no \u20ac5.- note, the group's winnings were rounded down to the nearest zero.\n\n\u20ac1,220.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Richtingsgevoel?' (Sense of Direction) - Max. \u20ac6,000.-\n\nThe final assignment took place at the Lijing Gate, where one at a time, the contestants met with Rik for one final offer. Along the top floor of the gate stood 6 doors in which the contestants could check to earn money. However, each contestant had to choose either to risk \u20ac500, \u20ac1,000, or \u20ac1,500 from the pot for the assignment. The Mole's voice is put through software to disguise themselves from the contestants. Once they have made their choice known to Rik, the Mole separates the money between 1 to 3 of the six doors and calls the contestant over the phone to tell them where they hid the money. The contestant must decide after every two doors to believe or distrust the Mole's instructions to check for money. The game continues until either all the money they risked is collected, or if the contestant has checked up to 3 doors of the six doors. Whatever money they managed to retrieve would be doubled and put back into the final pot.\n\nThe outcome of the assignment will be revealed during the live reunion at the end of the season.\n\nAfter the assignment, Rik informed the four contestants that they were indeed the finalists (to their surprise) and to prepare for their final test of the season.\n\n===Episode 10 - Finale===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 10 - Finale\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 14 March 2020<br>Locations: [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, Netherlands]]\n|-\n!

The finalists, Buddy, Miljuschka, Nathan, and Rob were gathered the morning of the Live Finale for the reveal of the Mole and the outcome of the final test back in Luoyang, Henan. With the final test being multiple choice out of 40 questions, in Third place was Nathan with a score of 34. Second place, Miljuschka, totaling up to 37 out of 40. At the announcement that Rob was the Mole, Buddy won the season with a final test score of an outstanding 39 out of 40.\n\nAfter the reveal of the Mole's identity, it was revealed that Rob managed to remove \u20ac300.- from the pot in the Mol Laser assignment. Despite his best efforts, the Finalists managed to earn \u20ac2,500.- for the pot during the final assignment, Richtingsgevoel. Leaving a grand total of \u20ac13,400 in the winner's pot for Buddy.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\nRob's strategy as the Mole was to play up his superfan status of Wie is de Mol on and off camera to the annoyance of the production to throw off his fellow Candidates. His strategy worked as only on the final test did the other Candidates finally chose him as their Moles.\n\n'''Beltegoed:''' While the group were scattered throughout the market gathering local Chinese people to use their phones for the assignment, Rob would sabotage the tablets to display lower amounts of money for the group to photograph.\n\n'''Parkeertarief:''' Rob was informed that the truck he was locked in with Leonie would cause the group to earn a maximum of \u20ac200,- if they did not get out. So he delayed solving their puzzle until the time ran out. Luckily a second truck did not complete their assignment, thus the group only managed to earn \u20ac20,- for the assignment.\n\n'''Beeldig:''' Rob placed himself in the group that had to search for envelopes in this assignment. His goal was to make sure neither group collected the correct envelopes. Directing his group to incorrect statues as quickly as he could to make sure Minus money would be collected. In one instance he took out money from one of the correct envelopes (and hid it in his hat) to further reduce the group's earnings from the assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' With Nathan as Treasurer selecting the group's roles in the assignment, Rob lucked out into the Traffic Guide position where he could give false directions over the radio phones to the drivers when he felt like it. In such a powerful position, he managed to make sure to keep the pot low by making sure only 7 out of the 10 cars were correctly driven and parked for a mere \u20ac320,-. His poor \"Etherdiscipline\" aided in delaying and confusing the Candidates further throughout the assignment.\n\n'''Lettergreep:''' Aware of which letters had to be found for the second stage of the assignment, Rob ran the first stage as a fanatical candidate and found 4 letters and the Question Mark. As the W was not found, that reduced the potential earning, and during the second stage, he let Leonie take charge in searching for the remaining money without helping behind the scenes.\n\n'''Voice Mol:''' While Buddy took charge of the measuring for this assignment, Rob would be on the other end of the measuring tape, pulling the tape further than necessary to fudge the certain distances. Once all the phones were found, he made sure that a certain distance was one meter off to make sure the group never called Rik.\n\n'''Alles Kenners:''' Rob volunteered to enter the village first, so that he could switch the correct envelopes with wrong envelopes. Further sabotage was that he searched for the sand vials for the timer and dig holes in the ground to hide them from the group, meaning less time for Nathan to search for the correct envelopes he had already sabotaged.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob managed to hide throughout the laser tag field against most of the candidates, however, when it came down to Nathan's battle against him, Nathan's antics scared Rob until he chose to be taken out instead of being caught and unmasked. In the end of the assignment, Rob managed to take out \u20ac300.- from the group's pot.\n\n'''Scherp Stellen:''' Having memorized the 15 photographs required for the assignment beforehand, Rob made sure that the others didn't remember the correct instructions; causing only 4 out of the 15 photographs to be correct at the end of the assignment.\n\n'''Cijferkunst:''' Knowing that Nathan as the treasurer would have an influential role at the end of the assignment, Rob avoided pairing up with him. Paired up with Buddy, who wanted to bait Rob into sabotaging, he let Buddy bait him into giving Rik the wrong answer and causing the assignment to fail. It was the moment that Buddy finally locked onto Rob as the Mole, as the group's main suspect Leonie had just been executed from the game.\n\n'''Richtingsgevoel:''' Using a voice muffler over a phone, Rob tried to use reverse psychology against Nathan, to no avail. Leading to Nathan reclaiming the money he risked. With Miljuschka, he chose to build trust to bluff her later, however she too didn't fall for his tricks. Eventually, when he got to Buddy he managed to fool him out of \u20ac500.-, the eventual total in the assignment led up to \u20ac2,500.-, out of a potential \u20ac4,500.-.\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n'''Episode 1 - Afgeschermd:''' In ''Beltegoed'', Rob made sure to point out the \u20ac20.- to indicate that he was the 20th Mole.\n\n'''Episode 5 - Aangeraakt:''' The Candidates and audience could have spotted the Mole in ''Lezen en Schrijven''. One of the fans in the park said \"The Mole is here\" when Rob was on the screen searching.\n\n'''Episode Titles:''' The titles throughout the season pointed out to Rob's sabotages, Episode 2 ''Tegendraads'', which translates to contrary, is shown when the wires in ''Kleur Werk'' near Rob and Claes were in the contrary direction than where they should have been. ''Misleid'' (Mislead) pointed to Rob's role as the Traffic Guide misleading the drivers. ''Aangeraakt'' (Touched) had Rob literally touch the letters M, O, L, in that order during the ''Lettergreep'' assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' During the beginning of the assignment, taking the first, second, third, and fourth letters of the first four road signs shown on screen, the letters M, O, L, R would spell out Mol R. A subtle suggestion that Rob was the Mole.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob's confessionals during this assignment were presented as the Mol talking to his opponents. And during his turn in the assignment he called out each of his opponents during the battle.\n\n'''Episode 6 - Voor Geen Meter:''' Rik's introduction monologue in this episode made a direct reference to one of Rob's tattoos. \"De Mol is tevreden.\" (The Mole is satisfied.) The words \"Tevreden\" is tattooed on Rob's shoulder, which is shown throughout the season.\n==Viewing Figures==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"| Viewing Figures\n|-\n! #\n!

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2020. This was the second season with [[Rik van de Westelaken]] as host. The location of the season was the [[Henan]] province in [[China|The People's Republic of China]], the second time the series had filmed in China, following [[Hong Kong]] in season 14. The season premiered on January 11, 2020. While the originally planned Live Finale aired with no audience on March 14, 2020. During the Reunion, Buddy Vedder was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac13,400.-. Vedder, alongside his runner-ups Miljuschka Witzenhausen and Nathan Rutjes, had successfully unmasked Rob Dekay as the Mole.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Mexico]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are 3 remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith the exception of the Black Exemption, that has been included throughout the series since its introduction in Season 14, there were no major twists added to the season. However, after 13 years since Season 7, this season was the second to end with four candidates competing in the Finale to unmask the Mole.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|{{ill|Rob Dekay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Buddy Vedder|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Miljuschka Witzenhausen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|[[Nathan Rutjes]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|{{nowrap|Second Runner-Up}}\n|-\n|{{ill|Leonie ter Braak|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|16\n|4th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Claes Iversen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|12\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Johan Goossens|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|10\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Jaike Belfor|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|6\n|7th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Tina de Bruin|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|8th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Anita Witzier|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|3\n|9th place\n|}\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

He gives everyone the option to either choose wisdom or luck by going through the left or right gate. Once the contestant has gone through the gate, they got a key and a note with a pattern of Chinese characters. When they went further ahead, they encountered a giant wall with more Chinese characters on it. The contestant then had to match the pattern on their note with the corresponding pattern on the wall. When they found their pattern, they got to open the box underneath, and if it was correct, there was a reward inside for them to keep.\n\nIf the contestant chose for luck, they got an 'exemption', which would automatically grant them a spot in the next round when used at the test.

Therefore, no one was executed.\n|-\n!colspan=3|Execution\n|-\n|colspan=3| No one executed\n|}\n\n;'Kleur Rijk' (Colourful) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-\nIn the midst of the local Dayang factory in Luoyang, the group select one contestant to record the group's observations, with special emphasis to the colours they see. Throughout the time limit of 20 minutes, electric cars of various colours drive past the contestants, with various words of colours placed on the backs of each car (which are also in various colours). After the time limit, Rik asks the contestant who wrote down the group's observations three questions about the number of red cars, number of cars with the word 'red' on their back, and how many words were written in red. Each correct answer earned \u20ac500.- for the pot.\n\nThe contestants failed the assignment and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Mol Laser' (Mole Laser) - Max. \u20ac1,600.-\nThe annual laser-game assignment occurred in the early evening in a barrack in the Luoyang. Throughout the barracks are light installations in which the contestants would have to shoot at with a laser gun. For each red light the contestants hit and turn green, they earn \u20ac100.- for the pot. However, they will be playing one on one against the Mole, who has to shoot green lights red to remove \u20ac100.- from the pot. Each round ends when either the contestant or the Mole is hit by their opponent's laser gun.\n\nThe outcome of the assignment will be revealed during the live reunion at the end of the season.\n\n;'Scherp Stellen' (Sharp Couples) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-\nTaken to a tourist theme park in Luoyang, Rik read out a list of 15 photographs the contestants had to take with the locals in the theme park. Some involved a combination of group photos with locals including certain contestants, some with only locals wearing specific outfits, or in specific locations. The contestants had 20 minutes to complete the assignment. Each correct photograph supplied to Rik earned \u20ac100.- for the pot.\n\n\u20ac400.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Executie' (Execution)\nBefore the Execution ceremony began, Rik informed the group that they had an opportunity to avoid viewing their results during this execution. Each contestant had to select between a Red or Green card hidden by Rik. If the contestant chose a Green card, they got to choose someone else who didn't have to see their results screen. If the contestant chose a Red card, they would choose who will see their result screen. The execution game ends if someone sees a Red screen, or if all contestants chosen to see their results screen only see Green; thus everyone proceeding to the next episode.\n===Episode 8 - Doorgeven===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 8 - Doorgeven\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 29 February 2020<br>Locations: [[Luoyang, Henan]]\n|-\n!

The two remaining contestants stay by the map at the starting point and must direct the three cyclists over the phone to the coloured bicycles throughout the city. Starting on blue bicycles, each of the cycles must proceed to swap bicycles in the order of Blue, Orange, White, and lastly Green before returning to the start. The more swaps each cyclist makes, the more money is earned for the pot if the cyclist returns within the 30 minute time limit.\n\n\u20ac250.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Je Draai Vinden' (Find Your Way)\nAfter lunch, the contestants were escorted to a prominent dining venue in Luoyang that [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] [[Xi Jinping]] had dined in while visiting the city. Once seated at the table, Rik informed the group that they would be answering 10 questions about their journey so far, with the goal of acquiring the most points. After each question (starting with the contestant that drew first, then clockwise around the table) each contestant is given the choice to keep their answer, or rotate the table until they get the answer they want from another contestant. The contestant with the most points after 10 questions receives an Exemption that they can use for the next Execution. In the event of a tie, the first contestant to break the tie wins the Exemption.\n\nMiljuschka broke the tiebreaker against Nathan and won the Exemption.\n\n;'Doorzichtig' (Transparant) - Max. \u20ac2,000.-\nTaking the morning to drive to the Three Gorges Scenic Area, the contestants were instructed to position themselves along a glass suspension bridge high above the Yellow River.; a common feature in parks around China. Across the bridge stood 6 boxes with tubes in 5 of them. At the beginning of the assignment, the contestants could look once inside the tubes at their corresponding boxes to see the amount of money they held. Once they have looked at their tubes, the group must swap them among themselves to fill five box with three vials to match the \u20ac amount on the lid of the box. The boxes increase in amounts from \u20ac80.-, to a sixth box valued at \u20ac1,200.- that can hold 9 tubes. The group has 20 minutes to complete the assignment, and only boxes with the correct tubes in them would become money for the pot.\n\n\u20ac80.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 9 - Sturen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode  - Sturen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 7 March 2020<br>Locations: [[Luoyang, Henan]]\n|-\n!

After the first viewing, Rik revealed that in duos, the group must decipher the number sequence the children in the Martial Arts demonstration are performing, with the help of a number chart. After three more viewings of the demonstration, Rik approached the treasurer, Nathan, and asked if the other duo knew the answer. If the treasurer's judgment is correct, the group would earn \u20ac1,750.-. \n\nThe contestants failed the assignment and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Onder de Pannen?' (Under the Pans?) - Max. N/A\n\nThat evening in the Shi Jie Night Market in Luoyang, the contestants were tasked for form duos again between two food carts. They had two hours to prepare, cook, and sell Dutch food to the local marketgoers. For every transaction made, the group earned money for the pot. After the assignment was complete, the group found out that they had 49 successful transactions at \u20ac25 per transaction, however, as the game has no \u20ac5.- note, the group's winnings were rounded down to the nearest zero.\n\n\u20ac1,220.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Richtingsgevoel?' (Sense of Direction) - Max. \u20ac6,000.-\n\nThe final assignment took place at the Lijing Gate, where one at a time, the contestants met with Rik for one final offer. Along the top floor of the gate stood 6 doors in which the contestants could check to earn money. However, each contestant had to choose either to risk \u20ac500, \u20ac1,000, or \u20ac1,500 from the pot for the assignment. The Mole's voice is put through software to disguise themselves from the contestants. Once they have made their choice known to Rik, the Mole separates the money between 1 to 3 of the six doors and calls the contestant over the phone to tell them where they hid the money. The contestant must decide after every two doors to believe or distrust the Mole's instructions to check for money. The game continues until either all the money they risked is collected, or if the contestant has checked up to 3 doors of the six doors. Whatever money they managed to retrieve would be doubled and put back into the final pot.\n\nThe outcome of the assignment will be revealed during the live reunion at the end of the season.\n\nAfter the assignment, Rik informed the four contestants that they were indeed the finalists (to their surprise) and to prepare for their final test of the season.\n\n===Episode 10 - Finale===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 10 - Finale\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 14 March 2020<br>Locations: [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, Netherlands]]\n|-\n!

The finalists, Buddy, Miljuschka, Nathan, and Rob were gathered the morning of the Live Finale for the reveal of the Mole and the outcome of the final test back in Luoyang, Henan. With the final test being multiple choice out of 40 questions, in Third place was Nathan with a score of 34. Second place, Miljuschka, totaling up to 37 out of 40. At the announcement that Rob was the Mole, Buddy won the season with a final test score of an outstanding 39 out of 40.\n\nAfter the reveal of the Mole's identity, it was revealed that Rob managed to remove \u20ac300.- from the pot in the Mol Laser assignment. Despite his best efforts, the Finalists managed to earn \u20ac2,500.- for the pot during the final assignment, Richtingsgevoel. Leaving a grand total of \u20ac13,400 in the winner's pot for Buddy.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\nRob's strategy as the Mole was to play up his superfan status of Wie is de Mol on and off camera to the annoyance of the production to throw off his fellow Candidates. His strategy worked as only on the final test did the other Candidates finally chose him as their Moles.\n\n'''Beltegoed:''' While the group were scattered throughout the market gathering local Chinese people to use their phones for the assignment, Rob would sabotage the tablets to display lower amounts of money for the group to photograph.\n\n'''Parkeertarief:''' Rob was informed that the truck he was locked in with Leonie would cause the group to earn a maximum of \u20ac200,- if they did not get out. So he delayed solving their puzzle until the time ran out. Luckily a second truck did not complete their assignment, thus the group only managed to earn \u20ac20,- for the assignment.\n\n'''Beeldig:''' Rob placed himself in the group that had to search for envelopes in this assignment. His goal was to make sure neither group collected the correct envelopes. Directing his group to incorrect statues as quickly as he could to make sure Minus money would be collected. In one instance he took out money from one of the correct envelopes (and hid it in his hat) to further reduce the group's earnings from the assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' With Nathan as Treasurer selecting the group's roles in the assignment, Rob lucked out into the Traffic Guide position where he could give false directions over the radio phones to the drivers when he felt like it. In such a powerful position, he managed to make sure to keep the pot low by making sure only 7 out of the 10 cars were correctly driven and parked for a mere \u20ac320,-. His poor \"Etherdiscipline\" aided in delaying and confusing the Candidates further throughout the assignment.\n\n'''Lettergreep:''' Aware of which letters had to be found for the second stage of the assignment, Rob ran the first stage as a fanatical candidate and found 4 letters and the Question Mark. As the W was not found, that reduced the potential earning, and during the second stage, he let Leonie take charge in searching for the remaining money without helping behind the scenes.\n\n'''Voice Mol:''' While Buddy took charge of the measuring for this assignment, Rob would be on the other end of the measuring tape, pulling the tape further than necessary to fudge the certain distances. Once all the phones were found, he made sure that a certain distance was one meter off to make sure the group never called Rik.\n\n'''Alles Kenners:''' Rob volunteered to enter the village first, so that he could switch the correct envelopes with wrong envelopes. Further sabotage was that he searched for the sand vials for the timer and dig holes in the ground to hide them from the group, meaning less time for Nathan to search for the correct envelopes he had already sabotaged.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob managed to hide throughout the laser tag field against most of the candidates, however, when it came down to Nathan's battle against him, Nathan's antics scared Rob until he chose to be taken out instead of being caught and unmasked. In the end of the assignment, Rob managed to take out \u20ac300.- from the group's pot.\n\n'''Scherp Stellen:''' Having memorized the 15 photographs required for the assignment beforehand, Rob made sure that the others didn't remember the correct instructions; causing only 4 out of the 15 photographs to be correct at the end of the assignment.\n\n'''Cijferkunst:''' Knowing that Nathan as the treasurer would have an influential role at the end of the assignment, Rob avoided pairing up with him. Paired up with Buddy, who wanted to bait Rob into sabotaging, he let Buddy bait him into giving Rik the wrong answer and causing the assignment to fail. It was the moment that Buddy finally locked onto Rob as the Mole, as the group's main suspect Leonie had just been executed from the game.\n\n'''Richtingsgevoel:''' Using a voice muffler over a phone, Rob tried to use reverse psychology against Nathan, to no avail. Leading to Nathan reclaiming the money he risked. With Miljuschka, he chose to build trust to bluff her later, however she too didn't fall for his tricks. Eventually, when he got to Buddy he managed to fool him out of \u20ac500.-, the eventual total in the assignment led up to \u20ac2,500.-, out of a potential \u20ac4,500.-.\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n'''Episode 1 - Afgeschermd:''' In ''Beltegoed'', Rob made sure to point out the \u20ac20.- to indicate that he was the 20th Mole.\n\n'''Episode 5 - Aangeraakt:''' The Candidates and audience could have spotted the Mole in ''Lezen en Schrijven''. One of the fans in the park said \"The Mole is here\" when Rob was on the screen searching.\n\n'''Episode Titles:''' The titles throughout the season pointed out to Rob's sabotages, Episode 2 ''Tegendraads'', which translates to contrary, is shown when the wires in ''Kleur Werk'' near Rob and Claes were in the contrary direction than where they should have been. ''Misleid'' (Mislead) pointed to Rob's role as the Traffic Guide misleading the drivers. ''Aangeraakt'' (Touched) had Rob literally touch the letters M, O, L, in that order during the ''Lettergreep'' assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' During the beginning of the assignment, taking the first, second, third, and fourth letters of the first four road signs shown on screen, the letters M, O, L, R would spell out Mol R. A subtle suggestion that Rob was the Mole.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob's confessionals during this assignment were presented as the Mol talking to his opponents. And during his turn in the assignment he called out each of his opponents during the battle.\n\n'''Episode 6 - Voor Geen Meter:''' Rik's introduction monologue in this episode made a direct reference to one of Rob's tattoos. \"De Mol is tevreden.\" (The Mole is satisfied.) The words \"Tevreden\" is tattooed on Rob's shoulder, which is shown throughout the season.\n==Viewing Figures==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"| Viewing Figures\n|-\n! #\n!

IFK participated in the first season of [[Allsvenskan]] in 1924/25. The club has altogether played 13 seasons in the premier division, in 1960 IFK finished second. In 1961 they made it to the quarterfinals in the European Cup (losing to Rapid Vienna). At home IFK plays in yellow jerseys, white shorts and white socks. Before the 2009 season, the club switched their home stadium from [[Malm\u00f6 IP]] to [[Malm\u00f6 Stadion]]. IFK Malm\u00f6 is often colloquially called ''di gule'' (The yellow ones) in reference to their team colours. Historically the club's main rivals are [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] although this rivalry has been toned down since the clubs have not played in the same division for nearly 60 years.\n\nIn the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], the [[Argentina national football team]] wore the IFK Malm\u00f6's home shirt, because Germany would not agree to use its alternative colours.<ref>{{cite web |url=

[[Malm\u00f6]]. The club is affiliated with [[Sk\u00e5nes Fotbollf\u00f6rbund]] and play their home games at [[Malm\u00f6 Stadion]]. The club colours, reflected in their crest and kit, are yellow, blue and white. Formed on 23 April 1899, the club have played thirteen seasons in Sweden's highest league [[Allsvenskan]] where they best finished as runners-up in [[1960 Allsvenskan|1960]] and played their most recent season in [[1962 Allsvenskan|1962]]. IFK Malm\u00f6 also reached the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions Cup]] in the [[1960\u201361 European Cup|1960\u201361]] season. The club is currently playing in [[Swedish football Division 2|Division 2 V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland]], the fourth tier of Swedish football.\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded in 1899 making it the oldest [[association football|football club]] in [[Malm\u00f6]]. IFK participated in the first season of [[Allsvenskan]] in 1924/25. The club has altogether played 13 seasons in the premier division, in 1960 IFK finished second. In 1961 they made it to the quarterfinals in the European Cup (losing to Rapid Vienna). At home IFK plays in yellow jerseys, white shorts and white socks. Before the 2009 season, the club switched their home stadium from [[Malm\u00f6 IP]] to [[Malm\u00f6 Stadion]]. IFK Malm\u00f6 is often colloquially called ''di gule'' (The yellow ones) in reference to their team colours. Historically the club's main rivals are [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] although this rivalry has been toned down since the clubs have not played in the same division for nearly 60 years.\n\nIn the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], the [[Argentina national football team]] wore the IFK Malm\u00f6's home shirt, because Germany would not agree to use its alternative colours.<ref>{{cite web |url=
