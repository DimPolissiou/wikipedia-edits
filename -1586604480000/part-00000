Currently most of the diamond polishing workshops are running in the [[Varachha]] area of Surat, mostly by the people of the [[Patel]] community.<ref name=diamondhistory>{{cite journal|title=Diamond and Patels|citeseerx = 10.1.1.1026.5615|year = 1999}}</ref>\n\nAround the world, 8 out of 10 diamonds on the market were cut and polished in Surat.

The major group working in this industry is people from the [[Saurashtra region]] of Gujarat. Because of demand in the American market from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s (with only a brief recession in 1979), Surat's diamond industry grew tremendously. Currently most of the diamond polishing workshops are running in the [[Varachha]] area of Surat, mostly by the people of the [[Patel]] community.<ref name=diamondhistory>{{cite journal|title=Diamond and Patels|citeseerx = 10.1.1.1026.5615|year = 1999}}</ref>\n\nAround the world, 8 out of 10 diamonds on the market were cut and polished in Surat. This industry earns India about US$10 billion in annual exports. A legacy of old Dutch trade links, it began after a Surti entrepreneur returned from East Africa bringing diamond cutters. The rough diamonds are mined in South Africa and other regions of the African continent, and go from here as smooth gems to Antwerp, Belgium where the international diamond trade is run mainly by Hasidic Jews and Jains from Palanpur in North Gujarat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gujarattourism.com/destination/details/6/104|title=https://www.gujarattourism.com/destination/details/6/104|website=www.gujarattourism.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113165648/https://www.gujarattourism.com/destination/details/6/104|archive-date=13 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Textiles===\n[[File:SuratAhmedabadMumbai 020.jpg|thumbnail|Surat's Textile District Ring Road]]\nSince it is known for producing textiles, including silk, Surat is known as the textile hub of the nation or the Silk City of India.

The cave was known by the Osage Indians in the early 16th century, after a tribe member fell through the cave's main entrance, a sinkhole. There is evidence that in 1541 the Spanish explored the cave, but the first recorded expedition was in 1869, led by Henry T. Blow. The unofficial Stone County chapter of [[Bald Knobbers]], a local group of vigilantes, were rumored to have taken people to the top of Roark Mountain, and thrown them in the sink hole.\n\nMarvel Cave was originally called Marble Cave, after explorers in 1882 saw what they thought was [[marble]] on the cave's ceiling. This started the Marble Cave Mining Company, although later it was realized that there was never any marble in the cave. The Marble Cave Mining Company ceased all operations after only four and a half years. William Lynch purchased the cave in 1889, and soon after opened the cave to the public. In 1950, Hugo Herschend leased the cave for 99 years. The Herschends made renovations to the cave, and later opened a theme park, [[Silver Dollar City]], on the surface above the cave. Marvel Cave is known for being one of the largest caves in Missouri, having one of the largest cave entry rooms (the Cathedral Room) of any cave in North America, and for being one of the longest running tourist attractions in the Ozarks.\n\n==History==\n\n===The Bald Knobbers===\nAccording to Silver Dollar City park legend, a local group of vigilantes who later turned into outlaws called the Bald Knobbers were known for throwing people through the sinkhole into Devil's Den around the mid 19th century. Though it's likely that roving Bushwhackers and outlaws would've undoubtedly chosen to dispose of their victims through this sinkhole, the Bald Knobbers did not form until 1883 (starting-up in neighboring Taney County), were replaced by an unofficial chapter in 1886 within nearby Christian County, with unofficial chapters in other counties (including Stone County where the cave is located) later than that.\n\nHowever, though there is no written evidence to substantiate it, it's possible that Stone County's unofficial Bald Knobbers used the cave for various uses sometime in 1889, between the time the mining operations ceased and late October of that year when it was purchased for sightseeing tours.\n\n===Early explorers===\nThere is evidence that the Spanish explored the cave in 1541, hoping to uncover riches and possibly the fountain of youth.<ref name=\"showcaves\">[http://www.showcaves.com/english/usa/showcaves/Marvel.html Show Caves of the United States of America: Marvel Cave<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> There is a legend that the Spanish buried gold in the cave. The first known expedition was in 1869 and lead [[Henry T. Blow]] of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], a lead mining magnate. He explored the cave with six other miners.<ref name=\"showcaves\" /> One by one, the miners lowered themselves down into the sinkhole. They carried lanterns for light and spent hours studying the cave walls carefully searching for signs of mineral deposits. They went as far as the Shoe Room, because on one side was the Gulf of Doom, which they believed was the bottomless pit after throwing rocks down the Gulf of Doom and hearing no sound. On the other side was the Cloud Room, which was filled to the ceiling with bat guano. The miners returned to the surface late that evening having failed to discover the lead ore they sought, but were convinced that the flat ceiling of the Shoe Room contained marble. Their report gained the interest of area locals who decided to name the cave, Marble Cave.\n\nNo more expeditions took place until 1882 when another group of entrepreneurs, led by Mr. T. Hodges Jones and Truman S. Powell of Barton County, entered the cave in hopes of finding lead. Jones and Powell found huge amounts of [[guano]] and the flat ceiling, which they also believed to be marble.\n\n===Marble Cave Mining and Manufacturing Company===\nIn 1884, Mr. T. Hodge Jones bought the property and, with several of his friends, formed the Marble Cave Mining and Manufacturing Company to mine the marble from the cave. The company hired a geologist, and it was proved that what looked like marble on the ceiling of the Shoe Room was really limestone. To keep the company alive they mined out the guano and sold it for $700 a ton. The guano was used for gunpowder and fertilizer. The miners filled ore carts with guano, then the carts were pulled by donkeys to the Cathedral Room, and the carts were lifted out of the cave by a pulley system. In 1889, after four and a half years,all the guano was mined out. Marble Cave Mining, Co. closed all operations.\n\n===Marmaros===\n\nMarmaros (Greek for Marble) was a small town that formed along with the Marble Cave Mining and Manufacturing Company in 1884. It was originally called Marble City. It was located on the rough hilltop near the cave and recorded a plat map at the courthouse in [[Galena, Missouri]]. Marmaros contained a hotel, [[general store]], pottery shop, white oak furniture factory, and was rumored to have a saloon. The town turned into a [[ghost town]] in 1889 after the Marble Cave Mining, Co. closed. When the Lynches bought the cave, the town was burned to the ground by the local group of [[vigilantes]] known as the Bald Knobbers.\n\n===The Lynches===\nOn October 30, 1889, William Henry Lynch, a Canadian miner and dairyman, purchased the cave and the square mile of land around the cave where Marmaros was located for $10,000.<ref name=\"showcaves\" /> After coming to Marvel Cave, he found that Marmaros was burnt to the ground. Lynch, with the aid of his family, proposed to open the cave to sightseers. The Lynches began operation of the sightseeing venture in 1894 with a grand celebration and a few visitors.<ref name=\"showcaves\" /> The cave has remained open since, making it one of the oldest continuously running tourist attractions in the Ozarks.\n\nWhen William Lynch died in 1927, ownership of the cave passed to his daughters. Shortly thereafter, the name of the cave was changed to Marvel Cave.<ref name=\"showcaves\" /> The Lynch family operated the cave for over fifty years.\n\n===The Herschends===\nA Chicago [[vacuum cleaner]] salesman, Hugo Herschend, purchased a 99-year lease on the cave in 1950, from The Lynch sisters.<ref name=\"showcaves\" />\n\nAfter Hugo Herschend's death in 1955, his wife Mary took over the day-to-day operations of the cave. With the aid of her two sons, Jack and Peter, Mary Herschend was able to make vast improvements to the cave. They added concrete paths and stairs to the cave, and a tower from the sinkhole to the top of the debris pile. Also, they added a [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[funicular]] (cable-pulled) railway in 1957, whose trains pulled visitors a distance of {{convert|218|ft|m}},<ref name=\"showcaves\" /> from the depths of the cave up to the surface. Before building the cable train, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] said that it could not be built, because a cable train can not make a turn like the one the Herschends planned.  The Herschends built it anyway, and it is still in operation to this day.\n\nOnce the cable train was in operation, the Herschends decided to recreate the mining village Marmaros, for tourists waiting to go on a tour. It opened in 1960, and is called [[Silver Dollar City]].\n\nIn 1972 Genevieve Lynch died and bequeathed the cave to the [[College of the Ozarks]] and the First Presbyterian Church of Branson. The Herschends continue to operate the property under lease.<ref>Missouri Roadsides: The Traveler's Companion - Bill Earngey - University of Missouri Press (October 1995) - {{ISBN|0-8262-1021-X}}</ref>\n\n==Tours==\n\nCurrently there are two different tours offered: The Traditional Tour and The Lantern Tour.\n\n===Traditional tours===\nThe first guided tours in the cave were in 1894 run by the Lynches. They lasted 8 hours and were by candle or lantern. Visitors climbed through the sink hole on a {{convert|100|ft|m}} ladder down to the top of the pile. Then you were instructed to slide down the pile to the bottom. You received a candle to guide your way. The tours included the Egyptian Room (now the Shoe Room), the Lakes Passage, and you saw formations such as the Great White Throne (now the Liberty Bell), and the Spring Room Sentinel (now just the Sentinel). After the Hershends started tours in 1950, they removed the wooden stairs, and added concrete stairs and paths through the cave. Current tours last for about an hour, and are limited to 60 people.\n\n=== Lantern tour ===\nIn 2006, Marvel Cave started offering The Lantern Light Tour. In this tour the electric lights are turned off in the cave and lanterns are given to each member of the tour. Unlike the regular tours which are free, this tour costs $16.12, and is limited to 20 people. The tour has been extended into the Mammoth Room, making it the first tour to incorporate this room in more than fifty years. One is also able to see both the summer and fall sections if the Waterfall Room is not flooded.  The tour lasts about an hour and a half.  The guide focuses on the history and folklore of the cave and is able to explain more information about the cave due to the small group setting of the tour.\n\n==Rooms and passages==\n*'''The Cathedral Room''' is one of the largest cave entrance rooms found in North America. The room measures {{convert|204|ft|m}} high, {{convert|225|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|411|ft|m}} feet long. Entrance to the cave is made through a sink hole which is 94' deep. Two large openings are at the bottom of the sink. Rocks, trees, dirt and animals falling through the sinkhole and falling boulders from the ceiling throughout the centuries has left a debris pile measuring {{convert|124|ft|m}} tall. This pile is sometimes referred to as the Underground Mountain. On July 7, 1963 an underground altitude record was set by [[Don Piccard]] by flying a [[hot air balloon]] around the massive room. Later, in 1994 five hot air balloons were flown simultaneously in the Cathedral Room in celebration of the 100th anniversary of giving cave tours.\n*'''The Mammoth Room''' is where the majority of the bats choose to hibernate. In 1869 Spanish style ladders, small trees with notches carved in them, were found in the Mammoth Room by Henry Taylor Blow, one of the first known explorers of the cave.\n*'''The Dungeon''' is a passage located next to the Cathedral Room. The entrance can be made through a small crevice located {{convert|80|ft|m}} below the sinkhole entrance. Blood like stains cover the walls due to the abundance of [[iron oxide]], which led some early cave guides to claim the Dungeon Passage a torture place of the Spanish Explorers. The passage has an entrance through the Mammoth Room as well.\n*'''The Lakes Passage''' is past the Mammoth Room and contains two lakes named Genevieve and Miriam, after the daughters of William Lynch. Divers have explored the lakes and have found several under water passages. The deepest they went was around {{convert|110|ft|m}}. The two lakes are long and were once thought to be a river, known as No-Name River. Genevieve later led an expedition of the passage and discovered that there was an end to the water filled passages. Her party found that the cave continued up hill. The passage has been explored, but not entirely. The last room explorers have discovered is a tall terminal dome pit that contains two small water falls that makes climbing to the top very difficult. Many have tried and failed.\n*'''The Spring Room''' A small crevice behind a tall column known as the Sentinel lies the Spring Room. The room is covered in orange calcite and contains several waterfalls that looks and sounds like rain fall. Legends have spread about the water being magical, possibly the [[Fountain of Youth]].\n*'''Serpentine Passage''' connects the Cathedral Room and the Egyptian Room. The route displays perfectly the way that water used to flow through the cave passages.\n*'''Egyptian Room / Shoe Room''' Genevieve and Miriam Lynch had a fondness for the study of Egypt and this flat smooth desert like room reminded them of a pyramid. Within the rocks of the room they saw King [[Tutankhamen]]'s [[Sarcophagus]], The [[Sphinx]]'s Nose, Arrow Head Entry, and [[Cleopatra]]'s Sandal. The ceiling is shaped like a large sandal or shoe, leading some to call it the Shoe Room. The flat smooth ceiling was once mistaken for Marble.\n*'''The Gulf of Doom''' is located under the \"heel\" of the shoe print ceiling. The great pit was once thought to be bottomless. Rocks would be thrown into the darkness, but no sound would ever resonate. The superstitious thought it was a gateway to the underworld, when the true reason was simple: large amounts of clay and bat guano were covering the bottom of the gulf's floor over 100' below.\n*'''Cloud Room or Cloud Land''' has a rough porous ceiling. The ceiling is made of dolomite and looks like low hanging clouds.\n*'''Tall Man's Headache / Fat Man's Misery''' is a passage with a low ceiling and narrow sides, the smallest passage in the guided tour. It is about {{convert|4|ft|m}} {{convert|7|in|cm}} tall, and {{convert|7|ft|m}} long.\n*'''The Harold Bell Wright Passage''' is before the Waterfall Room during fall and winter tours. [[Harold Bell Wright]], the author of [[The Shepherd of the Hills (novel)|The Shepherd of the Hills]],  was friends of the Lynches, and stayed in the cave for days at a time. There is a cabin located in the passage where Harold Bell Wright stayed. Some people believe that he wrote parts of his book in the cave. Inside the cabin he painted a picture of his book's character, Maggie. The Cabin that is there now is a replica, not the original, although it uses some of the same wood.\n*'''The Waterfall Room''' is the lowest room on the tour, {{convert|505|ft|m}} below the surface. The source of the water is from the underground stream named The Lost River. This room can flood to the ceiling during times of rain.\n*'''The Mud Passage''' is located between the Waterfall Room and the Mystic Pool Room, named for the mud in the passage during early tours, which has since been cleared out.\n*'''The Mystic River Passage''' is a small water filled passage that eventually opens up to the second largest room in the cave. The room is called the T Room and is in the shape of the letter T. The cave extends beyond the T Room, but the passage becomes much smaller and narrower than before. To enter the passage one must lie on their back and keep their face above the water. The passage is extremely tight and filled with mud and water causing many to call it the \"Sewer Pipe.\" The end of the passage has not been reached.\n*'''The Mystic Pool Room''' is the room in which the Mystic River Passage is located.\n*'''The Elves Chamber''' is the top of the terminal dome pit extending upwards from the Mystic Pool Room. Numerous [[calcite]] formations can be seen in this area of the cave. The ceiling is filled with long [[stalactites]] and covered in [[helictite]]s. The entrance to the Cable Train Tunnel is located in the Elves Chamber making it the last room on the tourist trail of Marvel Cave.\n\n==Notable formations==\n*'''Blondie's Throne''' is a [[flowstone]] located near the end of the tour of the cave, the name comes from its obvious resemblance to a throne. The name \"Blondie\" comes from a story about a boy (Charles Smallwood) who was lost in the cave in the late 19th or early 20th century. He was later found sleeping near this formation, and the first thing they saw in the candlelight was his blonde hair. While there is a legend that some substance in the cave turned his hair blonde, it is more likely that the boy was known for his blonde hair.\n*'''The Liberty Bell''' is a {{convert|55|ft|m}} tall [[stalagmite]], Although it started out on the ceiling near the Serpentine Passage as a [[stalactite]]. It gets its name from its shape, and the crack on its side. The crack was made when it fell from the ceiling, and now it is on the cave floor. After falling, it continued to grow on the floor. It is hollow and can fit four to five adults inside. It was originally called \"The Great White Throne\".\n*'''The Sentinel''' is a column located in the Cathedral Room, right in front of the passage that leads to the Spring Room. It used to be referred as \"The Spring Room Sentinel\" Tour guides also say that it is the only thing supporting the dome of the Cathedral Room.\n\n{{gallery\n|title = Marvel Cave rock formations\n|align = center\n|lines=2\n|File:Blondies Thrown.jpg|Blondie's Throne\n|File:Marvel Cave Sentinel.jpg|The Sentinel\n|File:Liberty Bell Formation.jpg|The Liberty Bell\n}}\n\n==Life in the cave==\n\n[[File:Myotis grisescens hibernating.jpg|thumb|right|Gray bat in a [[Hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernaculum]].

Shortly thereafter, the name of the cave was changed to Marvel Cave.<ref name=\"showcaves\" /> The Lynch family operated the cave for over fifty years.\n\n===The Herschends===\nA Chicago [[vacuum cleaner]] salesman, Hugo Herschend, purchased a 99-year lease on the cave in 1950, from The Lynch sisters.<ref name=\"showcaves\" />\n\nAfter Hugo Herschend's death in 1955, his wife Mary took over the day-to-day operations of the cave. With the aid of her two sons, Jack and Peter, Mary Herschend was able to make vast improvements to the cave. They added concrete paths and stairs to the cave, and a tower from the sinkhole to the top of the debris pile. Also, they added a [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[funicular]] (cable-pulled) railway in 1957, whose trains pulled visitors a distance of {{convert|218|ft|m}},<ref name=\"showcaves\" /> from the depths of the cave up to the surface. Before building the cable train, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] said that it could not be built, because a cable train can not make a turn like the one the Herschends planned.  The Herschends built it anyway, and it is still in operation to this day.\n\nOnce the cable train was in operation, the Herschends decided to recreate the mining village Marmaros, for tourists waiting to go on a tour. It opened in 1960, and is called [[Silver Dollar City]].\n\nIn 1972 Genevieve Lynch died and bequeathed the cave to the [[College of the Ozarks]] and the First Presbyterian Church of Branson. The Herschends continue to operate the property under lease.<ref>Missouri Roadsides: The Traveler's Companion - Bill Earngey - University of Missouri Press (October 1995) - {{ISBN|0-8262-1021-X}}</ref>\n\n==Tours==\n\nCurrently there are two different tours offered: The Traditional Tour and The Lantern Tour.\n\n===Traditional tours===\nThe first guided tours in the cave were in 1894 run by the Lynches. They lasted 8 hours and were by candle or lantern. Visitors climbed through the sink hole on a {{convert|100|ft|m}} ladder down to the top of the pile. Then you were instructed to slide down the pile to the bottom. You received a candle to guide your way. The tours included the Egyptian Room (now the Shoe Room), the Lakes Passage, and you saw formations such as the Great White Throne (now the Liberty Bell), and the Spring Room Sentinel (now just the Sentinel). After the Hershends started tours in 1950, they removed the wooden stairs, and added concrete stairs and paths through the cave. Current tours last for about an hour, and are limited to 60 people.\n\n=== Lantern tour ===\nIn 2006, Marvel Cave started offering The Lantern Light Tour. In this tour the electric lights are turned off in the cave and lanterns are given to each member of the tour. Unlike the regular tours which are free, this tour costs $16.12, and is limited to 20 people. The tour has been extended into the Mammoth Room, making it the first tour to incorporate this room in more than fifty years. One is also able to see both the summer and fall sections if the Waterfall Room is not flooded.  The tour lasts about an hour and a half.  The guide focuses on the history and folklore of the cave and is able to explain more information about the cave due to the small group setting of the tour.\n\n==Rooms and passages==\n*'''The Cathedral Room''' is one of the largest cave entrance rooms found in North America. The room measures {{convert|204|ft|m}} high, {{convert|225|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|411|ft|m}} feet long. Entrance to the cave is made through a sink hole which is 94' deep. Two large openings are at the bottom of the sink. Rocks, trees, dirt and animals falling through the sinkhole and falling boulders from the ceiling throughout the centuries has left a debris pile measuring {{convert|124|ft|m}} tall. This pile is sometimes referred to as the Underground Mountain. On July 7, 1963 an underground altitude record was set by [[Don Piccard]] by flying a [[hot air balloon]] around the massive room. Later, in 1994 five hot air balloons were flown simultaneously in the Cathedral Room in celebration of the 100th anniversary of giving cave tours.\n*'''The Mammoth Room''' is where the majority of the bats choose to hibernate. In 1869 Spanish style ladders, small trees with notches carved in them, were found in the Mammoth Room by Henry Taylor Blow, one of the first known explorers of the cave.\n*'''The Dungeon''' is a passage located next to the Cathedral Room. The entrance can be made through a small crevice located {{convert|80|ft|m}} below the sinkhole entrance. Blood like stains cover the walls due to the abundance of [[iron oxide]], which led some early cave guides to claim the Dungeon Passage a torture place of the Spanish Explorers. The passage has an entrance through the Mammoth Room as well.\n*'''The Lakes Passage''' is past the Mammoth Room and contains two lakes named Genevieve and Miriam, after the daughters of William Lynch. Divers have explored the lakes and have found several under water passages. The deepest they went was around {{convert|110|ft|m}}. The two lakes are long and were once thought to be a river, known as No-Name River. Genevieve later led an expedition of the passage and discovered that there was an end to the water filled passages. Her party found that the cave continued up hill. The passage has been explored, but not entirely. The last room explorers have discovered is a tall terminal dome pit that contains two small water falls that makes climbing to the top very difficult. Many have tried and failed.\n*'''The Spring Room''' A small crevice behind a tall column known as the Sentinel lies the Spring Room. The room is covered in orange calcite and contains several waterfalls that looks and sounds like rain fall. Legends have spread about the water being magical, possibly the [[Fountain of Youth]].\n*'''Serpentine Passage''' connects the Cathedral Room and the Egyptian Room. The route displays perfectly the way that water used to flow through the cave passages.\n*'''Egyptian Room / Shoe Room''' Genevieve and Miriam Lynch had a fondness for the study of Egypt and this flat smooth desert like room reminded them of a pyramid. Within the rocks of the room they saw King [[Tutankhamen]]'s [[Sarcophagus]], The [[Sphinx]]'s Nose, Arrow Head Entry, and [[Cleopatra]]'s Sandal. The ceiling is shaped like a large sandal or shoe, leading some to call it the Shoe Room. The flat smooth ceiling was once mistaken for Marble.\n*'''The Gulf of Doom''' is located under the \"heel\" of the shoe print ceiling. The great pit was once thought to be bottomless. Rocks would be thrown into the darkness, but no sound would ever resonate. The superstitious thought it was a gateway to the underworld, when the true reason was simple: large amounts of clay and bat guano were covering the bottom of the gulf's floor over 100' below.\n*'''Cloud Room or Cloud Land''' has a rough porous ceiling. The ceiling is made of dolomite and looks like low hanging clouds.\n*'''Tall Man's Headache / Fat Man's Misery''' is a passage with a low ceiling and narrow sides, the smallest passage in the guided tour. It is about {{convert|4|ft|m}} {{convert|7|in|cm}} tall, and {{convert|7|ft|m}} long.\n*'''The Harold Bell Wright Passage''' is before the Waterfall Room during fall and winter tours. [[Harold Bell Wright]], the author of [[The Shepherd of the Hills]],  was friends of the Lynches, and stayed in the cave for days at a time. There is a cabin located in the passage where Harold Bell Wright stayed. Some people believe that he wrote parts of his book in the cave. Inside the cabin he painted a picture of his book's character, Maggie. The Cabin that is there now is a replica, not the original, although it uses some of the same wood.\n*'''The Waterfall Room''' is the lowest room on the tour, {{convert|505|ft|m}} below the surface. The source of the water is from the underground stream named The Lost River. This room can flood to the ceiling during times of rain.\n*'''The Mud Passage''' is located between the Waterfall Room and the Mystic Pool Room, named for the mud in the passage during early tours, which has since been cleared out.\n*'''The Mystic River Passage''' is a small water filled passage that eventually opens up to the second largest room in the cave. The room is called the T Room and is in the shape of the letter T. The cave extends beyond the T Room, but the passage becomes much smaller and narrower than before. To enter the passage one must lie on their back and keep their face above the water. The passage is extremely tight and filled with mud and water causing many to call it the \"Sewer Pipe.\" The end of the passage has not been reached.\n*'''The Mystic Pool Room''' is the room in which the Mystic River Passage is located.\n*'''The Elves Chamber''' is the top of the terminal dome pit extending upwards from the Mystic Pool Room. Numerous [[calcite]] formations can be seen in this area of the cave. The ceiling is filled with long [[stalactites]] and covered in [[helictite]]s. The entrance to the Cable Train Tunnel is located in the Elves Chamber making it the last room on the tourist trail of Marvel Cave.\n\n==Notable formations==\n*'''Blondie's Throne''' is a [[flowstone]] located near the end of the tour of the cave, the name comes from its obvious resemblance to a throne. The name \"Blondie\" comes from a story about a boy (Charles Smallwood) who was lost in the cave in the late 19th or early 20th century. He was later found sleeping near this formation, and the first thing they saw in the candlelight was his blonde hair. While there is a legend that some substance in the cave turned his hair blonde, it is more likely that the boy was known for his blonde hair.\n*'''The Liberty Bell''' is a {{convert|55|ft|m}} tall [[stalagmite]], Although it started out on the ceiling near the Serpentine Passage as a [[stalactite]]. It gets its name from its shape, and the crack on its side. The crack was made when it fell from the ceiling, and now it is on the cave floor. After falling, it continued to grow on the floor. It is hollow and can fit four to five adults inside. It was originally called \"The Great White Throne\".\n*'''The Sentinel''' is a column located in the Cathedral Room, right in front of the passage that leads to the Spring Room. It used to be referred as \"The Spring Room Sentinel\" Tour guides also say that it is the only thing supporting the dome of the Cathedral Room.\n\n{{gallery\n|title = Marvel Cave rock formations\n|align = center\n|lines=2\n|File:Blondies Thrown.jpg|Blondie's Throne\n|File:Marvel Cave Sentinel.jpg|The Sentinel\n|File:Liberty Bell Formation.jpg|The Liberty Bell\n}}\n\n==Life in the cave==\n\n[[File:Myotis grisescens hibernating.jpg|thumb|right|Gray bat in a [[Hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernaculum]].

This experience convinced John that he preferred music and the stage to the preference of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a medical degree.\n\nWhile en route to a career as actor and singer, Boles earned a living by teaching French and singing in a high school in New York state and working as business manager and interpreter for a one-year tour of Europe by a student group. The latter venture led to his studying under tenor [[Jean de Reszke]].<ref name=ot/>\n\n==Personal life==\nBoles married Marcelite Dobbs (1896-1982) in 1917, and they remained married until his death; they are interred at Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marcelite Dobbs Boles|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=17417905|website=Find A Grave|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Rio-Rita-1929-LC-2.jpg|thumb|Lobby card for ''[[Rio Rita (1929 film)|Rio Rita]]'' (1929)]]\nHe started out in [[Hollywood]] in [[silent movie]]s, but became a huge star with the advent of talkies. After the war, Boles moved to New York to study music. He quickly became well known for his talents and was selected to replace the leading man in the 1923 Broadway musical ''Little Jesse James''. He became an established star on Broadway and attracted the attention of Hollywood producers and actors.\n\nBoles' [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] credits include ''One Touch of Venus'' (1943), ''Kitty's Kisses'' (1925), ''Mercenary Mary'' (1924), and ''Little Jessie James'' (1923).<ref>{{cite web|title=(\"John Boles\" search results)|url=http://www.playbill.com/searchpage/search?shows=on&people=on&theatres=on&q=John+Boles&qasset=00000150-ac85-d16d-a550-ecbf8e840000|website=Playbill Vault|publisher=Playbill|accessdate=7 September 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170907204129/http://www.playbill.com/searchpage/search?shows=on&people=on&theatres=on&q=John+Boles&qasset=00000150-ac85-d16d-a550-ecbf8e840000|archivedate=7 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHe was hired by MGM to appear in a silent film in 1924. He starred in two more films for that studio before returning to New York and the stage. In 1927, he returned to Hollywood to star in ''[[The Love of Sunya]]'' (1927) opposite [[Gloria Swanson]], which was a big success for him. Unfortunately, because the movies were still silent he was unable to show off his singing ability until late in the decade. In 1929, Warner Brothers hired him to star in their lavish musical operetta ''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'' (1929). This film featured sequences in [[Technicolor]] and was a box-office success. Soon after, Radio Pictures (later known as [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]) selected him to play the leading man in their extravagant production (the last portion of the film was photographed in Technicolor) of ''[[Rio Rita (1929 film)|Rio Rita]]'', opposite [[Bebe Daniels]]. Audiences were enthralled by his beautiful voice, and John Boles suddenly found himself in huge demand. [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] even hired him to make phonograph records of songs that he had sung in his films.\n\nAs soon as ''Rio Rita'' was completed, Boles went back to [[Warner Brothers]] as the leading man in an even more extravagant musical entitled ''[[Song of the West]]'' (1930) that was filmed entirely in Technicolor. Shortly after this film, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] offered John Boles a contract, which he accepted. He starred in a number of pictures for them, most notably the all-Technicolor musical revue entitled ''[[The King of Jazz]]'' (1930) and a historical operetta entitled ''[[Captain of the Guard]]'' (1930). In 1931, he starred in ''[[One Heavenly Night]]'' (1931), which would prove to be his last major musical.\n\nBoles portrayed [[Victor Moritz]] in ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931). He starred with [[Irene Dunne]] in a 1934 film adaptation of [[Edith Wharton]]'s 1920 novel ''[[The Age of Innocence]]'' directed for RKO Radio Pictures by Philip Moeller, and took the role of Edward Morgan in ''[[Curly Top (film)|Curly Top]]'' (1935), starring [[Shirley Temple]]. In 1937, Boles starred alongside [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in the [[King Vidor]] classic ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]''. In 1943, he co-starred with [[Mary Martin]] and [[Kenny Baker (American singer and actor)|Kenny Baker]] in ''[[One Touch of Venus]]''.\n\n==Later years==\nBoles retired from the screen and stage in 1952, after starring opposite [[Paulette Goddard]] in ''Babes in Baghdad.'' He later went into the oil business and lived the last 13 years of his life in San Angelo, Texas.<ref name=ct/>\n\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Boles was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1960 with a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] located at 6530 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/john-boles |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame - John Boles |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nBoles died on February 27, 1969, in [[San Angelo, Texas]], at age 73.<ref name=\"ct\">{{cite news|title=John Boles, Singing Film Actor, Dies|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/02/28/page/25/article/john-boles-singing-film-actor-dies|accessdate=7 September 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|date=February 28, 1969|location=Illinois, Chicago|page=Section 1A - Page 5}}</ref>\n\n==Partial filmography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''[[The Sixth Commandment]]'' (1924) - John Brant\n*''[[So This Is Marriage?]]'' (1924) - Uriah\n*''[[Excuse Me (1925 film)|Excuse Me]]'' (1925) - Lt.

This experience convinced John that he preferred music and the stage to the preference of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a medical degree.\n\nWhile en route to a career as actor and singer, Boles earned a living by teaching French and singing in a high school in New York state and working as business manager and interpreter for a one-year tour of Europe by a student group. The latter venture led to his studying under tenor [[Jean de Reszke]].<ref name=ot/>\n\n==Personal life==\nBoles married Marcelite Dobbs (1896-1982) in 1917, and they remained married until his death; they are interred at Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marcelite Dobbs Boles|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=17417905|website=Find A Grave|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Rio-Rita-1929-LC-2.jpg|thumb|Lobby card for ''[[Rio Rita (1929 film)|Rio Rita]]'' (1929)]]\nHe started out in [[Hollywood]] in [[silent movie]]s, but became a huge star with the advent of talkies. After the war, Boles moved to New York to study music. He quickly became well known for his talents and was selected to replace the leading man in the 1923 Broadway musical ''Little Jesse James''. He became an established star on Broadway and attracted the attention of Hollywood producers and actors.\n\nBoles' [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] credits include ''One Touch of Venus'' (1943), ''Kitty's Kisses'' (1925), ''Mercenary Mary'' (1924), and ''Little Jessie James'' (1923).<ref>{{cite web|title=(\"John Boles\" search results)|url=http://www.playbill.com/searchpage/search?shows=on&people=on&theatres=on&q=John+Boles&qasset=00000150-ac85-d16d-a550-ecbf8e840000|website=Playbill Vault|publisher=Playbill|accessdate=7 September 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170907204129/http://www.playbill.com/searchpage/search?shows=on&people=on&theatres=on&q=John+Boles&qasset=00000150-ac85-d16d-a550-ecbf8e840000|archivedate=7 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHe was hired by MGM to appear in a silent film in 1924. He starred in two more films for that studio before returning to New York and the stage. In 1927, he returned to Hollywood to star in ''[[The Love of Sunya]]'' (1927) opposite [[Gloria Swanson]], which was a big success for him. Unfortunately, because the movies were still silent he was unable to show off his singing ability until late in the decade. In 1929, Warner Brothers hired him to star in their lavish musical operetta ''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'' (1929). This film featured sequences in [[Technicolor]] and was a box-office success. Soon after, Radio Pictures (later known as [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]) selected him to play the leading man in their extravagant production (the last portion of the film was photographed in Technicolor) of ''[[Rio Rita (1929 film)|Rio Rita]]'', opposite [[Bebe Daniels]]. Audiences were enthralled by his beautiful voice, and John Boles suddenly found himself in huge demand. [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] even hired him to make phonograph records of songs that he had sung in his films.\n\nAs soon as ''Rio Rita'' was completed, Boles went back to [[Warner Brothers]] as the leading man in an even more extravagant musical entitled ''[[Song of the West]]'' (1930) that was filmed entirely in Technicolor. Shortly after this film, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] offered John Boles a contract, which he accepted. He starred in a number of pictures for them, most notably the all-Technicolor musical revue entitled ''[[The King of Jazz]]'' (1930) and a historical operetta entitled ''[[Captain of the Guard]]'' (1930). In 1931, he starred in ''[[One Heavenly Night]]'' (1931), which would prove to be his last major musical.\n\nBoles portrayed [[Victor Moritz]] in ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931). He starred with [[Irene Dunne]] in a 1934 film adaptation of [[Edith Wharton]]'s 1920 novel ''[[The Age of Innocence]]'' directed for RKO Radio Pictures by Philip Moeller, and took the role of Edward Morgan in ''[[Curly Top (film)|Curly Top]]'' (1935), starring [[Shirley Temple]]. In 1937, Boles starred alongside [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in the [[King Vidor]] classic ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]''. In 1943, he co-starred with [[Mary Martin]] and [[Kenny Baker (American singer and actor)|Kenny Baker]] in ''[[One Touch of Venus]]''.\n\n==Later years==\nBoles retired from the screen and stage in 1952, after starring opposite [[Paulette Goddard]] in ''Babes in Baghdad.'' He later went into the oil business and lived the last 13 years of his life in San Angelo, Texas.<ref name=ct/>\n\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Boles was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1960 with a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] located at 6530 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/john-boles |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame - John Boles |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nBoles died on February 27, 1969, in [[San Angelo, Texas]], at age 73.<ref name=\"ct\">{{cite news|title=John Boles, Singing Film Actor, Dies|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/02/28/page/25/article/john-boles-singing-film-actor-dies|accessdate=7 September 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|date=February 28, 1969|location=Illinois, Chicago|page=Section 1A - Page 5}}</ref>\n\n==Partial filmography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''[[The Sixth Commandment]]'' (1924) - John Brant\n*''[[So This Is Marriage?]]'' (1924) - Uriah\n*''[[Excuse Me (1925 film)|Excuse Me]]'' (1925) - Lt.

The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Games]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], defeating the Soviet Union, [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnside|first=Scott|title=Hockey's miracle before the 'Miracle'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=4897805|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning Skate: The Forgotten Miracle of 1960|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/the-morning-skate-the-forgotten-miracle-of-1960/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7\u20135 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5\u20132. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]. The Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the tournament championship.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]], met twice in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, which included a 2\u20132 round-robin draw and a 3\u20132 semi-final win for the Americans.

The game was tied 2\u20132 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with [[T.J. Oshie]] scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States.

The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Games]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], defeating the Soviet Union, [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnside|first=Scott|title=Hockey's miracle before the 'Miracle'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=4897805|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning Skate: The Forgotten Miracle of 1960|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/the-morning-skate-the-forgotten-miracle-of-1960/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7\u20135 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5\u20132. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]].

The citron is usually [[fertilized]] by [[self-pollination]].

Bog.); Wellcome V0042687.jpg|thumb|Illustration of [[fingered citron]] with the leaves and thorns that are common to all varieties of citron.]]\n<blockquote>In the east and south there are special plants... i.e. in Media and Persia there are many types of fruit, between them there is a fruit called Median or Persian Apple. The tree has a leaf similar to and almost identical with that of the ''andrachn'' (''[[Arbutus andrachne]]'' L.), but has [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns]] like those of the ''[[apios]]'' (the wild [[pear]], ''Pyrus amygdaliformis'' Vill.) or the [[firethorn]] (''Cotoneaster pyracantha'' Spach.), except that they are white, smooth, sharp and strong. The fruit is not eaten, but is very fragrant, as is also the [[leaf]] of the tree; and the fruit is put among [[clothes]], it keeps them from being [[moth]]-eaten. It is also useful when one has drunk deadly poison, for when it is administered in [[wine]]; it upsets the [[stomach]] and brings up the poison. It is also useful to improve the [[breath]], for if one boils the inner part of the fruit in a dish or squeezes it into the mouth in some other medium, it makes the breath more pleasant.\n\nThe seed is removed from the fruit and sown in the [[Spring (season)|spring]] in carefully tilled beds, and it is watered every fourth or fifth day. As soon the plant is strong it is [[Transplanting|transplanted]], also in the spring, to a soft, well watered site, where the soil is not very fine, for it prefers such places.\n\nAnd it bears its fruit at all [[season]]s, for when some have gathered, the flower of the others is on the tree and is ripening others. Of the [[flower]]s I have said<ref>''Historia plantarum'' 1.13.4.</ref> those that have a sort of distaff [meaning the [[carpel|pistil]]] projecting from the middle are fertile, while those that do not have this are sterile. It is also sown, like [[date palm]]s, in pots punctured with holes.\n\nThis tree, as has been remarked, grows in ''Media'' and ''Persia''.</blockquote>\n\n=== Pliny the Elder ===\nCitron was also described by [[Pliny the Elder]], who called it ''nata Assyria malus''. The following is from his book [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]:\n<blockquote>There is another tree also with the same name of \"citrus,\" and bears a fruit that is held by some persons in particular dislike for its smell and remarkable bitterness; while, on the other hand, there are some who esteem it very highly. This tree is used as an ornament to houses; it requires, however, no further description.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chap. 31.\u2014The Citron-Tree |work=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Tufts University |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D13%3Achapter%3D31}} excerpting from {{cite book |title=The Natural History.

The leaf is similar to that of the [[Arbutus|arbute]], except that it has small prickles running across it. As to the fruit, it is never eaten, but it is remarkable for its extremely powerful smell, which is the case, also, with the leaves; indeed, the odour is so strong, that it will penetrate clothes, when they are once impregnated with it, and hence it is very useful in repelling the attacks of noxious insects.\n\nThe tree bears fruit at all seasons of the year; while some is falling off, other fruit is ripening, and other, again, just bursting into birth. Various nations have attempted to naturalize this tree among them, for the sake of its medical properties, by planting it in pots of clay, with holes drilled in them, for the purpose of introducing the air to the roots; and I would here remark, once for all, that it is as well to remember that the best plan is to pack all slips of trees that have to be carried to any distance, as close together as they can possibly be placed.\n\nIt has been found, however, that this tree will grow nowhere except in Media or Persia. It is this fruit, the pips of which, as we have already mentioned, the [[Parthia]]n grandees employ in seasoning their [[ragout]]s, as being peculiarly conducive to the sweetening of the breath. We find no other tree very highly commended that is produced in Media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D12%3Achapter%3D7|title=Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, Book XII.

However, the citron's fruit shape is highly variable, due to the large quantity of [[Mesocarp#Mesocarp|albedo]], which forms independently according to the fruits' position on the tree, twig orientation, and many other factors. The rind is leathery, furrowed, and adherent. The inner portion is thick, white and hard; the outer is uniformly thin and very fragrant. The pulp is usually acidic, but also can be sweet, and even pulpless varieties are found.\n\nMost citron varieties contain a large number of [[monoembryonic]] seeds. They are white, with dark innercoats and red-purplish [[chalazal spot]]s for the acidic varieties, and colorless for the sweet ones. Some citron varieties are also distinct, having  persistent [[carpel|styles]], that do not fall off after fecundation. Those are usually promoted for ''[[etrog]]'' use.\n\nSome citrons have medium-sized oil bubbles at the outer surface, medially distant to each other. Some varieties are ribbed and faintly warted on the outer surface. There is also a fingered citron variety called [[Buddha's hand]].\n\nThe color varies from green, when unripe, to a yellow-orange when overripe. The citron does not fall off the tree and can reach 8\u201310 pounds (4\u20135&nbsp;kg) if not picked before fully mature.<ref>''Un curieux Cedrat marocain'', Chapot 1950.</ref><ref name=\"HortScience 2005\">[http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&origin=ibids_references&therow=796030 The Search for the Authentic Citron: Historic and Genetic Analysis; ''HortScience'' '''40'''(7):1963\u20131968. 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921214001/http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&origin=ibids_references&therow=796030 |date=September 21, 2008 }}</ref> However, they should be picked before the winter, as the branches might bend or break to the ground, and may cause numerous fungal diseases for the tree.\n\nDespite the wide variety of forms taken on by the fruit, citrons are all closely related genetically, representing a single species.<ref name=\"Talon\" /><ref name=\"Ramadugu\">{{cite journal | last1=Ramadugu | first1=Chandrika | last2=Keremane | first2=Manjunath L | last3=Hu | first3=Xulan | last4=Karp | first4=David | last5=Frederici | first5=Claire T | last6=Kahn | first6=Tracy | last7=Roose | first7=Mikeal L | last8=Lee | first8=Richard F. | title=Genetic analysis of citron (''Citrus medica'' L.) using simple sequence repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms | journal=Scientia Horticulturae | volume=195 | pages=124\u2013137 | year=2015 | doi=10.1016/j.scienta.2015.09.004 }}</ref>  Genetic analysis has shown known cultivars to divide into three clusters, a Mediterranean cluster thought to have originated in India, and two clusters predominantly found in China, one representing the fingered citrons, and another consisting of non-fingered varieties.<ref name=\"Ramadugu\" />\n\n=== Plant ===\n[[File:Citron Balady Etrog Simanim.jpg|thumb|A pure citron of any kind has a large portion of [[Fruit_anatomy#Mesocarp|albedo]], which is important for the production of [[succade]]]]\n\n''Citrus medica'' is a slow-growing [[shrub]] or small tree that reaches a height of about {{convert|8|to|15|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.

Some claim{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} that even the [[Florentine citron]] is not pure citron, but a citron hybrid.\n\n== Uses ==\n=== Culinary ===\n{{Main|Succade}}\n\nWhile the [[lemon]] and [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] are peeled to consume their pulpy and [[juice|juicy]] [[flavedo|segments]], the citron's pulp is dry, containing a small quantity of insipid juice, if any. The main content of a citron fruit is the thick white rind, which adheres to the segments and cannot be separated from them easily. The citron gets halved and depulped, then its rind (the thicker the better) is cut in pieces, cooked in sugar syrup, and used as a [[spoon sweet]], in Greek known as \"kitro glyko\" (\u03ba\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc), or it is diced and caramelized with sugar and used as a confection in cakes. In Italy, a soft drink called \"Cedrata\" is made from the fruit. \n\nIn Samoa a refreshing drink called \"vai tipolo\" is made from squeezed juice. It is also added to a raw fish dish called \"oka\" and to a variation of palusami or lu\u00e1u.\n\nCitron is a regularly used item in Asian cuisine. The variety of citron used in Japan, [[yuzu]], is juiced, and the juice is used regularly in dipping sauces, dressings and marinades. The juice is widely available bottled like lemon juice. Grated or shredded yuzu rind is also added to marinades and desserts, and hollowed out yuzu can be seen as decorative containers in higher end restaurants. In Korea, a popular tea, [[yuja-cha]], is made by mixing citron meat and julienned peels with sugar and honey. This tea is consumed both hot and iced, and is often taken for sore throats and colds in winter.\n\nToday the citron is used for the [[fragrance]] or [[Zest (ingredient)|zest]] of its [[flavedo]], but the most important part is still the inner rind (known as [[pith]] or ''[[Fruit anatomy#Mesocarp|albedo]]''), which is a fairly important article in [[international trade]] and is widely employed in the food industry as [[succade]],<ref name=\"Purdue Citron\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/citron.html |title=Citron: ''Citrus medica'' Linn. |publisher=Purdue University}}</ref> as it is known when it is candied in sugar.\n\nThe dozens of varieties of citron are collectively known as ''Lebu'' in [[Bengali cuisine|Bangladesh, West Bengal]], where it is the primary citrus fruit.\n\nIn Iran, the citron's thick white rind is used to make jam; in [[Pakistan]] the fruit is used to make jam but is also pickled; in [[South Indian cuisine]], some varieties of citron (collectively referred to as \"Narthangai\" in Tamil and \"Heralikayi\" in Kannada) are widely used in pickles and preserves.In karnataka, heralikayi(citron) is uses to make lemon rice. In [[Kutch]], Gujarat, it is used to make pickle, wherein entire slices of fruits are salted, dried and mixed with [[jaggery]] and spices to make sweet spicy pickle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bijora Pickle |url=http://www.jainworld.com/jainfoodrecipes/pic_bijora.asp |publisher=Jain World}}</ref> In the United States, citron is an important ingredient in holiday [[fruitcakes]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Halv sukat.JPG|A citron halved and depulped, cooked in sugar\nFile:Bicchiere di tassoni1.jpg|''Cedrata'', a citron soft drink from Italy\nFile:Citron cake.jpg|Citron torte\n</gallery>\n\n=== Medicinal ===\nFrom [[ancient]] through [[medieval]] times, the citron was used mainly for medical purposes: to combat [[seasickness]], [[pulmonary]] troubles, [[intestine|intestinal]] ailments, [[scurvy]] and other disorders. The [[essential oil]] of the [[flavedo]] (the outermost, pigmented layer of rind) was also regarded as an [[antibiotic]]. Citron juice with [[wine]] was considered an effective [[antidote]] to [[poison]], as [[Theophrastus]] reported. In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, the juice is still used for treating conditions like nausea, vomiting, and excessive thirst.\n\nThe juice of the citron has a high [[Vitamin C]] content and is used in the Indian system of medicine as an [[anthelmintic]], appetizer, tonic, in cough, rheumatism, vomiting, flatulence, haemorrhoids, skin diseases and weak eyesight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frlht.org/rasayana/matulunga |title=Matulunga (Citrus medica) |publisher=frlht.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224161117/http://www.frlht.org/rasayana/matulunga |archivedate=2013-12-24 }}</ref>\n\nThere is an increasing market for the citron for the soluble fiber ([[pectin]]) found in its thick [[flavedo|albedo]].<ref>{{cite journal \n |author=Dalia A.

The citron is usually [[fertilized]] by [[self-pollination]].  This results in them displaying a high degree of genetic [[zygosity|homozygosity]], and it is the male parent of any citrus hybrid rather than a female one.<ref name=\"HortScience 2005\" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=E.

Bog.); Wellcome V0042687.jpg|thumb|Illustration of [[fingered citron]] with the leaves and thorns that are common to all varieties of citron.]]\n<blockquote>In the east and south there are special plants... i.e. in Media and Persia there are many types of fruit, between them there is a fruit called Median or Persian Apple. The tree has a leaf similar to and almost identical with that of the ''andrachn'' (''[[Arbutus andrachne]]'' L.), but has [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns]] like those of the ''[[apios]]'' (the wild [[pear]], ''Pyrus amygdaliformis'' Vill.) or the [[firethorn]] (''Cotoneaster pyracantha'' Spach.), except that they are white, smooth, sharp and strong. The fruit is not eaten, but is very fragrant, as is also the [[leaf]] of the tree; and the fruit is put among [[clothes]], it keeps them from being [[moth]]-eaten. It is also useful when one has drunk deadly poison, for when it is administered in [[wine]]; it upsets the [[stomach]] and brings up the poison. It is also useful to improve the [[breath]], for if one boils the inner part of the fruit in a dish or squeezes it into the mouth in some other medium, it makes the breath more pleasant.\n\nThe seed is removed from the fruit and sown in the [[Spring (season)|spring]] in carefully tilled beds, and it is watered every fourth or fifth day. As soon the plant is strong it is [[Transplanting|transplanted]], also in the spring, to a soft, well watered site, where the soil is not very fine, for it prefers such places.\n\nAnd it bears its fruit at all [[season]]s, for when some have gathered, the flower of the others is on the tree and is ripening others.

The leaf is similar to that of the [[Arbutus|arbute]], except that it has small prickles running across it. As to the fruit, it is never eaten, but it is remarkable for its extremely powerful smell, which is the case, also, with the leaves; indeed, the odour is so strong, that it will penetrate clothes, when they are once impregnated with it, and hence it is very useful in repelling the attacks of noxious insects.\n\nThe tree bears fruit at all seasons of the year; while some is falling off, other fruit is ripening, and other, again, just bursting into birth. Various nations have attempted to naturalize this tree among them, for the sake of its medical properties, by planting it in pots of clay, with holes drilled in them, for the purpose of introducing the air to the roots; and I would here remark, once for all, that it is as well to remember that the best plan is to pack all slips of trees that have to be carried to any distance, as close together as they can possibly be placed.\n\nIt has been found, however, that this tree will grow nowhere except in Media or Persia. It is this fruit, the pips of which, as we have already mentioned, the [[Parthia]]n grandees employ in seasoning their [[ragout]]s, as being peculiarly conducive to the sweetening of the breath. We find no other tree very highly commended that is produced in Media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D12%3Achapter%3D7|title=Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, Book XII.

A decoction of citrons, or the juice extracted from them, is used as a gargle to impart sweetness to the breath.

However, the citron's fruit shape is highly variable, due to the large quantity of [[Mesocarp#Mesocarp|albedo]], which forms independently according to the fruits' position on the tree, twig orientation, and many other factors. The rind is leathery, furrowed, and adherent. The inner portion is thick, white and hard; the outer is uniformly thin and very fragrant. The pulp is usually acidic, but also can be sweet, and even pulpless varieties are found.\n\nMost citron varieties contain a large number of [[monoembryonic]] seeds. They are white, with dark innercoats and red-purplish [[chalazal spot]]s for the acidic varieties, and colorless for the sweet ones. Some citron varieties are also distinct, having  persistent [[carpel|styles]], that do not fall off after fecundation. Those are usually promoted for ''[[etrog]]'' use.\n\nSome citrons have medium-sized oil bubbles at the outer surface, medially distant to each other. Some varieties are ribbed and faintly warted on the outer surface. There is also a fingered citron variety called [[Buddha's hand]].\n\nThe color varies from green, when unripe, to a yellow-orange when overripe. The citron does not fall off the tree and can reach 8\u201310 pounds (4\u20135&nbsp;kg) if not picked before fully mature.<ref>''Un curieux Cedrat marocain'', Chapot 1950.</ref><ref name=\"HortScience 2005\">[http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&origin=ibids_references&therow=796030 The Search for the Authentic Citron: Historic and Genetic Analysis; ''HortScience'' '''40'''(7):1963\u20131968. 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921214001/http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&origin=ibids_references&therow=796030 |date=September 21, 2008 }}</ref> However, they should be picked before the winter, as the branches might bend or break to the ground, and may cause numerous fungal diseases for the tree.\n\nDespite the wide variety of forms taken on by the fruit, citrons are all closely related genetically, representing a single species.<ref name=\"Talon\" /><ref name=\"Ramadugu\">{{cite journal | last1=Ramadugu | first1=Chandrika | last2=Keremane | first2=Manjunath L | last3=Hu | first3=Xulan | last4=Karp | first4=David | last5=Frederici | first5=Claire T | last6=Kahn | first6=Tracy | last7=Roose | first7=Mikeal L | last8=Lee | first8=Richard F. | title=Genetic analysis of citron (''Citrus medica'' L.) using simple sequence repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms | journal=Scientia Horticulturae | volume=195 | pages=124\u2013137 | year=2015 | doi=10.1016/j.scienta.2015.09.004 }}</ref>  Genetic analysis has shown known cultivars to divide into three clusters, a Mediterranean cluster thought to have originated in India, and two clusters predominantly found in China, one representing the fingered citrons, and another consisting of non-fingered varieties.<ref name=\"Ramadugu\" />\n\n=== Plant ===\n[[File:Citron Balady Etrog Simanim.jpg|thumb|A pure citron of any kind has a large portion of [[Fruit_anatomy#Mesocarp|albedo]], which is important for the production of [[succade]]]]\n\n''Citrus medica'' is a slow-growing [[shrub]] or small tree that reaches a height of about {{convert|8|to|15|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.

Some claim{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} that even the [[Florentine citron]] is not pure citron, but a citron hybrid.\n\n== Uses ==\n=== Culinary ===\n{{Main|Succade}}\n\nWhile the [[lemon]] and [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] are peeled to consume their pulpy and [[juice|juicy]] [[flavedo|segments]], the citron's pulp is dry, containing a small quantity of insipid juice, if any. The main content of a citron fruit is the thick white rind, which adheres to the segments and cannot be separated from them easily. The citron gets halved and depulped, then its rind (the thicker the better) is cut in pieces, cooked in sugar syrup, and used as a [[spoon sweet]], in Greek known as \"kitro glyko\" (\u03ba\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc), or it is diced and caramelized with sugar and used as a confection in cakes. In Italy, a soft drink called \"Cedrata\" is made from the fruit. \n\nIn Samoa a refreshing drink called \"vai tipolo\" is made from squeezed juice. It is also added to a raw fish dish called \"oka\" and to a variation of palusami or lu\u00e1u.\n\nCitron is a regularly used item in Asian cuisine. The variety of citron used in Japan, [[yuzu]], is juiced, and the juice is used regularly in dipping sauces, dressings and marinades. The juice is widely available bottled like lemon juice. Grated or shredded yuzu rind is also added to marinades and desserts, and hollowed out yuzu can be seen as decorative containers in higher end restaurants. In Korea, a popular tea, [[yuja-cha]], is made by mixing citron meat and julienned peels with sugar and honey. This tea is consumed both hot and iced, and is often taken for sore throats and colds in winter.\n\nToday the citron is used for the [[fragrance]] or [[Zest (ingredient)|zest]] of its [[flavedo]], but the most important part is still the inner rind (known as [[pith]] or ''[[Fruit anatomy#Mesocarp|albedo]]''), which is a fairly important article in [[international trade]] and is widely employed in the food industry as [[succade]],<ref name=\"Purdue Citron\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/citron.html |title=Citron: ''Citrus medica'' Linn. |publisher=Purdue University}}</ref> as it is known when it is candied in sugar.\n\nThe dozens of varieties of citron are collectively known as ''Lebu'' in [[Bengali cuisine|Bangladesh, West Bengal]], where it is the primary citrus fruit.\n\nIn Iran, the citron's thick white rind is used to make jam; in [[Pakistan]] the fruit is used to make jam but is also pickled; in [[South Indian cuisine]], some varieties of citron (collectively referred to as \"Narthangai\" in Tamil and \"Heralikayi\" in Kannada) are widely used in pickles and preserves.In karnataka, heralikayi(citron) is uses to make lemon rice. In [[Kutch]], Gujarat, it is used to make pickle, wherein entire slices of fruits are salted, dried and mixed with [[jaggery]] and spices to make sweet spicy pickle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bijora Pickle |url=http://www.jainworld.com/jainfoodrecipes/pic_bijora.asp |publisher=Jain World}}</ref> In the United States, citron is an important ingredient in holiday [[fruitcakes]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Halv sukat.JPG|A citron halved and depulped, cooked in sugar\nFile:Bicchiere di tassoni1.jpg|''Cedrata'', a citron soft drink from Italy\nFile:Citron cake.jpg|Citron torte\n</gallery>\n\n=== Medicinal ===\nFrom [[ancient]] through [[medieval]] times, the citron was used mainly for medical purposes: to combat [[seasickness]], [[pulmonary]] troubles, [[intestine|intestinal]] ailments, [[scurvy]] and other disorders. The [[essential oil]] of the [[flavedo]] (the outermost, pigmented layer of rind) was also regarded as an [[antibiotic]]. Citron juice with [[wine]] was considered an effective [[antidote]] to [[poison]], as [[Theophrastus]] reported. In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, the juice is still used for treating conditions like nausea, vomiting, and excessive thirst.\n\nThe juice of the citron has a high [[Vitamin C]] content and is used in the Indian system of medicine as an [[anthelmintic]], appetizer, tonic, in cough, rheumatism, vomiting, flatulence, haemorrhoids, skin diseases and weak eyesight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frlht.org/rasayana/matulunga |title=Matulunga (Citrus medica) |publisher=frlht.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224161117/http://www.frlht.org/rasayana/matulunga |archivedate=2013-12-24 }}</ref>\n\nThere is an increasing market for the citron for the soluble fiber ([[pectin]]) found in its thick [[flavedo|albedo]].<ref>{{cite journal \n |author=Dalia A.

The [[Mughals]], on their capture of the fort in 1698 A.D., named it Nusratgadh in honour of Nawab [[Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung]], the commander-in-chief of the besieging army.

He was the son of Swarup Singh and revolted against the [[Nawab of Arcot]], and was defeated and killed in the war that followed.

The fortifications contain a sacred [[pond]] known as Aanaikulam. The walls of the fort are a mixture of the natural hilly terrain comprising the Krishnagiri, Chakkilidrug and Rajagiri hills, while the gaps were sealed with the main wall that measures {{convert|20|m|ft}} in thickness.<ref name=\"Manchanda\">[[#Manchanda|Manchanda]], p. 149</ref> On the top of the hillock, there are minor fortifications.<ref name=\"ASI\"/>\n\nWater resources are usually sparse in South Indian forts, while it was well managed in the [[Citadel]]. There are two sweet water sources on the summit and below it there are three reservoirs for storage of rain water. Water for Kalyana Mahal was brought through earthenware pipes from reservoir located {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} from it.<ref name=Verma/>\n\n===Rajagiri===\n[[File:Gingee fort entrance.jpg|thumb|Gingee fort as seen from the entrance]]\nThe first hill, where the main fort is, is called Rajagiri. Originally it was known as Kamalagiri as well as Anandagiri. The fort was historically considered most impregnable. It is about {{convert|800|ft|m}} in height. Its summit is cut off from communication and is surrounded by a deep, natural chasm that is about {{convert|10|yard|m}} wide and {{convert|20|yard|m}} deep. To gain entry into the [[citadel]] one had to cross the chasm with the help of a small wooden draw bridge. The naturally strong rock where the fortress is located, is further strengthened by the construction of [[embrasure]] walls and gateways along all possible shelves and precipitous edges. The citadel is reached by traversing through seven gates. This citadel contains important buildings apart from the living quarters of the royalty, like the stables, granaries, and meeting halls for the public, temples, mosques, shrines and pavilions. Kamalakanni Amman temple is present atop the Rajagiri hills. As per Hindu legend, the presiding deity, Kamalakanni, is believed to be the widow of demon king  Acalamaccuran. Draupadi, a [[Hindu]] goddess, beheaded the hundred heads of the demon and Kamalakanni is believed to have protests that she would become a widow. [[Draupadi]] explains her similarities that she has no sexual relations, though married. This resulted in the ambiguous ''kanni'' suffix.<ref>[[#Hiltebeitel|Hiltebeitel 1991]], p. 214</ref> Ranganathar Temple, bell tower, watch tower, cannon and draw bridge are located atop the hill.\n\nThe lower fort consists of Arcot Gate, Pondicherry Gate, which was probably improved by the French during their occupation (1751\u20131761),\nthe Prison on top of Pondicherry Gate, Royal Battery, Venkataramanaswami Temple, Pattabhi Ramaswami Temple, Sadatulla Khan's mosque, Chettikulam and Chakrakulam tanks, platform where Raja Desingh was killed in a war, large stone image of [[Hanuman]], prisoner's well where the prisoners condemned to death were thrown and left to die of starvation. The inner fort consists of Kalyana Mahal, the royal stables, the ruined royal palace,  Anaikulam tank, granaries, magazine and the shrine of [[Venugopalaswamy|Venugopalaswami]]. There is a site museum at the entrance of the fort set up by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] containing sculptures pertaining to periods and many dynasties that ruled Gingee. There are also guns and cannonballs made of stone, strewn about the fort.<ref name=\"ASI\"/>\n\n===Krishnagiri===\n[[File:Queen fort from King fort.jpg|thumb|Queen fort as seen from Rajagiri]]\nThe second important hillock with an imposing citadel is known as Krishnagiri. It is also known as the English Mountain, perhaps because the British residents occupied the fort here, for some time. The Krishnagiri fort lies to the North of [[Tiruvannamalai]] road. It is smaller in size and height compared to the Rajagiri fort. A flight of steps of granite stones leads to its top. Another fort connected with Rajagiri with a low rocky ridge is called Chandrayan Durg, Chandragiri or St. George's Mountain. The military and strategic value of this fort has been relatively less, but it has some interesting buildings of later period.\n\n===Chakkiliya Durg===\nThe third fort for some reason is called Chakkiliya Durg or Chamar Tikri \u2014 meaning the fort of the Chamars. It is not known why it had acquired the name. Probably the royal [[Chamar]] warriors used to stay here, as Gingee obviously was a military encampment. There is a smaller and less important fourth hill, the summit of which is also well fortified. There is nothing much left of Chandrayan Durg and Chakkilli Durg. Their flanks are now completely covered with thorny shrubs and stone pieces.<ref name=\"ASI\"/>\n\n==Culture==\nAfter the fort passed into British hands, it did not see any further action. The fort at Gingee was declared a National Monument in 1921 and was under the Archaeological Department. The Tourism Department of India has tried to popularize this remote and oft-forgotten fort. Gingee today, with its ruined forts, [[temples]] and granaries, presents a different picture from the glorious splendor of its bygone days. But the remains of that glorious past speak volumes about the numerous invasions, [[war]]fare and bravery that it witnessed. The fort is maintained by the [[Archaeological Survey of India|Archaeological Department]]. An entry charge of {{INR}}25 is charged for Indian citizens and {{INR}}300 for foreigners for all monuments inside Krishnagiri and Rajagiri forts.<ref name=\"ASI\"/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"165px\" height=\"150px\" align=\"center\">\nGingee tomb pillar.jpg|Tomb pillar at lower fort\nKalyana Mahal from Rajagiri.jpg|Kalyana Mahal as seen from Rajagiri\nGingee fort from ground.jpg|View of Gingee Fort(Queens) from the ground\nView From Queen's Fort Top - Gingee Town.jpg|View from Queen's Fort Top \u2013 Gingee Town\nHanuman carving image.jpg|Large stone image of Hanuman\nCannon gingee fort.jpg|Cannon present in Gingee Fort\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gingee Venkataramana Temple]]\n* [[Chenjiamman]]\n* [[Senji Singavaram Ranganatha Temple]]\n* [[Military history of India]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|3}}\n* {{cite book|title=The cult of Draupad\u012b: Mythologies : from Gingee to Kurukserta, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VncomfRVVhoC&pg=PA214&dq=gingee+fort&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5UZ-Ut7zHYi1kQfZyoCgAw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=gingee%20fort&f=false|last=Hiltebeitel|first=Alt|ref=Hiltebeitel|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|year=1991|isbn=9788120810006}}\n* {{cite book|title=Forts & Palaces of India: Sentinels of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12KdMcYlCcwC&pg=PA149&dq=gingee+fort&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yj--Uub6CsvksATG8YLADA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=gingee%20fort&f=false|last=Manchanda|first=Bindu |isbn=9788174363817|year=2006|publisher=Roli Books Private Limited|ref=Manchanda}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050524211748/http://indiaimage.nic.in/gingeefort.htm Indian Government site]\n{{commons category|Gingee Fort}}\n* [https://archive.org/details/historyofgingeea035396mbp History Of Gingee And Its Rulers : Dr Rajah Sir Annamalai_Chettiar : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last1=Srinivasachari|first1=Chidambaram S.|title=A history of Gingee and its rulers|publisher=The University|date=1943|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.500497}}\n\n{{Forts in Tamil Nadu}}\n{{Forts in India}}\n\n[[Category:Forts in Tamil Nadu]]\n[[Category:Archaeological monuments in Tamil Nadu]]\n[[Category:1761 establishments in the British Empire]]\n[[Category:16th-century forts in India]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in India]]\n[[Category:Hiking trails in India]]\n[[Category:Chola architecture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox military installation\n|name = Saenji Fort\n|partof =  [[Tamil Nadu]]\n|location = [[Villupuram District]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]\n|image = [[File:Gingee Fort panorama.jpg|300px]]\n|caption = A panorama of the Senji fort with the Kalyana Mahal visible just right of centre\n|map_type = India Tamil Nadu\n|map_size = 300\n|map_caption = \n|type = [[Fort]]s\n|coordinates= {{coord|12.2507|N|79.3957|E|region:IN_type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n|coordinates_footnotes=[http://wikimapia.org/1558528/Gingee-Fort-Raja-Desing]\n|code = \n|built = 1st century\n|builder =   Initially '''Saenji Ananda kone''' and later  [[Chola]] [[Dynasty]], [[Vijayanagara Empire]]\n|materials = [[Granite]] [[rock (geology)|Stones]] and [[lime mortar]]\n|height = \n|used = \n|demolished =\n|condition = Ruins\n|ownership = {{flagcountry|India}}Government of India                   \n|open_to_public = Yes\n|controlledby = Ananda Kone Dynasty\n\n{{flagicon image|Flag of Chola Kingdom.png}}[[Chola Empire]] <small>(9th Century)</small><br />{{flagicon image|Vijayanagara flag.png}}[[Vijayanagara Empire]] (<small>1345-1565</small>)<br />{{noflag}}[[Gingee Nayaks]] <small> 1509-1649<br />{{flagicon image| QutbshahiFlag.PNG}} [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Golconda Sultanate]](<small>1649-1677</small>)<br />{{flagcountry|Maratha Empire}} (<small>1677-1691</small>)<br />{{flagicon image|Alam of the Mughal Empire.svg}} [[Mughal Empire]] & [[Arcot State|Carnatic Nawabs]](<small>1698-1750</small>)<br />{{flagicon image|Flag of France.svg}}[[French colonial empire|French Empire]] (<small>1750-1761</small>)<br />{{flagcountry|United Kingdom}}\n* {{flagicon image|Flag of the British East India Company (1801).svg}} [[East India Company]] (<small>1761-1857</small>)\n* {{flagicon image|British Raj Red Ensign.svg}} [[British Raj]] (<small>1857-1947</small>)\n{{flagcountry|India}} (<small>1947-</small>)\n|garrison = \n|current_commander = \n|commanders =\n|occupants = \n|battles = \n|events = National Monument (1921)\n|image2 = \n|caption2 = \n}}\n\n'''Gingee Fort''' or '''Senji Fort''' (also known as Chenji, Chanchi, Jinji or Senchi)  ({{lang-ta|\u0b9a\u0bc6\u0b9e\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bcb\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc8}} )in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] is one of the surviving forts in [[Tamil Nadu]], India.

It has a seven-storeyed Kalyana Mahal (marriage hall), [[Granary|granaries]], [[prison]] cells, and a temple dedicated to its presiding  [[Hindu goddess]] called [[Chenjiamman]]. The fortifications contain a sacred [[pond]] known as Aanaikulam. The walls of the fort are a mixture of the natural hilly terrain comprising the Krishnagiri, Chakkilidrug and Rajagiri hills, while the gaps were sealed with the main wall that measures {{convert|20|m|ft}} in thickness.<ref name=\"Manchanda\">[[#Manchanda|Manchanda]], p. 149</ref> On the top of the hillock, there are minor fortifications.<ref name=\"ASI\"/>\n\nWater resources are usually sparse in South Indian forts, while it was well managed in the Citadel. There are two sweet water sources on the summit and below it there are three reservoirs for storage of rain water. Water for Kalyana Mahal was brought through earthenware pipes from reservoir located {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} from it.<ref name=Verma/>\n\n===Rajagiri===\n[[File:Gingee fort entrance.jpg|thumb|Gingee fort as seen from the entrance]]\nThe first hill, where the main fort is, is called Rajagiri. Originally it was known as Kamalagiri as well as Anandagiri. The fort was historically considered most impregnable. It is about {{convert|800|ft|m}} in height. Its summit is cut off from communication and is surrounded by a deep, natural chasm that is about {{convert|10|yard|m}} wide and {{convert|20|yard|m}} deep. To gain entry into the [[citadel]] one had to cross the chasm with the help of a small wooden draw bridge. The naturally strong rock where the fortress is located, is further strengthened by the construction of [[embrasure]] walls and gateways along all possible shelves and precipitous edges. The citadel is reached by traversing through seven gates. This citadel contains important buildings apart from the living quarters of the royalty, like the stables, granaries, and meeting halls for the public, temples, mosques, shrines and pavilions. Kamalakanni Amman temple is present atop the Rajagiri hills. As per Hindu legend, the presiding deity, Kamalakanni, is believed to be the widow of demon king  Acalamaccuran. Draupadi, a [[Hindu]] goddess, beheaded the hundred heads of the demon and Kamalakanni is believed to have protests that she would become a widow. Draupadi explains her similarities that she has no sexual relations, though married. This resulted in the ambiguous ''kanni'' suffix.<ref>[[#Hiltebeitel|Hiltebeitel 1991]], p. 214</ref> Ranganathar Temple, bell tower, watch tower, cannon and draw bridge are located atop the hill.\n\nThe lower fort consists of Arcot Gate, Pondicherry Gate, which was probably improved by the French during their occupation (1751\u20131761),\nthe Prison on top of Pondicherry Gate, Royal Battery, Venkataramanaswami Temple, Pattabhi Ramaswami Temple, Sadatulla Khan's mosque, Chettikulam and Chakrakulam tanks, platform where Raja Desingh was killed in a war, large stone image of [[Hanuman]], prisoner's well where the prisoners condemned to death were thrown and left to die of starvation. The inner fort consists of Kalyana Mahal, the royal stables, the ruined royal palace,  Anaikulam tank, granaries, magazine and the shrine of Venugopalaswami. There is a site museum at the entrance of the fort set up by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] containing sculptures pertaining to periods and many dynasties that ruled Gingee. There are also guns and cannonballs made of stone, strewn about the fort.<ref name=\"ASI\"/>\n\n===Krishnagiri===\n[[File:Queen fort from King fort.jpg|thumb|Queen fort as seen from Rajagiri]]\nThe second important hillock with an imposing citadel is known as Krishnagiri. It is also known as the English Mountain, perhaps because the British residents occupied the fort here, for some time. The Krishnagiri fort lies to the North of [[Tiruvannamalai]] road. It is smaller in size and height compared to the Rajagiri fort. A flight of steps of granite stones leads to its top. Another fort connected with Rajagiri with a low rocky ridge is called Chandrayan Durg, Chandragiri or St. George's Mountain. The military and strategic value of this fort has been relatively less, but it has some interesting buildings of later period.\n\n===Chakkiliya Durg===\nThe third fort for some reason is called Chakkiliya Durg or Chamar Tikri \u2014 meaning the fort of the Chamars. It is not known why it had acquired the name. Probably the royal [[Chamar]] warriors used to stay here, as Gingee obviously was a military encampment. There is a smaller and less important fourth hill, the summit of which is also well fortified. There is nothing much left of Chandrayan Durg and Chakkilli Durg. Their flanks are now completely covered with thorny shrubs and stone pieces.<ref name=\"ASI\"/>\n\n==Culture==\nAfter the fort passed into British hands, it did not see any further action. The fort at Gingee was declared a National Monument in 1921 and was under the Archaeological Department. The Tourism Department of India has tried to popularize this remote and oft-forgotten fort. Gingee today, with its ruined forts, [[temples]] and granaries, presents a different picture from the glorious splendor of its bygone days. But the remains of that glorious past speak volumes about the numerous invasions, [[war]]fare and bravery that it witnessed. The fort is maintained by the Archaeological Department. An entry charge of {{INR}}25 is charged for Indian citizens and {{INR}}300 for foreigners for all monuments inside Krishnagiri and Rajagiri forts.<ref name=\"ASI\"/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"165px\" height=\"150px\" align=\"center\">\nGingee tomb pillar.jpg|Tomb pillar at lower fort\nKalyana Mahal from Rajagiri.jpg|Kalyana Mahal as seen from Rajagiri\nGingee fort from ground.jpg|View of Gingee Fort(Queens) from the ground\nView From Queen's Fort Top - Gingee Town.jpg|View from Queen's Fort Top \u2013 Gingee Town\nHanuman carving image.jpg|Large stone image of Hanuman\nCannon gingee fort.jpg|Cannon present in Gingee Fort\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gingee Venkataramana Temple]]\n* [[Chenjiamman]]\n* [[Senji Singavaram Ranganatha Temple]]\n* [[Military history of India]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|3}}\n* {{cite book|title=The cult of Draupad\u012b: Mythologies : from Gingee to Kurukserta, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VncomfRVVhoC&pg=PA214&dq=gingee+fort&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5UZ-Ut7zHYi1kQfZyoCgAw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=gingee%20fort&f=false|last=Hiltebeitel|first=Alt|ref=Hiltebeitel|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|year=1991|isbn=9788120810006}}\n* {{cite book|title=Forts & Palaces of India: Sentinels of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12KdMcYlCcwC&pg=PA149&dq=gingee+fort&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yj--Uub6CsvksATG8YLADA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=gingee%20fort&f=false|last=Manchanda|first=Bindu |isbn=9788174363817|year=2006|publisher=Roli Books Private Limited|ref=Manchanda}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050524211748/http://indiaimage.nic.in/gingeefort.htm Indian Government site]\n{{commons category|Gingee Fort}}\n* [https://archive.org/details/historyofgingeea035396mbp History Of Gingee And Its Rulers : Dr Rajah Sir Annamalai_Chettiar : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last1=Srinivasachari|first1=Chidambaram S.|title=A history of Gingee and its rulers|publisher=The University|date=1943|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.500497}}\n\n{{Forts in Tamil Nadu}}\n{{Forts in India}}\n\n[[Category:Forts in Tamil Nadu]]\n[[Category:Archaeological monuments in Tamil Nadu]]\n[[Category:1761 establishments in the British Empire]]\n[[Category:16th-century forts in India]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in India]]\n[[Category:Hiking trails in India]]\n[[Category:Chola architecture]]\n", "name_user": "Ccmarathe", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingee_Fort"}

For the next 80 or 90 years succeeding the banishment of the apostle John to Patmos covering the successive reigns of the emperors [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]] and the two Antonines ([[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]), a golden age of prosperity, union, civil liberty and good government unstained with civil blood unfolded. The agents of this prosperity personified by the rider of the white horse are these five emperors wearing crowns that reigned with absolute authority and power under the guidance of virtue and wisdom, the armies being restrained by their firm and gentle hands.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|129\u2013131,134}}\n\nThis interpretation points out that the bow was preeminently a weapon of the inhabitants of the island of [[Crete]] and not of the Roman Empire in general. The Cretans were renowned for their archery skills. The significance of the rider of the white horse holding a bow indicates the place of origin of the line of emperors ruling during this time. This group of emperors can be classed together under one and the same head and family whose origins were from Crete.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|140,142\u2013144}}\n\nAccording to this interpretation, this period in Roman history, remarkable, both at its commencement and at its close, illustrated the glory of the empire where its limits were extended, though not without occasional wars, which were always uniformly triumphant and successful on the frontiers. The triumphs of the Emperor Trajan, a Roman Alexander, added to the empire [[Dacia]], [[Armenia]], [[Mesopotamia]] and other provinces during the course of the first 20 years of the period, which deepened the impression on the minds of the barbarians of the invincibility of the Roman Empire. Roman war progressed triumphantly into the invader's own territory, and the Parthian war was successfully ended by the total overthrow of those people. Roman conquest is demonstrated even in the most mighty of these wars, the Marcomannic succession of victories under the second Antonine unleashed on the German barbarians, driven into their forests and reduced to Roman submission.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|131\u2013133}}\n\n===As war===\n\nIn some commentaries to Bibles, the white Horseman is said to symbolize (ordinary) War, which may possibly be exercised on righteous grounds in decent manner, hence the white color, but still is devastating. The red Horseman (see below) then rather more specifically symbolizes civil war.<ref>''Herder'' German Bible, Freiburg im Breisgau 2007, p. 1348, annotation to Apc 6,7: \"The four Horsemen of the Apocalypse symbolize various plagues: [1.] War, [2.] Civil War, [3.] famine and inflation, [4.] pestilence and death.\" (translated from German)</ref>\n\n===As infectious disease===\nUnder another interpretation, the first Horseman is called [[Infection|Pestilence]], and is associated with infectious disease and plague. It appears at least as early as 1906, when it is mentioned in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].<ref name=Singer>{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Isidore|title=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, Volume 10|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YLw5AQAAMAAJ|year=1916|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|page=392|author2=Adler, Cyrus|quote=\"...and sees a white horse appear, with a rider holding a bow (representing, probably, Pestilence).\"}}</ref> This particular interpretation is common [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in popular culture|in popular culture references]] to the Four Horsemen.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian|title=The A to Z of Fantasy Literature|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0810868296|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHc3XTdJBxQC&pg=PA18|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of this interpretation is unclear. Some translations of the Bible mention \"[[plague (disease)|plague]]\" (e.g. the [[New International Version|NIV]]) or \"pestilence\" (e.g. the [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]]) in connection with the riders in the passage following the introduction of the fourth rider; cf. \"They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.\" ({{bibleverse|Revelation|6:7\u20138|NASB}} NASB).

The sword was a natural, universal badge among the Romans, of the military profession. The apocalyptic figure indicated by the great sword indicated an undue authority and unnatural use of it.

In the course of this history, the land tax, the taxes for services and the heavy contributions of corn, wine, oil and meat were exacted from the provinces for the use of the court, army and capital.

That furious plague (the [[Plague of Cyprian]]), which raged from the year 250 to the year 265, continued without interruption in every province, city and almost every family in the empire. During a portion of this time, 5000 people died daily in Rome; and many towns that escaped the attacks of barbarians were entirely depopulated.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|193}}\n\nFor a time in the late 260s, the strength of [[Aurelian]] crushed the enemies of Rome, yet after his assassination certain of them revived.<ref name=GibbonV1 />{{rp|246}} While the Goths had been destroyed for almost a century and the Empire reunited, the Sassanid Persians were uncowed in the East and during the following year hosts of central Asian Alani spread themselves over Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia and Galatia, etching their course by the flames of cities and villages they pillaged.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|197}}\n\nAs for the wild beasts of the earth, according to Elliott, it is a well-known law of nature that they quickly occupy the scenes of waste and depopulation\u2014where the reign of man fails and the reign of beasts begins.

For the next 80 or 90 years succeeding the banishment of the apostle John to Patmos covering the successive reigns of the emperors [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]] and the two Antonines ([[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]), a golden age of prosperity, union, civil liberty and good government unstained with civil blood unfolded. The agents of this prosperity personified by the rider of the white horse are these five emperors wearing crowns that reigned with absolute authority and power under the guidance of virtue and wisdom, the armies being restrained by their firm and gentle hands.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|129\u2013131,134}}\n\nThis interpretation points out that the bow was preeminently a weapon of the inhabitants of the island of [[Crete]] and not of the Roman Empire in general. The Cretans were renowned for their archery skills. The significance of the rider of the white horse holding a bow indicates the place of origin of the line of emperors ruling during this time. This group of emperors can be classed together under one and the same head and family whose origins were from Crete.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|140,142\u2013144}}\n\nAccording to this interpretation, this period in Roman history, remarkable, both at its commencement and at its close, illustrated the glory of the empire where its limits were extended, though not without occasional wars, which were always uniformly triumphant and successful on the frontiers. The triumphs of the Emperor Trajan, a Roman Alexander, added to the empire [[Dacia]], [[Armenia]], [[Mesopotamia]] and other provinces during the course of the first 20 years of the period, which deepened the impression on the minds of the barbarians of the invincibility of the Roman Empire. Roman war progressed triumphantly into the invader's own territory, and the Parthian war was successfully ended by the total overthrow of those people. Roman conquest is demonstrated even in the most mighty of these wars, the Marcomannic succession of victories under the second Antonine unleashed on the German barbarians, driven into their forests and reduced to Roman submission.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|131\u2013133}}\n\n===As war===\n\nIn some commentaries to Bibles, the white Horseman is said to symbolize (ordinary) War, which may possibly be exercised on righteous grounds in decent manner, hence the white color, but still is devastating. The red Horseman (see below) then rather more specifically symbolizes civil war.<ref>''Herder'' German Bible, Freiburg im Breisgau 2007, p. 1348, annotation to Apc 6,7: \"The four Horsemen of the Apocalypse symbolize various plagues: [1.] War, [2.] Civil War, [3.] famine and inflation, [4.] pestilence and death.\" (translated from German)</ref>\n\n===As infectious disease===\nUnder another interpretation, the first Horseman is called [[Infection|Pestilence]], and is associated with infectious disease and plague. It appears at least as early as 1906, when it is mentioned in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].<ref name=Singer>{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Isidore|title=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, Volume 10|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YLw5AQAAMAAJ|year=1916|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|page=392|author2=Adler, Cyrus|quote=\"...and sees a white horse appear, with a rider holding a bow (representing, probably, Pestilence).\"}}</ref> This particular interpretation is common [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in popular culture|in popular culture references]] to the Four Horsemen.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian|title=The A to Z of Fantasy Literature|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0810868296|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHc3XTdJBxQC&pg=PA18|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of this interpretation is unclear. Some translations of the Bible mention \"[[plague (disease)|plague]]\" (e.g. the [[New International Version|NIV]]) or \"pestilence\" (e.g. the [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]]) in connection with the riders in the passage following the introduction of the fourth rider; cf. \"They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.\" ({{bibleverse|Revelation|6:7\u20138|NASB}} NASB).

The sword was a natural, universal badge among the Romans, of the military profession. The apocalyptic figure indicated by the great sword indicated an undue authority and unnatural use of it. Military men in power, whose vocation was war and weapon the sword, rose by it and also fell.

John hears a voice, unidentified but coming from among [[Chronology of Revelation#Vision of Heaven|the four living creatures]], that speaks of the prices of wheat and barley, also saying \"and see thou hurt not the [[olive oil|oil]] and the [[wine]]\". This suggests that the black horse's famine is to drive up the price of grain but leave oil and wine supplies unaffected (though out of reach of the ordinary worker).

The balance during the time of the apostle John's exile in Patmos was commonly a symbol of justice since it was used to weigh out the grains for a set price.

During the reign of Emperor [[Caracalla]], whose sentiments were very different from the [[Antonines]] being inattentive, or rather averse, to the welfare of the people, he found himself under the necessity of gratifying the greed and excessive lifestyle which he had excited in the Army. During his reign, he crushed every part of the empire under the weight of his iron scepter. Old as well as new taxes were at the same time levied in the provinces. In the course of this history, the land tax, the taxes for services and the heavy contributions of corn, wine, oil and meat were exacted from the provinces for the use of the court, army and capital. This noxious weed not totally eradicated again sprang up with the most luxurious growth and going forward darkened the Roman world with its deadly shade.<ref name=\"GibbonV1\" />{{rp|138\u2013139}}\n\nIn reality, the rise to power of the Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximin]], whose cruelty was derived from a different source being raised as a barbarian from the district of Thrace, expanded the distress on the empire beyond the confines of the illustrious senators or bold adventurers who in the court or army exposed themselves to the whims of fortune.

That furious plague (the [[Plague of Cyprian]]), which raged from the year 250 to the year 265, continued without interruption in every province, city and almost every family in the empire.

The signs of the approaching end of the world are likened to birth pains, indicating that they would occur more frequently and with greater intensity the nearer the event of Christ's return.

After several years he grew disenchanted with the life of the big city and its focus on material possessions.  Having spent much of his youth being involved with the Boy Scouts and his love of the outdoors, he read the story \"[[The Shepherd of the Hills (novel)|The Shepherd of the Hills]]\" by [[Harold Bell Wright]] and an article by [[Horace Kephart]] about camping in the [[Ozarks]].  These books greatly influenced him and he decided to give up the big city life and find himself again in the hills of the [[Boston Mountains]] in [[Arkansas]].\n\nRichmond migrated to [[Springfield, Missouri]], in the Missouri Ozarks.  While in Springfield, he continued his education and attended what is now known as [[Missouri State University]].\n\n==Ozark life and the Boston Mountains==\n\nIn 1931, Richmond relocated to Mount Sherman, Arkansas, and homesteaded {{convert|160|acre|km2}} land located on the north slope, in what he called \"the cove\".<ref name=\"Wilderness Library\"/> He built a cabin which he lovingly called the \"Wildcat Cabin\" because of the bobcat that followed him on his journey to locate a suitable building site.\n\nRichmond immediately formed a kinship with the native Arkansasans. Richmond was a worldly man in a land that saw very little of the outside world. He began several quests that were dear to his heart, doctoring and education. He began writing people describing his need for books and magazines that offered reading material of the hill folks.\n\n==Later years==\n\nRichmond married Edna Garner, Chief Deputy Clerk of the Courts of Civil Appeals of the 6th Supreme Judicial District Court of Texas at Texarkana, in 1953.  They lived in Texarkana and Richmond would spend summers on Mount Sherman in Arkansas tending to his Wilderness Library.\n\nRichmond died in a nursing home in [[Texarkana, Texas]], at the age of 85.  He is buried in a Texarkana, Texas cemetery.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wildernesslibrary.org Wilderness Library web site dedicated to 'Twilight' Ted]\n* [http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=4438 Encyclopedia of Arkansas]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130822190224/http://universityofarkansas.edu/ University of Arkansas Archives]\n* [http://www.newtoncountyhistoricalsociety.org Newton County Historical Society]\n* [http://libinfo.uark.edu/specialcollections/ University of Arkansas Libraries]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Richmond, Theodore}}\n[[Category:1890 births]]\n[[Category:1975 deaths]]\n[[Category:American librarians]]\n[[Category:People from Ogallala, Nebraska]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2015}}\n{{Infobox person\n|name          = James Theodore (Ted) Richmond\n|image         = James Theodore Richmond.jpg\n|image_size    = 198px\n|caption       = 'Twilight' Ted Richmond\n|birth_name    = James Theodore Richmond\n|birth_date    = {{Birth date|1890|05|26}}\n|birth_place   = [[Ogallala, Nebraska]]\n|death_date    = {{Death date|1975|12|3}}\n|death_place   = [[Texarkana, Texas]]\n|death_cause   = \n|resting_place = \n|resting_place_coordinates = \n|residence     = \n|nationality   = \n|other_names   = \"Twilight Ted\"\n|known_for     = \n|education     =\n|alma_mater    = [[University of Chicago]], [[Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse]] and [[Missouri State University]]\n|employer      = \n|occupation    = writer, [[conservation movement|conservationist]], [[non-denominational]] preacher, and librarian\n|home_town     = \n|title         = \n|salary        = \n|networth      = \n|height        = \n|weight        = \n|term          = \n|predecessor   = \n|successor     = \n|party         = \n|boards        = \n|religion      = \n|spouse        = Edna Garner\n|partner       = \n|children      = \n|parents       = Albert and Etta Richmond\n|relations     = \n|signature     = \n|website       = \n|footnotes     = \n}}\n'''James Theodore (Ted) Richmond''' also known as \"Twilight Ted\" (May 26, 1890 \u2013 December 3, 1975) was an American writer, [[conservation movement|conservationist]], [[non-denominational]] preacher, and noted librarian.\n\n==Background==\nRichmond was born the second of five sons of a pioneer physician, Albert and Etta Richmond in [[Ogallala, Nebraska]].<ref name=\"Wilderness Library\">Ted Richmond's Wilderness Library. http://www.wildernesslibrary.org/ (accessed November 27, 2006).</ref>  In 1894 after years of drought, the family moved to [[Fort Madison, Iowa]].
