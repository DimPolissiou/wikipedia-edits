It stars [[Fred MacMurray]], Lin McCarthy and [[Dorothy Green (actress born 1920)|Dorothy Green]] and was based on the [[short story]] \"Long Gone\" by Peter Dawson, the [[nom de plume]] of Jonathan H. Glidden (older brother of [[Luke Short (writer)|Luke Short]]).  Dawson was the author of 120 Western short stories and [[Novella|novelettes]] as well as 15 book length Western serials.<ref>Tuska, Jon.

Without animosity, Larsen says he will use his time in prison to plan more robberies. Larsen feels  he was only caught by using a partner; the next time will be singlehanded.  Boarding the train, Larsen overpowers the deputy, takes his pistol and handcuffs him to the rear car of the train. Larsen's younger brother Danny comes to free Larsen, who chides Danny that he does not need help from anyone.\n\nDanny has brought Jim a horse and they flee. The deputy produces a hidden [[derringer]] from an ankle holster, aiming at them. He mortally wounds Danny, who kills the deputy.  The two board another train by hiding in the baggage car.  Jim explains his escape plans to Danny en route, but Danny dies.  Jim places his brother's corpse in a mail sack, throws it off a bridge passing over a river and vows to be alone in the future.\n\nThe train's first stop is the Enterprize Mine <!--this is how it's spelled, with a 'z'--> where Jim changes into his father's business suit which Danny brought, and Jim reboards the train as a passenger.  The only vacant seat is next to Alice a six-year-old girl who has been visiting her grandfather, an employee at the Enterprise mine.  The talkative Alice guesses that since she does not recognise Jim, he must be a visiting mining inspector.  Using the name Ray Kincaid, Larsen plays along with her guess and gathers information on the next town, Tangle Blue, Wyoming.\n\nMark Riley, an earnest but inexperienced sheriff who is young Alice's uncle, and a group of deputies stop the train to search for the deputy's murderer by asking for passengers' identification; they are satisfied with \"Ray Kincaid the mining inspector\" due to his travelling with Alice.  The deputies say that a wanted poster for their deputy's killer (which will have Jim Larsen's face on it) will be arriving on the next day's train and everyone will be checked entering or leaving the town.\n\nLarsen/Kincaid arrives in town, meeting Alice's mother, the widow Ellen Bailey. Uncle Mark is having problems with rich landowner Reed Williams fencing off government land [[open range]] which he has claimed as his for many years.\n\nLarsen/Kincaid uses his remaining money to have a shave then buy a horse and [[Horse tack|tack]], a set of work clothes, and a pistol, belt and ammunition to replace the pistol he threw away during the search on the train.  Larsen/Kincaid finds all the roads away from Tangle Blue are guarded by deputies who are preventing anyone leave the town until the wanted posters come in. Returning to town and desperate for cash, he  decides to earn some money as being a deputy for Mark.\n\nLarsen/Kincaid attends a dance with Ellen who says she wants to leave Tangle Blue.  He proves his ability as a lawman by preventing a showdown between Williams' gang and Mark.  Escorting Ellen and Alice home, they pass some deputies who have discovered Danny's unidentified body in the sack that the river has brought to town.  Though Larsen/Kincaid tries to avoid getting involved with Ellen, they fall in love.\n\nAs part of his duties in enforcing the law, Mark cuts down Williams' barbed wire fences, that Williams' men rebuild. Sheriff Mark reminds Larsen/Kincaid of Danny, and Mark is being threatened by Williams who says he will kill Mark if he cuts down the fence one more time. Returning to town to drink, Williams and his gang menace Larsen/Kincaid who responds by beating up Williams in a fair fight, but Larsen/Kincaid is then worked over by Williams' gang working together.\n\nThe next day Larsen/Kincaid is the only deputy willing to go with Mark to cut down Williams' fence. They go to an area overlooking the fence and find it unrepaired; Mark prepares to go back to meet the train with the wanted posters, which would leave Larsen/Kincaid free to leave town by the very road he was supposed to guard.\n\nBut then Purdy, one of Williams' hired men, arrives at the fence and repairs it.  When Mark discovers this he comes back to cut it again. Purdy draws a gun and is about to shoot Mark when Larsen/Kincaid see this from the overlook and chooses not to escape the town but instead to go help Mark. Using a rifle, he disarms Purdy, and then also shoots the barbed wire which snaps back and tangles around Purdy.  Mark goes on to meet the train, leaving Larsen/Kincaid to slowly untangle the wire around Purdy.\n\nSoon Williams and several more of his men arrive and immediately shoot at Larsen/Kincaid who escapes on horseback back to town. Pursued by them, he tries to defend himself from the roof of a boarded-up house on a main street. After killing several of the men but getting wounded, he falls through the rotted roof (conveniently cushioned by a bed below) losing his gun.   Injured, he struggles to crawl downstairs, getting to the stairs' landing; Williams begins to break through one of the boarded-up doors from the street.   Purdy, the last of Williams' men, jumps down from the hole in the roof and makes it to the top of the dark stairway just as Williams finally gets the door open and immediately shoots the figure in the dark, killing Purdy. \n\nAs the dead man falls down the stairway, Larsen/Kincaid retrieves the man's gun and uses it to kill Williams.  \n\nWhen Mark and others finally arrive at the scene, one of the men looks at the wounded and unconscious Larsen/Kincaid, then at the wanted poster he is holding, and says, \"Thats him, all right.\"  Mark then says, \"Well maybe, maybe not\", and says as they carefully take him to a doctor that he will testify for him at the trial.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Fred MacMurray]] as Jim Larsen aka Ray Kincaid\n* Lin McCarthy as Sheriff Mark Riley\n* [[Dorothy Green (actress born 1920)|Dorothy Green]] as Ellen Bailey\n* [[Alan Baxter (actor)|Alan Baxter]] as Reed Williams\n* [[Myrna Fahey]] as Janet Hawthorne\n* [[James Coburn]] as Purdy\n* [[Francis De Sales (actor)|Francis De Sales]] as Deputy Sheriff George Allison (as Francis deSales)\n* Gina Gillespie as Alice Bailey\n* [[Ron Hayes]] as Danny Larsen\n* [[Paul E.

It was written by Jonathan Brett and directed by Henry S. Miller and shot in [[New York City]], USA.  It also stars [[Cody Horn]] and [[Thorsten Kaye]].\n\nThe film premiered on the opening night of the [[Gotham Screen Film Festival & Screenplay Contest]] on October 14, 2011 in New York City. On October 18, 2011, the film was released on-demand in many cable systems and on most digital platforms (i.e., iTunes, Amazon, Blockbuster, PlayStation) in the U.S. and Canada. A full list of providers, as well as trailers, interviews and other information can be viewed at the movie's website. The DVD will be released in November 2011.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Occupant'' is a psychological thriller about the value of patience and importance of human contact.\n\nThe film opens as an old woman dies in her bed. The following day her estranged grandson, Danny, comes to the rent controlled apartment to ID the body, and the building's strange doorman encourages him to squat in the apartment until a lawyer friend of the doorman can transfer the lease to Danny permanently.\n\nDanny is instructed to not leave the apartment for 12 days by the Lawyer and then by the doorman Joe. Joe becomes his only contact to the outside world and brings him groceries, since if Danny leaves the apartment himself, the landlord could lock him out. After about three or four days he starts switching from the kid who had to be convinced to stay by the doorman, to the kid who feels that the apartment was for him, and only him.  As the days progress further, Danny begins to suffer from cabin fever leading to delusions and hallucinations. Also during this time strange things begin to happen and other people that enter the apartment go missing.\n\nBy the 9th day his cabin fever has progressed to the extreme. On this day Danny\u2019s cat Ziggy goes missing, Danny finds a bloody claw then goes crazy smashing through walls, thinking Ziggy is hidden behind it. The doorbell buzzes and neighbor tells him to keep down the racket. Then the power goes out.\n\nOn day 10 Danny requests razor wire and cutters from the doorman. Danny explains that he thinks the landlord stole his cat and cut his power. He turns on a light and the power is back on, but claims they are just messing with his head. He then sets up razor wire in his apartment as booby traps. When he calls for Joe the doorman, a new doorman shows up, claiming that Joe is sick and Danny must leave the apartment.\n\nDanny now, set off by the loss of his cat and the doorman he knows, begins making crude weapons from things around the house.\n\nDay 11 opens with him on the couch surrounded with razor wire, holding a crude weapon made from a tennis racket. The power is off again. When the power comes back on he starts smashing a chair, making too much noise. Another buzz of the doorbell brings the police, telling him to keep down the racket. The police officer also asks what the smell in the apartment is. Danny answers that it is dinner. Danny re-enters the apartment and opens a casserole in the oven to find his pet cat, charred.\n\nDay 12 he calls his lawyer and gets no answer. So constructs another crude weapon of nails in a swinging door.  He stands in front of the door and flashes back to some better times, then sees his dead grandmother\u2019s face as she died and uses the swinging door weapon on himself. Later in the day, the doorbell buzzes and it\u2019s his lawyer telling him the court order came thRough and the apartment is finally his.\n\nThe movie ends with the son of the new tenants, finding the video blog camera hidden in a piano. The child watches the SD card which reveals that Danny was a sleepwalker, who murdered every person and animal that entered the apartment.\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.occupantmovie.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|1671582|Occupant}}\n*[http://www.gsiff.com/content/occupant/ Occupant at the Gotham Screen Film Festival 2011]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Occupant}}\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=September 2018}}\n{{update|date=September 2018}}\n}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Occupant\n| image          =\n| alt            = <!-- see WP:ALT -->\n| caption        = Occupant Movie Poster at GSIFF\n| director       = Henry S.
