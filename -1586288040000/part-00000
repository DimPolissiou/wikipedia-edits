If instead one considers the normal, metallic state at the same finite magnetic field, then the Zeeman energy leads to different [[Fermi surface]]s for spin-up and spin-down electrons, which can lead to superconducting pairing where Cooper pair singlets are formed with a finite center-of-mass momentum '''q''', corresponding to the displacement of the two Fermi surfaces.\nA non-vanishing pairing momentum leads to a spatially modulated order parameter with wave vector '''q'''.<ref name=\"Shimahara\" />\n\n== Experiment ==\nFor the FFLO phase to appear, it is required that [[Pauli paramagnetic pair-breaking]] is the relevant mechanism to suppress superconductivity ([[Pauli limiting field]], also [[Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit]]). In particular, orbital pair breaking (when the [[Abrikosov vortex|vortices]] induced by the magnetic field overlap in space) has to be weaker, which is not the case for most conventional superconductors. Certain unusual [[Superconductivity|superconductors]], on the other hand, may favor Pauli pair breaking: materials with large [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective electron mass]] or layered materials (with quasi-two-dimensional electrical conduction).<ref name=\"Matsuda\" />\n\n=== Heavy-fermion superconductors ===\n[[Heavy fermion superconductor|Heavy-fermion superconductivity]] is caused by electrons with a drastically enhanced effective mass (the [[heavy fermion]]s, also heavy quasiparticles), which suppresses orbital pair breaking.

If instead one considers the normal, metallic state at the same finite magnetic field, then the Zeeman energy leads to different [[Fermi surface]]s for spin-up and spin-down electrons, which can lead to superconducting pairing where Cooper pair singlets are formed with a finite center-of-mass momentum '''q''', corresponding to the displacement of the two Fermi surfaces.\nA non-vanishing pairing momentum leads to a spatially modulated order parameter with wave vector '''q'''.<ref name=\"Shimahara\" />\n\n== Experiment ==\nFor the FFLO phase to appear, it is required that [[Pauli paramagnetic pair-breaking]] is the relevant mechanism to suppress superconductivity ([[Pauli limiting field]], also [[Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit]]). In particular, orbital pair breaking (when the [[Abrikosov vortex|vortices]] induced by the magnetic field overlap in space) has to be weaker, which is not the case for most conventional superconductors. Certain unusual [[Superconductivity|superconductors]], on the other hand, may favor Pauli pair breaking: materials with large [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective electron mass]] or layered materials (with quasi-two-dimensional electrical conduction).<ref name=\"Matsuda\" />\n\n=== Heavy-fermion superconductors ===\n[[Heavy fermion superconductor|Heavy-fermion superconductivity]] is caused by electrons with a drastically enhanced effective mass (the [[heavy fermion]]s, also heavy quasiparticles), which suppresses orbital pair breaking. Furthermore, certain heavy-fermion superconductors, such as [[CeCoIn5|CeCoIn<sub>5</sub>]], have a layered crystal structure, with somewhat two-dimensional electronic transport properties.<ref name=\"Matsuda\" /> Indeed, in [[CeCoIn5|CeCoIn<sub>5</sub>]] there is thermodynamic evidence for the existence of an unconventional low temperature phase within the superconducting state.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Radovan|first1=H.

At the age of 19 he entered the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]], where he studied with [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]], [[Jules Massenet]], [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]], and [[Albert Lavignac]]. In 1900 he won the [[Prix de Rome]]. During the 1890s he became friendly with [[Frederick Delius]], who was living in Paris at the time, and Schmitt prepared vocal scores for four of Delius's operas: ''[[Irmelin]]'', ''The Magic Fountain'', ''[[Koanga]]'' and ''[[A Village Romeo and Juliet]]''.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1939 Schmitt worked as a music critic for ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', where he proved controversial. He was known to shout out his views from his seat in the hall. The music publisher Heugel called him \"an irresponsible lunatic\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/Jun02/Schmitt.htm |title=Florent Schmitt in Oxford Music Online for a full biography and list of works|author=Leslie De'Ath |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref> In November 1933, at a concert that included music by [[Kurt Weill]], who had just been forced to leave Germany and was present, Schmitt led a group in shouting \"Vive Hitler!\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schebera|first1=J\u00fcrgen|title=Kurt Weill: An Illustrated Life|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZ1QE3ehnEIC&pg=PA221&|accessdate=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1914-15, Portrait de Florent Schmitt (Le Pianiste), pastel, 36 x 27 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1914\u201315, ''Portrait de Florent Schmitt'' (''Le Pianiste''), pastel, 36 x 27&nbsp;cm. Study for an oil on canvas titled ''Portrait de Florent Schmitt'', 1914\u201315, 200 x 152&nbsp;cm]]\nSchmitt wrote 138 works with [[opus number]]s. He composed examples of most of the major forms of music, except for [[opera]]. His [[piano quintet]] in B minor, written in 1908, helped establish his reputation. Other works include a [[violin sonata]] (''Sonate Libre''), a late [[string quartet]], a saxophone quartet,<ref>''\"Florent Schmitt\", in ''[[Adolphe Sax|Sax]], [[Marcel Mule|Mule]] & Co'', [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], Paris: H & D, 2004, pp. 175-176</ref> ''Dionysiaques'' for [[wind band]], two [[symphony|symphonies]] as well as several piano cycles such as ''Cr\u00e9puscules'', ''Ombres'' and ''Mirages''.\n\nHe was part of the group known as [[Les Apaches]]. His own style, recognizably impressionistic, owed something to the example of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], though it had distinct traces of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]] also.\n\nIn 1907 Schmitt composed a ballet, ''La trag\u00e9die de Salom\u00e9'', to a commission from [[Jacques Rouch\u00e9]] for [[Loie Fuller]] and the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre H\u00e9bertot|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Arts]]. The original ballet score required twenty instruments and lasted about an hour, In 1910 Schmitt prepared a suite using several of the ballet's movement, half as long as the ballet score, for a much expanded orchestra. The suite is much better-known, with recordings conducted by Schmitt himself, [[Paul Paray]], [[Jean Martinon]], [[Antonio de Almeida (conductor)|Antonio de Almeida]], [[Marek Janowski]] and others. There is also a recording of the 1907 original score under [[Patrick Davin]] on the Marco Polo label. The rhythmic syncopations, polyrhythms, percussively treated chords, bitonality, and scoring of Schmitt's work anticipate [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''. While composing ''The Rite of Spring'', Stravinsky acknowledged that Schmitt's ballet gave him greater joy than any work he had heard in a long time, but the two composers fell out with each other in later years, and Stravinsky reversed his opinion of Schmitt's works.\n\nSchmitt was one of the ten French composers who each, in 1927, contributed a dance for the children's ballet ''[[L'\u00e9ventail de Jeanne]]''. Schmitt wrote the finale, a ''Kermesse-Valse''.\n\nOther works include the suite for orchestra \"Oriane et le Prince d'Amour\" op. 83 bis (1934), the symphonic diptych to the memory of Gabriel Faure \"In Memoriam\" op. 72 (1937), the \"Ronde Burlesque\" op. 78 (1927), the \"Legende pour alto et orchestre\" op. 66 (1918), and the orchestral fresco \"Anthony and Cleopatra\" (1920).\n\n===Later life===\nThough he was one of the most often performed French composers during the first four decades of the 20th century, and although he never stopped composing, Schmitt's works fell into comparative neglect. In 1952 he was admitted to the ''[[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]''.\n\nSchmitt's early career was later re-examined in association with [[Sir]] [[Thomas Beecham]]'s [[biography]] of [[English people|English]] [[composer]] [[Frederick Delius]].<ref name=\"Beecham_a\">[[Thomas Beecham|Beecham, Thomas]].

Schmitt was probably the last to remember ''Le grand Anglais'' of the [[Latin Quarter]], as Delius had been known.<ref name=\"Aprahamian_a\" />\n\nIn 1956, Aprahamian arranged for Schmitt to meet Sir Thomas in [[England]]. On the occasion of his visit, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] telephoned to say that he had not met Florent Schmitt since before the [[First World War]], when he had been a pupil of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]\u2019s in Paris, and would like to see him. This precipitated a reunion of the two composers after a half-century. Afterwards, Schmitt travelled with Aprahamian to the [[Abbey Road Studios]] where Sir Thomas was then engaged in a recording project.<ref name=\"Aprahamian_a\" />\n\nAlthough it had been his express wish to interview him, all Sir Thomas could do was to greet Schmitt briefly, shake him by the hand, and pass on down the corridor. Schmitt brushed off the encounter casually saying, \"Il \u00e9tait toujours un homme curieux.\" Two years later, when Aprahamian saw Schmitt again, at the 1958 [[Strasbourg Music Festival]], he (Schmitt) was already seriously ill.

He was part of the group known as [[Les Apaches]].

At the age of 19 he entered the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]], where he studied with [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]], [[Jules Massenet]], [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]], and [[Albert Lavignac]]. In 1900 he won the [[Prix de Rome]]. During the 1890s he became friendly with [[Frederick Delius]], who was living in Paris at the time, and Schmitt prepared vocal scores for four of Delius's operas: ''[[Irmelin]]'', ''The Magic Fountain'', ''[[Koanga]]'' and ''[[A Village Romeo and Juliet]]''.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1939 Schmitt worked as a music critic for ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', where he proved controversial. He was known to shout out his views from his seat in the hall. The music publisher Heugel called him \"an irresponsible lunatic\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/Jun02/Schmitt.htm |title=Florent Schmitt in Oxford Music Online for a full biography and list of works|author=Leslie De'Ath |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref> In November 1933, at a concert that included music by [[Kurt Weill]], who had just been forced to leave Germany and was present, Schmitt led a group in shouting \"Vive Hitler!\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schebera|first1=J\u00fcrgen|title=Kurt Weill: An Illustrated Life|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZ1QE3ehnEIC&pg=PA221&|accessdate=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1914-15, Portrait de Florent Schmitt (Le Pianiste), pastel, 36 x 27 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1914\u201315, ''Portrait de Florent Schmitt'' (''Le Pianiste''), pastel, 36 x 27&nbsp;cm. Study for an oil on canvas titled ''Portrait de Florent Schmitt'', 1914\u201315, 200 x 152&nbsp;cm]]\nSchmitt wrote 138 works with [[opus number]]s. He composed examples of most of the major forms of music, except for [[opera]]. His [[piano quintet]] in B minor, written in 1908, helped establish his reputation. Other works include a [[violin sonata]] (''Sonate Libre''), a late [[string quartet]], a saxophone quartet,<ref>''\"Florent Schmitt\", in ''[[Adolphe Sax|Sax]], [[Marcel Mule|Mule]] & Co'', [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], Paris: H & D, 2004, pp. 175-176</ref> ''Dionysiaques'' for [[wind band]], two [[symphony|symphonies]] as well as several piano cycles such as ''Cr\u00e9puscules'', ''Ombres'' and ''Mirages''.\n\nHe was part of the group known as [[Les Apaches]]. His own style, recognizably impressionistic, owed something to the example of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], though it had distinct traces of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]] also.\n\nIn 1907 Schmitt composed a ballet, ''La trag\u00e9die de Salom\u00e9'', to a commission from [[Jacques Rouch\u00e9]] for [[Loie Fuller]] and the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre H\u00e9bertot|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Arts]]. The original ballet score required twenty instruments and lasted about an hour, In 1910 Schmitt prepared a suite using several of the ballet's movement, half as long as the ballet score, for a much expanded orchestra. The suite is much better-known, with recordings conducted by Schmitt himself, [[Paul Paray]], [[Jean Martinon]], [[Antonio de Almeida (conductor)|Antonio de Almeida]], [[Marek Janowski]] and others. There is also a recording of the 1907 original score under [[Patrick Davin]] on the Marco Polo label. The rhythmic syncopations, polyrhythms, percussively treated chords, bitonality, and scoring of Schmitt's work anticipate [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''. While composing ''The Rite of Spring'', Stravinsky acknowledged that Schmitt's ballet gave him greater joy than any work he had heard in a long time, but the two composers fell out with each other in later years, and Stravinsky reversed his opinion of Schmitt's works.\n\nSchmitt was one of the ten French composers who each, in 1927, contributed a dance for the children's ballet ''[[L'\u00e9ventail de Jeanne]]''. Schmitt wrote the finale, a ''Kermesse-Valse''.\n\nOther works include the suite for orchestra \"Oriane et le Prince d'Amour\" op. 83 bis (1934), the symphonic diptych to the memory of Gabriel Faure \"In Memoriam\" op. 72 (1937), the \"Ronde Burlesque\" op. 78 (1927), the \"Legende pour alto et orchestre\" op. 66 (1918), and the orchestral fresco \"Anthony and Cleopatra\" (1920).\n\n===Later life===\nThough he was one of the most often performed French composers during the first four decades of the 20th century, and although he never stopped composing, Schmitt's works fell into comparative neglect. In 1952 he was admitted to the ''[[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]''.\n\nSchmitt's early career was later re-examined in association with [[Sir]] [[Thomas Beecham]]'s [[biography]] of [[English people|English]] [[composer]] [[Frederick Delius]].<ref name=\"Beecham_a\">[[Thomas Beecham|Beecham, Thomas]].

Schmitt was probably the last to remember ''Le grand Anglais'' of the [[Latin Quarter]], as Delius had been known.<ref name=\"Aprahamian_a\" />\n\nIn 1956, Aprahamian arranged for Schmitt to meet Sir Thomas in [[England]]. On the occasion of his visit, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] telephoned to say that he had not met Florent Schmitt since before the [[First World War]], when he had been a pupil of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]\u2019s in Paris, and would like to see him. This precipitated a reunion of the two composers after a half-century. Afterwards, Schmitt travelled with Aprahamian to the [[Abbey Road Studios]] where Sir Thomas was then engaged in a recording project.<ref name=\"Aprahamian_a\" />\n\nAlthough it had been his express wish to interview him, all Sir Thomas could do was to greet Schmitt briefly, shake him by the hand, and pass on down the corridor. Schmitt brushed off the encounter casually saying, \"Il \u00e9tait toujours un homme curieux.\" Two years later, when Aprahamian saw Schmitt again, at the 1958 [[Strasbourg Music Festival]], he (Schmitt) was already seriously ill.

Depletion accounting factors in several different influences such as the number of years until resource exhaustion, the cost of resource extraction and the demand of the resource.<ref name=\":5\" /> Resource extraction industries make up a large part of the economic activity in developing countries. This, in turn, leads to higher levels of resource depletion and environmental degradation in developing countries.<ref name=\":5\" /> Theorists argue that implementation of resource depletion accounting is necessary in developing countries.

Environmentalists are interested in depletion accounting as a way to track the use of natural resources over time, hold governments accountable or to compare their environmental conditions to those of another country.<ref name=\":9\" /> Economists want to measure resource depletion to understand how financially reliant countries or corporations are on non-renewable resources, whether this use can be sustained and the financial drawbacks of switching to renewable resources in light of the depleting resources.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Issues  ===\nDepletion accounting is complex to implement as nature is not as quantifiable like cars, houses or bread.<ref name=\":9\" /> For depletion accounting to work, appropriate units of natural resources must be established so that natural resources can be viable in the market economy. The main issues that arise when trying to do so are, determining a suitable unit of account, deciding how to deal with \"collective\" nature of a complete ecosystem, delineating the borderline of the ecosystem and defining the extent of possible duplication when the resource interacts in more than one ecosystem.<ref name=\":9\" /> Some economists want to include measurement of the benefits arising from public goods provided by nature, but currently there are no market indicators of value.<ref name=\":9\" /> Globally, environmental economics has not been able to provide a consensus of measurement units of nature's services.\n\n== Minerals depletion ==\n{{Main|Peak minerals}}\n\nMinerals are needed to provide food, clothing, and housing.

As peaking is approached, liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically, and, without timely mitigation, the social, economic and political costs will be unprecedented.

As a result of deforestation, presently about one half of the forests that once covered Earth have been destroyed.<ref>\"Global Deforestation\". Global Change Curriculum. University of Michigan Global Change Program. January 4, 2006</ref> It occurs for many different reasons, and it has several negative implications on the atmosphere and the quality of the land in and surrounding the forest.\n[[File:Deforestation 2074483b.jpg|thumb|313x313px|[[Deforestation]] is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land, the wood is harvested as a resource for production of consumer products and firewood for heat. The land then either left to recover and then will be replanted or is converted to non-forest land used as agricultural land or development of urban areas. ]]\n\n=== Causes ===\nOne of the main causes of deforestation is clearing forests for [[agricultural]] reasons. As the population of developing areas, especially near [[rainforest]]s, increases, the need for land for farming becomes more and more important.<ref>Butler, Rhett A. \"Impact of Population and Poverty on Rainforests\". Mongabay.com / A Place Out of Time: Tropical Rainforests and the Perils They Face. Retrieved May 13, 2009.</ref> For most people, a forest has no value when its resources are not being used, so the incentives to deforest these areas outweigh the incentives to preserve the forests.

It is estimated that 80% of the world's known biodiversity lives in the rainforests, and the destruction of these rainforests is accelerating [[extinction]] at an alarming rate.<ref>[http://www.actionbioscience.org/environment/nilsson.html Do We Have Enough Forests?

The 2005 [[Hirsch report]] concluded that the decreased supply combined with increasing demand will significantly increase the worldwide prices of petroleum derived products, and that most significant will be the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation.\n\nThe Hirsch report, funded by [[United States Department of Energy]], concluded that \u201cThe peaking of world oil production presents the U. S. and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem. As peaking is approached, liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically, and, without timely mitigation, the social, economic and political costs will be unprecedented. Viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides, but to have substantial impact, they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking.\u201d<ref>[http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/others/pdf/Oil_Peaking_NETL.pdf DOE Hirsch Report]</ref>\n\n== Deforestation ==\n{{Main|Deforestation}}\n\n[[Deforestation]] is the clearing of [[forest]]s by [[cutting]] or burning of trees and plants in a forested area. As a result of deforestation, presently about one half of the forests that once covered Earth have been destroyed.<ref>\"Global Deforestation\". Global Change Curriculum. University of Michigan Global Change Program. January 4, 2006</ref> It occurs for many different reasons, and it has several negative implications on the atmosphere and the quality of the land in and surrounding the forest.\n[[File:Deforestation 2074483b.jpg|thumb|313x313px|[[Deforestation]] is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land, the wood is harvested as a resource for production of consumer products and firewood for heat. The land then either left to recover and then will be replanted or is converted to non-forest land used as agricultural land or development of urban areas. ]]\n\n=== Causes ===\nOne of the main causes of deforestation is clearing forests for [[agricultural]] reasons. As the population of developing areas, especially near [[rainforest]]s, increases, the need for land for farming becomes more and more important.<ref>Butler, Rhett A. \"Impact of Population and Poverty on Rainforests\". Mongabay.com / A Place Out of Time: Tropical Rainforests and the Perils They Face. Retrieved May 13, 2009.</ref> For most people, a forest has no value when its resources are not being used, so the incentives to deforest these areas outweigh the incentives to preserve the forests. For this reason, the economic value of the forests is very important for the [[developing countries]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = David W | year = 2001 | title = The Economic Value of Forest Ecosystems | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fbfbe2850c71eb61489ad4717ac0d124e3dac779| journal = Ecosystem Health | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 284\u2013296 | doi=10.1046/j.1526-0992.2001.01037.x}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nBecause deforestation is so extensive, it has made several significant impacts on the environment, including:\n\n* [[Carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere\n* Changing the [[water cycle]]\n* An increase in [[soil erosion]]\n* A decrease in [[biodiversity]]\n\n[[Deforestation and global warming|Deforestation is often cited as a contributor to global warming]]. Because trees and plants remove carbon dioxide and emit oxygen into the atmosphere, the reduction of forests contribute to about 12% of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide emissions]].<ref>G. R. van der Werf, D. C. Morton, R. S. DeFries, J. G. J. Olivier, P. S. Kasibhatla, R. B. Jackson, G. J. Collatz and J .T. Randerson, CO2 emissions from forest loss, ''Nature Geoscience'', Volume 2 (November 2009) pp. 737\u2013738</ref> One of the most pressing issues that deforestation creates is soil erosion. The removal of trees causes higher rates of erosion, increasing risks of [[landslide]]s, which is a direct threat to many people living close to deforested areas. As forests get destroyed, so does the [[habitat destruction|habitat]] for millions of animals. It is estimated that 80% of the world\u2019s known biodiversity lives in the rainforests, and the destruction of these rainforests is accelerating [[extinction]] at an alarming rate.<ref>[http://www.actionbioscience.org/environment/nilsson.html Do We Have Enough Forests? By Sten Nilsson]</ref>\n\n=== Controlling deforestation ===\nThe [[United Nations]] and the [[World Bank]] created programs such as [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (REDD), which works especially with developing countries to use subsidies or other incentives to encourage citizens to use the forest in a more sustainable way.<ref>\"Copenhagen Accord of 18 December 2009\". UNFCC. 2009.

It is also noted for its [[carillon]], which is the largest in northern Europe and plays melodies every hour from 8 am to midnight.\n\n==History==\nWhen [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] planned [[Christianshavn]] in 1617, it was intended as an independent merchant's town on the island of [[Amager]] and it therefore needed a church. A temporary church was inaugurated in 1639 but construction of the present Church of Our Saviour, the design of [[Lambert van Haven]], did not start until 1682. The church was inaugurated 14 years later in 1695 but important interior features like the altar had a notoriously temporary character and the tower still had no spire. The church got its permanent altar in 1732 but plans for construction of the spire was not revitalized until 1747 under the reign of [[Frederick V of Denmark|Frederik V]]. The new architect on the project was [[Lauritz de Thurah]]. He soon abandoned van Haven's original design in favour of his own project that was approved by the King in 1749. Three years later the spire was finished and the King climbed the tower at a ceremony on 28 August 1752.\n\n===Urban legend===\nThere is a long-lived [[urban legend]] stating that the architect killed himself by jumping from the top of the spire, when he realised that the spiral turns the wrong way - [[clockwise|anticlockwise]] -  around. This is not about Lambert van Haven, since the spire was added to the church almost 50 years after his death, but the designer of the spiral spire, [[Lauritz de Thurah|Laurids de Thurah]]. There is no truth in the myth though, since Thurah died in his bed seven years after the spire was completed, and there is nothing in the records that indicates that he should have been unhappy with his work in any way.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe church is built in a [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch baroque]] style and its basic layout is a [[Cross#As emblems and symbols|Greek cross]]. The walls rest on a [[granite]] foundation and are made of red and yellow [[tile]]s but in a random pattern unlike what is seen in Christian IV's buildings where they are generally systematically arranged. The facade is segmented by [[pilaster]]s in the [[Palladian architecture|palladian]] [[giant order]], that is they continue in the building's entire height. The pilasters are of the [[Tuscan order]] with [[stylobate|bases]] and [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s in [[sandstone]]. The [[cornice]] is also in sandstone but with a [[frieze]] in tiles. Between the pilasters are tall [[arch|round-arched]] windows with clear glass and iron [[came]]s. There are entrances at the [[gable]] of the cross arms except for the eastern gable where the [[sacristy]] is added. The main entrance is in the western gable below the tower and has a sandstone portal. All entrances are raised four steps from street level. At each side of the tower, there is a gate at street level leading to the two [[crypt]]s of the church. The roof is vaulted and covered in [[Ceramic glaze|black-glazed]] tiles.\n\n===Interior===\n\n===Tessin's altarpiece===\n[[Image:Vor Frelsers Kirke Copenhagen altar.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Tessin's altarpiece]]\nThe altarpiece is the work of [[Nicodemus Tessin the Younger|Nicodemus Tessin]] and is considered{{By whom|date=October 2009}} a masterpiece. It depicts a scene from the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] between two columns, where Jesus is comforted by an angel while another angel hangs in the air beside them, carrying the golden [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]]. On each side, two figures of [[Pietas]] and [[Justitia]] illustrate the King's [[motto]]. The two columns carry a broken, curved [[architrave]] and gable. Behind the opening of the broken gable is placed a pane with [[Tetragrammaton|Jahve]]'s name in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] inscribed and lit from behind. Around the pane is an arrangement of gilded [[beans]] and cloud formations.\n\n===Organ===\n[[Image:Vor Frelsers Kirke Copenhagen organ.jpg|right|thumb|120px|The organ facade]]The huge [[organ (music)|organ]] with Christian V\u2019s gilded [[monogram]] was built by the Botzen Brothers from 1698-1700 and is mounted on the wall and supported by two [[elephant]]s. The organ has more than 4000 [[pipe organ|pipe]]s with the original [[Zimbelstern|cymbelstern]] tinkling in the background during a special part of a music piece, and the entire instrument produces the sound that was heard in the church over 300 years ago. The church arranges 15-20 concerts every year together with musical church services on Sundays. The last rebuilding of the organ was in 1965, reusing older pipe work and this instrument is equipped with 57 stops spread over 4 manuals and pedals. The facade of the organ has intricate wood carvings and a bust of Christian V in the centre.\n\n==Tower==\nThe tower is raised three stories above the western cross arm. The levels are marked by sandstone cornices that become larger with height, and there are round-arched openings on all four sides at each level. The top level is decorated with flat pilasters and from the uppermost cornice has a [[gilding|gilded]] penetrated [[clock face]] centrally on each side. The hands are connected to a [[clockwork]] inside the tower.\n\n===Spire===\n[[Image:Church spire, Christianshavn, Copenhagen (30191066057).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Thurah's corkscrew spire]]The black and golden spire reaches a height of 90 metres and the external staircase turns four times [[anticlockwise|counterclockwise]] around it. Inspiration for the design came from the spiral lantern of [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]], which turns the same way around.\n\nIt is built as a [[timber framing|timber-framed]] structure, [[octagon]]al at its base, with round-arched openings and round windows with gilded frames. The windows are flanked by gilded pilasters in the [[composite order]]. Around the octagonal base of the spire on the four corners of the square tower, stand four statues of the [[four evangelists]]. The octagonal structure is topped by a small platform with a gilded [[Handrail|railing]] and it is from this point that the staircase become external. There is a total number of 400 steps to the top of the spire, the last 150 being outside.\n\nThe spire is topped by a vase-like structure, carrying a gilded globe with a 4-meter-tall figure of Christ Triumphant carrying a [[banner]]. It has an infamous reputation for being the ugliest sculpture in Copenhagen but is intentionally made with exaggerated proportions because it is only meant to be seen from long distances.\n\n===Views===\n{{panoViewer|Vor Frelsers Kirke (Kopenhagen) \u2013 360\u00b0 panorama from the top.jpg|360\u00b0-panorama from the top.}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"170px\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Vor Frelsers Kirke - Christiansborg view.jpg|View towards [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] and the [[Danmarks Nationalbank|National Bank]]\nFile:Vor Frelsers Kirke-view6.jpg|View towards [[Kl\u00f8vermarken]] and [[Amager]]\nFile:Christianshavns Kanal and Wilders Plads from above.jpg|View of [[Christianshavns Kanal|Christianshavn Canal]] and [[Wilders Plads]]\nFile:Vor Frelsers Kirke-view3.jpg|The entrance to [[Port of Copenhagen|Copenhagen Harbour]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Carillon===\nThe tower of the church is equipped with a concert [[carillon]] from 1928 that was rebuilt in 1980 and consists of 48 bronze carillon bells that have a musical range of four octaves, making it the largest carillon in Northern Europe. The largest bells weigh over 2,000 kilograms and the smallest 10 kilograms. In total, the carillon weighs almost 12 tonnes, and chimes every hour over Christianshavn with different hymn compositions. The church established the first full-time carillon performance position in Denmark in 1983, and carillonneur [[Ulla Laage]] held the position until 2006.\n\n==Grounds==\nThe grounds of the church are surrounded by a fence and contains the remains of the church's graveyard.

It is also noted for its [[carillon]], which is the largest in northern Europe and plays melodies every hour from 8 am to midnight.\n\n==History==\nWhen [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] planned [[Christianshavn]] in 1617, it was intended as an independent merchant's town on the island of [[Amager]] and it therefore needed a church. A temporary church was inaugurated in 1639 but construction of the present Church of Our Saviour, the design of [[Lambert van Haven]], did not start until 1682. The church was inaugurated 14 years later in 1695 but important interior features like the altar had a notoriously temporary character and the tower still had no spire. The church got its permanent altar in 1732 but plans for construction of the spire was not revitalized until 1747 under the reign of [[Frederick V of Denmark|Frederik V]]. The new architect on the project was [[Lauritz de Thurah]]. He soon abandoned van Haven's original design in favour of his own project that was approved by the King in 1749. Three years later the spire was finished and the King climbed the tower at a ceremony on 28 August 1752.\n\n===Urban legend===\nThere is a long-lived [[urban legend]] stating that the architect killed himself by jumping from the top of the spire, when he realised that the spiral turns the wrong way - [[clockwise|anticlockwise]] -  around. This is not about Lambert van Haven, since the spire was added to the church almost 50 years after his death, but the designer of the spiral spire, [[Lauritz de Thurah|Laurids de Thurah]]. There is no truth in the myth though, since Thurah died in his bed seven years after the spire was completed, and there is nothing in the records that indicates that he should have been unhappy with his work in any way.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe church is built in a [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch baroque]] style and its basic layout is a [[Cross#As emblems and symbols|Greek cross]]. The walls rest on a [[granite]] foundation and are made of red and yellow [[tile]]s but in a random pattern unlike what is seen in Christian IV's buildings where they are generally systematically arranged. The facade is segmented by [[pilaster]]s in the [[Palladian architecture|palladian]] [[giant order]], that is they continue in the building's entire height. The pilasters are of the [[Tuscan order]] with [[stylobate|bases]] and [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s in [[sandstone]]. The [[cornice]] is also in sandstone but with a [[frieze]] in tiles. Between the pilasters are tall [[arch|round-arched]] windows with clear glass and iron [[came]]s. There are entrances at the [[gable]] of the cross arms except for the eastern gable where the [[sacristy]] is added. The main entrance is in the western gable below the tower and has a sandstone portal. All entrances are raised four steps from street level. At each side of the tower, there is a gate at street level leading to the two [[crypt]]s of the church. The roof is vaulted and covered in [[Ceramic glaze|black-glazed]] tiles.\n\n===Interior===\n\n===Tessin's altarpiece===\n[[Image:Vor Frelsers Kirke Copenhagen altar.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Tessin's altarpiece]]\nThe altarpiece is the work of [[Nicodemus Tessin the Younger|Nicodemus Tessin]] and is considered{{By whom|date=October 2009}} a masterpiece. It depicts a scene from the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] between two columns, where Jesus is comforted by an angel while another angel hangs in the air beside them, carrying the golden [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]]. On each side, two figures of [[Pietas]] and [[Justitia]] illustrate the King's [[motto]]. The two columns carry a broken, curved [[architrave]] and gable. Behind the opening of the broken gable is placed a pane with [[Tetragrammaton|Jahve]]'s name in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] inscribed and lit from behind. Around the pane is an arrangement of gilded [[beans]] and cloud formations.\n\n===Organ===\n[[Image:Vor Frelsers Kirke Copenhagen organ.jpg|right|thumb|120px|The organ facade]]The huge [[organ (music)|organ]] with Christian V\u2019s gilded [[monogram]] was built by the Botzen Brothers from 1698-1700 and is mounted on the wall and supported by two [[elephant]]s. The organ has more than 4000 [[pipe organ|pipe]]s with the original [[Zimbelstern|cymbelstern]] tinkling in the background during a special part of a music piece, and the entire instrument produces the sound that was heard in the church over 300 years ago. The church arranges 15-20 concerts every year together with musical church services on Sundays. The last rebuilding of the organ was in 1965, reusing older pipe work and this instrument is equipped with 57 stops spread over 4 manuals and pedals. The facade of the organ has intricate wood carvings and a bust of Christian V in the centre.\n\n==Tower==\nThe tower is raised three stories above the western cross arm. The levels are marked by sandstone cornices that become larger with height, and there are round-arched openings on all four sides at each level. The top level is decorated with flat pilasters and from the uppermost cornice has a [[gilding|gilded]] penetrated [[clock face]] centrally on each side. The hands are connected to a [[clockwork]] inside the tower.\n\n===Spire===\n[[Image:Church spire, Christianshavn, Copenhagen (30191066057).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Thurah's corkscrew spire]]The black and golden spire reaches a height of 90 metres and the external staircase turns four times [[anticlockwise|counterclockwise]] around it. Inspiration for the design came from the spiral lantern of [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]], which turns the same way around.\n\nIt is built as a [[timber framing|timber-framed]] structure, [[octagon]]al at its base, with round-arched openings and round windows with gilded frames. The windows are flanked by gilded pilasters in the [[composite order]]. Around the octagonal base of the spire on the four corners of the square tower, stand four statues of the [[four evangelists]]. The octagonal structure is topped by a small platform with a gilded [[Handrail|railing]] and it is from this point that the staircase become external. There is a total number of 400 steps to the top of the spire, the last 150 being outside.\n\nThe spire is topped by a vase-like structure, carrying a gilded globe with a 4-meter-tall figure of Christ Triumphant carrying a [[banner]]. It has an infamous reputation for being the ugliest sculpture in Copenhagen but is intentionally made with exaggerated proportions because it is only meant to be seen from long distances.\n\n===Views===\n{{panoViewer|Vor Frelsers Kirke (Kopenhagen) \u2013 360\u00b0 panorama from the top.jpg|360\u00b0-panorama from the top.}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"170px\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Vor Frelsers Kirke - Christiansborg view.jpg|View towards [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] and the [[Danmarks Nationalbank|National Bank]]\nFile:Vor Frelsers Kirke-view6.jpg|View towards [[Kl\u00f8vermarken]] and [[Amager]]\nFile:Christianshavns Kanal and Wilders Plads from above.jpg|View of [[Christianshavns Kanal|Christianshavn Canal]] and [[Wilders Plads]]\nFile:Vor Frelsers Kirke-view3.jpg|The entrance to [[Port of Copenhagen|Copenhagen Harbour]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Carillon===\nThe tower of the church is equipped with a concert [[carillon]] from 1928 that was rebuilt in 1980 and consists of 48 bronze carillon bells that have a musical range of four octaves, making it the largest carillon in Northern Europe. The largest bells weigh over 2,000 kilograms and the smallest 10 kilograms. In total, the carillon weighs almost 12 tonnes, and chimes every hour over Christianshavn with different hymn compositions. The church established the first full-time carillon performance position in Denmark in 1983, and carillonneur [[Ulla Laage]] held the position until 2006.\n\n==Grounds==\nThe grounds of the church are surrounded by a fence and contains the remains of the church's graveyard. The current of [[Our Saviour's Cemetery, Copenhagen|Our Saviour's Cemetery]] is located at the corner of [[Amagerbrogade]] and [[Prags Boulevard]] on [[Amager]], It was inaugurated in 1790.\n\n===Burials===\nBurials at the church include:\n* [[Andreas Bj\u00f8rn]] (1703\u20131750), merchant, shipowner and ship builder\n* [[Otto Fabricius]] (1744\u20131822), missionary, naturalist, ethnographer and explorer\n* [[Frederik Holmsted]]  (1683\u20131758), merchant and mayor of Copenhagen \n* [[Carl Viborg]] (1783\u20131844), veterinarian\n\n==Cultural connections==\nThe Church of Our Saviour in Christianshavn appears in a chapter of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[A Journey to the Center of the Earth]]''.
