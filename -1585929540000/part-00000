It was formerly known as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia or the Agricultural University of Malaysia. Now, UPM offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in most fields such as science, engineering, medicine, veterinary medicine, business and social science.\n\nIt was ranked as the 159th best university in the world in 2020 by [[Quacquarelli Symonds]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UPM QS World Ranking|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020|publisher=Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref> and it was ranked 34th in Best Asian Universities and the 2nd best university in Malaysia.\n\n== History ==\nThe School of Agriculture was officially instituted on 21 May 1931 by John Scott,<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.upm.edu.my/?aktvt=content&kat=D&kod=20060424114103210172165493|title=UPM History|date=1 October 2007|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=25 June 2008}}</ref> an administrative officer of the British colonial [[Straits Settlements]]. The school was on a 22-acre piece of land in Serdang and offered two programmes: a three-year diploma programme and a one-year certificate course in Agriculture.\n\nIn 1947, the school was declared the College of Agriculture Malaya by Sir [[Edward Gent]], the then Governor of the Malayan Union. The establishment of Universiti Pertanian Malaysia came about when the College of Agriculture in Serdang merged with the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Malaya. Dr. Mohd. Rashdan bin Haji Baba, the then principal of the College of Agriculture Malaya, was appointed as the first vice-chancellor by virtue of the provisions of Section 18 of the Universities and University Colleges Act, 1971. With the first intake of 1,559 students, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia had its first academic session in July 1973 in the three central faculties and one basic division: the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Forestry, Faculty of Agriculture, and a Division of Foundation Studies.\n\nIn the early 80s, UPM extended its area of studies to include the field of Science and Technology (S&T). In 1997, the name Universiti Pertanian Malaysia was changed to Universiti Putra Malaysia by Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammad, as a strategic gesture to portray the status of UPM as a centre of higher education capable of providing fields of studies, especially in science and information technology, which facilitate national development in the new millennium.<ref>{{cite web|title=UPM History|url=http://www.upm.edu.my/about_us/TheStoryBehindUPM?LANG=en|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe list of the Vice-Chancellor of Universiti Putra Malaysia. <ref>{{cite web|title=Previous UPM Vice-Chancellors|url=http://www.upm.edu.my/about_us/history/our_previous_vice_chancellors-8205|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''#'''\n!'''Vice-Chancellor'''\n! width=50% |'''Academic qualification'''\n! width=15% |'''Term in office'''\n|-\n| '''1''' \n| Professor Tan Sri Datuk Dr. [[Mohd Rashdan Baba]]\n| Diploma of Agriculture(Malaya Agriculture College), Bachelor of Agriculture Science(Reading, UK), PhD in Agriculture Science(Leeds, UK).\n| align=center |4 November 1971<br>\u2193<br>28 February 1982\n|-\n| '''2'''\n| Professor Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Dr. [[Nayan Ariffin]]\n| \n| align=center |1 March 1982<br>\u2193<br>4 June 1994\n|-\n| '''3''' \n| Professor Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Dr. [[Syed Jalaludin Syed Salim]]\n|\n| align=center |5 June 1994<br>\u2193<br>17 April 2001\n|-\n| '''4'''\n| Professor Dato\u2019 Ir.

Beginning with seven departments under this faculty, most of these departments were later developed to become other faculties.\n\nAt the end of 1998, the faculty had three academic departments \u2014 Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, Department of Plant Protection, and Department of Soil Science.\n\nBeginning from 1 January 1999, the restructuring process at Universiti Putra Malaysia involved the Faculty of Agriculture. The faculty now has six departments \u2014 Crop Science, Animal Science, Plant Protection, Land Management, Agribusiness and Information System, and Agriculture Technology.\n\nFaculty of Agriculture comprises seven main departments:\n\n# Department of Crop Science\n# Department of Plant Protection\n# Department of Land Management\n# Department of Animal Science\n# Department of Agribusiness and Information Systems\n# Department of Agriculture Technology\n# Department of Aquaculture\n\n===Faculty of Forestry===\n\nThe Faculty of Forestry<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Forestry|url=http://www.forr.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> is one of the founding faculties during the establishment of Universiti Putra Malaysia, formerly known as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia in 1971.\n\nFaculty of Forestry comprises three main departments and one section:\n\n# Department of Forest Management\n# Department of Forest Production\n# Department of Recreation and Eco-tourism\n# Forest & Plantation Section\n\n===Faculty of Veterinary Medicine===\n\nFaculty of Veterinary Medicine has six main departments:\n\n# Department of Veterinary Pathology & Microbiology\n# Department of Pre-Clinical Veterinary\n# Department of Veterinary Clinical Studies\n# Department of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnostics\n# Department of Medicine Companion Animal Surgery\n# Department of Medicine and Exotic & Farm Animal Surgery\n\n===Faculty of Economics and Management===\n\nThe Faculty of Economics and Management (FEP)<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Economics and Management|url=http://www.econ.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> (formerly known as the Faculty of Resource Economics and Agribusiness) was established in January 1974, as the fourth faculty in Universiti Putra Malaysia (formerly known as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia). It was established in response to the needs for competent professionals in the fields of agribusiness and resource economics.\n\nEver since its inception, FEP has grown in student intake, number of academic programs offered, research activities, and professional services. This is the first faculty in Malaysia gaining AACSB status. This accreditation is awarded to the Faculty of Economics and Management (FEP) and Putra Business School or PBS (formerly known as the Graduate School of Management or GSM).\n\nThe achievement of UPM and seven other international universities was announced by the President and Chief Executive Officer of AACSB International, John J. Fernandes at Tampa, Florida via www.aacsb.edu recently.\n\nTo cater to the education needs of working adults, FEP established Executive Program Unit (UPE) in 1997 by offering part-time programs to candidates with working experience in the public or private sector. This program has thus expanded through collaboration with Malaysian Airlines (MAS) Academy in 2000.\n\nThe same year, FEP established External Program Unit and Distance Learning Unit in 2001.\n\nFEP offers three bachelor-level programs: Bachelor of Accounting, Bachelor of Economics and Bachelor of Business Administration. At the graduate level, FEP offers Masters of Economics, Masters of Science and PhD in Economics.\n\nFaculty of Economics and Management comprises three main departments:\n\n# Department of Economics\n# Department of Management and Marketing\n# Department of Accounting and Finance\n\n===Faculty of Engineering===\n\nThe Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Engineering|url=http://www.eng.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> of Universiti Putra Malaysia was established on 1 January 1975 at the main Serdang Campus, some 22 kilometres to the south of Kuala Lumpur. It is one of the largest faculties at UPM with a student population of over 3000. The campus\u2019 location at the heart of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) provides the faculty with access to the array of IT and multimedia facilities available in the Corridor.\n\nThe eight academic departments housed in the faculty offer a similar number of Bachelor of Engineering degree programs. Out of 800 postgraduates, almost 50% are international students. In addition to providing facilities and opportunities for teaching and research, the faculty has established Research Centres in engineering and related fields.\n\nThe \"Centres of Excellence\" organise research and development programs, consultancy and professional training using expertise from disciplines in the university. The objective is to secure contracts from the public or private sectors to generate income for the faculty. Centers of Excellence have been established as listed below.\n* Road Safety Research Center (RSRC)\n* Housing Research Center (HRC)\n* Mountainous Terrain Development Research Center (MTDRC)\n* Centre of Excellence for Wireless and Photonic Network (WiPNET)\n* Centre of Excellence on Lightning Protection (CELP)\n\nThe Eighth Malaysia Plan ended in 2005 and, during its duration, most of the approved research projects were completed. Under the Ninth Malaysia Plan, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation offers three research grants: Technofund, Innofund, and Sciencefund.  In addition, the Ministry of Higher Education initiated the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme and UPM offers the Research University Grant Scheme.\n\nFaculty of Engineering comprises eight main departments:\n\n# Aerospace\n# Biological and Agricultural\n# Civil\n# Electric and Electronic\n# Chemical and Environment\n# Computer and Communication Systems\n# Mechanical and Manufacturing\n# Process and Food.\n\n===Faculty of Educational Studies===\n\nThe Faculty of Educational Studies<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Educational Studies|url=http://www.educ.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> serves to produce teachers who can teach at the secondary school level as well as professionals who are responsible for human resource development.

Its objective was to offer basic science courses required by other faculties in the university. In 1975, the status of the division was upgraded to a faculty and named the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies.\n\nSince then the faculty has set up the Department of Environmental Sciences and the Department of Computer Sciences which later were upgraded to form two new faculties and the transfer of the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology to the newly formed Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences. Ever since the restructuring, it was renamed as the Faculty of Science in 2004.\n\nFaculty of Science comprises four main departments and one centre:\n\n# Department of Biology\n# Department of Physics\n# Department of Chemistry\n# Department of Mathematics\n# Catalysis Science and Technology Research Centre (PutraCAT)\n\n===Faculty of Food Science and Technology===\n\nThe Faculty of Food Science and Technology<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Food Science and Technology|url=http://www.food.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> had its humble beginnings in 1976 with the establishment of the Department of Food Science and Technology under the Faculty of Agriculture. The establishment of the department is in line with the need of the country to fulfill the shortage of skilled employees in the field of science-based food. At that time, only one undergraduate program was offered: Bachelor of Food Science and Technology.\n\nOn 1 March 1982, the Department of Food Science and Technology was upgraded to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology. There were two departments under the faculty: Department of Food Technology and Department of Food Science. In 1986, the Faculty was renamed Faculty of Food Science and Biotechnology (FSMB) with the establishment of the Department of Biotechnology that offered the Bachelor of Science (Biotechnology) program with six modules: Plant Biotechnology, Molecular Biotechnology, Food Biotechnology, Industrial Biotechnology, Environmental Biotechnology, and Management.\n\nIn 1996, the faculty began offering the Bachelor of Science (Food Studies) program with two options: Food Quality Management and Food Management. In 1997 and 2000, the Food Service Administration and Food Marketing options were offered through the same program. On 1 August 2004, the faculty was renamed to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology when the Department of Biotechnology formed a separate faculty. In January 2005, the Department of Food Service and Management was established to strengthen the existing programs in the faculty. The faculty began offering the Bachelor of Science (Food Service Management) and Master of Food Technology in September 2012.\n\nFaculty of Food Science and Technology comprises three main departments:\n\n# Department of Food Science\n# Department of Food Technology\n# Department of Food Service and Management\n\n===Faculty of Human Ecology===\n\nThe Faculty of Human Ecology<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Human Ecology|url=http://www.eco1.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was officially established on 1 April {{Year missing|date=August 2017}} through the merger of the Department of Human Development Studies from the Faculty of Agriculture with the Department of Social Sciences from the Faculty of Educational Studies.

Both units were combined to form the Language Division in 1971 which was subsequently upgraded into the Language Department in 1972 and was placed under the Faculty of Agriculture.\n\nOn 15 January 1975, the Language Department was placed in the Faculty of Educational Studies. On 4 January 1995, the Language Department was upgraded to the Faculty of Language Studies. On 1 January 1999, the Department of Development Communication (which was in the Faculty of Human Ecology) was transferred to the Faculty of Modern Languages as the Department of Communication. With this restructuring, the Faculty of Language Studies was renamed as the Faculty of Modern Languages and Communication (FBMK).\n\nCurrently, Faculty of Modern Languages & Communication comprises four main departments:\n\n# Department of Malay Language and Linguistics\n# Department of English Language\n# Department of Foreign Languages\n# Department of Communication\n\n===Faculty of Design & Architecture===\n\nThe idea to establish the Faculty of Design and Architecture<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Design & Architecture|url=http://www.frsb.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> in UPM originated with a proposal paper titled \"Proposed Establishment of the Faculty of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture.\" It was submitted to the Faculty Agriculture in 1976. However, the proposal was never brought up for further consideration by the Faculty's administration. Nevertheless, a group of teaching staff in Landscape Architecture was recruited in 1980 to teach \"landscape subjects\" in the diploma and bachelor of agriculture programmes.\n\nThe first landscape course was offered in 1984. It was a three-credit course titled \"AGRO 472 \u2013 An Approach to Landscape Design\". It became popular and managed to attract many agricultural students who later graduated and continued their studies in landscape architecture at the undergraduate and graduate level overseas. Many of these early graduates have since returned and assumed successful practice or became professors at institutions of higher learning.\n\nIn 1991, the Faculty of Engineering, UPM proposed to offer the Architecture programme in UPM. However, the idea never materialised until the Faculty of Agriculture was given the task by the university's management to look into the feasibility of offering landscape architecture and architecture in UPM. A committee was formed in the Faculty of Agriculture 1994 and in 1995 a report was sent to the vice-chancellor proposing the setting up of a new faculty offering courses in design and the creative arts. With the strong support of the university's management the Faculty of Design and Architecture was approved by the University's Senate, Board of Directors and the Ministry of Education.\n\nThe new faculty was officially established on 26 June 1996 and began its operation with the offering of the Bachelor of Landscape Architecture and Master of Landscape Architecture programmes under the new Department of Landscape Architecture. Subsequently, the Department of Architecture was established in 1999 and the Department of Industrial Design in 2002. The faculty began with an enrolment of 40 students. Today, it has expanded rapidly offering five programmes with an enrolment of more than 400 students at the undergraduate, master and doctoral levels.\n\nFaculty of Design and Architecture comprises three main departments:\n\n# Landscape Architecture Department\n# Industrial Design Department\n# Architecture Department\n\n===Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences===\n\nThe Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences|url=http://www.medic.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was established on 1 August 1996 as a result of the merger between the Department of Biomedical of the Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Science with Nutrition and Community Health Department of the Faculty Human Ecology. Currently, there are 1,845 full-time students in the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.\n\nFMHS complex has many facilities which include administration building, library, lecture halls, tutorial rooms and laboratory. In addition, there are four blocks of students\u2019 hostels that can accommodate 2,000 students, student centre, food court, and mosque.\n\nFaculty of Medicine and Health Sciences comprises various departments:\n\n# Department of Medicine\n# Department of Community Health\n# Department of Science (Biomedical Sciences)\n# Department of Science (Dietetics)\n# Department of Science (Dietetics)\n# Department of Science (Nutrition and Community Health)\n# Department of Science (Environmental & Occupational Health)\n# Department of Nursing\n\n===Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology===\nIn October 1998, the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology|url=http://www.fsktm.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was officially established to meet the demands for additional academic programmes and to keep pace with rapid developments.

For example, there is long-term co-operation with the Department of Environment, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Housing, and local government, local authorities, and with international agencies such as the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS).\n\nFaculty of Environmental Studies has two main departments:\n\n# Department of Environmental Management\n# Department of Environmental Sciences\n\n===Faculty of Agriculture & Food Sciences===\n\n[[Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu Campus]] (UPMKB)<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Agriculture & Food Sciences (UPMKB)|url=http://www.btu.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> is the oldest campus in Sarawak. The history of Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu Sarawak Campus can be traced to 10 August 1974, when it was a temporary campus under the National Resources Training Centre in Semenggok, Kuching.\n\nThe campus relocated to its permanent site in Bintulu, Sarawak in June 1987. On 27 August 1987, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia Sarawak was officially established as a branch campus through the three centres of learning \u2014 Applied Sciences, Basic Sciences, and Social Sciences and Management.\n\nThree diploma level programs were on offer: the Diploma in Agriculture, Diploma in Forestry, and Diploma in Agribusiness programs, as well as an initiation program.\n\nUPM was closed temporarily in 1992 and was operational again in November 2001, based on UPM 2001-2010 third strategic plan which was to upgrade UPM into and international center for agriculture, bioresource studies and services. UPMKB's main focus is in agribio fields such as agriculture, forestry, fishery, livestock, food and environment.\n\nUPMKB is a branch campus of UPM with one faculty, the Faculty of Agriculture and Food Sciences. This faculty comprises five academic departments: Department of Crop\nScience, Department of Forestry Science, Department of Social Science, Department of Basic Science and Engineering, and Department of Animal Science and Fishery. The faculty offers Diploma, Bachelor, Master with thesis and PhD programmes.\n\nFaculty of Agriculture & Food Sciences (UPMKB) comprises five main departments:\n\n# Department of Crop Science\n# Department of Forestry Science\n# Department of Basic Science and Engineering\n# Department of Social Science\n# Department of Animal Science and Fishery\n\n==Institutes==\n\n===Institute of Bioscience===\nThe Institute of Bioscience (IBS),<ref>{{cite web|title=Institute of Bioscience|url=http://www.ibs.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> Universiti Putra Malaysia was established on 1 August 1996 and was the first research institute founded in UPM. IBS was established to boost research and development (R&D) and postgraduate training in fields of biological sciences. The emphasis on research was given to strengthen the scientific and technological capabilities of the country as well as to develop relevant human capital to support the Industrial and Agricultural Master Plan. Since its inception, IBS\u2019 areas of research have grown and it is gradually developing into a leading research centre in UPM.\n\nOver the past 17 years, the Institute of Bioscience has rearranged and developed the existing units into five laboratories. Each laboratory has two main functions, i.e., doing research and providing the Service and Facility Unit. The five laboratories are\n\n* Laboratory of Natural Products\n* Laboratory of Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics\n* Laboratory of Molecular Biomedicine\n* Laboratory of Biotechnology Marine\n* Laboratory of Cancer Research UPM-MAKNA\n\n===Institute of Advanced Technology===\n\nInstitute of Advanced Technology (ITMA),<ref>{{cite web|title=Institute of Advanced Technology (ITMA)|url=http://www.itma.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> Universiti Putra Malaysia was established in 1999 as an interdisciplinary advanced research institute.

It began operating on 1 April 2002 after its establishment was approved by the Division of Higher Education in November 2001. The institute is under the administration of UPM and is subjected to the regulations and stipulated in the statute on the establishment of institutes in UPM.\n\nThe main activities of INSPEM include planning, identifying and implementing research in Theoretical Studies, Applied and Computational Statistics, areas of Computational Sciences and Informatics and Innovational Methods in Education. The institute also serves as two-way channel between it and the public and private agencies through which research products can be channelled and problem requiring mathematical treatment can be received and examined at the institute.\n\nAt the same time it provides opportunities for collaborative research with agencies from inside and outside UPM. It is also a primary function of INSPEM to invite potential young researchers to carry out research that leads to postgraduate degrees.\n\nFour research laboratories have been formed, each led by a head of laboratory:\n\n* Laboratory of Theoretical Mathematics\n* Laboratory of Statistics and Applied Mathematics\n* Laboratory of Mathematical Sciences and Applications\n* Laboratory of Education and Mathematics Literacy\n\n===Halal Product Research Institute===\n\nEstablishment of Halal Food Institute as a research center is one of halal proactive measures to put UPM UPM as the leading center of excellence in agricultural education in the country. This establishment has submitted proposals to the management of the University in 2003 and was approved at the Management Committee Meeting University 110th on 26 and 31 March 2003. However, the establishment of this institute can not be implemented because of financial problems the university at the time. Therefore, Faculty of Food Science and Technology has taken the initiative to establish the Halal Food Unit in June 2003.\n\nIn August 2004, the Halal Food Unit in collaboration with Yayasan Dakwah Islamiah Malaysia (YADIM) has organised a \"Workshop on Global Halal Hub Development Malaysia\" in conjunction with the 1st Malaysian International Halal Showcase (Mihas) 2004. Resolution of the workshop titled \"Proposed Development of Halal Food Hub Global Malaysia\" was presented to the Honorable Prime Minister of Malaysia by Y.Bhg. Vice-Chancellor of the university in the opening MIHAS 2004 on 16 August 2004. Following this development, the Ministry of Higher Education has approved and agreed that UPM lead the national agricultural education center on 30 August 2004. To support this initiative, UPM has proposed the establishment of Halal Food Institute and has received approval from the Ministry of Higher Education on 1 June 2005. this initiative was implemented to help Malaysia to realise the aspiration to emerge as a global hub for halal food.\n\nFollowing the change in administration policy UPM, several workshops were held to address the future direction related issues RMK9 and strengthen the position of UPM as a research university. To enhance research excellence, UPM has held workshops directions from 25\u201327 May 2006 and has established eight universities and research focus areas Halal products have been placed as one of the focus areas.\n\nThus, on 1 July 2006, after UPM implement changes Basically, the name Halal Food Institute (IMH) was converted to Halal Products Research Institute (IPPH).<ref>{{cite web|title=Halal Product Research Institute (IPPH)|url=http://www.halal.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> This amendment is to broaden the scope of research IPPH beyond the scope of food and put some new research scope of consumables Muslims and Islamic business.

The establishment of this institute was the outcome of the restructuring and rationalisation process of institutes, academy, and centres in Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). This rationalisation process was implemented as a proactive and integrated effort taken to strengthen UPM status as a Research University (RU) and to become the center of excellence in agriculture education in Malaysia.\n\nIn line with UPM mission to have an efficient and effective administration structure via the lean and mean concept, the University has identified six new research clusters: Agriculture, Food, Forestry and Environment, Health, Social Science and Science, and Engineering and Technology to enhance research activities in UPM. In addition, UPM has identified eight specific research thrusts for each cluster, in line with the government's emphasis on the country's agriculture development agenda.\n\nThree of the eight identified thrusts \u2014 Food Crops, Plantation Crops and Animal Production \u2014 will be ITA's research focus.\n\n==Schools==\n\n===School Of Graduate Studies===\n\nThe School of Graduate Studies (SGS)<ref>{{cite web|title=School of Graduate Studies (SGS)|url=http://www.sgs.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> is a service and administrative centre established to assist postgraduate students in the processes involved from their registration at UPM up to the completion of their studies. SGS is the core support system which helps ease and enhance the postgraduate experience for UPM students, and plays a crucial role in fostering the relationship between UPM and its graduates.\n\nInitially set up as a Graduate Study Unit in 1978, SGS then proceeded to become a fully functioning Graduate School Office (GSO) in February 1993, to serve the growing population of postgraduate students at UPM. In March 2002, it continued to flourish as it was officially renamed the School of Graduate Studies (SGS) and was established as a service centre which had a status equivalent to a faculty at the university. This entailed its bigger role in the co-ordination of all postgraduate programmes and activities at UPM.\n\nIn its original inception, its key role also included an active involvement in research and development in postgraduate studies. In other words, SGS was conceptualised not only as a service centre to facilitate the general running of matters related to postgraduate students, but it was deemed to play a more active and crucial role in bolstering UPM's status as a research university.\n\nAmong its main roles as stated in the 1992 proposal for its establishment are:\n* To cultivate and nurture a research culture through efficient and effective management of postgraduate research activities\n* To help the university produce graduates who are knowledgeable and skilled to meet the nation's needs\n* To improve the quality of postgraduate programmes and therefore reduce the need for overseas postgraduate training\n* To increase the international student population and contribute to UPM's internationalisation through the intensification of publication and research training for staff.\n\n===Putra Business School===\n\nPutra Business School<ref>{{cite web|title=Putra Business School|url=http://putrabusinessschool.edu.my/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> \u2013 formerly the Graduate School of Management, in Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang.\n\nPUTRA became the first business programme in Malaysia to receive accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

This agreement is similar to agreements previously negotiated by the MOHE with Nottingham University and with Imperial College, London. The University of Melbourne is the only Australian university invited to participate in this initiative.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, Split PhD scholarships are being offered by the Malaysian universities to their academic staff to undertake PhD training at the University of Melbourne. These scholarships are in addition to the regular full-time scholarships for overseas study offered by the MOHE through Malaysian public universities.  The Split PhD scholarship enables the scholarship recipients to undertake the three year full-time University of Melbourne PhD degree over four years and candidates are expected to split their PhD study equally between The University of Melbourne and their respective Malaysian university.\n\nThe following seven Malaysian universities have been selected by the Malaysian Government to be involved in the Split-PhD and research collaboration initiative with the University of Melbourne:\n* Universiti Malaya (UM)\n* Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM)\n* Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)\n* International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM)\n* Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS)\n* Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS)\n* Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) <ref name=\"http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705235816/http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html |archive-date=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==University Agriculture Park==\nUniversity Agriculture Park (TPU)<ref>{{cite web|title=University Agriculture Park (TPU)|url=http://www.tpu.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was established on 1 December 2001 to facilitate in the teaching and research in agriculture related fields and also provide services for the students, staffs and the community.\n\nUniversity Agriculture Park was originally established as the Farm Division, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia in 1971 with its function then was to provide students with agriculture practical training and to give services to the campus community.\n\nIn 1998, Farm Division was restructured to become University Research Park, Universiti Putra Malaysia to facilitated research and services in agriculture.\n\n[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 01.jpg|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]<br />[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 02.JPG|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]<br />[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 03.JPG|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]\n\n== Ayer Hitam UPM Research Forest ==\nThe research forest is at the Ayer Hitam Reserved Forest, Puchong, with a space of 1,248 hectares. The forest is 20&nbsp;km from the capital city Kuala Lumpur and 10&nbsp;km from the main campus of Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) Serdang. The Selangor State Government gave the research forest in a long term agreement for 80 years beginning 1996 for the purpose of education and research. The forest is managed by the Selangor Forestry Department and Faculty of Forestry UPM  based on sustainable forest management. The Forest Management Plan for Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve is prepared by the faculty.\n\nThe forest area is the only well-managed Lowland Dipterocarp Forest in the Klang Valley. The facilities include a partially enclosed multipurpose hall, prayer room, kitchen, bathrooms, toilets and a playing field. The base camp can accommodate around 100 to 150 person at a time.\n\nThe forest is also used for teaching purposes in the field of forestry, wood science, and park and recreation management. There are field plots for research activities in silviculture, wildlife management, forest ecology, forest survey, forest engineering, and hydrology. The extension programmes include forestry, science, motivation, interpretation and ecological camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forr.upm.edu.my/eng/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150&Itemid=187|title=Faculty of Forestry|date=18 August 2011|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=18 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728104810/http://www.forr.upm.edu.my/eng/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150&Itemid=187|archive-date=28 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== UPM \u2013 Mitsubishi Corporation Forest Restoration Project ==\nThe Joint Research Project on Rehabilitation of Tropical Rainforest Ecosystem was initiated in July 1991 by Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and [[Yokohama National University]], Japan (YNU) with sponsorship from [[Mitsubishi Corporation]]. The project is based on the success of restoration of native forest land in Japan and results of some field surveys conducted in the forests of South East Asian countries since 1978. The scientific basis of the project is based on the concept of vegetation association by Prof. Akira Miyawaki from Yokohama National University.\n\nThe objectives of the project are to assess the health of rehabilitated forest through measuring the indicators of forest health and the sustainability of forest resources. The project conducts research in soil science, plant physiology, water science, biodiversity (terrestrial floral, wildlife, aquatic flora and fauna, insect and microbes) and in microclimatic conditions that indicate the health of the rehabilitated forest.\n\nThe project was initiated in UPM Bintulu campus Sarawak (Phase 1) at a 47.5 ha site. In 2010, 350,000 seedlings were planted representing 128 species native to Sarawak. In addition, 100 research plots were established in the rehabilitated area.\n\nIn July 2008, a new agreement between UPM and Mitsubishi Corporation was signed to establish a model planted forest of indigenous tree species in an urban setting at UPM main campus Serdang, Selangor. The second phase of the project was launched on 26 November 2008 covering an area of 27 hectares. To date 1,350,000 seedlings representing 136 species have been planted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forr2.upm.edu.my/frp/index.php|title=Faculty of Forestry|date=17 March 2012|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=17 March 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801095712/http://www.forr2.upm.edu.my/frp/index.php|archive-date=1 August 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Logo ==\n[[File:Official Logo of Universiti Putra Malaysia.png|thumb|Logo UPM]]\nThe logo is simple, yet eloquent. It embodies the tradition, philosophy and vision of the university.\n\nThe design of the logo is based on the shape of a shield, which traditionally symbolises strong principles, stability and preservation of knowledge for the good of mankind.\n\nThe water droplet symbolises the commitment of the university in preserving the environment. Water is also fundamental in life, as is knowledge in human development.\n\nThe thin lines represent electronic circuits, which symbolise the university's sophisticated approach in the era of information and knowledge. The three lines on the left and right are the symbols of branches, which depict the importance of agriculture. These lines also represent the three main functions of the university, which are teaching, research and services.\n\nIn addition, these lines symbolise the setting up of UPM with its three pioneering faculties: Agriculture, Forestry, and Veterinary and Animal Science.\n\nThe colour red symbolises the quest for knowledge. It also symbolises the pioneering spirit, courage and persistence in confronting challenges. The colour grey symbolises information technology, neutrality, versatility and consistency.\n\nThe combination of these colours represents harmony, stability, happiness, maturity and dynamics.\n\n==Rankings==\n\n===Quacquarelli Symonds===\n\n{| width=90% class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=8%  | Year\n! width=8% | Rank\n! width=25% | Valuer\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2012||align=\"center\"|360||align=\"center\" rowspan=\"8\" |  [[QS World University Rankings]]\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2014||align=\"center\"|411\u2014420\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2015||align=\"center\"|376\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2016||align=\"center\"|=331\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2017||align=\"center\"|270\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2018||align=\"center\"|229\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2019||align=\"center\"|202\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2020||align=\"center\"|159\n|}\n\n===UI-Greenmetric===\n\nIn 2019, Universiti Putra Malaysia is ranked 28th in the world.

The school was on a 22-acre piece of land in Serdang and offered two programmes: a three-year diploma programme and a one-year certificate course in Agriculture.\n\nIn 1947, the school was declared the College of Agriculture Malaya by Sir [[Edward Gent]], the then Governor of the Malayan Union. The establishment of Universiti Pertanian Malaysia came about when the College of Agriculture in Serdang merged with the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Malaya. Dr. Mohd. Rashdan bin Haji Baba, the then principal of the College of Agriculture Malaya, was appointed as the first vice-chancellor by virtue of the provisions of Section 18 of the Universities and University Colleges Act, 1971. With the first intake of 1,559 students, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia had its first academic session in July 1973 in the three central faculties and one basic division: the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Forestry, Faculty of Agriculture, and a Division of Foundation Studies.\n\nIn the early 80s, UPM extended its area of studies to include the field of Science and Technology (S&T). In 1997, the name Universiti Pertanian Malaysia was changed to Universiti Putra Malaysia by Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammad, as a strategic gesture to portray the status of UPM as a centre of higher education capable of providing fields of studies, especially in science and information technology, which facilitate national development in the new millennium.<ref>{{cite web|title=UPM History|url=http://www.upm.edu.my/about_us/TheStoryBehindUPM?LANG=en|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe list of the vice-chancellor of Universiti Putra Malaysia.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Vice-Chancellor'''\n!'''Academic Qualification'''\n!'''Term in office'''\n|-\n| '''1''' Professor Tan Sri Datuk Dr. [[Mohd Rashdan Baba]]\n| Diploma of Agriculture(Malaya Agriculture College), Bachelor of Agriculture Science(Reading, UK), PhD in Agriculture Science(Leeds, UK).\n| 4th November 1971\u201328th February 1982\n|-\n| '''2''' Professor Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Dr. [[Nayan Ariffin]]\n| \n| 1st March 1982\u20134th June 1994\n|-\n| '''3''' Professor Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Dr. [[Syed Jalaluddin Syed Salim]]\n|\n| 5th June 1994-17th April 2001\n|-\n| '''4''' Professor Dato\u2019 Ir.

The establishment of the department is in line with the need of the country to fulfill the shortage of skilled employees in the field of science-based food. At that time, only one undergraduate program was offered: Bachelor of Food Science and Technology.\n\nOn 1 March 1982, the Department of Food Science and Technology was upgraded to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology. There were two departments under the faculty: Department of Food Technology and Department of Food Science. In 1986, the Faculty was renamed Faculty of Food Science and Biotechnology (FSMB) with the establishment of the Department of Biotechnology that offered the Bachelor of Science (Biotechnology) program with six modules: Plant Biotechnology, Molecular Biotechnology, Food Biotechnology, Industrial Biotechnology, Environmental Biotechnology, and Management.\n\nIn 1996, the faculty began offering the Bachelor of Science (Food Studies) program with two options: Food Quality Management and Food Management. In 1997 and 2000, the Food Service Administration and Food Marketing options were offered through the same program. On 1 August 2004, the faculty was renamed to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology when the Department of Biotechnology formed a separate faculty.

However, the proposal was never brought up for further consideration by the Faculty's administration. Nevertheless, a group of teaching staff in Landscape Architecture was recruited in 1980 to teach \"landscape subjects\" in the diploma and bachelor of agriculture programmes.\n\nThe first landscape course was offered in 1984. It was a three-credit course titled \"AGRO 472 \u2013 An Approach to Landscape Design\". It became popular and managed to attract many agricultural students who later graduated and continued their studies in landscape architecture at the undergraduate and graduate level overseas. Many of these early graduates have since returned and assumed successful practice or became professors at institutions of higher learning.\n\nIn 1991, the Faculty of Engineering, UPM proposed to offer the Architecture programme in UPM. However, the idea never materialised until the Faculty of Agriculture was given the task by the university's management to look into the feasibility of offering landscape architecture and architecture in UPM. A committee was formed in the Faculty of Agriculture 1994 and in 1995 a report was sent to the vice-chancellor proposing the setting up of a new faculty offering courses in design and the creative arts. With the strong support of the university's management the Faculty of Design and Architecture was approved by the University's Senate, Board of Directors and the Ministry of Education.\n\nThe new faculty was officially established on 26 June 1996 and began its operation with the offering of the Bachelor of Landscape Architecture and Master of Landscape Architecture programmes under the new Department of Landscape Architecture. Subsequently, the Department of Architecture was established in 1999 and the Department of Industrial Design in 2002. The faculty began with an enrolment of 40 students.

The establishment of this institute was the outcome of the restructuring and rationalisation process of institutes, academy, and centres in Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). This rationalisation process was implemented as a proactive and integrated effort taken to strengthen UPM status as a Research University (RU) and to become the center of excellence in agriculture education in Malaysia.\n\nIn line with UPM mission to have an efficient and effective administration structure via the lean and mean concept, the University has identified six new research clusters: Agriculture, Food, Forestry and Environment, Health, Social Science and Science, and Engineering and Technology to enhance research activities in UPM. In addition, UPM has identified eight specific research thrusts for each cluster, in line with the government's emphasis on the country's agriculture development agenda.\n\nThree of the eight identified thrusts \u2014 Food Crops, Plantation Crops and Animal Production \u2014 will be ITA's research focus.\n\n==Schools==\n\n===School Of Graduate Studies===\n\nThe School of Graduate Studies (SGS)<ref>{{cite web|title=School of Graduate Studies (SGS)|url=http://www.sgs.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> is a service and administrative centre established to assist postgraduate students in the processes involved from their registration at UPM up to the completion of their studies. SGS is the core support system which helps ease and enhance the postgraduate experience for UPM students, and plays a crucial role in fostering the relationship between UPM and its graduates.\n\nInitially set up as a Graduate Study Unit in 1978, SGS then proceeded to become a fully functioning Graduate School Office (GSO) in February 1993, to serve the growing population of postgraduate students at UPM. In March 2002, it continued to flourish as it was officially renamed the School of Graduate Studies (SGS) and was established as a service centre which had a status equivalent to a faculty at the university. This entailed its bigger role in the co-ordination of all postgraduate programmes and activities at UPM.\n\nIn its original inception, its key role also included an active involvement in research and development in postgraduate studies. In other words, SGS was conceptualised not only as a service centre to facilitate the general running of matters related to postgraduate students, but it was deemed to play a more active and crucial role in bolstering UPM's status as a research university.\n\nAmong its main roles as stated in the 1992 proposal for its establishment are:\n* To cultivate and nurture a research culture through efficient and effective management of postgraduate research activities\n* To help the university produce graduates who are knowledgeable and skilled to meet the nation's needs\n* To improve the quality of postgraduate programmes and therefore reduce the need for overseas postgraduate training\n* To increase the international student population and contribute to UPM's internationalisation through the intensification of publication and research training for staff.\n\n===Putra Business School===\n\nPutra Business School<ref>{{cite web|title=Putra Business School|url=http://putrabusinessschool.edu.my/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> \u2013 formerly the Graduate School of Management, in Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang.\n\nPUTRA became the first business programme in Malaysia to receive accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Other business programmes accredited by AACSB include Harvard, London Business School, Wharton, the University of Warwick and Yale. Only five percent of business programmes in the world enjoy AACSB accreditation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nPUTRA has been set up by a not-for-profit foundation, YAYASAN PUTRA BUSINESS SCHOOL \u2013 as a private entity with public interest.\n\n==Centres==\n\n===Centre for Diagnostic Nuclear Imaging===\n\nThis small unit started as part of the Department of Imaging, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Universiti Putra Malaysia in 2003. Subsequently, the unit was restructured and repositioned as part of the Dean Office and known as Nuclear Imaging Unit.\n\nIn the year 2008, under the 9th Malaysian Plan, the Centre for Diagnostic Nuclear Imaging Project obtained its approval from the Malaysian Ministry Of Higher Education. The project started in the following year and took 11 months to complete and commissioned. On 1 April 2010, the centre started its operation and became the first PET CT equipment installed under the Ministry Of Higher Education for teaching, learning and research development by providing service to the public.\n\nIn retrospect, during early phase of development, the unit contributed teaching activities in diagnostic imaging programs in other institutions leading to good academic and research networking.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The research activities from the unit were partly supported by International partners through financial and non-financial assistance including Ospedale Niguarda, Milan, Italy, Oncology Research Foundation, Italy and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Austria. The unit also initiated research collaborations with other local institutions and hospitals.\n\nToday, the unit is ready to provide clinical services in PET/CT by expanding from oncology and introducing new clinical areas of PET/CT in infection, inflammation, cardiology and neurology. References have been received from public and private hospitals including university hospitals. In support of the government's aspiration and in line with the Strategic Plan of Malaysian Ministry Of Higher Education, the centre will spearhead the research and academic development in clinical integrated diagnostic imaging specialisation. From 1 October 2010, the unit is officially known as Centre For Diagnostic Nuclear Imaging (PPDN).<ref>{{cite web|title=Centre For Diagnostic Nuclear Imaging (PPDN)|url=http://www.ppdn.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Research Management Centre===\n\nThe Research Management Centre (RMC)<ref>{{cite web|title=Research Management Centre (RMC)|url=http://www.rmc.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was officially established in May 2000 to replace the former University Research Unit that was formed in 1992, to mobilise research management and enhance the overall impact of research to expand alliances and reinforce partnerships with other world class research universities.\n\n===Cancer Resource & Education Center===\n\nIn year 2002, two cancer survivors, one from Malaysia and the other from USA, initiated the idea of adapting and translating selected educational materials into Malay language as one of the ways in providing the much needed information on breast cancer treatment in Malaysia.\n\nTheir effort evolved into major educational activity; Cancer Education and Research Project (CaEd). Leadership for this program is being provided cooperatively by Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and Cornell University. CaEd formally commenced its operation in Malaysia in September 2003.\n\nIn 2008, a center called Cancer Resource & Education Center (CaRE)<ref>{{cite web|title=Cancer Resource & Education Center (CaRE)|url=http://www.care.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was set up to house the activities of cancer education, information and support programs.\n\nThis center was officially launched on 8 July 2009 by YB Senator Dato\u2019 Sri Shahrizat Abdul Jalil, Minister of Women, Family and Community Development.\n\nIn August 2011, CaRE was institutionalised under UPM as a Center of Excellence.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===University Community Transformation Centre===\nIn the 90s, Professional Advancement Centre (PACE), Agro-Entrepreneur Development Centre (AgroPAC) and Agricultural Extension Institute (IPP) were setups. In January 2007, these 3 entities were rejuvenated as Centre for Extension, Entrepreneurship and Professional Advancement (APEEC).\n\nAs the role of APEEC met approval of criteria for establishment of UCTC by NBOS, APEEC was renamed as University Community Transformation Centre (UCTC)<ref>{{cite web|title=University Community Transformation Centre (UCTC)|url=http://www.uctc.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> UPM and its role realigned. This renaming effectively retained previous organisation albeit with some roles and directions adjustments commensurate with its new function as a more pivotal link to communities.\n\nThe rebranding was formally approved by Universiti Putra Malaysia's Senate 575th meeting and came in effect on 14 Mac 2013. Hence, UPM had a leap start a far as UCTC UPM was concerned.\n\n==Campus life==\n\n===Accommodation facilities===\n\nCollege list:\n# Mohamad Rashid College\n# Second College\n# Tun Dr. Ismail College\n# Chancellor College\n# Fifth College\n# Sixth College\n# Sultan Alaeddin Suleiman Shah College\n# Tun Perak College\n# Pendeta Za'ba College\n# Tenth College\n# Eleventh College\n# Twelfth College\n# Thirteenth College\n# Fourteenth College\n# Fifteenth College\n# Sixteenth College\n# Seventeenth College\n# Sri Rajang College\n\n===Associations & Clubs===\n\n* Martial Arts / Self-Defense Category\n* Sports And Recreational Category\n* Leadership Category\n* Entrepreneurship Category\n* Spiritual Category\n* Cultural Category\n* Welfare Category\n* Faculty Category\n* Malaysia Category\n\n===Food & Beverages===\n\n===Arts & Culture===\n\nBelow is a list of arts and culture clubs that come under the management of PKKSSAAS:\n\n# Caklempong Uniputra\n# Uniputra 5 Harmony\n# Putra Band\n# Pelayang Uniputra\n# Tropikana Uniputra Band\n# Traditional Poetry\n# Kreatif Putra Band\n# Uniputra Kencana Dance\n# Gamelan Seni Alun Uniputra\n# Hadrah Uniputra\n# Uniputra Theater\n# Ghazal Uniputra\n# Dikir Barat Uniputra\n# Kompang Uniputra\n# Uniputra Choir\n# Marhaban Uniputra\n# Tetuang Uniputra\n# Uniputra Arts of Batik\n# Uniputra Audio Visual Arts\n# Nasyid Putra\n* International Arts and Culture\n\n===Sports===\n\nThe university facilities include a gym, sports hall, outdoor swimming pool, under soil drainage football pitch, Astroturf pitch for hockey, tennis courts, and a floodlit athletics and football stadium.

The University of Melbourne is the only Australian university invited to participate in this initiative.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, Split PhD scholarships are being offered by the Malaysian universities to their academic staff to undertake PhD training at the University of Melbourne. These scholarships are in addition to the regular full-time scholarships for overseas study offered by the MOHE through Malaysian public universities.  The Split PhD scholarship enables the scholarship recipients to undertake the three year full-time University of Melbourne PhD degree over four years and candidates are expected to split their PhD study equally between The University of Melbourne and their respective Malaysian university.\n\nThe following seven Malaysian universities have been selected by the Malaysian Government to be involved in the Split-PhD and research collaboration initiative with the University of Melbourne:\n* Universiti Malaya (UM)\n* Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM)\n* Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)\n* International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM)\n* Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS)\n* Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS)\n* Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) <ref name=\"http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705235816/http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html |archive-date=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==University Agriculture Park==\nUniversity Agriculture Park (TPU)<ref>{{cite web|title=University Agriculture Park (TPU)|url=http://www.tpu.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was established on 1 December 2001 to facilitate in the teaching and research in agriculture related fields and also provide services for the students, staffs and the community.\n\nUniversity Agriculture Park was originally established as the Farm Division, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia in 1971 with its function then was to provide students with agriculture practical training and to give services to the campus community.\n\nIn 1998, Farm Division was restructured to become University Research Park, Universiti Putra Malaysia to facilitated research and services in agriculture.\n\n[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 01.jpg|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]<br />[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 02.JPG|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]<br />[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 03.JPG|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]\n\n== Ayer Hitam UPM Research Forest ==\nThe research forest is at the Ayer Hitam Reserved Forest, Puchong, with a space of 1,248 hectares. The forest is 20&nbsp;km from the capital city Kuala Lumpur and 10&nbsp;km from the main campus of Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) Serdang. The Selangor State Government gave the research forest in a long term agreement for 80 years beginning 1996 for the purpose of education and research. The forest is managed by the Selangor Forestry Department and Faculty of Forestry UPM  based on sustainable forest management. The Forest Management Plan for Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve is prepared by the faculty.\n\nThe forest area is the only well-managed Lowland Dipterocarp Forest in the Klang Valley. The facilities include a partially enclosed multipurpose hall, prayer room, kitchen, bathrooms, toilets and a playing field. The base camp can accommodate around 100 to 150 person at a time.\n\nThe forest is also used for teaching purposes in the field of forestry, wood science, and park and recreation management. There are field plots for research activities in silviculture, wildlife management, forest ecology, forest survey, forest engineering, and hydrology. The extension programmes include forestry, science, motivation, interpretation and ecological camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forr.upm.edu.my/eng/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150&Itemid=187|title=Faculty of Forestry|date=18 August 2011|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=18 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728104810/http://www.forr.upm.edu.my/eng/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150&Itemid=187|archive-date=28 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== UPM \u2013 Mitsubishi Corporation Forest Restoration Project ==\nThe Joint Research Project on Rehabilitation of Tropical Rainforest Ecosystem was initiated in July 1991 by Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and [[Yokohama National University]], Japan (YNU) with sponsorship from [[Mitsubishi Corporation]]. The project is based on the success of restoration of native forest land in Japan and results of some field surveys conducted in the forests of South East Asian countries since 1978. The scientific basis of the project is based on the concept of vegetation association by Prof. Akira Miyawaki from Yokohama National University.\n\nThe objectives of the project are to assess the health of rehabilitated forest through measuring the indicators of forest health and the sustainability of forest resources. The project conducts research in soil science, plant physiology, water science, biodiversity (terrestrial floral, wildlife, aquatic flora and fauna, insect and microbes) and in microclimatic conditions that indicate the health of the rehabilitated forest.\n\nThe project was initiated in UPM Bintulu campus Sarawak (Phase 1) at a 47.5 ha site. In 2010, 350,000 seedlings were planted representing 128 species native to Sarawak. In addition, 100 research plots were established in the rehabilitated area.\n\nIn July 2008, a new agreement between UPM and Mitsubishi Corporation was signed to establish a model planted forest of indigenous tree species in an urban setting at UPM main campus Serdang, Selangor. The second phase of the project was launched on 26 November 2008 covering an area of 27 hectares. To date 1,350,000 seedlings representing 136 species have been planted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forr2.upm.edu.my/frp/index.php|title=Faculty of Forestry|date=17 March 2012|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=17 March 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801095712/http://www.forr2.upm.edu.my/frp/index.php|archive-date=1 August 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Logo ==\n[[File:Official Logo of Universiti Putra Malaysia.png|thumb|Logo UPM]]\nThe logo is simple, yet eloquent.

It is the continental portion of the province and constitutes  71% of the province's area but is home to only 6% of the province's population. It is separated from the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] by the [[Strait of Belle Isle]]. It is the largest and northernmost geographical region in [[Atlantic Canada]].\n\nLabrador occupies most of the eastern part of the [[Labrador Peninsula]]. It is bordered to the west and the south by the Canadian province of [[Quebec]]. Labrador also shares a small land border with the Canadian territory of [[Nunavut]] on [[Killiniq Island]].\n\nThe aboriginal peoples of Labrador include the Northern [[Inuit]] of [[Nunatsiavut]], the Southern [[Inuit]]-[[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] of [[NunatuKavut]], and the [[Innu]] of [[Nitassinan]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Nitassinan: The Innu Struggle to Reclaim Their Homeland |publisher=[[Douglas & McIntyre]] |year=December 1991 |page=240 |last=Wadden |first=Marie |author-link=Marie Wadden |isbn=978-1-55365-731-6 |url=http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130121161501/http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-21 |access-date=2012-11-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nLabrador is named after [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]], a Portuguese explorer who sailed along the coasts of the [[Labrador Peninsula|Peninsula]] in 1498\u201399. ''Lavrador'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] means \"farmer\", as does its [[Spanish language|Spanish]] equivalent ''labrador''.\n\n==Geography==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[Image:Labrador fullmap.gif|thumb|left|Map of Labrador.]]\n\nLabrador has a roughly triangular shape that encompasses the easternmost section of the [[Canadian Shield]], a sweeping geographical region of thin soil and abundant mineral resources. Its western border with Quebec is the drainage divide of the Labrador Peninsula. Lands that drain into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are part of Labrador, while lands that drain into [[Hudson Bay]] are part of Quebec. Northern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Polar climate|polar]], while Southern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]].\n\nLabrador can be divided into four geographical regions: the North Coast, Central Labrador, Western Labrador, and the South Coast. Each of those regions is described below.\n\n===North Coast===\n\nFrom Cape Chidley to Hamilton Inlet, the long, thin, northern tip of Labrador holds the [[Torngat Mountains]], named after an Inuit spirit believed to inhabit them. The mountains stretch along the coast from Port Manvers to [[Cape Chidley]], the northernmost point of Labrador. The Torngat Mountain range is also home to [[Mount Caubvick]], the highest point in the province. This area is predominantly Inuit, with the exception of a small Innu community, [[Natuashish]]. The North Coast is the most isolated region of Labrador, with [[snowmobile]]s, boats, and planes being the only modern modes of transportation. The largest community in this region is [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]].\n\n==== Nunatsiavut ====\n[[Nunatsiavut]] is an Inuit self-government region in Labrador created on June 23, 2000. The Settlement area comprises the majority of Labrador's North Coast, while the land-use area also includes land farther to the interior and in Central Labrador. Nain is the administrative centre.\n[[File:Kiglapait Mountains, Labrador.jpg|thumb|Icy Labrador coast and [[Kiglapait Mountains]] on the north coast of Labrador]]\n\n===Central Labrador===\n\n[[Central Labrador]] extends from the shores of [[Lake Melville]] into the interior. It contains the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]], the largest river in Labrador and one of the largest in Canada. The hydroelectric dam at [[Churchill Falls]] is the second-largest underground power station in the world. Most of the supply is bought by [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] under a long-term contract. The [[Lower Churchill Project]] will develop the remaining potential of the river and supply it to provincial consumers. Known as \"the heart of the Big Land\", the area's population comprises people from all groups and regions of Labrador.\n\nCentral Labrador is also home to [[Happy Valley \u2013 Goose Bay]]. Once a refuelling point for plane convoys to Europe during [[World War II]], [[CFB Goose Bay]] is now operated as a [[NATO]] tactical flight training site. It was an alternate landing zone for the United States' [[Space Shuttle]]. Other major communities in the area are [[North West River, Newfoundland and Labrador|North West River]] and the large [[Indian reserve|reserve]] known as [[Sheshatshiu]].\n\n===Western Labrador===\n[[File:Open_pit_iron_mine,_Labrador.jpg|right|thumb|Open pit  [[Iron Ore Company of Canada|iron mine]] in Labrador West]]\nThe highlands above the Churchill Falls were once an ancient hunting ground for the [[Innu]] First Nations and settled trappers of Labrador. After the construction of the hydroelectric dam at Churchill Falls in 1970, the [[Smallwood Reservoir]] has flooded much of the old hunting land\u2014submerging several grave sites and trapping cabins in the process.\n\nWestern Labrador is also home to the [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]], which operates a large iron ore mine in [[Labrador City]]. Together with the small community of [[Wabush]], the two towns are known as \"Labrador West\".\n\n=== South Coast ===\n\n====NunatuKavut====\nFrom [[Hamilton Inlet]] to [[Cape St. Charles]]/[[St. Lewis, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Lewis]], [[NunatuKavut]] is the territory of the NunatuKavummiut or Central-Southern Labrador Inuit (formerly known as the Labrador [[M\u00e9tis]]). It includes portions of Central and Western Labrador, but more NunatuKavummiut reside in its South Coast portion: it is peppered with tiny Inuit fishing communities, of which [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] is the largest.\n\n====The Labrador Straits====\nFrom Cape Charles to the Quebec/Labrador coastal border, the Straits is known for its Labrador sea grass (as is NunatuKavut) and the multitude of icebergs that pass by the coast via the [[Labrador Current]].\n\n[[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]] is known as one of the best examples of a preserved 16th-century [[Basque people|Basque]] whaling station. It is also the location of four 16th-century Spanish galleons. The [[lighthouse]] at [[Point Amour Lighthouse|Point Amour]] is the second-largest lighthouse in Canada. [[MV Kamutik]], a passenger ferry between the mainland and [[St. Barbe, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Barbe]] on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], is based in [[Blanc Sablon, Quebec]], near the Labrador border. [[L'Anse-au-Loup]] is the largest town on the Labrador Straits. [[L'Anse-au-Clair]] is a small town on the Labrador side of the border.\n\n===Time zones of Labrador===\n\nMost of Labrador (from [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] north and west) uses [[Atlantic Standard Time Zone|Atlantic Time]] (UTC\u22124 in winter, UTC\u22123 in summer). The southeastern tip nearest Newfoundland uses [[Newfoundland Standard Time Zone|Newfoundland Time]] (UTC\u22123:30 in winter, UTC\u22122:30 in summer) to stay co-ordinated with the more populous part of the province.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Innu making canoes near Sheshatshiu, ca. 1920.jpg|thumb|right|Innu making canoes ca. 1920]]\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Fours de fonte d'huile de baleine.jpg|thumb|right|Model of [[History of the Basques#Basque sailors|Basque]] whale oil melting factory at [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]]]]\nEarly settlement in Labrador was tied to the sea as demonstrated by the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] (or [[Innu]]) and [[Inuit]], although these peoples also made significant forays throughout the interior.\n\nIt is believed that the [[Norsemen]] were the first Europeans to sight Labrador around 1000 AD, but no Norse remains have been found on the North American mainland. The area was known as ''[[Markland]]'' in [[Greenlandic Norse]] and its inhabitants were known as ''[[skr\u00e6lingjar]]''.\n\nIn 1499 and 1500, Portuguese explorers [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]] and [[P\u00earo de Barcelos]] reached what was probably Labrador today and that is believed to be the origin of the name Labrador.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&pg=PA464 |title=Foundations of the Portuguese empire |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |author=Bailey W.

On the extreme northeast promontory of North America, Maggiolo place-names include ''Terra de los Ingres'' (Land of the English), and ''Terra de Lavorador de rey de portugall'' (Land of Lavrador of the King of Portugal). Further south, we notice ''Terra de corte real e de rey de portugall'' (Land of \"Corte-Real\" and of the King of Portugal) and ''terra de pescaria'' (Land for Fishing). In the 1532 Wolfenb\u00fcttel map, believed to be the work of [[Diogo Ribeiro]], along the coast of Greenland, the following legend was added: ''As he who first sighted it was a farmer from the Azores Islands, this name remains attached to that country.'' This is believed to be Jo\u00e3o Fernandes. For the first seven decades or so of the sixteenth century, the name Labrador was sometimes also applied to what we know as Greenland.<ref>See James A. Williamson, The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII (London, 1962), pp. 98, 120\u20131, 312\u201317.</ref> Labrador (\"lavrador\" in Portuguese) means husbandman or farmer of a tract of land (from \"labour\" in Latin) \u2014the land of the labourer. European settlement was largely concentrated in coastal communities, particularly those south of St. Lewis and Cape Charles, and are among Canada's oldest European settlements.\n\nIn 1542 Basque mariners came ashore at a natural harbour on the northeast coast of the Strait of Belle Isle. They gave this \"new land\" its Latin name ''Terranova''. A whaling station was set up around the bay, which they called ''Butus'' and is now named Red Bay after the red terracotta roof tiles they brought with them. A whaling ship, the ''San Juan'', sank there in 1565 and was raised in 1978.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/canada/articles/Red-Bay-a-corner-of-Canada-that-is-forever-Basque|last=Richardson|first=Nigel|title=A corner of Canada that is forever Basque|date=1 June 2015|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Moravian Brethren]] of [[Herrnhut]], [[Saxony]], first came to the Labrador Coast in 1760 to minister to the migratory Inuit tribes there. They founded Nain, Okak, Hebron, Hopedale and Makkovik. Quite poor, both European and First Nations settlements along coastal Labrador came to benefit from cargo and relief vessels that were operated as part of the [[Grenfell Mission]] (see [[Wilfred Grenfell]]). Throughout the 20th century, coastal freighters and ferries operated initially by the [[Newfoundland Railway]] and later [[Canadian National Railway]]/[[CN Marine]]/[[Marine Atlantic]] became a critical lifeline for communities on the coast, which for the majority of that century did not have any road connection with the rest of North America.\n\nLabrador was within [[New France]] mostly by 1748. However, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] that ended the [[French and Indian War]] transferred New France (including Labrador though excluding the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] southwest of Newfoundland) to the British, which administered the area as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] until splitting it in two in 1791, with Labrador located in [[Lower Canada]]. However, in 1809 the British Imperial government detached Labrador from Lower Canada for transfer to the separate, self-governing [[Newfoundland Colony]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n{{Further|Newfoundland National Convention|1948 Newfoundland referendums|Canadian Confederation#Joining Confederation|selfref=|label1=|label3=}}\nAs part of [[Newfoundland]] since 1809, Labrador was still being disputed by [[Quebec]] until the British resolved their border in 1927. In 1949, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] [[1948 Newfoundland referendums|entered into confederation]], becoming part of Canada (see above artices for full information).\n\n[[File:Moravian Church, Nain, NL, exterior.JPG|thumb|[[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]] was established in 1771 by [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries]]\nLabrador played strategic roles during both [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]. In October 1943, a German [[U-boat]] crew installed an automated weather station on the northern tip of Labrador near Cape Chidley, code-named [[Weather Station Kurt]]; the installation of the equipment was the only (known) armed, German military operation on the North American mainland during the war. The station broadcast weather observations to the German navy for only a few days, but was not discovered until the 1980s when a historian, working with the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], identified its location and mounted an expedition to recover it. The station is now exhibited in the [[Canadian War Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/ops/weather_stations.htm |title=Weather station Kurt erected in Labrador in 1943 | accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian government built a major air force base at [[Goose Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Goose Bay]], at the head of [[Lake Melville]] during the Second World War, a site selected because of its topography, access to the sea, defensible location, and minimal fog. During the Second World War and the Cold War, the base was also home to American, British, and later German, Dutch, and Italian detachments. Today, Serco, the company contracted to operate [[CFB Goose Bay]] is one of the largest employers for the community of [[Happy Valley-Goose Bay]].\n\nAdditionally, both the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and [[United States Air Force]] built and operated a number of radar stations along coastal Labrador as part of the [[Pinetree Line]], [[Mid-Canada Line]] and [[Distant Early Warning Line|DEW Line]] systems. Today the remaining stations are automated as part of the [[North Warning System]], however the military settlements during the early part of the Cold War surrounding these stations have largely continued as local Innu and Inuit populations have clustered near their port and airfield facilities.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, some of the largest [[iron ore]] deposits in the world were discovered in the western part of Labrador and adjacent areas of Quebec. Deposits at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright]], [[Schefferville, Quebec|Schefferville]], Labrador City, and Wabush drove industrial development and human settlement in the area during the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe present community of [[Labrador West, Newfoundland and Labrador|Labrador West]] is entirely a result of the iron ore mining activities in the region. The Iron Ore Company of Canada operates the [[Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway]] to transport ore concentrate 578 kilometres (359 miles) south to the port of [[Sept-\u00celes, Quebec]], for shipment to steel mills in North America and elsewhere.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] (Labrador name: Grand River) was diverted at Churchill Falls, resulting in the flooding of an enormous area \u2013 today named the Smallwood Reservoir after Joey Smallwood, the first premier of Newfoundland. The flooding of the reservoir destroyed large areas of habitat for the threatened Woodland Caribou. A hydroelectric generating station was built in Labrador and a transmission line to the neighbouring province of Quebec.\n\nConstruction of a large hydroelectric dam project at Muskrat Falls began in 2012 by Nalcor Energy and the Province of Newfoundland. Muskrat Falls is 45&nbsp;km west of Happy Valley-Goose Bay on the Grand River (Newfoundland name: Churchill River). A transmission line began construction in October 2014 and was completed in 2016 that will deliver power down to the southern tip of Labrador and underwater across the strait of Belle Isle to the Province of Newfoundland in 2018.<ref>http://muskratfalls.nalcorenergy.com/team-work-and-dedication-brings-the-link-to-completion/</ref>\n\nFrom the 1970s to early 2000s, the [[Trans-Labrador Highway]] was built in stages to connect various inland communities with the North American highway network at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright, Quebec]] (which in turn is connected by a highway running north from [[Baie-Comeau]], [[Quebec]]). A southern extension of this highway has opened in stages during the early 2000s and is resulting in significant changes to the coastal ferry system in the Strait of Belle Isle and southeastern Labrador. These \"highways\" are so called only because of their importance to the region; they would be better described as roads, and are not completely paved.\n\nA study on a [[Newfoundland-Labrador fixed link|fixed link]] to Newfoundland, in 2004, recommended that a tunnel under the [[Strait of Belle Isle]], being a single railway that would carry cars, buses and trucks, was technologically the best option for such a link. However, the study also concluded that a fixed link was not economically viable. Conceivably, if built with federal aid, the 1949 terms of union would be amended to remove ferry service from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Channel \u2013 Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAlthough a [[Trans-Labrador Highway|highway link]] has, as of 16 December 2009, been completed across Labrador, this route is somewhat longer than a proposed [[Quebec Route 138|Quebec North Shore highway]] that presently does not exist. Part of the \"highway\", [[Quebec Route 389|Route 389]], starting approximately {{convert|212|km|mi}} from Baie-Comeau to {{convert|482|km|mi}}, is of an inferior alignment, and from there to {{convert|570|km|mi}}, the provincial border, is an accident-prone section notorious for its poor surface and sharp curves. Quebec in April 2009 announced major upgrades to Route 389 to be carried out.\n\nRoute 389 and the Trans-Labrador Highway were added to Canada's [[National Highway System (Canada)|National Highway System]] in September 2005.\n\n[[Labrador (electoral district)|Labrador]] constitutes a federal electoral district electing one member to the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. Due to its size, distinct nature, and large Aboriginal population, Labrador has one seat despite having the smallest population of any electoral district in Canada. Formerly, Labrador was part of a riding that included part of the Island of Newfoundland. Labrador is divided into four provincial electoral districts in the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly]].\n\n==Boundary dispute==\n[[Image:Labrador boundary dispute.png|thumb|Line A: the boundary decided by the Privy Council; the current legal boundary.

In 1809 Labrador had been transferred from [[Lower Canada]] to [[Newfoundland Colony]] but the inland boundary of Labrador had never been precisely stated.<ref name=\"marianopolis\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/NFLDHistory/Quebec-NewfoundlandLabradorBoundaryIssue.htm|title = Labrador-Canada boundary|publisher = marianopolis| accessdate = 2008-03-20 | last= |quote=Labrador Act, 1809. \u2013 An imperial act (49 Geo.

Labrador also shares a small land border with the Canadian territory of [[Nunavut]] on [[Killiniq Island]].\n\nThe aboriginal peoples of Labrador include the Northern [[Inuit]] of [[Nunatsiavut]], the Southern [[Inuit]]-[[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] of [[NunatuKavut]], and the [[Innu]] of [[Nitassinan]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Nitassinan: The Innu Struggle to Reclaim Their Homeland |publisher=[[Douglas & McIntyre]] |year=December 1991 |page=240 |last=Wadden |first=Marie |author-link=Marie Wadden |isbn=978-1-55365-731-6 |url=http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130121161501/http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-21 |access-date=2012-11-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nLabrador is named after [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]], a Portuguese explorer who sailed along the coasts of the [[Labrador Peninsula|Peninsula]] in 1498\u201399. ''Lavrador'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] means \"farmer\", as does its [[Spanish language|Spanish]] equivalent ''labrador''.\n\n==Geography==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[Image:Labrador fullmap.gif|thumb|left|Map of Labrador.]]\n\nLabrador has a roughly triangular shape that encompasses the easternmost section of the [[Canadian Shield]], a sweeping geographical region of thin soil and abundant mineral resources. Its western border with Quebec is the drainage divide of the Labrador Peninsula. Lands that drain into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are part of Labrador, while lands that drain into [[Hudson Bay]] are part of Quebec. Northern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Polar climate|polar]], while Southern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]].\n\nLabrador can be divided into four geographical regions: the North Coast, Central Labrador, Western Labrador, and the South Coast. Each of those regions is described below.\n\n===North Coast===\n\nFrom Cape Chidley to Hamilton Inlet, the long, thin, northern tip of Labrador holds the [[Torngat Mountains]], named after an Inuit spirit believed to inhabit them. The mountains stretch along the coast from Port Manvers to [[Cape Chidley]], the northernmost point of Labrador. The Torngat Mountain range is also home to [[Mount Caubvick]], the highest point in the province. This area is predominantly Inuit, with the exception of a small Innu community, [[Natuashish]]. The North Coast is the most isolated region of Labrador, with [[snowmobile]]s, boats, and planes being the only modern modes of transportation. The largest community in this region is [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]].\n\n==== Nunatsiavut ====\n[[Nunatsiavut]] is an Inuit self-government region in Labrador created on June 23, 2000. The Settlement area comprises the majority of Labrador's North Coast, while the land-use area also includes land farther to the interior and in Central Labrador. Nain is the administrative centre.\n[[File:Kiglapait Mountains, Labrador.jpg|thumb|Icy Labrador coast and [[Kiglapait Mountains]] on the north coast of Labrador]]\n\n===Central Labrador===\n\n[[Central Labrador]] extends from the shores of [[Lake Melville]] into the interior. It contains the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]], the largest river in Labrador and one of the largest in Canada. The hydroelectric dam at [[Churchill Falls]] is the second-largest underground power station in the world. Most of the supply is bought by [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] under a long-term contract. The [[Lower Churchill Project]] will develop the remaining potential of the river and supply it to provincial consumers. Known as \"the heart of the Big Land\", the area's population comprises people from all groups and regions of Labrador.\n\nCentral Labrador is also home to [[Happy Valley \u2013 Goose Bay]]. Once a refuelling point for plane convoys to Europe during [[World War II]], [[CFB Goose Bay]] is now operated as a [[NATO]] tactical flight training site. It was an alternate landing zone for the United States' [[Space Shuttle]]. Other major communities in the area are [[North West River, Newfoundland and Labrador|North West River]] and the large [[Indian reserve|reserve]] known as [[Sheshatshiu]].\n\n===Western Labrador===\n[[File:Open_pit_iron_mine,_Labrador.jpg|right|thumb|Open pit  [[Iron Ore Company of Canada|iron mine]] in Labrador West]]\nThe highlands above the Churchill Falls were once an ancient hunting ground for the [[Innu]] First Nations and settled trappers of Labrador. After the construction of the hydroelectric dam at Churchill Falls in 1970, the [[Smallwood Reservoir]] has flooded much of the old hunting land\u2014submerging several grave sites and trapping cabins in the process.\n\nWestern Labrador is also home to the [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]], which operates a large iron ore mine in [[Labrador City]]. Together with the small community of [[Wabush]], the two towns are known as \"Labrador West\".\n\n=== South Coast ===\n\n====NunatuKavut====\nFrom [[Hamilton Inlet]] to [[Cape St. Charles]]/[[St. Lewis, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Lewis]], [[NunatuKavut]] is the territory of the NunatuKavummiut or Central-Southern Labrador Inuit (formerly known as the Labrador [[M\u00e9tis]]). It includes portions of Central and Western Labrador, but more NunatuKavummiut reside in its South Coast portion: it is peppered with tiny Inuit fishing communities, of which [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] is the largest.\n\n====The Labrador Straits====\nFrom Cape Charles to the Quebec/Labrador coastal border, the Straits is known for its Labrador sea grass (as is NunatuKavut) and the multitude of icebergs that pass by the coast via the [[Labrador Current]].\n\n[[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]] is known as one of the best examples of a preserved 16th-century [[Basque people|Basque]] whaling station. It is also the location of four 16th-century Spanish galleons. The [[lighthouse]] at [[Point Amour Lighthouse|Point Amour]] is the second-largest lighthouse in Canada. [[MV Kamutik]], a passenger ferry between the mainland and [[St. Barbe, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Barbe]] on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], is based in [[Blanc Sablon, Quebec]], near the Labrador border. [[L'Anse-au-Loup]] is the largest town on the Labrador Straits. [[L'Anse-au-Clair]] is a small town on the Labrador side of the border.\n\n===Time zones of Labrador===\n\nMost of Labrador (from [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] north and west) uses [[Atlantic Standard Time Zone|Atlantic Time]] (UTC\u22124 in winter, UTC\u22123 in summer). The southeastern tip nearest Newfoundland uses [[Newfoundland Standard Time Zone|Newfoundland Time]] (UTC\u22123:30 in winter, UTC\u22122:30 in summer) to stay co-ordinated with the more populous part of the province.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Innu making canoes near Sheshatshiu, ca. 1920.jpg|thumb|right|Innu making canoes ca. 1920]]\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Fours de fonte d'huile de baleine.jpg|thumb|right|Model of [[History of the Basques#Basque sailors|Basque]] whale oil melting factory at [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]]]]\nEarly settlement in Labrador was tied to the sea as demonstrated by the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] (or [[Innu]]) and [[Inuit]], although these peoples also made significant forays throughout the interior.\n\nIt is believed that the [[Norsemen]] were the first Europeans to sight Labrador around 1000 AD, but no Norse remains have been found on the North American mainland. The area was known as ''[[Markland]]'' in [[Greenlandic Norse]] and its inhabitants were known as ''[[skr\u00e6lingjar]]''.\n\nIn 1499 and 1500, Portuguese explorers [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]] and [[P\u00earo de Barcelos]] reached what was probably Labrador today and that is believed to be the origin of the name Labrador.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&pg=PA464 |title=Foundations of the Portuguese empire |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |author=Bailey W.

On the extreme northeast promontory of North America, Maggiolo place-names include ''Terra de los Ingres'' (Land of the English), and ''Terra de Lavorador de rey de portugall'' (Land of Lavrador of the King of Portugal). Further south, we notice ''Terra de corte real e de rey de portugall'' (Land of \"Corte-Real\" and of the King of Portugal) and ''terra de pescaria'' (Land for Fishing). In the 1532 Wolfenb\u00fcttel map, believed to be the work of [[Diogo Ribeiro]], along the coast of Greenland, the following legend was added: ''As he who first sighted it was a farmer from the Azores Islands, this name remains attached to that country.'' This is believed to be Jo\u00e3o Fernandes. For the first seven decades or so of the sixteenth century, the name Labrador was sometimes also applied to what we know as Greenland.<ref>See James A. Williamson, The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII (London, 1962), pp. 98, 120\u20131, 312\u201317.</ref> Labrador (\"lavrador\" in Portuguese) means husbandman or farmer of a tract of land (from \"labour\" in Latin) \u2014the land of the labourer. European settlement was largely concentrated in coastal communities, particularly those south of St. Lewis and Cape Charles, and are among Canada's oldest European settlements.\n\nIn 1542 Basque mariners came ashore at a natural harbour on the northeast coast of the Strait of Belle Isle. They gave this \"new land\" its Latin name ''Terranova''. A whaling station was set up around the bay, which they called ''Butus'' and is now named Red Bay after the red terracotta roof tiles they brought with them. A whaling ship, the ''San Juan'', sank there in 1565 and was raised in 1978.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/canada/articles/Red-Bay-a-corner-of-Canada-that-is-forever-Basque|last=Richardson|first=Nigel|title=A corner of Canada that is forever Basque|date=1 June 2015|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Moravian Brethren]] of [[Herrnhut]], [[Saxony]], first came to the Labrador Coast in 1760 to minister to the migratory Inuit tribes there. They founded Nain, Okak, Hebron, Hopedale and Makkovik. Quite poor, both European and First Nations settlements along coastal Labrador came to benefit from cargo and relief vessels that were operated as part of the [[Grenfell Mission]] (see [[Wilfred Grenfell]]). Throughout the 20th century, coastal freighters and ferries operated initially by the [[Newfoundland Railway]] and later [[Canadian National Railway]]/[[CN Marine]]/[[Marine Atlantic]] became a critical lifeline for communities on the coast, which for the majority of that century did not have any road connection with the rest of North America.\n\nLabrador was within [[New France]] mostly by 1748. However, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] that ended the [[French and Indian War]] transferred New France (including Labrador though excluding the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] southwest of Newfoundland) to the British, which administered the area as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] until splitting it in two in 1791, with Labrador located in [[Lower Canada]]. However, in 1809 the British Imperial government detached Labrador from Lower Canada for transfer to the separate, self-governing [[Newfoundland Colony]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n{{Further|Newfoundland National Convention|1948 Newfoundland referendums|Canadian Confederation#Joining Confederation|selfref=|label1=|label3=}}\nAs part of [[Newfoundland]] since 1809, Labrador was still being disputed by [[Quebec]] until the British resolved their border in 1927. In 1949, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] [[1948 Newfoundland referendums|entered into confederation]], becoming part of Canada (see above artices for full information).\n\n[[File:Moravian Church, Nain, NL, exterior.JPG|thumb|[[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]] was established in 1771 by [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries]]\nLabrador played strategic roles during both [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]. In October 1943, a German [[U-boat]] crew installed an automated weather station on the northern tip of Labrador near Cape Chidley, code-named [[Weather Station Kurt]]; the installation of the equipment was the only (known) armed, German military operation on the North American mainland during the war. The station broadcast weather observations to the German navy for only a few days, but was not discovered until the 1980s when a historian, working with the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], identified its location and mounted an expedition to recover it. The station is now exhibited in the [[Canadian War Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/ops/weather_stations.htm |title=Weather station Kurt erected in Labrador in 1943 | accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian government built a major air force base at [[Goose Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Goose Bay]], at the head of [[Lake Melville]] during the Second World War, a site selected because of its topography, access to the sea, defensible location, and minimal fog. During the Second World War and the Cold War, the base was also home to American, British, and later German, Dutch, and Italian detachments. Today, Serco, the company contracted to operate [[CFB Goose Bay]] is one of the largest employers for the community of [[Happy Valley-Goose Bay]].\n\nAdditionally, both the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and [[United States Air Force]] built and operated a number of radar stations along coastal Labrador as part of the [[Pinetree Line]], [[Mid-Canada Line]] and [[Distant Early Warning Line|DEW Line]] systems. Today the remaining stations are automated as part of the [[North Warning System]], however the military settlements during the early part of the Cold War surrounding these stations have largely continued as local Innu and Inuit populations have clustered near their port and airfield facilities.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, some of the largest [[iron ore]] deposits in the world were discovered in the western part of Labrador and adjacent areas of Quebec. Deposits at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright]], [[Schefferville, Quebec|Schefferville]], Labrador City, and Wabush drove industrial development and human settlement in the area during the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe present community of [[Labrador West, Newfoundland and Labrador|Labrador West]] is entirely a result of the iron ore mining activities in the region. The Iron Ore Company of Canada operates the [[Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway]] to transport ore concentrate 578 kilometres (359 miles) south to the port of [[Sept-\u00celes, Quebec]], for shipment to steel mills in North America and elsewhere.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] (Labrador name: Grand River) was diverted at Churchill Falls, resulting in the flooding of an enormous area \u2013 today named the Smallwood Reservoir after Joey Smallwood, the first premier of Newfoundland. The flooding of the reservoir destroyed large areas of habitat for the threatened Woodland Caribou. A hydroelectric generating station was built in Labrador and a transmission line to the neighbouring province of Quebec.\n\nConstruction of a large hydroelectric dam project at Muskrat Falls began in 2012 by Nalcor Energy and the Province of Newfoundland. Muskrat Falls is 45&nbsp;km west of Happy Valley-Goose Bay on the Grand River (Newfoundland name: Churchill River). A transmission line began construction in October 2014 and was completed in 2016 that will deliver power down to the southern tip of Labrador and underwater across the strait of Belle Isle to the Province of Newfoundland in 2018.<ref>http://muskratfalls.nalcorenergy.com/team-work-and-dedication-brings-the-link-to-completion/</ref>\n\nFrom the 1970s to early 2000s, the [[Trans-Labrador Highway]] was built in stages to connect various inland communities with the North American highway network at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright, Quebec]] (which in turn is connected by a highway running north from [[Baie-Comeau]], [[Quebec]]). A southern extension of this highway has opened in stages during the early 2000s and is resulting in significant changes to the coastal ferry system in the Strait of Belle Isle and southeastern Labrador. These \"highways\" are so called only because of their importance to the region; they would be better described as roads, and are not completely paved.\n\nA study on a [[Newfoundland-Labrador fixed link|fixed link]] to Newfoundland, in 2004, recommended that a tunnel under the [[Strait of Belle Isle]], being a single railway that would carry cars, buses and trucks, was technologically the best option for such a link. However, the study also concluded that a fixed link was not economically viable. Conceivably, if built with federal aid, the 1949 terms of union would be amended to remove ferry service from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Channel \u2013 Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAlthough a [[Trans-Labrador Highway|highway link]] has, as of 16 December 2009, been completed across Labrador, this route is somewhat longer than a proposed [[Quebec Route 138|Quebec North Shore highway]] that presently does not exist. Part of the \"highway\", [[Quebec Route 389|Route 389]], starting approximately {{convert|212|km|mi}} from Baie-Comeau to {{convert|482|km|mi}}, is of an inferior alignment, and from there to {{convert|570|km|mi}}, the provincial border, is an accident-prone section notorious for its poor surface and sharp curves. Quebec in April 2009 announced major upgrades to Route 389 to be carried out.\n\nRoute 389 and the Trans-Labrador Highway were added to Canada's [[National Highway System (Canada)|National Highway System]] in September 2005.\n\n[[Labrador (electoral district)|Labrador]] constitutes a federal electoral district electing one member to the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. Due to its size, distinct nature, and large Aboriginal population, Labrador has one seat despite having the smallest population of any electoral district in Canada. Formerly, Labrador was part of a riding that included part of the Island of Newfoundland. Labrador is divided into four provincial electoral districts in the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly]].\n\n==Boundary dispute==\n[[Image:Labrador boundary dispute.png|thumb|Line A: the boundary decided by the Privy Council; the current legal boundary.
