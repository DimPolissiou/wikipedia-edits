Lightning causes [[thunder]], a sound from the [[shock wave]] which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during [[thunderstorm]]s and other types of energetic [[weather]] systems, but [[volcanic lightning]] can also occur during volcanic eruptions.\n\nThe three main kinds of lightning are distinguished by where they occur: either inside a single [[thundercloud]], between two different clouds, or between a cloud and the ground. Many other observational variants are recognized, including \"[[heat lightning]]\", which can be seen from a great distance but not heard; [[dry lightning]], which can cause [[forest fires]]; and [[ball lightning]], which is rarely observed scientifically.\n\nHumans have [[Lightning in religion|deified lightning]] for millennia, and lightning-inspired expressions like \"bolt from the blue\", \"to be struck by lightning\" (as to having an [[Epiphan\u044c\u0431\u0431\u0442\u044e\u0431\u0442\u0442\u0431\u044c\u0442\u0434\u043b\u0445\u044b\u0444\u0446\u043a\ntenment]]), \"lightning never strikes twice (in the same place)\" and \"[[blitzkrieg]]\" are in common usage. In some languages, the notion of \"love at first sight\" literally translates as \"lightning strike\".\n\n==Electrification==\n[[File:Understanding Lightning - Figure 1 - Cloud Charging Area.gif|thumb|(Figure 1) The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from {{convert|-15|to|-25|C|F}}.]]\n\nThe details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists, but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification. The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from {{convert|-15|to|-25|C|F}}; see Figure 1. At that place, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and [[graupel]] (soft hail). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.<ref name=\"NOAA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_electrication.htm |title=NWS Lightning Safety: Understanding Lightning: Thunderstorm Electrification |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=25 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130080723/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_electrication.htm |archivedate=November 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graupel animation 3a.gif|thumb|left|(Figure 2) When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged.]]\n\nThe differences in the movement of the precipitation cause collisions to occur. When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged; see Figure 2. The updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud. The larger and denser graupel is either suspended in the middle of the thunderstorm cloud or falls toward the lower part of the storm.<ref name=\"NOAA\"/>\n\n[[File:Charged cloud animation 4a.gif|thumb|The upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged.]]\n\nThe result is that the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged.<ref name=\"NOAA\"/>\n\nThe upward motions within the storm and winds at higher levels in the atmosphere tend to cause the small ice crystals (and positive charge) in the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from thunderstorm cloud base. This part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil. While this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud, some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm (updrafts and downdrafts). In addition, there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures.<ref name=\"NOAA\"/>\n\n==General considerations==\n[[File:LightningCNP.ogg|thumb|left|Four-second video of a lightning strike, Island in the Sky, [[Canyonlands National Park]], [[Utah]], United States.]]\n\nA typical cloud-to-ground lightning flash culminates in the formation of an electrically conducting [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] channel through the air in excess of {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} tall, from within the cloud to the ground's surface.

The flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses, such as the [[Gulf stream|Gulf Stream]], partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the [[Southeast United States]]. Because large bodies of water lack the topographic variation that would result in atmospheric mixing, lightning is notably less frequent over the world's oceans than over land. The [[north pole|North]] and [[south pole|South Poles]] are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least amount of lightning.{{Clarify|reason=absence of thunderstorms is similar to absence of lightning; an explanation of why are there less thunderstorms (lightning) above the poles would be more helpful|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn general, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes account for only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide. Since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged, this is where most CG lightning originates. This region is typically at the elevation where [[freezing level|freezing]] occurs within the cloud. Freezing, combined with collisions between ice and water, appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process. During wind-driven collisions, ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge, while a heavier, slushy mixture of ice and water (called [[graupel]]) develops a negative charge. Updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel, causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive [[space charge]] while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge.\n\n[[File:2013-08-07 04-23-26-foudre-belfort.jpg|thumb|Lightning in [[Belfort]], France]]\n\nBecause the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air, and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground, the proportion of CG strikes (versus cloud-to-cloud (CC) or in-cloud (IC) discharges) becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground. In the tropics, where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere, only 10% of lightning flashes are CG. At the latitude of Norway (around 60\u00b0 North latitude), where the freezing elevation is lower, 50% of lightning is CG.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast05dec_1/|date=December 5, 2001|title=Where LightningStrikes|publisher=NASA Science.

The atmosphere provides the electrical insulation, or barrier, that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity.\n\nIt is well understood that during a thunderstorm there is charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud; however the exact processes by which this occurs are not fully understood.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1993)032<0642:AROTEP>2.0.CO;2|volume=32|title=A Review of Thunderstorm Electrification Processes |last1=Saunders|first1=C.

The induced positive surface charge, when measured against a fixed point, will be small as the thundercloud approaches, increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes. The referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve.\n\nThe oppositely charged regions create an [[electric field]] within the air between them. This electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud \u2013 the greater the accumulated charge, the higher the electrical field.\n\n== Flashes and strikes ==\nThe best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground (CG). Although more common, intracloud (IC) and cloud to cloud (CC) flashes are very difficult to study given there are no \"physical\" points to monitor inside the clouds. Also, given the very low probability lightning will strike the same point repeatedly and consistently, scientific inquiry is difficult at best even in the areas of high CG frequency. As such, knowing flash propagation is similar amongst all forms of lightning, the best means to describe the process is through an examination of the most studied form, cloud to ground.[[File:Desert Electric.jpg|thumb|A lightning strike from cloud to ground in the [[Mojave Desert]], California]] \n[[File:Florescent cloud blanket.jpg|thumb|An intracloud flash. A lightning flash within the cloud, illuminates the entire blanket.]]\n\n=== Lightning leaders ===\n[[File:Lightning formation.gif|thumb|Lightning formation|thumb|A downward leader travels towards earth, branching as it goes.]]\n[[File:Leaderlightnig.gif|thumbnail|Lightning strike caused by the connection of two leaders, positive shown in blue and negative in red]]\n\nIn a process not well understood, a bidirectional channel of [[ionized]] air, called a \"[[leader (spark)|leader]]\", is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud. Leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through, or are otherwise attracted to, regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip. The negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region, also called a well, inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well. Leaders often split, forming branches in a tree-like pattern.<ref>Ultraslow-motion video of stepped leader propagation: [http://www.ztresearch.com/ ztresearch.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413125231/http://www.ztresearch.com/ |date=April 13, 2010 }}</ref> In addition, negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion, in a process called \"stepping\". The resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of lightning flashes.\n\nIt is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active. When this happens, the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash. In a typical cloud-to-ground flash, a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud. The weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground.\n\nThe positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions, positive upwards within the cloud and [[Electric charge|negative]] towards the earth. Both ionic channels proceed, in their respective directions, in a number of successive spurts. Each leader \"pools\" ions at the leading tips, shooting out one or more new leaders, momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions, then shooting out another leader. The negative leader continues to propagate and split as it heads downward, often speeding up as it gets closer to the Earth's surface.\n\nAbout 90% of ionic channel lengths between \"pools\" are approximately {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.<ref>Goulde, R.H. (1977) \"The lightning conductor\", pp. 545\u2013576 in ''Lightning Protection'', R.H. Golde, Ed., ''Lightning, Vol. 2'', Academic Press.</ref> The establishment of the ionic channel takes a comparatively long amount of time (hundreds of [[millisecond]]s) in comparison to the resulting discharge, which occurs within a few dozen microseconds. The [[electric current]] needed to establish the channel, measured in the tens or hundreds of [[ampere]]s, is dwarfed by subsequent currents during the actual discharge.\n\nInitiation of the lightning leaders is not well understood. The electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11214-008-9338-z|title=Charge Structure and Dynamics in Thunderstorms|date=2008|last1=Stolzenburg|first1=Maribeth|last2=Marshall|first2=Thomas C.|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=137|issue=1\u20134|page=355|bibcode = 2008SSRv..137..355S }}</ref> Many hypotheses have been proposed. One theory postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by [[cosmic rays]] and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called [[runaway breakdown]].

The electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud, such as trees and tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough, a positively charged ionic channel, called a positive or upward [[Streamer discharge|streamer]], can develop from these points. This was first theorized by Heinz Kasemir.<ref>Kasemir, H. W.

Photographs have been taken in which unattached streamers are clearly visible. The unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning, none of which are connected to the earth, although it may appear they are. High-speed videos can show the attachment process in progress.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1002/2017GL072796|title = Lightning attachment process to common buildings|journal = Geophysical Research Letters|volume = 44|issue = 9|pages = 4368\u20134375|year = 2017|last1 = Saba|first1 = M.

Electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment, which expands across the entire leader network at a fraction of the speed of light. This is the 'return stroke' and it is the most [[Luminous intensity|luminous]] and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.\n\nA large electric current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground, neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area. This huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground. Called step potentials, they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself.<ref>See, for example, [https://www.livescience.com/55916-why-reindeer-killed-by-lightning.html here]</ref> Electricity takes every path available to it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Path of Least Resistance|url=http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104215214/http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|archivedate=January 4, 2016|df=mdy-all|date=July 2001}}</ref>\nA portion of the return stroke current will often preferentially flow through one leg and out another, electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes.\n\nThe electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative CG flash, often referred to as \"negative CG\" lightning. In some cases, a ground to cloud (GC) lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm. These discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures, such as communications antennas. The rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 100,000&nbsp;km/s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Idone | first1 = V. P. | last2 = Orville | first2 = R.

The core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50,000 K, causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color. Once the electric current stops flowing, the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds, often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas. The nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively, producing a powerful [[shock wave]] which is heard as [[#Thunder|thunder]].\n\n====Re-strike====\nHigh-speed videos (examined frame-by-frame) show that most negative CG lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes, though there may be as many as 30.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 5, p. 41.</ref>\n\nEach re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time, typically 40 to 50 milliseconds, as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes. Re-strikes often cause a noticeable \"[[strobe light]]\" effect.<ref name=\"uman\">[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] pp. 103\u2013110.</ref>\n\nTo understand why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel, one needs to understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on the tips of the decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called ''recoil leaders'', usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a ''dart leader'' travels across all or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground are what cause a majority of subsequent return strokes.<ref name=\"Warner\">{{cite web |url=https://ztresearch.blog/education/ground-flashes/ |title=Ground Flashes |last=Warner |first=Tom |website=ZT Research |access-date=2017-11-09|date=2017-05-06 }}</ref>\n\nEach successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke. Each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one, but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 9, p. 78.</ref>\n\nSince recoil and dart leader processes do not occur on negative leaders, subsequent return strokes very seldom utilize the same channel on positive ground flashes which are explained later in the article.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\n====Transient currents during flash====\nThe electric current within a typical negative CG lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 1\u201310 microseconds, then decays more slowly over 50\u2013200 microseconds. The transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground-based structures. Rapidly changing currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor, in what is called the [[skin effect]], unlike direct currents, which \"flow-through\" the entire conductor like water through a hose. Hence, conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi-stranded, with small wires woven together. This increases the total bundle [[surface area]] in inverse proportion to the individual strand radius, for a fixed total [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]].\n\nThe rapidly changing currents also create [[Electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulses (EMPs)]] that radiate outward from the ionic channel. This is a characteristic of all electrical discharges. The radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases. However, if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines, communication lines, or metallic pipes, they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination. The surge current is inversely related to the Surge impedance ... so the higher in impedance, then the lower the current.<ref>[http://sites.ieee.org/sas-pesias/files/2016/03/Lightning-Protection-and-Transient-Overvoltage_Rogerio-Verdolin.pdf Lightning Protection and Transient Overvoltage | VERDOLIN SOLUTIONS INC. | HIGH VOLTAGE POWER ENGINEERING SERVICES]</ref> This is the \"[[Voltage spike|surge]]\" that, more often than not, results in the destruction of delicate [[electronics]], [[electrical appliance]]s, or [[electric motor]]s. Devices known as [[Surge protector|surge protectors (SPD) or transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS)]] attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash's transient irregular current, and, through alteration of its physical properties, route the spike to an attached [[Electrical ground|earthing ground]], thereby protecting the equipment from damage.\n\n== Types ==\nThere are three primary types of lightning, defined by what is at the \"ends\" of a flash channel.\n*Intracloud (IC), which occurs within a single thundercloud unit\n*Cloud to cloud (CC) or intercloud, which starts and ends between two different \"functional\" thundercloud units\n*Cloud to ground (CG), that primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an Earth surface, but may also occur in the reverse direction, that is ground to cloud \nThere are variations of each type, such as \"positive\" versus \"negative\" CG flashes, that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured. Different [[common name]]s used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events.\n\n=== Cloud to ground (CG) ===\n[[File:Lightning strikes mountain top.jpg|thumb|right|''Cloud to ground'' lightning]]\nCloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground. It is initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud, which is met by a streamer moving up from the ground.\n\nCG is the least common, but best understood of all types of lightning.  It is easier to study scientifically, because it terminates on a physical object, namely the Earth, and lends itself to being measured by instruments on the ground. Of the three primary types of lightning, it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates or \"strikes\" the Earth. \nThe overall discharge, termed a flash, is composed of a number of processes such as preliminary breakdown, stepped leaders, connecting leaders, return strokes, dart leaders and subsequent return strokes.<ref>V.

The reverse happens in a positive CG flash, where electrons travel upward along the lightning channel and a positive charge is transferred to the ground.

When it occurs between two separate clouds it is known as ''inter-cloud lightning'', and when it occurs between areas of differing [[electric potential]] within a single cloud it is known as ''intra-cloud lightning''. Intra-cloud lightning is the most frequently occurring type.<ref name=\"GHCC primer2\" />\n\nIntra-cloud lightning most commonly occurs between the upper [[cumulonimbus incus|anvil]] portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm. This lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so-called \"[[sheet lightning]]\". In such instances, the observer may see only a flash of light without hearing any thunder.\n\n [[File:Anvil Crawler over Lake Wright Patman south of Redwater, Texas..JPG|thumb|Anvil Crawler over Lake Wright Patman south of Redwater, Texas on the backside of a large area of rain associated with a cold-front]]\nAnother term used for cloud\u2013cloud or cloud\u2013cloud\u2013ground lightning is \"Anvil Crawler\", due to the habit of charge, typically originating beneath or within the anvil and scrambling through the upper cloud layers of a thunderstorm, often generating dramatic multiple branch strokes. These are usually seen as a thunderstorm passes over the observer or begins to decay. The most vivid crawler behavior occurs in well developed thunderstorms that feature extensive rear anvil shearing.\n\n=== Observational variations ===\n* '''Anvil crawler lightning''', sometimes called '''Spider lightning''' is created when leaders propagate through horizontally-extensive charge regions in mature thunderstorms, usually the stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems. These discharges usually begin as intracloud discharges originating within the convective region; the negative leader end then propagates well into the aforementioned charge regions in the stratiform area. If the leader becomes too long, it may separate into multiple bidirectional leaders. When this happens, the positive end of the separated leader may strike the ground as a positive CG flash or crawl on the underside of the cloud, creating a spectacular display of lightning crawling across the sky. Ground flashes produced in this manner tend to transfer high amounts of charge, and this can trigger upward lightning flashes and upper-atmospheric lightning.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n*'''[[Ball lightning]]''' may be an [[atmospheric electricity|atmospheric electrical]] phenomenon, the physical nature of which is still [[controversial]].

Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning's path, the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel, by [[echo (phenomenon)|acoustic echoing]] from terrain, and by the usually multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike.\n\n[[Speed of light|Light travels]] at about {{cvt|300,000,000|m/s}}, and [[speed of sound|sound]] travels through air at about {{cvt|343|m/s}}. An observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates. A lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately {{convert|343|m|abbr=on}} in distance; a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about {{cvt|1|km|disp=or}} (3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;343&nbsp;m). A flash preceding thunder by five seconds would indicate a distance of approximately {{cvt|1.5|km|disp=or}} (5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;343&nbsp;m).

Scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as \"'''filaments'''\". Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, playing the role of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered. According to the French and German scientists who ran the experiment, the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://infoniac.com/science/terawatt-laser-beam-shot-clouds-provokes-lightning-strike.html |title=Terawatt Laser Beam Shot in the Clouds Provokes Lightning Strike |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420130439/http://infoniac.com/science/terawatt-laser-beam-shot-clouds-provokes-lightning-strike.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} News report based on: {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1364/OE.16.005757 | pmid = 18542684 | title = Electric events synchronized with laser filaments in thunderclouds | journal = Optics Express | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 5757\u201363 | year = 2008 | last1 = Kasparian | first1 = J. | last2 = Ackermann | first2 = R. | last3 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = Y.

Lightning causes [[thunder]], a sound from the [[shock wave]] which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during [[thunderstorm]]s and other types of energetic [[weather]] systems, but [[volcanic lightning]] can also occur during volcanic eruptions.\n\nThe three main kinds of lightning are distinguished by where they occur: either inside a single [[thundercloud]], between two different clouds, or between a cloud and the ground. Many other observational variants are recognized, including \"[[heat lightning]]\", which can be seen from a great distance but not heard; [[dry lightning]], which can cause [[forest fires]]; and [[ball lightning]], which is rarely observed scientifically.\n\nHumans have [[Lightning in religion|deified lightning]] for millennia, and lightning-inspired expressions like \"bolt from the blue\", \"to be struck by lightning\" (as to having an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] or [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]), \"lightning never strikes twice (in the same place)\" and \"[[blitzkrieg]]\" are in common usage. In some languages, the notion of \"love at first sight\" literally translates as \"lightning strike\".\n\n==Electrification==\n[[File:Understanding Lightning - Figure 1 - Cloud Charging Area.gif|thumb|(Figure 1) The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from {{convert|-15|to|-25|C|F}}.]]\n\nThe details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists, but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification. The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from {{convert|-15|to|-25|C|F}}; see Figure 1. At that place, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and [[graupel]] (soft hail). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward.

When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged; see Figure 2.

This part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil. While this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud, some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm (updrafts and downdrafts).

Lightning's relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs, even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation.\nAbout 70% of lightning occurs over land in the [[tropics]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5oZUAAAAMAAJ&q=70%25+of+lightning+occurs+in+tropics+on+land&dq=70%25+of+lightning+occurs+in+tropics+on+land|title=Encyclopedia of atmospheric sciences|last=Holton|first=James R.|last2=Curry|first2=Judith A.|last3=Pyle|first3=J.

The flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses, such as the [[Gulf stream|Gulf Stream]], partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the [[Southeast United States]]. Because large bodies of water lack the topographic variation that would result in atmospheric mixing, lightning is notably less frequent over the world's oceans than over land. The [[north pole|North]] and [[south pole|South Poles]] are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least amount of lightning.{{Clarify|reason=absence of thunderstorms is similar to absence of lightning; an explanation of why are there less thunderstorms (lightning) above the poles would be more helpful|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn general, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes account for only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide. Since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged, this is where most CG lightning originates. This region is typically at the elevation where [[freezing level|freezing]] occurs within the cloud. Freezing, combined with collisions between ice and water, appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process. During wind-driven collisions, ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge, while a heavier, slushy mixture of ice and water (called [[graupel]]) develops a negative charge. Updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel, causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive [[space charge]] while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge.\n\n[[File:2013-08-07 04-23-26-foudre-belfort.jpg|thumb|Lightning in [[Belfort]], France]]\n\nBecause the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air, and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground, the proportion of CG strikes (versus cloud-to-cloud (CC) or in-cloud (IC) discharges) becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground. In the tropics, where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere, only 10% of lightning flashes are CG. At the latitude of Norway (around 60\u00b0 North latitude), where the freezing elevation is lower, 50% of lightning is CG.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast05dec_1/|date=December 5, 2001|title=Where LightningStrikes|publisher=NASA Science.

The atmosphere provides the electrical insulation, or barrier, that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity.\n\nIt is well understood that during a thunderstorm there is charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud; however the exact processes by which this occurs are not fully understood.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1993)032<0642:AROTEP>2.0.CO;2|volume=32|title=A Review of Thunderstorm Electrification Processes |last1=Saunders|first1=C.

The induced positive surface charge, when measured against a fixed point, will be small as the thundercloud approaches, increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes. The referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve.\n\nThe oppositely charged regions create an [[electric field]] within the air between them. This electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud \u2013 the greater the accumulated charge, the higher the electrical field.\n\n== Flashes and strikes ==\nThe best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground (CG). Although more common, intracloud (IC) and cloud to cloud (CC) flashes are very difficult to study given there are no \"physical\" points to monitor inside the clouds. Also, given the very low probability lightning will strike the same point repeatedly and consistently, scientific inquiry is difficult at best even in the areas of high CG frequency. As such, knowing flash propagation is similar amongst all forms of lightning, the best means to describe the process is through an examination of the most studied form, cloud to ground.[[File:Desert Electric.jpg|thumb|A lightning strike from cloud to ground in the [[Mojave Desert]], California]] \n[[File:Florescent cloud blanket.jpg|thumb|An intracloud flash. A lightning flash within the cloud, illuminates the entire blanket.]]\n\n=== Lightning leaders ===\n[[File:Lightning formation.gif|thumb|Lightning formation|thumb|A downward leader travels towards earth, branching as it goes.]]\n[[File:Leaderlightnig.gif|thumbnail|Lightning strike caused by the connection of two leaders, positive shown in blue and negative in red]]\n\nIn a process not well understood, a bidirectional channel of [[ionized]] air, called a \"[[leader (spark)|leader]]\", is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud. Leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through, or are otherwise attracted to, regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip. The negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region, also called a well, inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well. Leaders often split, forming branches in a tree-like pattern.<ref>Ultraslow-motion video of stepped leader propagation: [http://www.ztresearch.com/ ztresearch.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413125231/http://www.ztresearch.com/ |date=April 13, 2010 }}</ref> In addition, negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion, in a process called \"stepping\". The resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of lightning flashes.\n\nIt is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active. When this happens, the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash. In a typical cloud-to-ground flash, a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud. The weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground.\n\nThe positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions, positive upwards within the cloud and [[Electric charge|negative]] towards the earth. Both ionic channels proceed, in their respective directions, in a number of successive spurts. Each leader \"pools\" ions at the leading tips, shooting out one or more new leaders, momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions, then shooting out another leader.

The electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud, such as trees and tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough, a positively charged ionic channel, called a positive or upward [[Streamer discharge|streamer]], can develop from these points. This was first theorized by Heinz Kasemir.<ref>Kasemir, H. W.

Electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment, which expands across the entire leader network at a fraction of the speed of light. This is the 'return stroke' and it is the most [[Luminous intensity|luminous]] and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.\n\nA large electric current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground, neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area. This huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground. Called step potentials, they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself.<ref>See, for example, [https://www.livescience.com/55916-why-reindeer-killed-by-lightning.html here]</ref> Electricity takes every path available to it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Path of Least Resistance|url=http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104215214/http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|archivedate=January 4, 2016|df=mdy-all|date=July 2001}}</ref>\nA portion of the return stroke current will often preferentially flow through one leg and out another, electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes.\n\nThe electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative CG flash, often referred to as \"negative CG\" lightning. In some cases, a ground to cloud (GC) lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm. These discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures, such as communications antennas. The rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 100,000&nbsp;km/s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Idone | first1 = V. P. | last2 = Orville | first2 = R.

The core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50,000 K, causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color. Once the electric current stops flowing, the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds, often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas. The nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively, producing a powerful [[shock wave]] which is heard as [[#Thunder|thunder]].\n\n====Re-strike====\nHigh-speed videos (examined frame-by-frame) show that most negative CG lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes, though there may be as many as 30.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 5, p. 41.</ref>\n\nEach re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time, typically 40 to 50 milliseconds, as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes. Re-strikes often cause a noticeable \"[[strobe light]]\" effect.<ref name=\"uman\">[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] pp. 103\u2013110.</ref>\n\nTo understand why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel, one needs to understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on the tips of the decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called ''recoil leaders'', usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a ''dart leader'' travels across all or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground are what cause a majority of subsequent return strokes.<ref name=\"Warner\">{{cite web |url=https://ztresearch.blog/education/ground-flashes/ |title=Ground Flashes |last=Warner |first=Tom |website=ZT Research |access-date=2017-11-09|date=2017-05-06 }}</ref>\n\nEach successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke. Each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one, but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 9, p. 78.</ref>\n\nSince recoil and dart leader processes do not occur on negative leaders, subsequent return strokes very seldom utilize the same channel on positive ground flashes which are explained later in the article.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\n====Transient currents during flash====\nThe electric current within a typical negative CG lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 1\u201310 microseconds, then decays more slowly over 50\u2013200 microseconds. The transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground-based structures. Rapidly changing currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor, in what is called the [[skin effect]], unlike direct currents, which \"flow-through\" the entire conductor like water through a hose. Hence, conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi-stranded, with small wires woven together. This increases the total bundle [[surface area]] in inverse proportion to the individual strand radius, for a fixed total [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]].\n\nThe rapidly changing currents also create [[Electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulses (EMPs)]] that radiate outward from the ionic channel. This is a characteristic of all electrical discharges. The radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases. However, if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines, communication lines, or metallic pipes, they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination. The surge current is inversely related to the Surge impedance ... so the higher in impedance, then the lower the current.<ref>[http://sites.ieee.org/sas-pesias/files/2016/03/Lightning-Protection-and-Transient-Overvoltage_Rogerio-Verdolin.pdf Lightning Protection and Transient Overvoltage | VERDOLIN SOLUTIONS INC. | HIGH VOLTAGE POWER ENGINEERING SERVICES]</ref> This is the \"[[Voltage spike|surge]]\" that, more often than not, results in the destruction of delicate [[electronics]], [[electrical appliance]]s, or [[electric motor]]s. Devices known as [[Surge protector|surge protectors (SPD) or transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS)]] attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash's transient irregular current, and, through alteration of its physical properties, route the spike to an attached [[Electrical ground|earthing ground]], thereby protecting the equipment from damage.\n\n== Types ==\nThere are three primary types of lightning, defined by what is at the \"ends\" of a flash channel.\n*Intracloud (IC), which occurs within a single thundercloud unit\n*Cloud to cloud (CC) or intercloud, which starts and ends between two different \"functional\" thundercloud units\n*Cloud to ground (CG), that primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an Earth surface, but may also occur in the reverse direction, that is ground to cloud \nThere are variations of each type, such as \"positive\" versus \"negative\" CG flashes, that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured. Different [[common name]]s used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events.\n\n=== Cloud to ground (CG) ===\n[[File:Lightning strikes mountain top.jpg|thumb|right|''Cloud to ground'' lightning]]\nCloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground. It is initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud, which is met by a streamer moving up from the ground.\n\nCG is the least common, but best understood of all types of lightning.  It is easier to study scientifically, because it terminates on a physical object, namely the Earth, and lends itself to being measured by instruments on the ground. Of the three primary types of lightning, it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates or \"strikes\" the Earth. \nThe overall discharge, termed a flash, is composed of a number of processes such as preliminary breakdown, stepped leaders, connecting leaders, return strokes, dart leaders and subsequent return strokes.<ref>V.

Most CG lightning is negative, meaning that a negative charge is transferred to ground and electrons travel downward along the lightning channel. The reverse happens in a positive CG flash, where electrons travel upward along the lightning channel and a positive charge is transferred to the ground. Positive lightning is less common than negative lightning, and on average makes up less than 5% of all lightning strikes.<ref>{{cite web | title = NWS JetStream \u2013 The Positive and Negative Side of Lightning | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/positive.htm | accessdate = September 25, 2007 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070705205815/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/positive.htm | archivedate = July 5, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anvil-to-ground lightning.jpg|thumb|A ''bolt from the blue'' lightning strike which appears to initiate from the clear, but turbulent sky above the [[anvil cloud]] and drive a bolt of plasma through the cloud directly to the ground.

The most vivid crawler behavior occurs in well developed thunderstorms that feature extensive rear anvil shearing.\n\n=== Observational variations ===\n* '''Anvil crawler lightning''', sometimes called '''Spider lightning''' is created when leaders propagate through horizontally-extensive charge regions in mature thunderstorms, usually the stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems. These discharges usually begin as intracloud discharges originating within the convective region; the negative leader end then propagates well into the aforementioned charge regions in the stratiform area. If the leader becomes too long, it may separate into multiple bidirectional leaders. When this happens, the positive end of the separated leader may strike the ground as a positive CG flash or crawl on the underside of the cloud, creating a spectacular display of lightning crawling across the sky. Ground flashes produced in this manner tend to transfer high amounts of charge, and this can trigger upward lightning flashes and upper-atmospheric lightning.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n*'''[[Ball lightning]]''' may be an [[atmospheric electricity|atmospheric electrical]] phenomenon, the physical nature of which is still [[controversial]].

Due to the conductive properties of [[Aluminium alloy]], the fuselage acts as a [[Faraday cage]].\n\n=== Thunder ===\n{{main|Thunder}}\n\nBecause the electrostatic discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats the air to plasma temperatures along the length of the discharge channel in a short duration, [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a [[shock wave]] audible as thunder. Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning's path, the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel, by [[echo (phenomenon)|acoustic echoing]] from terrain, and by the usually multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike.\n\n[[Speed of light|Light travels]] at about {{cvt|300,000,000|m/s}}, and [[speed of sound|sound]] travels through air at about {{cvt|343|m/s}}. An observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates. A lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately {{convert|343|m|abbr=on}} in distance; a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about {{cvt|1|km|disp=or}} (3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;343&nbsp;m). A flash preceding thunder by five seconds would indicate a distance of approximately {{cvt|1.5|km|disp=or}} (5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;343&nbsp;m). Consequently, a lightning strike observed at a very close distance will be accompanied by a sudden clap of thunder, with almost no perceptible time lapse, possibly accompanied by the smell of [[ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>).\n\nLightning at a sufficient distance may be seen and not heard; there is data that a lightning storm can be seen at over {{cvt|100|mi|order=flip}} whereas the thunder travels about {{cvt|20|mi|order=flip}}.

Scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as \"'''filaments'''\". Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, playing the role of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 31 October 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]], inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]]. It has numerous [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements in its production, including clapping samples, a [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]], [[Synthesizer|synth]] bursts and [[Accent (music)|accented]] strings. A post-break up song, its lyrics find Lipa celebrating her independence and instructing a former lover to forget about their past relationship.\n\nThe track was critically acclaimed upon release with many reviewers noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and vocals. Critics also favoured its 1980s and disco elements for standing out among pop releases at the time. The song peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. Internationally, it charted in the top 10 in more than 40 different countries and topped the charts in Croatia, Ecuador, Ireland, Singapore and Slovenia. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and features [[point-of-view shot|point-of-view]] and [[high-angle shot]]s of Lipa dancing at a crowded nightclub and [[masquerade ball]]. To promote the single, Lipa performed it on many television programmes and awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa co-wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\": [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \"Don't Start Now\" first came about after the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] head at Lipa's record label, Joe Kentish, challenged Kirkpatrick in late 2018 to produce another track for the singer following the success of \"New Rules\".<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/9350891/producer-ian-kirkpatrick-interview|title=Producer Ian Kirkpatrick on Chart Success During Quarantine: 'It's a Very Strange Duality'|last=LeDonne|first=Rob|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> The song was first composed at Ailin's home in [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"SU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ian-kirkpatrick-songwriter-2020.htm|title=Ian Kirkpatrick Interview - Hit Songwriter and Producer|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|website=Songwriter Universe|date=20 February 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Kirkpatrick recalls it being \"a back and forth\" between the [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] sound that Lipa envisioned. Producer J Kash was involved during initial writing sessions.<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\"/>\n\nThe lyrics were written in January 2019 with a \"dance-around-the-room attitude\". Kirkpatrick included the use of a [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] in the first [[Demo (music)|demo]], based on phrasing in the chorus and inspired by music by [[Two Door Cinema Club]].

It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 31 October 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]], inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]]. It has numerous [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements in its production, including clapping samples, a [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]], [[Synthesizer|synth]] bursts and [[Accent (music)|accented]] strings. A post-break up song, its lyrics find Lipa celebrating her independence and instructing a former lover to forget about their past relationship.\n\nThe track was critically acclaimed upon release with many reviewers noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and vocals. Critics also favoured its 1980s and disco elements for standing out among pop releases at the time. The song peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. Internationally, it charted in the top 10 in more than 40 different countries and topped the charts in Croatia, Ecuador, Ireland, Singapore and Slovenia. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and features [[point-of-view shot|point-of-view]] and [[high-angle shot]]s of Lipa dancing at a crowded nightclub and [[masquerade ball]]. To promote the single, Lipa performed it on many television programmes and awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa co-wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\": [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \"Don't Start Now\" first came about after the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] head at Lipa's record label, Joe Kentish, challenged Kirkpatrick in late 2018 to produce another track for the singer following the success of \"New Rules\".<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/9350891/producer-ian-kirkpatrick-interview|title=Producer Ian Kirkpatrick on Chart Success During Quarantine: 'It's a Very Strange Duality'|last=LeDonne|first=Rob|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> The song was first composed at Ailin's home in [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"SU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ian-kirkpatrick-songwriter-2020.htm|title=Ian Kirkpatrick Interview - Hit Songwriter and Producer|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|website=Songwriter Universe|date=20 February 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Kirkpatrick recalls it being \"a back and forth\" between the [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] sound that Lipa envisioned. Producer J Kash was involved during initial writing sessions.<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\"/>\n\nThe lyrics were written in January 2019 with a \"dance-around-the-room attitude\". Kirkpatrick included the use of a [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] in the first [[Demo (music)|demo]], based on phrasing in the chorus and inspired by music by [[Two Door Cinema Club]].
