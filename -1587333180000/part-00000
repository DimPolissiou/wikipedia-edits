In 1993 the parliament moved from [[Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg]] to its present house on [[Niederkirchnerstra\u00dfe]] in [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]], which until 1934 was the seat of the [[Preu\u00dfischer Landtag|Prussian Landtag]]. The current president of the parliament is [[Ralf Wieland]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Prussian Landtag 2013 Interior 05.jpg|thumb|left|Staircase]]\nThe Abgeordnetenhaus was established by the new constitution of [[West Berlin]] in 1951. It replaced the former city legislature called ''Stadtverordnetenversammlung'' (city deputies assembly), established by the [[Prussian Reforms]] in 1808 and re-established by [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied]]-initiated state elections of 1946.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1990 the Abgeordnetenhaus was a parliament of restricted autonomy, since the [[Allied Control Council]] required that all its legislation and its elections, such as those of mayors and the senators (then still elected and not yet appointed by the mayor), be subject to Western Allied confirmation or rejection. After [[German reunification|reunification]] the Abgeordnetenhaus continued to be the parliament of united Berlin.\n\n==Elections==\n{{see also|Elections in Berlin}}\nThe parliament of Berlin is chosen every five years in a general, free, secret and direct ballot according to the principle of [[proportional representation]]. It consists of at least 130 representatives, 78 chosen directly in the [[electoral district]]s of the [[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|Berlin boroughs]], and 52 indirectly from land or district lists. If a party wins more constituency seats than its overall share of the vote, the overall size of the Abgeordnetenhaus increases because of these [[Overhang seat|overhang]] mandates.\n\nThe current distribution of seats as of the [[2016 Berlin state election|2016 election]] (compared to the [[2011 Berlin state election|2011 election]]) is:\n* [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD): 38 seats (-10)\n* [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU): 31 seats (-8)\n* [[Alliance '90/The Greens]]: 27 seats (-3)\n* [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]: 27 seats (+7)\n* [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD): 25 (+25)\n* [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP): 12 (+12)\n* [[Pirate Party Berlin]]: 0 seats (-15)\nThe [[Pirate Party Berlin]] lost the 15 seats it won for the first time in the 2011 election due to their failure to cross the 5% [[election threshold]] necessary to qualify for representation in the 2016 election while the AfD joined the assembly for the first time and the FDP returned following a recovery in voter support.\n\n== Functions ==\n[[File:Berlin Abgeordnetenhaus Schild 2-a.jpg|thumb|270px|Nameplate]]\nThe consideration and passing of [[legislation]] is the most important task, including the [[government budget]].

In 1537, the diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin consisted of the (modern) counties of [[Hordaland]] and [[Sogn og Fjordane]] (with exception of the parishes of [[Eidfjord]] and [[R\u00f8ldal]]). \n\nThe region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (to the north) was transferred from the [[Diocese of Nidaros]] to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The parish of [[Eidfjord]] was transferred from the [[Diocese of Stavanger]] to Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1630. The parish of [[R\u00f8ldal]] was transferred from the [[Diocese of Agder og Telemark|Diocese of Kristiansand]] to Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1863. The Sunnm\u00f8re region was removed from the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1983 when it, along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (from the [[Diocese of Nidaros]]), were established as a separate diocese, the [[Diocese of M\u00f8re]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesbok&bokid=lampe|title=Bergen stifts biskoper og pr\u00e6ster|first=Johan Fredrik|last=Lampe|publisher=Cammermeyers Boghandel|location=Kristiania|year=1895}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe [[Old Norse]] form of the name for Bergen was ''Bj\u01ebrgvin''.

In 1537, the diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin consisted of the (modern) counties of [[Hordaland]] and [[Sogn og Fjordane]] (with exception of the parishes of [[Eidfjord]] and [[R\u00f8ldal]]). \n\nThe region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (to the north) was transferred from the [[Diocese of Nidaros]] to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The parish of [[Eidfjord]] was transferred from the [[Diocese of Stavanger]] to Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1630. The parish of [[R\u00f8ldal]] was transferred from the [[Diocese of Agder og Telemark|Diocese of Kristiansand]] to Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1863. The Sunnm\u00f8re region was removed from the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1983 when it, along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (from the [[Diocese of Nidaros]]), were established as a separate diocese, the [[Diocese of M\u00f8re]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesbok&bokid=lampe|title=Bergen stifts biskoper og pr\u00e6ster|first=Johan Fredrik|last=Lampe|publisher=Cammermeyers Boghandel|location=Kristiania|year=1895}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe [[Old Norse]] form of the name for Bergen was ''Bj\u01ebrgvin''.

HOUR-LONG EPISODES ARE CONSIDERED TWO EPISODES. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE EPISODE NUMBERS IN THIS ARTICLE. -->\n\"'''Stress Relief'''\" is a two-part episode of the American comedy television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. They constituted the fourteenth and fifteenth episodes of the [[The Office (U.S. season 5)|fifth season]], and the 86th and 87th overall episodes of the series. Both episodes were directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]] and written by [[Paul Lieberstein]], who also plays [[Toby Flenderson]] on the show.\n\nIn this episode, Dwight stages a fire in the office to test the office's [[fire safety]] skills, but things go from bad to worse when Stanley suffers a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], causing Michael to come up with ways to relieve stress in the office, including a [[Roast (comedy)|comedic roast]] of himself. Meanwhile, Andy, Jim, and Pam watch an [[Copyright infringement|illegally downloaded]] movie at work starring [[Jack Black]], [[Jessica Alba]] and [[Cloris Leachman]], and Pam deals with her parents' recent argument that's caused her father to move in with her and Jim temporarily.\n\nBoth parts of \"Stress Relief\" originally aired together on February 1, 2009 immediately following NBC's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLIII]], and ''The Office'' writers and producers sought to attract newcomers to the series with the expected increase in viewership. Guest stars Black, Alba and Leachman do not interact with the regular characters themselves, but rather appear in a film within the episode. ''The Office'' creator [[Greg Daniels]] said this was done to keep the episode more grounded in reality.\n\nThe episode received generally positive reviews, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine declaring it the best overall television episode of any series in 2009. The episode is considered a favorite by many fans of the series. Many commentators particularly praised the chaotic [[cold open]] scene, in which Dwight panics his co-workers with a simulated fire as part of a twisted safety demonstration. Because it aired following the Super Bowl, \"Stress Relief\" was the most viewed episode of ''The Office'' with 22.9 million viewers according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]] during its original broadcast. It won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]], and received another nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Part one===\nAnnoyed that none of his co-workers paid attention to the fire safety seminar he gave last week, [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting the phone lines and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, crawling through air ducts and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals it was just a drill, but [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]) suffers a heart attack and collapses in the commotion. Dwight is subsequently censured by [[Dunder Mifflin]] [[CFO]] [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] ([[Andy Buckley]]), and [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael]] ([[Steve Carell]]) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn him to keep his stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign.\n\nWith tensions running high in the office, Michael tries to calm his workers down with [[yoga]] and [[meditation]] sessions. However, Michael soon realizes ''he'' is actually the source of his employees' stress when Stanley\u2019s stress reader beeps uncontrollably whenever Michael is nearby. Michael hands the stress reader to [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) and is horrified when the same result occurs. Meanwhile, [[Pam Beesly|Pam]]\u2019s ([[Jenna Fischer]]) parents are going through a rough patch in their marriage, and Pam\u2019s father is staying with her and [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]). Jim attempts to cheer Pam up by watching a pirated movie titled ''Mrs. Albert Hannaday'' with [[Andy Bernard|Andy]] ([[Ed Helms]]) (they do not know how to access such films while Andy does, so they have to watch the movie in Andy's company). The film stars [[Jack Black]], who is engaged to a character played by [[Jessica Alba]], but falls in love with her elderly grandmother, played by [[Cloris Leachman]]. During the movie, Jim and Pam discuss the situation with Pam\u2019s parents, but Andy believes their comments are directed at the characters in the film, leading him to conclude they are \"movie geniuses\" finding hidden depths in the film.\n\n===Part two===\nMichael decides the workers are stressed because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a [[roast (comedy)|comedic roast]] of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each of the office and warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. When Michael roasts Stanley, saying \"Stanley, you crush your wife during sex, and your heart sucks.\", Stanley laughs heartily, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.\n\nPam asks Jim to talk to her father and convince him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates.

HOUR-LONG EPISODES ARE CONSIDERED TWO EPISODES. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE EPISODE NUMBERS IN THIS ARTICLE. -->\n\"'''Stress Relief'''\" is a two-part episode of the American comedy television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. They constituted the fourteenth and fifteenth episodes of the [[The Office (U.S. season 5)|fifth season]], and the 86th and 87th overall episodes of the series. Both episodes were directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]] and written by [[Paul Lieberstein]], who also plays [[Toby Flenderson]] on the show.\n\nIn this episode, Dwight stages a fire in the office to test the office's [[fire safety]] skills, but things go from bad to worse when Stanley suffers a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], causing Michael to come up with ways to relieve stress in the office, including a [[Roast (comedy)|comedic roast]] of himself. Meanwhile, Andy, Jim, and Pam watch an [[Copyright infringement|illegally downloaded]] movie at work starring [[Jack Black]], [[Jessica Alba]] and [[Cloris Leachman]], and Pam deals with her parents' recent argument that's caused her father to move in with her and Jim temporarily.\n\nBoth parts of \"Stress Relief\" originally aired together on February 1, 2009 immediately following NBC's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLIII]], and ''The Office'' writers and producers sought to attract newcomers to the series with the expected increase in viewership. Guest stars Black, Alba and Leachman do not interact with the regular characters themselves, but rather appear in a film within the episode. ''The Office'' creator [[Greg Daniels]] said this was done to keep the episode more grounded in reality.\n\nThe episode received generally positive reviews, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine declaring it the best overall television episode of any series in 2009. The episode is considered a favorite by many fans of the series. Many commentators particularly praised the chaotic [[cold open]] scene, in which Dwight panics his co-workers with a simulated fire as part of a twisted safety demonstration. Because of its proximity to the Super Bowl, \"Stress Relief\" is the most viewed episode of ''The Office'' with 22.9 million viewers according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]] during its original broadcast. It won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]], and received another nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Part one===\nAnnoyed that none of his co-workers paid attention to the fire safety seminar he gave last week, [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting the phone lines and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, crawling through air ducts and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals it was just a drill, but [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]) suffers a heart attack and collapses in the commotion. Dwight is subsequently censured by [[Dunder Mifflin]] [[CFO]] [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] ([[Andy Buckley]]), and [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael]] ([[Steve Carell]]) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn him to keep his stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign.\n\nWith tensions running high in the office, Michael tries to calm his workers down with [[yoga]] and [[meditation]] sessions. However, Michael soon realizes ''he'' is actually the source of his employees' stress when Stanley\u2019s stress reader beeps uncontrollably whenever Michael is nearby. Michael hands the stress reader to [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) and is horrified when the same result occurs. Meanwhile, [[Pam Beesly|Pam]]\u2019s ([[Jenna Fischer]]) parents are going through a rough patch in their marriage, and Pam\u2019s father is staying with her and [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]). Jim attempts to cheer Pam up by watching a pirated movie titled ''Mrs. Albert Hannaday'' with [[Andy Bernard|Andy]] ([[Ed Helms]]) (they do not know how to access such films while Andy does, so they have to watch the movie in Andy's company). The film stars [[Jack Black]], who is engaged to a character played by [[Jessica Alba]], but falls in love with her elderly grandmother, played by [[Cloris Leachman]]. During the movie, Jim and Pam discuss the situation with Pam\u2019s parents, but Andy believes their comments are directed at the characters in the film, leading him to conclude they are \"movie geniuses\" finding hidden depths in the film.\n\n===Part two===\nMichael decides the workers are stressed because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a [[roast (comedy)|comedic roast]] of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each of the office and warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. When Michael roasts Stanley, saying \"Stanley, you crush your wife during sex, and your heart sucks.\", Stanley laughs heartily, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.\n\nPam asks Jim to talk to her father and convince him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.\n\nIn the final scene of the episode, the ending of the illegally downloaded movie is revealed: Jack Black visits Cloris Leachman with flowers and a new walker, only to discover her affair with another young man and he walks away heartbroken.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:PaulLieberstein.jpg|thumb|right |200 px|''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' actor and producer [[Paul Lieberstein]] wrote \"Stress Relief\"]]\n\n\"Stress Relief\" was directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]] and written by [[Paul Lieberstein]], who also plays [[Toby Flenderson]] on the show.

Sepinwall said \"Stress Relief\" was accessible to newcomers and regular viewers, and displayed both the comedic and human sides of the characters. He said the only drawback of the episode was the ''Mrs. Albert Hannaday'' subplot, which he felt was an unnecessary gimmick added solely to accommodate the guest stars.<ref name=\"Sepinwall\" /> ''[[TV Guide]]'' writer Shahzad Abbas wrote, \"This was one of my favorite episodes ever.

The main US forces defending [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]] (KSCB) were two [[Regiment#United States Marine Corps|regiments]] of the [[United States Marines Corps]] supported by elements from the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), as well as a small number of [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) troops. These were pitted against two to three [[army division|divisional-size]] elements of the [[North Vietnam]]ese [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN).\n\nThe US command in [[Saigon]] initially believed that combat operations around KSCB during 1967 were part of a series of minor PAVN offensives in the border regions. That appraisal was later altered when the PAVN was found to be moving major forces into the area. In response, US forces were built up before the PAVN isolated the Marine base. Once the base came under siege, a series of actions was fought over a period of five months. During this time, KSCB and the hilltop outposts around it were subjected to constant PAVN [[artillery]], mortar, and rocket attacks, and several infantry assaults. To support the Marine base, a massive aerial bombardment campaign ([[Operation Niagara]]) was launched by the USAF. Over 100,000 tons of bombs were dropped by US aircraft and over 158,000 artillery rounds were fired in defense of the base. Throughout the campaign, US forces used the latest technology to locate PAVN forces for targeting. Additionally, the logistical effort required to support the base once it was isolated demanded the implementation of other tactical innovations to keep the Marines supplied.\n\nIn March 1968, an overland relief expedition (Operation Pegasus) was launched by a combined Marine\u2013Army/ARVN task force that eventually broke through to the Marines at Khe Sanh. American commanders considered the defense of Khe Sanh a success, but shortly after the siege was lifted, the decision was made to dismantle the base rather than risk similar battles in the future. On 19 June 1968, the evacuation and destruction of KSCB began. Amid heavy shelling, the Marines attempted to salvage what they could before destroying what remained as they were evacuated. Minor attacks continued before the base was officially closed on 5 July. Marines remained around Hill 689, though, and fighting in the vicinity continued until 11 July until they were finally withdrawn, bringing the battle to a close.\n\nIn the aftermath, the North Vietnamese proclaimed a victory at Khe Sanh, while US forces claimed that they had withdrawn, as the base was no longer required. Historians have observed that the Battle of Khe Sanh may have distracted American and South Vietnamese attention from the buildup of [[Viet Cong]] (VC) forces in the south before the early 1968 [[Tet Offensive]]. Nevertheless, the US commander during the battle, General [[William Westmoreland]], maintained that the true intention of Tet was to distract forces from Khe Sanh.\n\n== Prelude ==\nThe village of Khe Sanh was the seat of government of H\u01b0\u01a1ng Hoa district, an area of Bru [[Degar|Montagnard]] villages and coffee plantations, situated about {{convert|7|mi}} from the Laotian frontier on [[National Road 9 (Vietnam)|Route 9]], the northernmost transverse road in South Vietnam. The badly deteriorated Route 9 ran from the coastal region through the western highlands, and then crossed the border into [[Laos]]. The origin of the combat base lay in the construction by [[United States Army Special Forces|US Army Special Forces]] of an airfield in August 1962 outside the village at an old French fort.<ref>Shulimson, p. 59.</ref> The camp then became a Special Forces outpost of the [[Civilian Irregular Defense Group]]s, whose purpose was to keep watch on PAVN infiltration along the border and to protect the local population.<ref name=Stanton35_48>Stanton, pp. 35\u201348.</ref>{{#tag:ref|For a succinct overview of the creation of the CIDG program and its operations.<ref name=Stanton35_48/>|group=Note}}\n\nJames Marino wrote that in 1964, General Westmoreland, the US commander in Vietnam, had determined, \"Khe Sanh could serve as a patrol base blocking enemy infiltration from Laos; a base for ... operations to harass the enemy in Laos; an airstrip for reconnaissance to survey the Ho Chi Minh Trail; a western anchor for the defenses south of the DMZ; and an eventual jumping-off point for ground operations to cut the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/strategic-crossroads-at-khe-sanh.htm |author=Marino, James I. |title=Strategic Crossroads at Khe Sanh |work=HistoryNet|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref> In November 1964, the Special Forces moved their camp to the Xom Cham Plateau, the future site of Khe Sanh Combat Base.<ref name=BPC131>Boston Publishing Company, p. 131.</ref>\n\n[[File:DMZ1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Map of northern [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]]]]\n\nDuring the winter of 1964, Khe Sanh became the location of a launch site for the highly classified [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam \u2013 Studies and Observations Group]] (the site was first established near the village and was later moved to the French fort).<ref>US Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, ''Command History 1965, Annex N''. Saigon, 1966, p. 18.</ref> From there, reconnaissance teams were launched into Laos to explore and gather intelligence on the PAVN logistical system known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (also known as \"Truong Son Strategic Supply Route\" to the North Vietnamese soldiers).<ref name=BPC131/>\n\nAccording to Marino, \"by 1966, Westmoreland had begun to consider Khe Sanh as part of a larger strategy\". With a view to eventually gaining approval for an advance through Laos to interdict the Ho Chi Minh Trail, he determined, \"it was absolutely essential to hold the base\", and he gave the order for US Marines to take up positions around Khe Sanh. [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] subsequently began planning for incursion into Laos, and in October, construction of an airfield at Khe Sanh was completed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThe plateau camp was permanently manned by the US Marines during 1967, when they established an outpost next to the airstrip. This base was to serve as the western anchor of Marine Corps forces, which had tactical responsibility for the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam known as [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]].<ref>Prados, pp. 140\u2013146</ref><ref>Dougan, Weiss, et al., p. 42.</ref> The Marines' defensive system stretched below the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) from the coast, along Route 9, to Khe Sanh. During 1966 the regular Special Forces troops had moved off the plateau and built a smaller camp down Route 9 at [[Lang Vei]], about half the distance to the Laotian border.<ref>Shulimson, p. 60.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n=== Border battles ===\n{{details|Battle of Dak To}}\nDuring the second half of 1967, the North Vietnamese instigated a series of actions in the border regions of South Vietnam. All of these attacks were conducted by regimental-size PAVN/VC units, but unlike the usual hit-and-run tactics used previously, these were sustained and bloody affairs.<ref>Eggleston, pp. 16\u2013122.</ref>\n\nIn early October, the PAVN had intensified battalion-sized ground probes and sustained artillery fire against [[Con Thien]], a hilltop stronghold in the center of the Marines' defensive line south of the DMZ in northern Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province.<ref>Telfer, Rogers, and Fleming, pp. 129\u2013131.</ref> Mortar rounds, artillery shells, and 122&nbsp;mm rockets fell randomly, but incessantly, upon the base. The September bombardments ranged from 100 to 150 rounds per day, with a maximum on 25 September of 1,190 rounds.<ref>Maitland and McInerney, p. 164.</ref> Westmoreland responded by launching Operation Neutralize, an aerial and naval bombardment campaign designed to break the siege. For seven weeks, American aircraft dropped from 35,000 to 40,000 tons of bombs in nearly 4,000 airstrikes.<ref name=\"M&M165\">Maitland and McInerney, p. 165.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hill 875 Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Combat on Hill 875, the most intense of the battles around Dak To]]\n\nOn 27 October, a PAVN regiment attacked an [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) battalion at [[S\u00f4ng B\u00e9 Base Camp|Song Be]], capital of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long Province.<ref name=\"M&M165\"/> The PAVN fought for several days, took casualties, and fell back. Two days later, the PAVN 273rd Regiment attacked a Special Forces camp near the border town of [[First Battle of Loc Ninh|Loc Ninh]], in [[B\u00ecnh Long Province]].<ref name=\"M&M165\"/> Troops of the US [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] were able to respond quickly. After a ten-day battle, the attackers were pushed back into [[Cambodia]]. At least 852 PAVN soldiers were killed during the action, as opposed to 50 American and South Vietnamese dead.<ref name=\"M&M165\"/>\n\nThe heaviest action took place near [[Battle of Dak To|Dak To]], in the central highlands province of Kon Tum. There, the presence of the PAVN [[1st Division (Vietnam)|1st Division]] prompted a 22-day battle that had some of the most intense close-quarters fighting of the entire conflict.<ref>Stanton, pp. 160\u2013169.</ref> American intelligence estimated between 1,200 and 1,600 PAVN troops were killed, while 362 members of the US [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team (United States)|173rd Airborne Brigade]], and ARVN [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division|Airborne]] elements were killed in action. Nonetheless, three of the four battalions of the 4th Infantry and the entire 173rd were rendered combat ineffective during the battle.<ref>Maitland and McInerney, p. 183.</ref>\n\nAmerican intelligence analysts were quite baffled by this series of enemy actions. For them, no logic was apparent behind the sustained PAVN/VC offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time: they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions, and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.<ref>Palmer, pp. 213\u2013215.</ref>\n\n=== Hill fights ===\n{{details|The Hill Fights}}\n[[File:kasa.jpg|thumb|left|The Khe Sanh Valley]]\n\nThings remained quiet in the Khe Sanh area through 1966. Even so, Westmoreland insisted that it not only be occupied by the Marines, but that it also be reinforced.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 432.</ref> He was vociferously opposed by General [[Lewis W. Walt]], the Marine commander of I Corps. Walt argued heatedly that the real target of the American effort should be the pacification and protection of the population, not chasing the PAVN/VC in the hinterlands.<ref>Murphy 2003, pp. 3\u20137, 13\u201314.</ref> Westmoreland won out, however, and the [[1st Battalion, 3rd Marines|1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment]] (1/3 Marines) was dispatched to occupy the camp and airstrip on 29 September. By late January 1967, the 1/3 returned to Japan and was relieved by Bravo Company, [[1st Battalion 9th Marines|1st Battalion, 9th Marines]] (1/9 Marines). A single company was replacing an entire battalion.<ref>Telfer, Rogers, and Fleming, p. 33.</ref>\n\n[[File:KS2.jpg|thumb|The Hill Fights]]\nOn 24 April 1967, a patrol from Bravo Company became engaged with a PAVN force of unknown size north of Hill 861. This action prematurely triggered a PAVN offensive aimed at taking Khe Sanh. The PAVN forces were in the process of gaining elevated terrain before the launching of the main attack.<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 79.</ref> The [[2nd Battalion 3rd Marines|2nd]] and [[3rd Battalion 3rd Marines|3rd Battalions]] of the [[3rd Marine Regiment (United States)|3rd Marine Regiment]], under the command of Colonel John P. Lanigan, reinforced KSCB and were given the task of pushing the PAVN off of Hills 861, 881 North, and 881 South. PAVN forces were driven out of the area around Khe Sanh after suffering 940 casualties. The Marines suffered 155 killed in action and 425 wounded.<ref>Shore, p. 17.</ref> To prevent PAVN observation of the main base at the airfield (and their possible use as firebases), the hills of the surrounding Khe Sanh Valley had to be continuously occupied and defended by separate Marine elements.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the hill fights, a lull in PAVN activity occurred around Khe Sanh. By the end of May, Marine forces were again drawn down from two battalions to one, the [[1st Battalion, 26th Marines]].<ref>Murphy 1997 p. 165.</ref> Lieutenant General [[Robert E. Cushman, Jr.]] relieved Walt as commander of III MAF in June.<ref>Long 2016, p. 125.</ref>\n\nOn 14 August, Colonel [[David E. Lownds]] took over as commander of the [[26th Marine Regiment]]. Sporadic actions were taken in the vicinity during the late summer and early fall, the most serious of which was the ambush of a supply convoy on Route 9. This proved to be the last overland attempt at resupply for Khe Sanh until the following March.<ref>Prados, p. 155.</ref> During December and early January, numerous sightings of PAVN troops and activities were made in the Khe Sanh area, but the sector remained relatively quiet.<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 233.</ref>\n\n=== Decisions ===\nA decision then had to be made by the American high command: either commit more of the limited manpower in I Corps to the defense of Khe Sanh or abandon the base.<ref name=Prados159>Prados and Stubbe, p. 159.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Only nine US battalions were available from Hue/Phu Bai northward.<ref name=Prados159/>|group=Note}} Westmoreland regarded this choice as quite simple. In his memoirs, he listed the reasons for a continued effort<blockquote>Khe Sanh could serve as a patrol base for blocking enemy infiltration from Laos along Route 9; as a base for SOG operations to harass the enemy in Laos; as an airstrip for reconnaissance planes surveying the Ho Chi Minh Trail; as the western anchor for defenses south of the DMZ; and as an eventual jump-off point for ground operations to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail.<ref name=Westmoreland236>Westmoreland, p. 236.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Westmoreland had been forwarding operational plans for an invasion of Laos since 1966. First there had been Operation Full Cry, the original three-division invasion plan. This was superseded by the smaller contingency plans ''Southpaw'' and ''High Port'' (1967). With Operation El Paso the General returned to a three-divisional plan in 1968. Another plan (''York'') envisioned the use of even larger forces.<ref>US Military Assistance Command, Vietnam ''Command History, 1966, Annex M''. Saigon, 1967, p. 60.</ref><ref>Van Staaveren, pp. 230 & 290.</ref>|group=Note}} </blockquote>\n\nLeading Marine officers, however, were not all of the same opinion. Cushman, the new III MAF commander, supported Westmoreland (perhaps wanting to mend Army/Marine relations after the departure of Walt).<ref>Shulimson, p. 67.</ref> Other concerns raised included the assertion that the real danger to I Corps was from a direct threat to [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]] City and other urban areas; that a defense would be pointless as a threat to infiltration, since PAVN troops could easily bypass Khe Sanh; that the base was too isolated and that the Marines \"had neither the helicopter resources, the troops, nor the logistical bases for such operations\". Additionally, Shore argues that the \"weather was another critical factor because the poor visibility and low overcasts attendant to the monsoon season made such operations hazardous.\"<ref>Shore, p. 47.</ref> Brigadier General Lowell English (assistant commander [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]]) complained that the defense of the isolated outpost was ludicrous. \"When you're at Khe Sanh, you're not really anywhere. You could lose it and you really haven't lost a damn thing.\"<ref name=\"D&W42\">Dougan and Weiss p. 42.</ref>\n\nAs far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all he needed to know was that the PAVN had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the prospect even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.<ref name=\"D&W42\"/>\n\n== Battle ==\n=== Attacks on the perimeter ===\n==== First skirmishes ====\nIn early December 1967, the PAVN appointed Major General [[Tran Quy Hai]] as the local commander for the actions around Khe Sanh, with Le Quang D\u1ea1o as his political commissar. In the coming days, a campaign headquarters was established around Sap Lit.<ref>Clarke, p. 146.</ref> Two divisions, the [[304th Division (Vietnam)|304th]] and the [[325th Division (Vietnam)|325th]], were assigned to the operation: the 325th was given responsibility for the area around the north, while the 304th was given responsibility for the southern sector.<ref>Clarke, p. 46.</ref> In attempting to determine PAVN intentions Marine intelligence confirmed that, within a period of just over a week, the 325th Division had moved into the vicinity of the base and two more divisions were within supporting distance. The 324th Division was located in the DMZ area {{convert|10\u201315|mi}} north of Khe Sanh while the [[320th Division (Vietnam)|320th Division]] was within easy reinforcing distance to the northeast.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 43.</ref> They were supported logistically from the nearby Ho Chi Minh Trail. As a result of this intelligence, KSCB was reinforced on 13 December by the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment. According to the official PAVN history, by December 1967 the North Vietnamese had in place, or within supporting distance: the 304th, 320th, [[324th Division (Vietnam)|324th]] and 325th Infantry Divisions, the independent 270th infantry Regiment; five artillery regiments (the 16th, 45th, 84th, 204th, and 675th); three [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AAA]] regiments (the 208th, 214th, and 228th); four tank companies; one engineer regiment plus one independent engineer battalion; one signal battalion; and a number of local force units.<ref>Military Institute of Vietnam, p. 216.</ref>\n\n[[File:KhSh9colkey.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Dispositions of opposing forces, January 1968]]\n\nAt positions west of Hill 881 South and north of Co Roc Ridge, across the border in Laos, the PAVN established artillery, rocket, and mortar positions from which to launch attacks by fire on the base and to support its ground operations. The PAVN 130&nbsp;mm and 152&nbsp;mm artillery pieces, and 122&nbsp;mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105&nbsp;mm and 155&nbsp;mm howitzers. This range overmatch was used by the PAVN to avoid [[counter-battery fire]].<ref>Shore, pp. 58\u201359.</ref><ref name=Barry/> They were assisted in their emplacement efforts by the continuing bad weather of the winter monsoon.<ref name=Shore72/>\n\nDuring the rainy night of 2 January 1968, six men dressed in black uniforms were seen outside the defensive wire of the main base by members of a listening post.

Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122-mm rockets slammed into the base, levelling most of the above-ground structures. One of the first enemy shells set off an explosion in the main ammunition dump.

Declassified documents show that in response, Westmoreland considered using nuclear weapons. In 1970, the Office of Air Force History published a then \"top secret\", but now declassified, 106-page report, titled ''The Air Force in Southeast Asia: Toward a Bombing Halt, 1968''. Journalist Richard Ehrlich writes that according to the report, \"in late January, General Westmoreland had warned that if the situation near the DMZ and at Khe Sanh worsened drastically, nuclear or chemical weapons might have to be used.\" The report continues to state, \"this prompted Air Force chief of staff, General John McConnell, to press, although unsuccessfully, for JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) authority to request Pacific Command to prepare a plan for using low-yield nuclear weapons to prevent a catastrophic loss of the U.S. Marine base.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JD17Ae01.html|title=The US's secret plan to nuke Vietnam, Laos |first= Richard|last= Ehrlich|website=Asia Times |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, ultimately the nuclear option was discounted by military planners. A secret memorandum reported by US Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], sent to US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on 19 February 1968, was declassified in 2005. It reveals that the nuclear option was discounted because of terrain considerations that were unique to South Vietnam, which would have reduced the effectiveness of tactical nuclear weapons. McNamara wrote: \"because of terrain and other conditions peculiar to our operations in South Vietnam, it is inconceivable that the use of nuclear weapons would be recommended there against either Viet Cong or North Vietnamese forces\". McNamara's thinking may have also been affected by his aide David Morrisroe (later VP at Cal Tech where McNamara later served as Trustee), whose brother Michael Morrisroe (1960 New York State Chess Champion) was serving at the base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www103.pair.com/adsd/khe-sanh/nukes/j021968a.jpg |title=Memorandum for the President, 19 February 1968 |last=McNamara |first=Robert |work=Khe Sanh Declassified Documents |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation Niagara ====\n{{details|topic=the bombing campaign|Operation Niagara}}\n{{details|topic=the electronic sensor system|Operation Igloo White}}\nDuring January, the recently installed electronic sensors of [[Operation Igloo White|Operation Muscle Shoals]] (later renamed \"Igloo White\"), which were undergoing test and evaluation in southeastern Laos, were alerted by a flurry of PAVN activity along the Ho Chi Minh Trail opposite the northwestern corner of South Vietnam. Due to the nature of these activities, and the threat that they posed to KSCB, Westmoreland ordered Operation Niagara I, an intense intelligence collection effort on PAVN activities in the vicinity of the Khe Sanh Valley.<ref name=autogenerated3>Van Staaveren, p. 290.</ref>\n\n[[File:IW2.jpg|thumb|US Navy OP-2E Neptune of VO-67, a variant of a naval patrol bomber and antisubmarine warfare aircraft specifically developed for the Muscle Shoals mission]]\nNiagara I was completed during the third week of January, and the next phase, Niagara II, was launched on the 21st,<ref>Pearson, p. 35.</ref> the day of the first PAVN artillery barrage.<ref name=Shulimson260_261/> The Marine [[Direct Air Support Center]] (DASC), located at KSCB, was responsible for the coordination of air strikes with artillery fire.

Momyer]], the responsibility for coordinating all air assets during the operation to support KSCB. This caused problems for the Marine command, which possessed its own aviation squadrons that operated under their own close air support doctrine. The Marines were extremely reluctant to relinquish authority over their aircraft to an Air Force general.<ref>Prados, pp. 295\u2013297.</ref> The command and control arrangement then in place in Southeast Asia went against Air Force doctrine, which was predicated on the single air manager concept. One headquarters would allocate and coordinate all air assets, distributing them wherever they were considered most necessary, and then transferring them as the situation required. The Marines, whose aircraft and doctrine were integral to their operations, were under no such centralized control. On 18 January, Westmoreland passed his request for Air Force control up the chain of command to [[United States Pacific Command|CINCPAC]] in Honolulu.<ref>Nalty, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nHeated debate arose among Westmoreland, [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] [[Leonard F. Chapman, Jr.]], and Army Chief of Staff [[Harold K. Johnson]]. Johnson backed the Marine position due to his concern over protecting the Army's air assets from Air Force co-option.<ref>Prados, p. 223.</ref> Westmoreland was so obsessed with the tactical situation that he threatened to resign if his wishes were not obeyed.<ref>Prados, p. 295.</ref> As a result, on 7 March, for the first time during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed under the control of a single manager.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was a diversion, including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.<ref>Donaldson, p. 115.</ref>\n\n==== Fall of Lang Vei ====\n{{main|Battle of Lang Vei}}\nThe Tet Offensive was launched prematurely in some areas on 30 January. On the following night, a massive wave of PAVN/VC attacks swept throughout South Vietnam, everywhere except Khe Sanh. The launching of the largest enemy offensive thus far in the conflict did not shift Westmoreland's focus away from Khe Sanh. A press release prepared on the following day (but never issued), at the height of Tet, showed that he was not about to be distracted. \"The enemy is attempting to confuse the issue&nbsp;... I suspect he is also trying to draw everyone's attention away from the greatest area of threat, the northern part of I Corps. Let me caution everyone not to be confused.\"<ref>Prados, p. 286.</ref><ref>Pisor, p. 152.</ref>\n\nNot much activity (with the exception of patrolling) had occurred thus far during the battle for the Special Forces of Detachment A-101 and their four companies of Bru CIDGs stationed at Lang Vei. Then, on the morning of 6 February, the PAVN fired mortars into the Lang Vei compound, wounding eight Camp Strike Force soldiers.<ref name=Pike35>Pike 2013, p. 35.</ref> At 18:10 hours, the PAVN followed up their morning mortar attack with an artillery strike from 152&nbsp;mm howitzers, firing 60 rounds into the camp. The strike wounded two more Strike Force soldiers and damaged two bunkers.<ref name=Pike35/>\n\nThe situation changed radically during the early morning hours of 7 February. The Americans had forewarning of PAVN armor in the area from Laotian refugees from camp BV-33. SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank tracks in the area surrounding Co Roc mountain.<ref>Plaster, p. 154</ref> Although the PAVN was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded an armored unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it impossible for them to get one down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.<ref>Prados, pp. 319\u2013320.</ref>\n\nIt still came as a shock to the Special Forces troopers at Lang Vei when 12 tanks attacked their camp. The Soviet-built [[PT-76]] amphibious tanks of the 203rd Armored Regiment churned over the defenses, backed up by an infantry assault by the 7th Battalion, 66th Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 24th Regiment, both elements of the 304th Division. The ground troops had been specially equipped for the attack with satchel charges, tear gas, and flame throwers. Although the camp's main defenses were overrun in only 13 minutes, the fighting lasted for several hours, during which the Special Forces men and Bru CIDGs managed to knock out at least five of the tanks.<ref>Prados, p. 329.</ref>\n\nThe Marines at Khe Sanh had a plan in place for providing a ground relief force in just such a contingency, but Lownds, fearing a PAVN ambush, refused to implement it. Lownds also rejected a proposal to launch a helicopter extraction of the survivors.<ref name=Shulimson276>Shulimson, p. 276.</ref> During a meeting at Da Nang at 07:00 the next morning, Westmoreland and Cushman accepted Lownds' decision. Army Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Ladd (commander, [[5th Special Forces Group]]), who had just flown in from Khe Sanh, was reportedly, \"astounded that the Marines, who prided themselves on leaving no man behind, were willing to write off all of the Green Berets and simply ignore the fall of Lang Vei.\"<ref name=Shulimson276/>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh Lang Vei SF-Camp Map.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|Attack on Lang Vei]]\n\nLadd and the commander of the SOG compound (whose men and camp had been incorporated into the defenses of KSCB) proposed that, if the Marines would provide the helicopters, the SOG reconnaissance men would go in themselves to pick up any survivors.<ref>Prados, pp. 332\u2013333.</ref> The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to issue an order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed.<ref>Prados, p. 333.</ref> The relief effort was not launched until 15:00, and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 Americans at the camp, 10 had been killed and 11 wounded.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 47.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The official North Vietnamese history claimed that 400 South Vietnamese troops had been killed and 253 captured. It claimed, however, that only three American advisors were killed during the action.<ref>Military History Institute of Vietnam, p. 222.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nLownds infuriated the Special Forces personnel even further when the indigenous survivors of Lang Vei, their families, civilian refugees from the area, and Laotian survivors from the camp at Ban Houei Sane arrived at the gate of KSCB. Lownds feared that PAVN infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position a short distance from the perimeter and from there, some of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and walked back down Route 9 toward Laos.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 276\u2013277.</ref>\n\nThe Lao troops were eventually flown back to their homeland, but not before the Laotian regional commander remarked that his army had to \"consider the South Vietnamese as enemy because of their conduct.\"<ref>Prados, p. 338.</ref> The Bru were excluded from evacuation from the highlands by an order from the ARVN I Corps commander, who ruled that no Bru be allowed to move into the lowlands.<ref>Prados, p. 340.</ref> Ladd, back on the scene, reported that the Marines stated, \"they couldn't trust any gooks in their damn camp.\"<ref name=Shulimson277>Shulimson, p. 277.</ref> There had been a history of distrust between the Special Forces personnel and the Marines, and General [[Rathvon M. Tompkins]], commander of the 3rd Marine Division, described the Special Forces soldiers as \"hopped up&nbsp;... wretches&nbsp;... [who] were a law unto themselves.\"<ref>Pisor, p. 76.</ref> At the end of January, Tompkins had ordered that no Marine patrols proceed more than 500 meters from the Combat Base.<ref name=\"Shulimson, p. 269\"/> Regardless, the SOG reconnaissance teams kept patrolling, providing the only human intelligence available in the battle area. This, however, did not prevent the Marine tanks within the perimeter from training their guns on the SOG camp.<ref name=Shulimson277/>\n\n==== Logistics and supporting fire ====\nLownds estimated that the logistical requirements of KSCB were 60 tons per day in mid-January and rose to 185 tons per day when all five battalions were in place.<ref>Shore, p. 90.</ref> The greatest impediments to the delivery of supplies to the base were the closure of Route 9 and the winter monsoon weather. For most of the battle, low-lying clouds and fog enclosed the area from early morning until around noon, and poor visibility severely hampered aerial resupply.<ref name=Shore72>Shore, p. 72.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh LAPES C-130.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|A C-130 delivering supplies with LAPES]]\n\nMaking matters worse for the defenders, any aircraft that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to PAVN antiaircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of PAVN artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then had to contend with antiaircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65% of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the USAF, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 49.</ref> The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the [[Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System]], in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land.<ref name=Barry>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/air-power-in-the-siege-of-khe-sanh.htm |title=Air Power in the Siege of Khe Sanh |work=HistoryNet |author=Barry, William A. |accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> The USAF delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop).

The fire of PAVN antiaircraft units took its toll of helicopters that made the attempt. The Marines found a solution to the problem in the \"Super Gaggle\" concept. A group of 12 [[A-4 Skyhawk]] fighter-bombers provided flak suppression for massed flights of 12\u201316 helicopters, which would resupply the hills simultaneously. The adoption of this concept at the end of February was the turning point in the resupply effort. After its adoption, Marine helicopters flew in 465 tons of supplies during February. When the weather later cleared in March, the amount was increased to 40 tons per day.<ref>Shore, p. 89.</ref>\n\nAs more infantry units had been assigned to defend KSCB, artillery reinforcement kept pace. By early January, the defenders could count on fire support from 46 artillery pieces of various calibers, five tanks armed with 90-mm guns, and 92 single or [[Ontos]]-mounted 106-mm recoilless rifles.<ref>Shore, p. 33.</ref> The base could also depend on fire support from US Army 175-mm guns located at [[Camp Carroll]], east of Khe Sanh.

The latest microwave/tropospheric scatter technology enabled them to maintain communications at all times.  The Khe Sanh site linked to another microwave/tropo site in Hue manned by the 513th Signal Detachment.  From the Hue site the communication signal was sent to Danang headquarters where it could be sent anywhere in the world.  The Khe Sanh microwave/tropo site was located in an underground bunker next to the airstrip and they had they had a personnel bunker next it it.  All the men on the team were killed (except the man on duty with the equipment in the other bunker) when the personnel bunker took a direct hit from an enemy artillery round. The men were replaced by an all volunteer team from the 337th Signal Company in Danang.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://armyhistory.org/1st-signal-brigade/|title=1st Signal Brigade \u2013 The Campaign for the National Museum of the United States Army}}</ref>     \n\n==== Attacks prior to relief of the base ====\nOn the night of the fall of Lang Vei, three companies of the PAVN 101D Regiment moved into jump-off positions to attack Alpha-1, an outpost just outside the Combat Base held by 66 men of Company A, 1st Platoon, 1/9 Marines. At 04:15 on 8 February under cover of fog and a mortar barrage, the PAVN penetrated the perimeter, overrunning most of the position and pushing the remaining 30 defenders into the southwestern portion of the defenses. For some unknown reason, the PAVN troops did not press their advantage and eliminate the pocket, instead throwing a steady stream of grenades at the Marines.<ref name=\"Shulimson277\"/> At 07:40, a relief force from Company A, 2nd Platoon set out from the main base and attacked through the PAVN, pushing them into supporting tank and artillery fire.<ref>Prados, p. 348.</ref> By 11:00, the battle was over, Company A had lost 24 dead and 27 wounded, while 150 PAVN bodies were found around the position, which was then abandoned.<ref>Shulimson, p.278.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe-Sanh-Web.gif|thumb|The Khe Sanh perimeter, 28 February 1968: A white dotted line indicates a PAVN trench just 200 m from 37th ARVN Rangers along the southern perimeter of Khe Sanh.]]\n\nOn 23 February, KSCB received its worst bombardment of the entire battle. During one 8-hour period, the base was rocked by 1,307 rounds, most of which came from [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130-mm]] (used for the first time on the battlefield) and 152-mm artillery pieces located in Laos.<ref>Shulimson, p. 279.</ref> Casualties from the bombardment were 10 killed and 51 wounded.

Two further attacks later in the morning were halted before the PAVN finally withdrew. The PAVN, however, were not through with the ARVN troops. Five more attacks against their sector were launched during March.<ref name=Shulimson281/>\n\nBy mid-March, Marine intelligence began to note an exodus of PAVN units from the Khe Sanh sector.<ref name=Shulimson281/> The 325C Divisional Headquarters was the first to leave, followed by the 95C and 101D Regiments, all of which relocated to the west. At the same time, the 304th Division withdrew to the southwest. That did not mean, however, that battle was over. On 22 March, over 1,000 North Vietnamese rounds fell on the base, and once again, the ammunition dump was detonated.<ref>Shulimson, p. 282.</ref>\n\nOn 30 March, Bravo Company, 26th Marines, launched an attack toward the location of the ambush that had claimed so many of their comrades on 25 February. Following a rolling barrage fired by nine artillery batteries, the Marine attack advanced through two PAVN trenchlines, but the Marines failed to locate the remains of the men of the ambushed patrol. The Marines claimed 115 PAVN killed, while their own casualties amounted to 10 dead, 100 wounded, and two missing.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 282\u2013283.</ref> At 08:00 the following day, Operation Scotland was officially terminated. Operational control of the Khe Sanh area was handed over to the US Army's [[1st Air Cavalry Division]] for the duration of Operation Pegasus.<ref name=Shulimson283>Shulimson, p. 283.</ref>\n\nCumulative friendly casualties for Operation Scotland, which began on 1 November 1967, were: 205 killed in action, 1,668 wounded, and 25 missing and presumed dead.<ref name=Shore131>Shore, p.131</ref> These figures do not include casualties among Special Forces troops at Lang Vei, aircrews killed or missing in the area, or Marine replacements killed or wounded while entering or exiting the base aboard aircraft. As far as PAVN casualties were concerned, 1,602 bodies were counted, seven prisoners were taken, and two soldiers defected to allied forces during the operation. American intelligence estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 PAVN troops were killed during the operation, equating to up to 90% of the attacking 17,200-man PAVN force.<ref name=Shulimson283/><ref name=Shore131/> The PAVN acknowledged 2,500 men killed in action.<ref name=autogenerated2>Dougan and Weiss, p. 55.</ref> They also reported 1,436 wounded before mid-March, of which 484 men returned to their units, while 396 were sent up the Ho Chi Minh Trail to hospitals in the north.<ref name=autogenerated4/>\n\n==== President Johnson orders that the base be held at all costs ====\nThe fighting at Khe Sanh was so volatile that the Joint Chiefs and MACV commanders were uncertain that the base could be held by the Marines. In the US, the media following the battle drew comparisons with the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which proved disastrous for the French.<ref>Ryan 1984, p.75.</ref><ref>Welburn 1996, p. 51.</ref> Nevertheless, according to Tom Johnson, President Johnson was \"determined that Khe Sanh [would not] be an 'American Dien Bien Phu'\". He subsequently ordered the US military to hold Khe Sanh at all costs. As a result, \"B-52 [[Operation Arc Light|Arc Light strikes]] originating in Guam, Okinawa, and Thailand bombed the jungles surrounding Khe Sanh into stubble fields\" and Khe Sanh became the major news headline coming out of Vietnam in late March 1968.<ref>Johnson, Chapter 18.</ref>\n\n=== Relief and retreat from Khe Sanh ===\n==== Operation Pegasus (1\u201314 April 1968) ====\nPlanning for the overland relief of Khe Sanh had begun as early as 25 January 1968, when Westmoreland ordered General [[John J. Tolson]], commander, First Cavalry Division, to prepare a contingency plan. Route 9, the only practical overland route from the east, was impassable due to its poor state of repair and the presence of PAVN troops. Tolson was not happy with the assignment, since he believed that the best course of action, after Tet, was to use his division in an attack into the [[A Shau Valley]]. Westmoreland, however, was already planning ahead. Khe Sanh would be relieved and then used as the jump-off point for a \"hot pursuit\" of enemy forces into Laos.<ref>Prados, pp. 418\u2013420.</ref>\n\nOn 2 March, Tolson laid out what became known as Operation Pegasus, the operational plan for what was to become the largest operation launched by III MAF thus far in the conflict. The [[2nd Battalion 1st Marines|2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment]] (2/1 Marines) and the 2/3 Marines would launch a ground assault from [[Ca Lu Combat Base]] (16&nbsp;km east of Khe Sanh) and head west on Route 9 while the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Brigades of the 1st Cavalry Division, would air-assault key terrain features along Route 9 to establish fire support bases and cover the Marine advance. The advance would be supported by 102 pieces of artillery.<ref>Prados, p. 428.</ref> The Marines would be accompanied by their 11th Engineer Battalion, which would repair the road as the advance moved forward. Later, the 1/1 Marines and 3rd ARVN Airborne Task Force (the 3rd, 6th, and 8th Airborne Battalions) would join the operation.<ref>Prados, p. 419.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh Operation Pegasus First Cavalry.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division moving towards Khe Sanh Combat Base during Operation Pegasus]]\n\nWestmoreland's planned relief effort infuriated the Marines, who had not wanted to hold Khe Sanh in the first place and who had been roundly criticized for not defending it well.<ref>Murphy 2003, pp. 239\u2013240. See also Pisor, p. 108.</ref> The Marines had constantly argued that technically, Khe Sanh had never been under siege, since it had never truly been isolated from resupply or reinforcement. Cushman was appalled by the \"implication of a rescue or breaking of the siege by outside forces.\"<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 240.</ref>\n\nRegardless, on 1 April, Operation Pegasus began.<ref>Shulimson, p. 284.</ref> Opposition from the North Vietnamese was light and the primary problem that hampered the advance was continual heavy morning cloud cover that slowed the pace of helicopter operations. As the relief force made progress, the Marines at Khe Sanh moved out from their positions and began patrolling at greater distances from the base. Things heated up for the air cavalrymen on 6 April, when the 3rd Brigade encountered a PAVN blocking force and fought a day-long engagement.<ref name=Shulimson287>Shulimson, p. 287.</ref>\n\nOn the following day, the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Air Cavalry captured the old French fort near Khe Sanh village after a three-day battle. The link-up between the relief force and the Marines at KSCB took place at 08:00 on 8 April, when the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment entered the camp.<ref>Shulimson, p. 286.</ref> The 11th Engineers proclaimed Route 9 open to traffic on 11 April. On that day, Tolson ordered his unit to immediately make preparations for [[Operation Delaware]], an air assault into the A Shau Valley.<ref name=Shulimson287/> At 08:00 on 15 April, Operation Pegasus was officially terminated.<ref name=\"Shulimson, p. 289\">Shulimson, p. 289.</ref> Total US casualties during the operation were 92 killed, 667 wounded, and five missing. Thirty-three ARVN troops were also killed and 187 were wounded.<ref>Sigler, p. 72.</ref> Because of the close proximity of the enemy and their high concentration, the massive B-52 bombings, tactical airstrikes, and vast use of artillery, PAVN casualties were estimated by MACV as being between 10,000 and 15,000 men.<ref>Tucker 1998, p. 340.</ref>\n\nLownds and the 26th Marines departed Khe Sanh, leaving the defense of the base to the 1st Marine Regiment. He made his final appearance in the story of Khe Sanh on 23 May, when his regimental sergeant major and he stood before President Johnson and were presented with a [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] on behalf of the 26th Marines.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 287\u2013289.</ref><ref>Jones, Chapters 21 & 22.</ref>\n\n==== Operation Scotland II ====\n{{main|Operation Scotland II}}\nOn 15 April, the 3rd Marine Division resumed responsibility for KSCB, Operation Pegasus ended, and Operation Scotland II began with the Marines seeking out the PAVN in the surrounding area.<ref name=\"Shulimson, p. 289\"/> Operation Scotland II would continue until 28 February 1969 resulting in 435 Marines and 3304 PAVN killed.<ref name=Smith>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Charles|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: High Mobility and Standdown 1969|publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps|url=https://archive.org/details/HighMobilityAndStanddown|year=1988|isbn=9781494287627|page=[https://archive.org/details/HighMobilityAndStanddown/page/n37 23]}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Peter Brush details that an \"additional 413 Marines were killed during Scotland II through the end of June 1968\".<ref name=autogenerated10 /> He goes on to state that a further 72 were killed as part Operation Scotland II throughout the remainder of the year, but that these deaths are not included in the official US casualty lists for the Battle of Khe Sanh. Twenty-five USAF personnel who were killed are also not included.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\n==== Operation Charlie: evacuation of the base ====\n[[File:3.4 Marines memorial service at Khe Sanh Combat Base.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|3/4 Marines memorial service at the base]]\n\nThe evacuation of Khe Sanh began on 19 June 1968 as Operation Charlie.<ref>Shulimson, p. 324.</ref> Useful equipment was withdrawn or destroyed, and personnel were evacuated. A limited attack was made by a PAVN company on 1 July, falling on a company from the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, who were holding a position 3&nbsp;km to the southeast of the base. Casualties were heavy among the attacking PAVN, who lost over 200 killed, while the defending Marines lost two men.<ref>Shulimson, p. 326.</ref> The official closure of the base came on 5 July after fighting, which had killed five more Marines. The withdrawal of the last Marines under the cover of darkness was hampered by the shelling of a bridge along Route 9, which had to be repaired before the withdrawal could be completed.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/>\n\nFollowing the closure of the base, a small force of Marines remained around Hill 689 carrying out mopping-up operations.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/>  Further fighting followed, resulting in the loss of another 11 Marines and 89 PAVN soldiers, before the Marines finally withdrew from the area on 11 July.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> According to Brush, it was \"the only occasion in which Americans abandoned a major combat base due to enemy pressure\" and in the aftermath, the North Vietnamese began a strong propaganda campaign, seeking to exploit the US withdrawal and to promote the message that the withdrawal had not been by choice.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\nRegardless, the PAVN had gained control of a strategically important area, and its lines of communication extended further into South Vietnam.<ref name=Rottman90/>  Once the news of the closure of KSCB was announced, the American media immediately raised questions about the reasoning behind its abandonment. They asked what had changed in six months so that American commanders were willing to abandon Khe Sanh in July. The explanations given out by the Saigon command were that \"the enemy had changed his tactics and reduced his forces; that PAVN had carved out new infiltration routes; that the Marines now had enough troops and helicopters to carry out mobile operations; that a fixed base was no longer necessary.\"<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 54.</ref>\n\nWhile KSCB was abandoned, the Marines continued to patrol the Khe Sanh plateau, including reoccupying the area with ARVN forces from 5\u201319 October 1968 with minimal opposition.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 409\u2013410.</ref> On 31 December 1968, the [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] was landed west of Khe Sanh to commence [[Operation Dawson River West]], on 2 January 1969 the 9th Marines and 2nd ARVN Regiment were also deployed on the plateau supported by the newly established Fire Support Bases Geiger and Smith; the 3-week operation found no significant PAVN forces or supplies in the Khe Sanh area.<ref>Smith, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> From 12 June to 6 July 1969, ''Task Force Guadalcanal'' comprising 1/9 Marines, [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment]] and 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 2nd ARVN Regiment occupied the Khe Sanh area in [[Operation Utah Mesa]].<ref>Smith, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> The Marines occupied [[Hill 950]] overlooking the Khe Sanh plateau from 1966 until September 1969 when control was handed to the Army who used the position as a SOG operations and support base until it was overrun by the PAVN in June 1971.<ref>Smith, p. 152.</ref><ref>Long 2013, pp. 355\u2013362.</ref> The gradual withdrawal of US forces began during 1969 and the adoption of [[Vietnamization]] meant that, by 1969, \"although limited tactical offensives abounded, US military participation in the war would soon be relegated to a defensive stance.\"<ref>Stanton, p. 246.</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian [[Ronald Spector]], to reasonably record the fighting at Khe Sanh as an American victory is impossible.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/> With the abandonment of the base, according to Thomas Ricks, \"Khe Sanh became etched in the minds of many Americans as a symbol of the pointless sacrifice and muddled tactics that permeated a doomed U.S. war effort in Vietnam\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/05/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-khe-sanh/|title=5 things you didn't know about Khe Sanh |author=Ricks, Thomas E. |date=5 June 2014|website=FP |access-date=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Termination of the McNamara Line ===\nCommencing in 1966, the US had attempted to establish a barrier system across the DMZ to prevent infiltration by North Vietnamese troops. Known as the [[McNamara Line]], it was initially codenamed \"Project Nine\" before being renamed \"Dye Marker\" by MACV in September 1967. This occurred just as the PAVN began the first phase of their offensive, launching attacks against Marine-held positions across the DMZ. These attacks hindered the advancement of the McNamara Line, and as the fighting around Khe Sanh intensified, vital equipment including sensors and other hardware had to be diverted from elsewhere to meet the needs of the US garrison at Khe Sanh. Construction on the line was ultimately abandoned and resources were later diverted towards implementing a more mobile strategy.<ref name=autogenerated8 />\n\n=== Assessment ===\nThe precise nature of Hanoi's strategic goal at Khe Sanh is regarded as one of the most intriguing unanswered questions of the Vietnam War. According to Gordon Rottman, even the North Vietnamese official history, ''Victory in Vietnam'', is largely silent on the issue.<ref>Rottman, Opposing plans.</ref> This question, known among American historians as the \"riddle of Khe Sanh\" has been summed up by John Prados and Ray Stubbe: \"Either the Tet Offensive was a diversion intended to facilitate PAVN/VC preparations for a war-winning battle at Khe Sanh, or Khe Sanh was a diversion to mesmerize Westmoreland in the days before Tet.\"<ref>Prados, p. 173.</ref> In assessing North Vietnamese intentions, Peter Brush cites the Vietnamese theater commander, [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]]'s claim \"that Khe Sanh itself was not of importance, but only a diversion to draw U.S. forces away from the populated areas of South Vietnam\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/BattleKheSanh1968.htm |title=The Battle of Khe Sanh |author=Brush, Peter |accessdate=10 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230121/http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/BattleKheSanh1968.htm |archivedate=16 July 2012  }}</ref> This has led other observers to conclude that the siege served a wider PAVN strategy; it diverted 30,000 US troops away from the cities that were the main targets of the Tet Offensive.<ref>Page and Pimlott, p. 324.</ref>\n\nWhether the PAVN actually planned to capture Khe Sanh and whether the battle was an attempt to replicate the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] triumph against the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu has long been a point of contention. Westmoreland believed that the latter was the case and this belief was the basis for his desire to stage \"Dien Bien Phu in reverse\".<ref>Pisor, p. 61.</ref> Those who agree with Westmoreland reason that no other explanation exists as to why Hanoi would have committed so many forces to the area instead of deploying them for the Tet Offensive. The fact that the North Vietnamese only committed about half of their available forces to the offensive (60\u201370,000), the majority of whom were VC, is cited in favor of Westmoreland's argument. Other theories argued that the forces around Khe Sanh were simply a localized defensive measure in the DMZ area, or that they were serving as a reserve in case of an offensive American end run in the mode of the American [[Battle of Inchon|invasion at Inchon]] during the [[Korean War]]. However, North Vietnamese sources claim that the Americans did not win a victory at Khe Sanh, but they were forced to retreat to avoid destruction. The PAVN claimed that Khe Sanh was \"a stinging defeat from both the military and political points of view\": Westmoreland was replaced two months after the end of the battle and his successor explained the retreat in different ways.<ref name=\"historynet_a\" />\n\n[[File:Wallace Greene, Robert Cushman and William Westmoreland.jpg|thumb|left|General Wallace Greene, Commandant of the Marine Corps (l), Lieutenant General Robert Cushman, III MAF Commander (c), and General William Westmoreland (r)]]\n\nGeneral [[Creighton Abrams]] has also suggested that the North Vietnamese may have been planning to emulate Dien Bien Phu. He believed that the PAVN's actions during Tet proved it.<ref>Warren, p. 333.</ref> He cited the fact that it would have taken longer to [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf|dislodge the North Vietnamese at Hue]] if the PAVN had committed the three divisions at Khe Sanh to the battle there (although the PAVN did commit three regiments to the fighting from the Khe Sanh sector), instead of dividing their forces.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 38.</ref>\n\nAnother interpretation was that the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy has come to be known as the Option Play. If the PAVN could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive.<ref>Pisor, p. 210.</ref> This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the PAVN would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but the price they were willing to pay had limits. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that the actions around Khe Sanh (and the other border battles) were simply a feint, a ruse meant to focus American attention (and forces) on the border. General and historian Dave Palmer accepts this rationale: \"General Giap never had any intention of capturing Khe Sanh&nbsp;... [it] was a feint, a diversionary effort. And it had accomplished its purpose magnificently.\"<ref>Palmer, p. 219.</ref>{{#tag:ref|This is also the position taken in the official PAVN history, but which offers no further explanation of the strategy.<ref>Military History Institute of Vietnam, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nMarine General Rathvon M. Tompkins, commander of the 3rd Marine Division, has pointed out that had the PAVN actually intended to take Khe Sanh, PAVN troops could have cut the base's sole source of water, a stream 500 m outside the perimeter of the base. Had they simply contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided enough water to the Marines.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Marine Lieutenant General [[Victor Krulak]] seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by also arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever cut by the PAVN.<ref>Krulak, p. 218.</ref><ref>Shulimson p. 289.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sahn airstrip looking west.JPG|thumb|right|Khe Sanh airstrip, December 2006]]\n\nOne argument leveled by Westmoreland at the time (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several PAVN divisions.<ref>Pisor, p. 240.</ref> At the time Hanoi made the decision to move in around the base, though, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. Whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four PAVN divisions was debatable. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops\u2014nearly 50 maneuver battalions\u2014to I Corps.<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 235.</ref><br />\n\n=== Use during Operation Lam Son 719 ===\nOn 30 January 1971, the ARVN and US forces launched [[Operation Dewey Canyon II]], which involved the reopening of Route 9, securing the Khe Sanh area and reoccupying of KSCB as a forward supply base for [[Operation Lam Son 719]]. On 8 February 1971, the leading ARVN units marched along Route 9 into southern Laos while the US ground forces and advisers were prohibited from entering Laos.

The main US forces defending [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]] (KSCB) were two [[Regiment#United States Marine Corps|regiments]] of the [[United States Marines Corps]] supported by elements from the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), as well as a small number of [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) troops. These were pitted against two to three [[army division|divisional-size]] elements of the [[North Vietnam]]ese [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN).\n\nThe US command in [[Saigon]] initially believed that combat operations around KSCB during 1967 were part of a series of minor PAVN offensives in the border regions. That appraisal was later altered when the PAVN was found to be moving major forces into the area. In response, US forces were built up before the PAVN isolated the Marine base. Once the base came under siege, a series of actions was fought over a period of five months. During this time, KSCB and the hilltop outposts around it were subjected to constant PAVN [[artillery]], mortar, and rocket attacks, and several infantry assaults. To support the Marine base, a massive aerial bombardment campaign ([[Operation Niagara]]) was launched by the USAF. Over 100,000 tons of bombs were dropped by US aircraft and over 158,000 artillery rounds were fired in defense of the base. Throughout the campaign, US forces used the latest technology to locate PAVN forces for targeting. Additionally, the logistical effort required to support the base once it was isolated demanded the implementation of other tactical innovations to keep the Marines supplied.\n\nIn March 1968, an overland relief expedition (Operation Pegasus) was launched by a combined Marine\u2013Army/ARVN task force that eventually broke through to the Marines at Khe Sanh. American commanders considered the defense of Khe Sanh a success, but shortly after the siege was lifted, the decision was made to dismantle the base rather than risk similar battles in the future. On 19 June 1968, the evacuation and destruction of KSCB began. Amid heavy shelling, the Marines attempted to salvage what they could before destroying what remained as they were evacuated. Minor attacks continued before the base was officially closed on 5 July. Marines remained around Hill 689, though, and fighting in the vicinity continued until 11 July until they were finally withdrawn, bringing the battle to a close.\n\nIn the aftermath, the North Vietnamese proclaimed a victory at Khe Sanh, while US forces claimed that they had withdrawn, as the base was no longer required. Historians have observed that the Battle of Khe Sanh may have distracted American and South Vietnamese attention from the buildup of [[Viet Cong]] (VC) forces in the south before the early 1968 [[Tet Offensive]]. Nevertheless, the US commander during the battle, General [[William Westmoreland]], maintained that the true intention of Tet was to distract forces from Khe Sanh.\n\n== Prelude ==\nThe village of Khe Sanh was the seat of government of H\u01b0\u01a1ng Hoa district, an area of Bru [[Degar|Montagnard]] villages and coffee plantations, situated about {{convert|7|mi}} from the Laotian frontier on [[National Road 9 (Vietnam)|Route 9]], the northernmost transverse road in South Vietnam. The badly deteriorated Route 9 ran from the coastal region through the western highlands, and then crossed the border into [[Laos]]. The origin of the combat base lay in the construction by [[United States Army Special Forces|US Army Special Forces]] of an airfield in August 1962 outside the village at an old French fort.<ref>Shulimson, p. 59.</ref> The camp then became a Special Forces outpost of the [[Civilian Irregular Defense Group]]s, whose purpose was to keep watch on PAVN infiltration along the border and to protect the local population.<ref name=Stanton35_48>Stanton, pp. 35\u201348.</ref>{{#tag:ref|For a succinct overview of the creation of the CIDG program and its operations.<ref name=Stanton35_48/>|group=Note}}\n\nJames Marino wrote that in 1964, General Westmoreland, the US commander in Vietnam, had determined, \"Khe Sanh could serve as a patrol base blocking enemy infiltration from Laos; a base for ... operations to harass the enemy in Laos; an airstrip for reconnaissance to survey the Ho Chi Minh Trail; a western anchor for the defenses south of the DMZ; and an eventual jumping-off point for ground operations to cut the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/strategic-crossroads-at-khe-sanh.htm |author=Marino, James I. |title=Strategic Crossroads at Khe Sanh |work=HistoryNet|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref> In November 1964, the Special Forces moved their camp to the Xom Cham Plateau, the future site of Khe Sanh Combat Base.<ref name=BPC131>Boston Publishing Company, p. 131.</ref>\n\n[[File:DMZ1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Map of northern [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]]]]\n\nDuring the winter of 1964, Khe Sanh became the location of a launch site for the highly classified [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam \u2013 Studies and Observations Group]] (the site was first established near the village and was later moved to the French fort).<ref>US Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, ''Command History 1965, Annex N''. Saigon, 1966, p. 18.</ref> From there, reconnaissance teams were launched into Laos to explore and gather intelligence on the PAVN logistical system known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (also known as \"Truong Son Strategic Supply Route\" to the North Vietnamese soldiers).<ref name=BPC131/>\n\nAccording to Marino, \"by 1966, Westmoreland had begun to consider Khe Sanh as part of a larger strategy\". With a view to eventually gaining approval for an advance through Laos to interdict the Ho Chi Minh Trail, he determined, \"it was absolutely essential to hold the base\", and he gave the order for US Marines to take up positions around Khe Sanh. [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] subsequently began planning for incursion into Laos, and in October, construction of an airfield at Khe Sanh was completed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThe plateau camp was permanently manned by the US Marines during 1967, when they established an outpost next to the airstrip. This base was to serve as the western anchor of Marine Corps forces, which had tactical responsibility for the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam known as [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]].<ref>Prados, pp. 140\u2013146</ref><ref>Dougan, Weiss, et al., p. 42.</ref> The Marines' defensive system stretched below the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) from the coast, along Route 9, to Khe Sanh. During 1966 the regular Special Forces troops had moved off the plateau and built a smaller camp down Route 9 at [[Lang Vei]], about half the distance to the Laotian border.<ref>Shulimson, p. 60.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n=== Border battles ===\n{{details|Battle of Dak To}}\nDuring the second half of 1967, the North Vietnamese instigated a series of actions in the border regions of South Vietnam. All of these attacks were conducted by regimental-size PAVN/VC units, but unlike the usual hit-and-run tactics used previously, these were sustained and bloody affairs.<ref>Eggleston, pp. 16\u2013122.</ref>\n\nIn early October, the PAVN had intensified battalion-sized ground probes and sustained artillery fire against [[Con Thien]], a hilltop stronghold in the center of the Marines' defensive line south of the DMZ in northern Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province.<ref>Telfer, Rogers, and Fleming, pp. 129\u2013131.</ref> Mortar rounds, artillery shells, and 122&nbsp;mm rockets fell randomly, but incessantly, upon the base. The September bombardments ranged from 100 to 150 rounds per day, with a maximum on 25 September of 1,190 rounds.<ref>Maitland and McInerney, p. 164.</ref> Westmoreland responded by launching Operation Neutralize, an aerial and naval bombardment campaign designed to break the siege. For seven weeks, American aircraft dropped from 35,000 to 40,000 tons of bombs in nearly 4,000 airstrikes.<ref name=\"M&M165\">Maitland and McInerney, p. 165.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hill 875 Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Combat on Hill 875, the most intense of the battles around Dak To]]\n\nOn 27 October, a PAVN regiment attacked an [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) battalion at [[S\u00f4ng B\u00e9 Base Camp|Song Be]], capital of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long Province.<ref name=\"M&M165\"/> The PAVN fought for several days, took casualties, and fell back. Two days later, the PAVN 273rd Regiment attacked a Special Forces camp near the border town of [[First Battle of Loc Ninh|Loc Ninh]], in [[B\u00ecnh Long Province]].<ref name=\"M&M165\"/> Troops of the US [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] were able to respond quickly. After a ten-day battle, the attackers were pushed back into [[Cambodia]]. At least 852 PAVN soldiers were killed during the action, as opposed to 50 American and South Vietnamese dead.<ref name=\"M&M165\"/>\n\nThe heaviest action took place near [[Battle of Dak To|Dak To]], in the central highlands province of Kon Tum. There, the presence of the PAVN [[1st Division (Vietnam)|1st Division]] prompted a 22-day battle that had some of the most intense close-quarters fighting of the entire conflict.<ref>Stanton, pp. 160\u2013169.</ref> American intelligence estimated between 1,200 and 1,600 PAVN troops were killed, while 362 members of the US [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team (United States)|173rd Airborne Brigade]], and ARVN [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division|Airborne]] elements were killed in action. Nonetheless, three of the four battalions of the 4th Infantry and the entire 173rd were rendered combat ineffective during the battle.<ref>Maitland and McInerney, p. 183.</ref>\n\nAmerican intelligence analysts were quite baffled by this series of enemy actions. For them, no logic was apparent behind the sustained PAVN/VC offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time: they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions, and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.<ref>Palmer, pp. 213\u2013215.</ref>\n\n=== Hill fights ===\n{{details|The Hill Fights}}\n[[File:kasa.jpg|thumb|left|The Khe Sanh Valley]]\n\nThings remained quiet in the Khe Sanh area through 1966. Even so, Westmoreland insisted that it not only be occupied by the Marines, but that it also be reinforced.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 432.</ref> He was vociferously opposed by General [[Lewis W. Walt]], the Marine commander of I Corps. Walt argued heatedly that the real target of the American effort should be the pacification and protection of the population, not chasing the PAVN/VC in the hinterlands.<ref>Murphy 2003, pp. 3\u20137, 13\u201314.</ref> Westmoreland won out, however, and the [[1st Battalion, 3rd Marines|1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment]] (1/3 Marines) was dispatched to occupy the camp and airstrip on 29 September. By late January 1967, the 1/3 returned to Japan and was relieved by Bravo Company, [[1st Battalion 9th Marines|1st Battalion, 9th Marines]] (1/9 Marines).

This action prematurely triggered a PAVN offensive aimed at taking Khe Sanh. The PAVN forces were in the process of gaining elevated terrain before the launching of the main attack.<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 79.</ref> The [[2nd Battalion 3rd Marines|2nd]] and [[3rd Battalion 3rd Marines|3rd Battalions]] of the [[3rd Marine Regiment (United States)|3rd Marine Regiment]], under the command of Colonel John P.

Sporadic actions were taken in the vicinity during the late summer and early fall, the most serious of which was the ambush of a supply convoy on Route 9. This proved to be the last overland attempt at resupply for Khe Sanh until the following March.<ref>Prados, p. 155.</ref> During December and early January, numerous sightings of PAVN troops and activities were made in the Khe Sanh area, but the sector remained relatively quiet.<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 233.</ref>\n\n=== Decisions ===\nA decision then had to be made by the American high command: either commit more of the limited manpower in I Corps to the defense of Khe Sanh or abandon the base.<ref name=Prados159>Prados and Stubbe, p. 159.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Only nine US battalions were available from Hue/Phu Bai northward.<ref name=Prados159/>|group=Note}} Westmoreland regarded this choice as quite simple. In his memoirs, he listed the reasons for a continued effort<blockquote>Khe Sanh could serve as a patrol base for blocking enemy infiltration from Laos along Route 9; as a base for SOG operations to harass the enemy in Laos; as an airstrip for reconnaissance planes surveying the Ho Chi Minh Trail; as the western anchor for defenses south of the DMZ; and as an eventual jump-off point for ground operations to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail.<ref name=Westmoreland236>Westmoreland, p. 236.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Westmoreland had been forwarding operational plans for an invasion of Laos since 1966.

Cushman, the new III MAF commander, supported Westmoreland (perhaps wanting to mend Army/Marine relations after the departure of Walt).<ref>Shulimson, p. 67.</ref> Other concerns raised included the assertion that the real danger to I Corps was from a direct threat to [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]] City and other urban areas; that a defense would be pointless as a threat to infiltration, since PAVN troops could easily bypass Khe Sanh; that the base was too isolated and that the Marines \"had neither the helicopter resources, the troops, nor the logistical bases for such operations\". Additionally, Shore argues that the \"weather was another critical factor because the poor visibility and low overcasts attendant to the monsoon season made such operations hazardous.\"<ref>Shore, p. 47.</ref> Brigadier General Lowell English (assistant commander [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]]) complained that the defense of the isolated outpost was ludicrous. \"When you're at Khe Sanh, you're not really anywhere. You could lose it and you really haven't lost a damn thing.\"<ref name=\"D&W42\">Dougan and Weiss p. 42.</ref>\n\nAs far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all he needed to know was that the PAVN had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the prospect even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.<ref name=\"D&W42\"/>\n\n== Battle ==\n=== Attacks on the perimeter ===\n==== First skirmishes ====\nIn early December 1967, the PAVN appointed Major General [[Tran Quy Hai]] as the local commander for the actions around Khe Sanh, with Le Quang D\u1ea1o as his political commissar. In the coming days, a campaign headquarters was established around Sap Lit.<ref>Clarke, p. 146.</ref> Two divisions, the [[304th Division (Vietnam)|304th]] and the [[325th Division (Vietnam)|325th]], were assigned to the operation: the 325th was given responsibility for the area around the north, while the 304th was given responsibility for the southern sector.<ref>Clarke, p. 46.</ref> In attempting to determine PAVN intentions Marine intelligence confirmed that, within a period of just over a week, the 325th Division had moved into the vicinity of the base and two more divisions were within supporting distance. The 324th Division was located in the DMZ area {{convert|10\u201315|mi}} north of Khe Sanh while the [[320th Division (Vietnam)|320th Division]] was within easy reinforcing distance to the northeast.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 43.</ref> They were supported logistically from the nearby Ho Chi Minh Trail. As a result of this intelligence, KSCB was reinforced on 13 December by the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment. According to the official PAVN history, by December 1967 the North Vietnamese had in place, or within supporting distance: the 304th, 320th, [[324th Division (Vietnam)|324th]] and 325th Infantry Divisions, the independent 270th infantry Regiment; five artillery regiments (the 16th, 45th, 84th, 204th, and 675th); three [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AAA]] regiments (the 208th, 214th, and 228th); four tank companies; one engineer regiment plus one independent engineer battalion; one signal battalion; and a number of local force units.<ref>Military Institute of Vietnam, p. 216.</ref>\n\n[[File:KhSh9colkey.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Dispositions of opposing forces, January 1968]]\n\nAt positions west of Hill 881 South and north of Co Roc Ridge, across the border in Laos, the PAVN established artillery, rocket, and mortar positions from which to launch attacks by fire on the base and to support its ground operations. The PAVN 130&nbsp;mm and 152&nbsp;mm artillery pieces, and 122&nbsp;mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105&nbsp;mm and 155&nbsp;mm howitzers.

After failing to respond to a challenge, they were fired upon and five were killed outright while the sixth, although wounded, escaped.{{#tag:ref|A myth has grown up around this incident.

The PAVN infantry, though bracketed by artillery fire, still managed to penetrate the perimeter of the defenses and were only driven back after severe close-quarters combat.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 258\u2013259.</ref>\n\nThe main base was then subjected to an intense mortar and rocket barrage. Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122-mm rockets slammed into the base, levelling most of the above-ground structures. One of the first enemy shells set off an explosion in the main ammunition dump. Many of the artillery and mortar rounds stored in the dump were thrown into the air and detonated on impact within the base. Soon after, another shell hit a cache of [[tear gas]], which saturated the entire area.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 44.</ref> The fighting and shelling on 21 January resulted in 14 Marines killed and 43 wounded.<ref>Shulimson, p. 261.</ref> Hours after the bombardment ceased, the base was still in danger. At around 10:00, the fire ignited a large quantity of explosives, rocking the base with another series of detonations.<ref>Shulimson, p. 260.</ref>\n\nAt the same time as the artillery bombardment at KSCB, an attack was launched against Khe Sanh village, seat of [[H\u01b0\u1edbng H\u00f3a District]]. The village, 3&nbsp;km south of the base, was defended by 160 local Bru troops, plus 15 American advisers. At dawn of 21 January, it was attacked by a roughly 300-strong PAVN battalion. A platoon from Company D, 1/26 Marines was sent from the base but was withdrawn in the face of the superior PAVN forces. Reinforcements from the ARVN 256th [[South Vietnamese Regional Force|Regional Force]] (RF) company were dispatched aboard nine [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] helicopters of the 282nd Assault Helicopter Company, but they were landed near the abandoned French fort/former FOB-3 which was occupied by the PAVN who killed many of the RF troops and 4 Americans, including Lieutenant colonel Joseph Seymoe the deputy adviser for Quang Tri Province and forcing the remaining helicopters to abandon the mission. On the morning of 22 January Lownds decided to evacuate the remaining forces in the village with most of the Americans evacuated by helicopter while two advisers led the surviving local forces overland to the combat base.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://www.vva.org/veteran/0807/khesanh.html|title=Khe Sanh: The Other Side Of The Hill |author=Prados, John |work=The VVA Veteran |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706021028/http://www.vva.org/veteran/0807/khesanh.html|archivedate=6 July 2014}}</ref><ref>Shulimson, p. 261-4.</ref>\n\nTo eliminate any threat to their flank, the PAVN attacked Laotian Battalion BV-33, located at [[Ban Houei Sane]], on Route 9 in Laos.

Declassified documents show that in response, Westmoreland considered using nuclear weapons. In 1970, the Office of Air Force History published a then \"top secret\", but now declassified, 106-page report, titled ''The Air Force in Southeast Asia: Toward a Bombing Halt, 1968''. Journalist Richard Ehrlich writes that according to the report, \"in late January, General Westmoreland had warned that if the situation near the DMZ and at Khe Sanh worsened drastically, nuclear or chemical weapons might have to be used.\" The report continues to state, \"this prompted Air Force chief of staff, General John McConnell, to press, although unsuccessfully, for JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) authority to request Pacific Command to prepare a plan for using low-yield nuclear weapons to prevent a catastrophic loss of the U.S. Marine base.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JD17Ae01.html|title=The US's secret plan to nuke Vietnam, Laos |first= Richard|last= Ehrlich|website=Asia Times |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, ultimately the nuclear option was discounted by military planners. A secret memorandum reported by US Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], sent to US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on 19 February 1968, was declassified in 2005. It reveals that the nuclear option was discounted because of terrain considerations that were unique to South Vietnam, which would have reduced the effectiveness of tactical nuclear weapons. McNamara wrote: \"because of terrain and other conditions peculiar to our operations in South Vietnam, it is inconceivable that the use of nuclear weapons would be recommended there against either Viet Cong or North Vietnamese forces\". McNamara's thinking may have also been affected by his aide David Morrisroe (later VP at Cal Tech where McNamara later served as Trustee), whose brother Michael Morrisroe (1960 New York State Chess Champion) was serving at the base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www103.pair.com/adsd/khe-sanh/nukes/j021968a.jpg |title=Memorandum for the President, 19 February 1968 |last=McNamara |first=Robert |work=Khe Sanh Declassified Documents |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation Niagara ====\n{{details|topic=the bombing campaign|Operation Niagara}}\n{{details|topic=the electronic sensor system|Operation Igloo White}}\nDuring January, the recently installed electronic sensors of [[Operation Igloo White|Operation Muscle Shoals]] (later renamed \"Igloo White\"), which were undergoing test and evaluation in southeastern Laos, were alerted by a flurry of PAVN activity along the Ho Chi Minh Trail opposite the northwestern corner of South Vietnam. Due to the nature of these activities, and the threat that they posed to KSCB, Westmoreland ordered Operation Niagara I, an intense intelligence collection effort on PAVN activities in the vicinity of the Khe Sanh Valley.<ref name=autogenerated3>Van Staaveren, p. 290.</ref>\n\n[[File:IW2.jpg|thumb|US Navy OP-2E Neptune of VO-67, a variant of a naval patrol bomber and antisubmarine warfare aircraft specifically developed for the Muscle Shoals mission]]\nNiagara I was completed during the third week of January, and the next phase, Niagara II, was launched on the 21st,<ref>Pearson, p. 35.</ref> the day of the first PAVN artillery barrage.<ref name=Shulimson260_261/> The Marine [[Direct Air Support Center]] (DASC), located at KSCB, was responsible for the coordination of air strikes with artillery fire.

Momyer]], the responsibility for coordinating all air assets during the operation to support KSCB. This caused problems for the Marine command, which possessed its own aviation squadrons that operated under their own close air support doctrine. The Marines were extremely reluctant to relinquish authority over their aircraft to an Air Force general.<ref>Prados, pp. 295\u2013297.</ref> The command and control arrangement then in place in Southeast Asia went against Air Force doctrine, which was predicated on the single air manager concept. One headquarters would allocate and coordinate all air assets, distributing them wherever they were considered most necessary, and then transferring them as the situation required. The Marines, whose aircraft and doctrine were integral to their operations, were under no such centralized control. On 18 January, Westmoreland passed his request for Air Force control up the chain of command to [[United States Pacific Command|CINCPAC]] in Honolulu.<ref>Nalty, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nHeated debate arose among Westmoreland, [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] [[Leonard F. Chapman, Jr.]], and Army Chief of Staff [[Harold K. Johnson]]. Johnson backed the Marine position due to his concern over protecting the Army's air assets from Air Force co-option.<ref>Prados, p. 223.</ref> Westmoreland was so obsessed with the tactical situation that he threatened to resign if his wishes were not obeyed.<ref>Prados, p. 295.</ref> As a result, on 7 March, for the first time during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed under the control of a single manager.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was a diversion, including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.<ref>Donaldson, p. 115.</ref>\n\n==== Fall of Lang Vei ====\n{{main|Battle of Lang Vei}}\nThe Tet Offensive was launched prematurely in some areas on 30 January. On the following night, a massive wave of PAVN/VC attacks swept throughout South Vietnam, everywhere except Khe Sanh. The launching of the largest enemy offensive thus far in the conflict did not shift Westmoreland's focus away from Khe Sanh. A press release prepared on the following day (but never issued), at the height of Tet, showed that he was not about to be distracted. \"The enemy is attempting to confuse the issue&nbsp;... I suspect he is also trying to draw everyone's attention away from the greatest area of threat, the northern part of I Corps. Let me caution everyone not to be confused.\"<ref>Prados, p. 286.</ref><ref>Pisor, p. 152.</ref>\n\nNot much activity (with the exception of patrolling) had occurred thus far during the battle for the Special Forces of Detachment A-101 and their four companies of Bru CIDGs stationed at Lang Vei. Then, on the morning of 6 February, the PAVN fired mortars into the Lang Vei compound, wounding eight Camp Strike Force soldiers.<ref name=Pike35>Pike 2013, p. 35.</ref> At 18:10 hours, the PAVN followed up their morning mortar attack with an artillery strike from 152&nbsp;mm howitzers, firing 60 rounds into the camp. The strike wounded two more Strike Force soldiers and damaged two bunkers.<ref name=Pike35/>\n\nThe situation changed radically during the early morning hours of 7 February. The Americans had forewarning of PAVN armor in the area from Laotian refugees from camp BV-33. SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank tracks in the area surrounding Co Roc mountain.<ref>Plaster, p. 154</ref> Although the PAVN was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded an armored unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it impossible for them to get one down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.<ref>Prados, pp. 319\u2013320.</ref>\n\nIt still came as a shock to the Special Forces troopers at Lang Vei when 12 tanks attacked their camp. The Soviet-built [[PT-76]] amphibious tanks of the 203rd Armored Regiment churned over the defenses, backed up by an infantry assault by the 7th Battalion, 66th Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 24th Regiment, both elements of the 304th Division. The ground troops had been specially equipped for the attack with satchel charges, tear gas, and flame throwers. Although the camp's main defenses were overrun in only 13 minutes, the fighting lasted for several hours, during which the Special Forces men and Bru CIDGs managed to knock out at least five of the tanks.<ref>Prados, p. 329.</ref>\n\nThe Marines at Khe Sanh had a plan in place for providing a ground relief force in just such a contingency, but Lownds, fearing a PAVN ambush, refused to implement it. Lownds also rejected a proposal to launch a helicopter extraction of the survivors.<ref name=Shulimson276>Shulimson, p. 276.</ref> During a meeting at Da Nang at 07:00 the next morning, Westmoreland and Cushman accepted Lownds' decision. Army Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Ladd (commander, [[5th Special Forces Group]]), who had just flown in from Khe Sanh, was reportedly, \"astounded that the Marines, who prided themselves on leaving no man behind, were willing to write off all of the Green Berets and simply ignore the fall of Lang Vei.\"<ref name=Shulimson276/>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh Lang Vei SF-Camp Map.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|Attack on Lang Vei]]\n\nLadd and the commander of the SOG compound (whose men and camp had been incorporated into the defenses of KSCB) proposed that, if the Marines would provide the helicopters, the SOG reconnaissance men would go in themselves to pick up any survivors.<ref>Prados, pp. 332\u2013333.</ref> The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to issue an order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed.<ref>Prados, p. 333.</ref> The relief effort was not launched until 15:00, and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded.

It claimed, however, that only three American advisors were killed during the action.<ref>Military History Institute of Vietnam, p. 222.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nLownds infuriated the Special Forces personnel even further when the indigenous survivors of Lang Vei, their families, civilian refugees from the area, and Laotian survivors from the camp at Ban Houei Sane arrived at the gate of KSCB. Lownds feared that PAVN infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position a short distance from the perimeter and from there, some of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and walked back down Route 9 toward Laos.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 276\u2013277.</ref>\n\nThe Lao troops were eventually flown back to their homeland, but not before the Laotian regional commander remarked that his army had to \"consider the South Vietnamese as enemy because of their conduct.\"<ref>Prados, p. 338.</ref> The Bru were excluded from evacuation from the highlands by an order from the ARVN I Corps commander, who ruled that no Bru be allowed to move into the lowlands.<ref>Prados, p. 340.</ref> Ladd, back on the scene, reported that the Marines stated, \"they couldn't trust any gooks in their damn camp.\"<ref name=Shulimson277>Shulimson, p. 277.</ref> There had been a history of distrust between the Special Forces personnel and the Marines, and General [[Rathvon M.

[who] were a law unto themselves.\"<ref>Pisor, p. 76.</ref> At the end of January, Tompkins had ordered that no Marine patrols proceed more than 500 meters from the Combat Base.<ref name=\"Shulimson, p. 269\"/> Regardless, the SOG reconnaissance teams kept patrolling, providing the only human intelligence available in the battle area. This, however, did not prevent the Marine tanks within the perimeter from training their guns on the SOG camp.<ref name=Shulimson277/>\n\n==== Logistics and supporting fire ====\nLownds estimated that the logistical requirements of KSCB were 60 tons per day in mid-January and rose to 185 tons per day when all five battalions were in place.<ref>Shore, p. 90.</ref> The greatest impediments to the delivery of supplies to the base were the closure of Route 9 and the winter monsoon weather. For most of the battle, low-lying clouds and fog enclosed the area from early morning until around noon, and poor visibility severely hampered aerial resupply.<ref name=Shore72>Shore, p. 72.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh LAPES C-130.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|A C-130 delivering supplies with LAPES]]\n\nMaking matters worse for the defenders, any aircraft that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to PAVN antiaircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of PAVN artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then had to contend with antiaircraft fire on the way out.

The fire of PAVN antiaircraft units took its toll of helicopters that made the attempt. The Marines found a solution to the problem in the \"Super Gaggle\" concept. A group of 12 [[A-4 Skyhawk]] fighter-bombers provided flak suppression for massed flights of 12\u201316 helicopters, which would resupply the hills simultaneously. The adoption of this concept at the end of February was the turning point in the resupply effort. After its adoption, Marine helicopters flew in 465 tons of supplies during February.

At 04:15 on 8 February under cover of fog and a mortar barrage, the PAVN penetrated the perimeter, overrunning most of the position and pushing the remaining 30 defenders into the southwestern portion of the defenses. For some unknown reason, the PAVN troops did not press their advantage and eliminate the pocket, instead throwing a steady stream of grenades at the Marines.<ref name=\"Shulimson277\"/> At 07:40, a relief force from Company A, 2nd Platoon set out from the main base and attacked through the PAVN, pushing them into supporting tank and artillery fire.<ref>Prados, p. 348.</ref> By 11:00, the battle was over, Company A had lost 24 dead and 27 wounded, while 150 PAVN bodies were found around the position, which was then abandoned.<ref>Shulimson, p.278.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe-Sanh-Web.gif|thumb|The Khe Sanh perimeter, 28 February 1968: A white dotted line indicates a PAVN trench just 200 m from 37th ARVN Rangers along the southern perimeter of Khe Sanh.]]\n\nOn 23 February, KSCB received its worst bombardment of the entire battle.

At 21:30, the attack came on, but it was stifled by the small arms of the Rangers, who were supported by thousands of artillery rounds and air strikes. Two further attacks later in the morning were halted before the PAVN finally withdrew. The PAVN, however, were not through with the ARVN troops. Five more attacks against their sector were launched during March.<ref name=Shulimson281/>\n\nBy mid-March, Marine intelligence began to note an exodus of PAVN units from the Khe Sanh sector.<ref name=Shulimson281/> The 325C Divisional Headquarters was the first to leave, followed by the 95C and 101D Regiments, all of which relocated to the west.

In the US, the media following the battle drew comparisons with the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which proved disastrous for the French.<ref>Ryan 1984, p.75.</ref><ref>Welburn 1996, p. 51.</ref> Nevertheless, according to Tom Johnson, President Johnson was \"determined that Khe Sanh [would not] be an 'American Dien Bien Phu'\". He subsequently ordered the US military to hold Khe Sanh at all costs. As a result, \"B-52 [[Operation Arc Light|Arc Light strikes]] originating in Guam, Okinawa, and Thailand bombed the jungles surrounding Khe Sanh into stubble fields\" and Khe Sanh became the major news headline coming out of Vietnam in late March 1968.<ref>Johnson, Chapter 18.</ref>\n\n=== Relief and retreat from Khe Sanh ===\n==== Operation Pegasus (1\u201314 April 1968) ====\nPlanning for the overland relief of Khe Sanh had begun as early as 25 January 1968, when Westmoreland ordered General [[John J. Tolson]], commander, First Cavalry Division, to prepare a contingency plan. Route 9, the only practical overland route from the east, was impassable due to its poor state of repair and the presence of PAVN troops. Tolson was not happy with the assignment, since he believed that the best course of action, after Tet, was to use his division in an attack into the [[A Shau Valley]]. Westmoreland, however, was already planning ahead. Khe Sanh would be relieved and then used as the jump-off point for a \"hot pursuit\" of enemy forces into Laos.<ref>Prados, pp. 418\u2013420.</ref>\n\nOn 2 March, Tolson laid out what became known as Operation Pegasus, the operational plan for what was to become the largest operation launched by III MAF thus far in the conflict. The [[2nd Battalion 1st Marines|2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment]] (2/1 Marines) and the 2/3 Marines would launch a ground assault from [[Ca Lu Combat Base]] (16&nbsp;km east of Khe Sanh) and head west on Route 9 while the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Brigades of the 1st Cavalry Division, would air-assault key terrain features along Route 9 to establish fire support bases and cover the Marine advance. The advance would be supported by 102 pieces of artillery.<ref>Prados, p. 428.</ref> The Marines would be accompanied by their 11th Engineer Battalion, which would repair the road as the advance moved forward. Later, the 1/1 Marines and 3rd ARVN Airborne Task Force (the 3rd, 6th, and 8th Airborne Battalions) would join the operation.<ref>Prados, p. 419.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh Operation Pegasus First Cavalry.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division moving towards Khe Sanh Combat Base during Operation Pegasus]]\n\nWestmoreland's planned relief effort infuriated the Marines, who had not wanted to hold Khe Sanh in the first place and who had been roundly criticized for not defending it well.<ref>Murphy 2003, pp. 239\u2013240. See also Pisor, p. 108.</ref> The Marines had constantly argued that technically, Khe Sanh had never been under siege, since it had never truly been isolated from resupply or reinforcement. Cushman was appalled by the \"implication of a rescue or breaking of the siege by outside forces.\"<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 240.</ref>\n\nRegardless, on 1 April, Operation Pegasus began.<ref>Shulimson, p. 284.</ref> Opposition from the North Vietnamese was light and the primary problem that hampered the advance was continual heavy morning cloud cover that slowed the pace of helicopter operations. As the relief force made progress, the Marines at Khe Sanh moved out from their positions and began patrolling at greater distances from the base. Things heated up for the air cavalrymen on 6 April, when the 3rd Brigade encountered a PAVN blocking force and fought a day-long engagement.<ref name=Shulimson287>Shulimson, p. 287.</ref>\n\nOn the following day, the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Air Cavalry captured the old French fort near Khe Sanh village after a three-day battle.

A limited attack was made by a PAVN company on 1 July, falling on a company from the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, who were holding a position 3&nbsp;km to the southeast of the base. Casualties were heavy among the attacking PAVN, who lost over 200 killed, while the defending Marines lost two men.<ref>Shulimson, p. 326.</ref> The official closure of the base came on 5 July after fighting, which had killed five more Marines. The withdrawal of the last Marines under the cover of darkness was hampered by the shelling of a bridge along Route 9, which had to be repaired before the withdrawal could be completed.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/>\n\nFollowing the closure of the base, a small force of Marines remained around Hill 689 carrying out mopping-up operations.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/>  Further fighting followed, resulting in the loss of another 11 Marines and 89 PAVN soldiers, before the Marines finally withdrew from the area on 11 July.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> According to Brush, it was \"the only occasion in which Americans abandoned a major combat base due to enemy pressure\" and in the aftermath, the North Vietnamese began a strong propaganda campaign, seeking to exploit the US withdrawal and to promote the message that the withdrawal had not been by choice.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\nRegardless, the PAVN had gained control of a strategically important area, and its lines of communication extended further into South Vietnam.<ref name=Rottman90/>  Once the news of the closure of KSCB was announced, the American media immediately raised questions about the reasoning behind its abandonment. They asked what had changed in six months so that American commanders were willing to abandon Khe Sanh in July. The explanations given out by the Saigon command were that \"the enemy had changed his tactics and reduced his forces; that PAVN had carved out new infiltration routes; that the Marines now had enough troops and helicopters to carry out mobile operations; that a fixed base was no longer necessary.\"<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 54.</ref>\n\nWhile KSCB was abandoned, the Marines continued to patrol the Khe Sanh plateau, including reoccupying the area with ARVN forces from 5\u201319 October 1968 with minimal opposition.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 409\u2013410.</ref> On 31 December 1968, the [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] was landed west of Khe Sanh to commence [[Operation Dawson River West]], on 2 January 1969 the 9th Marines and 2nd ARVN Regiment were also deployed on the plateau supported by the newly established Fire Support Bases Geiger and Smith; the 3-week operation found no significant PAVN forces or supplies in the Khe Sanh area.<ref>Smith, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> From 12 June to 6 July 1969, ''Task Force Guadalcanal'' comprising 1/9 Marines, [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment]] and 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 2nd ARVN Regiment occupied the Khe Sanh area in [[Operation Utah Mesa]].<ref>Smith, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> The Marines occupied [[Hill 950]] overlooking the Khe Sanh plateau from 1966 until September 1969 when control was handed to the Army who used the position as a SOG operations and support base until it was overrun by the PAVN in June 1971.<ref>Smith, p. 152.</ref><ref>Long 2013, pp. 355\u2013362.</ref> The gradual withdrawal of US forces began during 1969 and the adoption of [[Vietnamization]] meant that, by 1969, \"although limited tactical offensives abounded, US military participation in the war would soon be relegated to a defensive stance.\"<ref>Stanton, p. 246.</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian [[Ronald Spector]], to reasonably record the fighting at Khe Sanh as an American victory is impossible.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/> With the abandonment of the base, according to Thomas Ricks, \"Khe Sanh became etched in the minds of many Americans as a symbol of the pointless sacrifice and muddled tactics that permeated a doomed U.S. war effort in Vietnam\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/05/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-khe-sanh/|title=5 things you didn't know about Khe Sanh |author=Ricks, Thomas E. |date=5 June 2014|website=FP |access-date=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Termination of the McNamara Line ===\nCommencing in 1966, the US had attempted to establish a barrier system across the DMZ to prevent infiltration by North Vietnamese troops. Known as the [[McNamara Line]], it was initially codenamed \"Project Nine\" before being renamed \"Dye Marker\" by MACV in September 1967. This occurred just as the PAVN began the first phase of their offensive, launching attacks against Marine-held positions across the DMZ. These attacks hindered the advancement of the McNamara Line, and as the fighting around Khe Sanh intensified, vital equipment including sensors and other hardware had to be diverted from elsewhere to meet the needs of the US garrison at Khe Sanh. Construction on the line was ultimately abandoned and resources were later diverted towards implementing a more mobile strategy.<ref name=autogenerated8 />\n\n=== Assessment ===\nThe precise nature of Hanoi's strategic goal at Khe Sanh is regarded as one of the most intriguing unanswered questions of the Vietnam War. According to Gordon Rottman, even the North Vietnamese official history, ''Victory in Vietnam'', is largely silent on the issue.<ref>Rottman, Opposing plans.</ref> This question, known among American historians as the \"riddle of Khe Sanh\" has been summed up by John Prados and Ray Stubbe: \"Either the Tet Offensive was a diversion intended to facilitate PAVN/VC preparations for a war-winning battle at Khe Sanh, or Khe Sanh was a diversion to mesmerize Westmoreland in the days before Tet.\"<ref>Prados, p. 173.</ref> In assessing North Vietnamese intentions, Peter Brush cites the Vietnamese theater commander, [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]]'s claim \"that Khe Sanh itself was not of importance, but only a diversion to draw U.S. forces away from the populated areas of South Vietnam\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/BattleKheSanh1968.htm |title=The Battle of Khe Sanh |author=Brush, Peter |accessdate=10 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230121/http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/BattleKheSanh1968.htm |archivedate=16 July 2012  }}</ref> This has led other observers to conclude that the siege served a wider PAVN strategy; it diverted 30,000 US troops away from the cities that were the main targets of the Tet Offensive.<ref>Page and Pimlott, p. 324.</ref>\n\nWhether the PAVN actually planned to capture Khe Sanh and whether the battle was an attempt to replicate the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] triumph against the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu has long been a point of contention. Westmoreland believed that the latter was the case and this belief was the basis for his desire to stage \"Dien Bien Phu in reverse\".<ref>Pisor, p. 61.</ref> Those who agree with Westmoreland reason that no other explanation exists as to why Hanoi would have committed so many forces to the area instead of deploying them for the Tet Offensive. The fact that the North Vietnamese only committed about half of their available forces to the offensive (60\u201370,000), the majority of whom were VC, is cited in favor of Westmoreland's argument. Other theories argued that the forces around Khe Sanh were simply a localized defensive measure in the DMZ area, or that they were serving as a reserve in case of an offensive American end run in the mode of the American [[Battle of Inchon|invasion at Inchon]] during the [[Korean War]]. However, North Vietnamese sources claim that the Americans did not win a victory at Khe Sanh, but they were forced to retreat to avoid destruction. The PAVN claimed that Khe Sanh was \"a stinging defeat from both the military and political points of view\": Westmoreland was replaced two months after the end of the battle and his successor explained the retreat in different ways.<ref name=\"historynet_a\" />\n\n[[File:Wallace Greene, Robert Cushman and William Westmoreland.jpg|thumb|left|General Wallace Greene, Commandant of the Marine Corps (l), Lieutenant General Robert Cushman, III MAF Commander (c), and General William Westmoreland (r)]]\n\nGeneral [[Creighton Abrams]] has also suggested that the North Vietnamese may have been planning to emulate Dien Bien Phu. He believed that the PAVN's actions during Tet proved it.<ref>Warren, p. 333.</ref> He cited the fact that it would have taken longer to [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf|dislodge the North Vietnamese at Hue]] if the PAVN had committed the three divisions at Khe Sanh to the battle there (although the PAVN did commit three regiments to the fighting from the Khe Sanh sector), instead of dividing their forces.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 38.</ref>\n\nAnother interpretation was that the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy has come to be known as the Option Play. If the PAVN could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive.<ref>Pisor, p. 210.</ref> This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the PAVN would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but the price they were willing to pay had limits. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that the actions around Khe Sanh (and the other border battles) were simply a feint, a ruse meant to focus American attention (and forces) on the border. General and historian Dave Palmer accepts this rationale: \"General Giap never had any intention of capturing Khe Sanh&nbsp;... [it] was a feint, a diversionary effort. And it had accomplished its purpose magnificently.\"<ref>Palmer, p. 219.</ref>{{#tag:ref|This is also the position taken in the official PAVN history, but which offers no further explanation of the strategy.<ref>Military History Institute of Vietnam, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nMarine General Rathvon M. Tompkins, commander of the 3rd Marine Division, has pointed out that had the PAVN actually intended to take Khe Sanh, PAVN troops could have cut the base's sole source of water, a stream 500 m outside the perimeter of the base. Had they simply contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided enough water to the Marines.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Marine Lieutenant General [[Victor Krulak]] seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by also arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever cut by the PAVN.<ref>Krulak, p. 218.</ref><ref>Shulimson p. 289.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sahn airstrip looking west.JPG|thumb|right|Khe Sanh airstrip, December 2006]]\n\nOne argument leveled by Westmoreland at the time (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several PAVN divisions.<ref>Pisor, p. 240.</ref> At the time Hanoi made the decision to move in around the base, though, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. Whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four PAVN divisions was debatable. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level.

The following year it was published by [[Ace Books]] as an [[Ace Double]] with ''Seven from the Stars'' by [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]].<ref>[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?787 isfdb]</ref>  It is an example of an [[alternate history]] novel in which a man from our reality becomes involved with another [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] in which the [[American Revolution]] never happened and the secret of inter-world travel came under the control of the [[British Empire]], which forged a unified Imperial world-state known as the Imperium.\n\n==Plot summary==\nBrion Bayard, an American diplomat on assignment in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], attempts to evade a man following him, only to find himself kidnapped by agents of the Imperium from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]]. Taken to the home world of the Imperium, he is introduced to the aristocratic members of the government, which rules most of the civilized world from London, having been formed by the union of the [[British Empire]], which included America, and the [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian empire]]s of Europe, with neutral [[Sweden]] added as an impartial component of the mixture. He is impressed by the commitment to duty of the Imperial officials he meets and drawn to a particularly noble lady. Surprisingly, the Imperial officials also include an analogue of [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] who - as [[Nazi Germany]] never existed - is a fairly honest and decent person, completely free of the crimes he would have committed in our history,\n\nThe main reason for Bayard's abduction, however, is that the Imperium is under attack from another parallel world.\n\nThe Maxoni-Cocini drive, invented in the Imperium universe by Italian scientists/experimenters Giulio Maxoni and Carlo Cocini at the end of the 19th Century, is the technology for traveling between worlds and is extremely dangerous. Only if several sensitive parameters are tuned exactly can disaster be avoided and the trans-world transportation effect be achieved. Almost all worlds where its development is attempted or even inadvertently stumbled upon are destroyed, often in bizarre and horrible ways.\n\nThe collection of time lines where such disasters have occurred is known as the Blight, and the rare ones where the Earth survives are known as Blight Insulars, or BI's. BI-1 is the Imperium, where, by rare chance, the Maxoni-Cocini drive was successfully developed. The Imperium has become rich and powerful by trading with time lines beyond the Blight. BI-3 is Bayard's home world, where the technology never developed. The raids are coming from BI-2, a chaotic world where [[Imperial Germany]] won the [[First World War]] but failed to consolidate its victory, with a chaotic and highly destructive war continuing to sweep the planet for generations. This world, which was not believed to have the Maxoni-Cocini drive until it became the origin of increasingly destructive raids,is currently ruled by a dictator, who happens to be an analogue of... Brion Bayard.\n\nBayard undergoes extensive training to substitute for his double, presumably after killing him, and take over the other government, shutting off the raids. The plan falls through almost as soon as he arrives in the new world. For some reason, almost nobody believes in his impersonation. The reason becomes apparent when he meets the other Bayard, who had lost both legs in a battle years before, but who has concealed that fact from the public.\n\nHowever, this other Bayard is not the evil dictator he is portrayed to be. He greets his double as a brother, and tells him how, after being a military officer dedicated to saving the soldiers under his command, he became a dictator after the government he served disintegrated, and undertook an effort to save what was left of shattered  world. He is based in [[Algiers]], which was lass damaged than other parts of the world, and used the remanants of the former [[French Algeria| French Colonial Government]] as the nucleus of his fledgling World Government.  He knows nothing of the raids on the Imperium. The two Bayards talk over a gourmet meal and discover they have much in common, including similar histories.\n\nBayard the dictator is abruptly assassinated by the real conspirators, who are working for power-hungry factions in the Imperium itself, using stolen technology. Bayard himself is scheduled for a showy execution, after suitable amputation surgery, to allow the conspiracy to consolidate its hold on their world by publicly eliminating the dictator.

The following year it was published by [[Ace Books]] as an [[Ace Double]] with ''Seven from the Stars'' by [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]].<ref>[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?787 isfdb]</ref>  It is an example of an [[alternate history]] novel in which a man from our reality becomes involved with another [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] in which the [[American Revolution]] never happened and the secret of inter-world travel came under the control of the [[British Empire]], which forged a unified Imperial world-state known as the Imperium.\n\n==Plot summary==\nBrion Bayard, an American diplomat on assignment in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], attempts to evade a man following him, only to find himself kidnapped by agents of the Imperium from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]]. Taken to the home world of the Imperium, he is introduced to the aristocratic members of the government, which rules most of the civilized world from London, having been formed by the union of the [[British Empire]], which included America, and the [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian empire]]s of Europe, with neutral [[Sweden]] added as an impartial component of the mixture. He is impressed by the commitment to duty of the Imperial officials he meets and drawn to a particularly noble lady. Surprisingly, the Imperial officials also include an analogue of [[Herman Goering]] who - as [[Nazi Germany]] never existed - is a fairly honest and decent person, completely free of the crimes he would have committed in our history,\n\nThe main reason for Bayard's abduction, however, is that the Imperium is under attack from another parallel world.\n\nThe Maxoni-Cocini drive, invented in the Imperium universe by Italian scientists/experimenters Giulio Maxoni and Carlo Cocini at the end of the 19th Century, is the technology for traveling between worlds and is extremely dangerous. Only if several sensitive parameters are tuned exactly can disaster be avoided and the trans-world transportation effect be achieved. Almost all worlds where its development is attempted or even inadvertently stumbled upon are destroyed, often in bizarre and horrible ways.\n\nThe collection of time lines where such disasters have occurred is known as the Blight, and the rare ones where the Earth survives are known as Blight Insulars, or BI's. BI-1 is the Imperium, where, by rare chance, the Maxoni-Cocini drive was successfully developed. The Imperium has become rich and powerful by trading with time lines beyond the Blight. BI-3 is Bayard's home world, where the technology never developed. The raids are coming from BI-2, a chaotic world where [[Imperial Germany]] won the [[First World War]] but failed to consolidate its victory, with a chaotic and highly destructive war continuing to sweep the planet for generations. This world, which was not believed to have the Maxoni-Cocini drive until it became the origin of increasingly destructive raids,is currently ruled by a dictator, who happens to be an analogue of... Brion Bayard.\n\nBayard undergoes extensive training to substitute for his double, presumably after killing him, and take over the other government, shutting off the raids. The plan falls through almost as soon as he arrives in the new world. For some reason, almost nobody believes in his impersonation. The reason becomes apparent when he meets the other Bayard, who had lost both legs in a battle years before, but who has concealed that fact from the public.\n\nHowever, this other Bayard is not the evil dictator he is portrayed to be. He greets his double as a brother, and tells him how, after being a military officer dedicated to saving the soldiers under his command, he became a dictator after the government he served disintegrated, and undertook an effort to save what was left of shattered  world. He is based in [[Algiers]], which was lass damaged than other parts of the world, and used the remanants of the former [[French Algeria| French Colonial Government]] as the nucleus of his fledgling World Government.  He knows nothing of the raids on the Imperium. The two Bayards talk over a gourmet meal and discover they have much in common, including similar histories.\n\nBayard the dictator is abruptly assassinated by the real conspirators, who are working for power-hungry factions in the Imperium itself, using stolen technology. Bayard himself is scheduled for a showy execution, after suitable amputation surgery, to allow the conspiracy to consolidate its hold on their world by publicly eliminating the dictator. Eventually he is able to escape back to the Imperium and expose the conspirators. Offered a chance to return to his Earth, or become a high-ranking Imperium officer, he looks at the noble lady who has become so important to him, and declares, \"Home is where the heart is.\"\n\n==Sequels==\nThere are three sequels to this novel.

It is approximately aligned north-to-south and [[oval]] in shape, measuring approximately 2.9 miles (4.6&nbsp;km) on the long axis and 0.9 miles (1.4&nbsp;km) on the short axis. The lake was created by at least two [[glacier]]s that traveled northward down the Glen Alpine Valley. If the glacier had continued instead of stopping, Fallen Leaf Lake would be a bay of Lake Tahoe, similar to nearby [[Emerald Bay State Park|Emerald Bay]]. A [[terminal moraine]] is visible at the north end of the lake on the northeast edge.\n\n== Surrounding land ==\n\nFallen Leaf Lake is located within the National Forest System lands managed by the [[Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/ltbmu/|title=Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit|publisher=USDA Forest Service|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref> adjacent to [[El Dorado County]]. The land surrounding the lake is privately owned, leased from the [[U.S. Forest Service]], and part of the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit. Like some areas where the Forest Service has leased land intermingled with private land, the two land types appear in a mosaic or [[checkerboard]] pattern.\n\n== Access ==\n\nFallen Leaf Road is approximately 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) long, and begins at [[California State Route 89|State Route 89]], which runs along the south shore of Lake Tahoe. The road intersects the highway approximately half a mile (800 m) west of [[Camp Richardson]], a resort and campground on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe. The road runs generally to the south, is one lane wide and paved, and has turnouts to allow cars to pass each other. The road passes the Fallen Leaf Lake Campground, operated by the Forest Service, and then past privately owned [[pasture|meadows]]. Two miles south of State Route 89, Angora Road provides access to Angora Lookout, a Forest Service fire lookout on the east side of the lake and approximately 1,000 feet (300&nbsp;m) above the lake's surface, and to [[Angora Lakes| Angora Lakes Resort]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutlaketahoe.com/hiking/angora_lakes.htm|title=Angora Lakes Resort|work=About Lake Tahoe|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref> It also connects to [[US 50 (CA)|US 50]]/SR 89 via Sawmill Road.\n\nFallen Leaf Road continues south past privately owned homes following the lakeshore. Emigrant Road connects to Fallen Leaf Road approximately three miles from SR 89, and provides access to houses above the lake on the eastern slope. There is little commercial development at the lake other than the tiny Fallen Leaf Marina and Store at the southern extremity of the lake. The road winds around the south end of the lake, past St. Francis of the Mountains, an Episcopalian chapel, and then across a [[concrete]] bridge spanning Glen Alpine Creek. Glen Alpine Road begins at the bridge and runs for about two miles southwest to Glen Alpine Springs, one of the trailheads to the [[Desolation Wilderness]] Area.\n\nCathedral Road also intersects State Route 89, and travels south to the houses on the west side of the lake. While it runs to within about three-quarters of a mile (1.2&nbsp;km) of Fallen Leaf Road, they do not connect. Some of the homes on the west side of the lake have no road access and are accessed on foot or by boat.\n\n== Tributaries ==\n[[File:Glen Alpine Falls 2019.jpg|thumb|Glen Alpine Falls on Glen Alpine Creek, a short walk from Fallen Leaf Lake, with strong runoff in May 2019]]\n\nFallen Leaf Lake is fed almost entirely by Glen Alpine Creek at the south end, which is in turn fed by several lakes in the Desolation Wilderness area including [[Gilmore Lake]], Susie Lake, Heather Lake, and Grass Lake. In the spring, melting [[snow]] causes a vigorous flow of cold water into the lake which gradually tapers off during the summer months until the creek flow is greatly reduced in late summer and the [[autumn|fall]]. Other much smaller creeks and streams feed the lake, including Cathedral Creek, but they are not nearly as important as Glen Alpine Creek.\n\n[[Taylor Creek (Lake Tahoe)|Taylor Creek]] is the only outflow, and it is controlled by a long, low concrete [[dam]] with an adjustable spillway to control the rate at which the water leaves the lake. This dam is 12ft high and 265ft in length.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vay.studio/index/ca/dams/fallen-leaf-lake-dam|title=Fallen Leaf Lake Dam {{!}} Vay Open Data|website=vay.studio|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref> Taylor Creek<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutlaketahoe.com/hiking/taylor_creek.htm|title=Taylor Creek|work=About Lake Tahoe|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref> flows northward, passing under State Route 89, and enters [[Lake Tahoe]] at Baldwin Beach.\n\n== The lake ==\n[[File:Stanford Sierra Camp's Boat Dock on Fallen Leaf Lake.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Stanford Sierra Camp on the calm waters of Fallen Leaf Lake]]\n\nFallen Leaf is approximately 415 feet (125&nbsp;m) deep at its deepest point, which is east of the sheer face of [[Mount Tallac]] and north of [[Stanford Sierra Camp]]. The average depth of the lake is around 240 feet (72&nbsp;m), and the bottom falls away rapidly as one moves away from the shorelines. Due to the action of the glaciers that carved the lake, the northern end of the lake has a much more gradual depth change, and the bottom can be seen from the surface for a quarter-mile (400&nbsp;m) offshore. Along other shores, the bottom may be hidden in as little as 100 feet (30&nbsp;m) offshore.\n\nThe water quality is extremely good due to the lack of commercial development (including [[golf course]]s and their [[fertilizer]]-rich runoff), the universal use of [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, and modern [[sediment]] retention techniques associated with new development. Visibility runs around 40\u201350 feet (10\u201315&nbsp;m) under most conditions. The water is [[potable]], and many homes along the shoreline run a pipe offshore to provide water during the winter when other water systems may be turned off.\n\nThe water in the lake is exchanged every eight years, compared to the much deeper, therefore slower, Lake Tahoe, which exchanges every 700 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Water Quality|publisher=Tahoe Integrated Information Management System|accessdate=2007-08-21 |url = http://www.tiims.org/Basin-Topics/Water-Quality.aspx}}</ref>\n\nThe surface elevation of the lake is 152 feet (46&nbsp;m) above Lake Tahoe.\n\nMature conifer trees can be found on the bottom of Fallen Leaf Lake, preserved for some 800 years by the cold water.  Some scientists believe that these trees show evidence of a so-called \"[[megadrought]]\" occurring between the 9th and 12th centuries that eliminated or reduced the lake, allowing conifers to grow to maturity.  Even older trees have been identified by [[Dendrology|dendrologists]] dating to between 18 and 35 centuries ago.<ref>{{Cite web|title = An underwater forest reveals the story of a historic megadrought|url = http://www.hcn.org/issues/44.22/underwater-forest-reveals-the-story-of-a-historic-megadrought|website = www.hcn.org|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}</ref> A recent expedition by the [[Undersea Voyager Project]] concluded that the ancient trees did not grow there during an ancient drought, but rather slid into the lake during one of the many seismic events that have occurred in the Tahoe Basin since it was formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://californiadiver.com/solving-a-mile-high-mystery-0703/|title=Solving A Mile-High Mystery: Explorers Study Ancient Underwater Forest at Fallen Leaf Lake, Tahoe|publisher=California Diver Magazine|date=July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]] banned [[two-stroke]] [[Outboard motor|outboard]] boat motors in the late 1990s, pollution from these engines was virtually eliminated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trpa.org/documents/docdwnlds/shrzneis/ad.pdf |title=The relationship between boating activity on Lake Tahoe and contamination from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) |publisher=Tahoe Regional Planning Agency |access-date=2007-08-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211458/http://www.trpa.org/documents/docdwnlds/shrzneis/ad.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Local terrain ==\n\nAs the glaciers receded from the Fallen Leaf basin, they left some dramatic rock formations including Cathedral Peak to the west, and the ridge upon which the Angora Lookout is located on the east (now forested). Cathedral Peak ({{Convert|8200|ft|m|-2}}) might be better named Cathedral Ridge since, while it appears to be a solitary peak from the vantage point on the lake, it is really the beginning of a ridge that leads in the direction of Gilmore Lake and [[Mount Tallac]]. Incidentally, Mount Tallac ({{Convert|9735|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}) is familiar to anyone who was a fan of the television series ''[[Bonanza]]'' as it appeared with its characteristic cross of snow behind the Cartwright family as they rode towards the camera.\n\nCathedral Peak does not have a trail that leads directly to it, but can be reached by three different approaches. The '''Middle Trail to Tallac''' is a trail that begins near Lily Lake and which runs along the northern side of Glen Alpine Valley. It runs up to a junction which splits off to Gilmore Lake and Mount Tallac. Intrepid hikers can set off cross-country in the general direction of Cathedral Peak, about half a mile (800&nbsp;m) away. Another route is from Gilmore Lake, to the same junction. Finally, the ''Lake Trail'' begins at the end of Fallen Leaf Road and slowly climbs up to Cathedral Lake and Floating Island Lake, and eventually to the Mount Tallac trail.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Lahontan cutthroat trout]] (''Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi'') is the only trout species native to Fallen Leaf Lake, Lake Tahoe and the [[Truckee River|Truckee River Basin]] but were extirpated by introduction of predatory non-native [[lake trout]] (''Salvelinus namaycush''), other competing non-native salmonids, and overfishing. Re-introduction into Fallen Leaf Lake of the Pilot Peak strain of Lahontan cutthroat trout (LCT), established as the LCT strain native to the watershed, began in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Population Genetic Structure in Lahontan Cutthroat Trout |authors=Jennifer L.

Although the LCT suffer from heavy predation by lake trout, interbreeding with non-native [[rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss''), and foraging competition with non-native [[sockeye salmon|kokanee salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus nerka''), their population is gradually increasing in the lake.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Evaluating the Reintroduction Potential of Lahontan Cutthroat Trout in Fallen Leaf Lake, California |authors=Robert Al-Chokhacy and Mary Peacock |journal=North American Journal of Fisheries Management |volume=29 |pages=1296\u20131313 |year=2009 |url=http://www.fws.gov/lahontannfhc/documents/fallen_leaf/Al-Chokhachy_et_al_2009.pdf |accessdate=2013-01-27 |doi=10.1577/m08-087.1}}</ref>\n\n== Water activities ==\n\nMost homes that have lake front property have [[dock (maritime)|dock]]s and/or [[boathouse]]s, generally with an older [[ski boat]] or a 16\u201320 feet (5\u20137&nbsp;m) [[sailboat]]. The marina has room for approximately 60 boats, many of which are owned by property owners without direct access to the water. [[Wakeboard]] and [[waterski]] boats are the most common, followed by dedicated fishing boats, a few sailboats and [[pontoon boat]]s, and some manually propelled craft. [[Kayaking]] is becoming more popular, as is recreational [[watercraft rowing|rowing]].\n\nFishing is popular, if not particularly productive, for [[brown trout]], [[rainbow trout]] and [[lake trout]].

This dam is 12ft high and 265ft in length.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vay.studio/index/ca/dams/fallen-leaf-lake-dam|title=Fallen Leaf Lake Dam {{!}} Vay Open Data|website=vay.studio|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref> Taylor Creek<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutlaketahoe.com/hiking/taylor_creek.htm|title=Taylor Creek|work=About Lake Tahoe|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref> flows northward, passing under Highway 89, and enters [[Lake Tahoe]] at Baldwin Beach.\n\n== The lake ==\n[[File:Stanford Sierra Camp's Boat Dock on Fallen Leaf Lake.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Stanford Sierra Camp on the calm waters of Fallen Leaf Lake]]\n\nFallen Leaf is approximately 415 feet (125&nbsp;m) deep at its deepest point, which is east of the sheer face of [[Mount Tallac]] and north of [[Stanford Sierra Camp]]. The average depth of the lake is around 240 feet (72&nbsp;m), and the bottom falls away rapidly as one moves away from the shorelines. Due to the action of the glaciers that carved the lake, the northern end of the lake has a much more gradual depth change, and the bottom can be seen from the surface for a quarter-mile (400&nbsp;m) offshore. Along other shores, the bottom may be hidden in as little as 100 feet (30&nbsp;m) offshore.\n\nThe water quality is extremely good due to the lack of commercial development (including [[golf course]]s and their [[fertilizer]]-rich runoff), the universal use of [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, and modern [[sediment]] retention techniques associated with new development. Visibility runs around 40\u201350 feet (10\u201315&nbsp;m) under most conditions. The water is [[potable]], and many homes along the shoreline run a pipe offshore to provide water during the winter when other water systems may be turned off.\n\nThe water in the lake is exchanged every eight years, compared to the much deeper, therefore slower, Lake Tahoe, which exchanges every 700 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Water Quality|publisher=Tahoe Integrated Information Management System|accessdate=2007-08-21 |url = http://www.tiims.org/Basin-Topics/Water-Quality.aspx}}</ref>\n\nThe surface elevation of the lake is 152 feet (46&nbsp;m) above Lake Tahoe.\n\nMature conifer trees can be found on the bottom of Fallen Leaf Lake, preserved for some 800 years by the cold water.  Some scientists believe that these trees show evidence of a so-called \"[[megadrought]]\" occurring between the 9th and 12th centuries that eliminated or reduced the lake, allowing conifers to grow to maturity.  Even older trees have been identified by [[Dendrology|dendrologists]] dating to between 18 and 35 centuries ago.<ref>{{Cite web|title = An underwater forest reveals the story of a historic megadrought|url = http://www.hcn.org/issues/44.22/underwater-forest-reveals-the-story-of-a-historic-megadrought|website = www.hcn.org|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}</ref> A recent expedition by the [[Undersea Voyager Project]] concluded that the ancient trees did not grow there during an ancient drought, but rather slid into the lake during one of the many seismic events that have occurred in the Tahoe Basin since it was formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://californiadiver.com/solving-a-mile-high-mystery-0703/|title=Solving A Mile-High Mystery: Explorers Study Ancient Underwater Forest at Fallen Leaf Lake, Tahoe|publisher=California Diver Magazine|date=July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]] banned [[two-stroke]] [[Outboard motor|outboard]] boat motors in the late 1990s, pollution from these engines was virtually eliminated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trpa.org/documents/docdwnlds/shrzneis/ad.pdf |title=The relationship between boating activity on Lake Tahoe and contamination from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) |publisher=Tahoe Regional Planning Agency |access-date=2007-08-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211458/http://www.trpa.org/documents/docdwnlds/shrzneis/ad.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Local terrain ==\n\nAs the glaciers receded from the Fallen Leaf basin, they left some dramatic rock formations including Cathedral Peak to the west, and the ridge upon which the Angora Lookout is located on the east (now forested). Cathedral Peak ({{Convert|8200|ft|m|-2}}) might be better named Cathedral Ridge since, while it appears to be a solitary peak from the vantage point on the lake, it is really the beginning of a ridge that leads in the direction of Gilmore Lake and [[Mount Tallac]]. Incidentally, Mount Tallac ({{Convert|9735|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}) is familiar to anyone who was a fan of the television series ''[[Bonanza]]'' as it appeared with its characteristic cross of snow behind the Cartwright family as they rode towards the camera.\n\nCathedral Peak does not have a trail that leads directly to it, but can be reached by three different approaches. The '''Middle Trail to Tallac''' is a trail that begins near Lily Lake and which runs along the northern side of Glen Alpine Valley. It runs up to a junction which splits off to Gilmore Lake and Mount Tallac. Intrepid hikers can set off cross-country in the general direction of Cathedral Peak, about half a mile (800&nbsp;m) away. Another route is from Gilmore Lake, to the same junction. Finally, the ''Lake Trail'' begins at the end of Fallen Leaf Road and slowly climbs up to Cathedral Lake and Floating Island Lake, and eventually to the Mount Tallac trail.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Lahontan cutthroat trout]] (''Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi'') is the only trout species native to Fallen Leaf Lake, Lake Tahoe and the [[Truckee River|Truckee River Basin]] but were extirpated by introduction of predatory non-native [[lake trout]] (''Salvelinus namaycush''), other competing non-native salmonids, and overfishing. Re-introduction into Fallen Leaf Lake of the Pilot Peak strain of Lahontan cutthroat trout (LCT), established as the LCT strain native to the watershed, began in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Population Genetic Structure in Lahontan Cutthroat Trout |authors=Jennifer L.

Although the LCT suffer from heavy predation by lake trout, interbreeding with non-native [[rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss''), and foraging competition with non-native [[sockeye salmon|kokanee salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus nerka''), their population is gradually increasing in the lake.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Evaluating the Reintroduction Potential of Lahontan Cutthroat Trout in Fallen Leaf Lake, California |authors=Robert Al-Chokhacy and Mary Peacock |journal=North American Journal of Fisheries Management |volume=29 |pages=1296\u20131313 |year=2009 |url=http://www.fws.gov/lahontannfhc/documents/fallen_leaf/Al-Chokhachy_et_al_2009.pdf |accessdate=2013-01-27 |doi=10.1577/m08-087.1}}</ref>\n\n== Water activities ==\n\nMost homes that have lake front property have [[dock (maritime)|dock]]s and/or [[boathouse]]s, generally with an older [[ski boat]] or a 16\u201320 feet (5\u20137&nbsp;m) [[sailboat]]. The marina has room for approximately 60 boats, many of which are owned by property owners without direct access to the water. [[Wakeboard]] and [[waterski]] boats are the most common, followed by dedicated fishing boats, a few sailboats and [[pontoon boat]]s, and some manually propelled craft. [[Kayaking]] is becoming more popular, as is recreational [[watercraft rowing|rowing]].\n\nFishing is popular, if not particularly productive, for [[brown trout]], [[rainbow trout]] and [[lake trout]]. The Forest Service stocks the lake and Glen Alpine Creek, which improves anglers' odds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fishsniffer.com/maps/fallenleaf.html |title=Fallen Leaf Lake Fishery Like A 'Little Tahoe' |work=fishsniffer.com |access-date=2007-08-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009024417/http://www.fishsniffer.com/maps/fallenleaf.html |archive-date=2007-10-09 |df= }}</ref> The lake has also seen what appears to be a successful reintroduction of the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]], which were fished to extinction in the Lake Tahoe area in the twenties and thirties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lteec.org/news.php?newsID=128 |title=Scientists See Progress in Reintroduction of  (sic) |publisher=Lake Tahoe Environmental Educational Coalition |access-date=2007-08-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929021043/http://www.lteec.org/news.php?newsID=128 |archive-date=2007-09-29 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSailing is challenging on the lake due to the shifty and gusty winds.
