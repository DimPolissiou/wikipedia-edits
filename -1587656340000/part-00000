Portrayed by [[Jennifer Aniston]], the character was created by [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]] and [[Marta Kauffman]], and appeared in all of the show's [[List of Friends episodes|236 episodes]] during its decade-long run, from its premiere on September 22, 1994 to its finale on May 6, 2004. Introduced in the show's [[Pilot (Friends)|pilot]] as a na\u00efve runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend [[Monica Geller]] and relocates to New York City, Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled, inexperienced \"daddy's girl\" into a successful businesswoman. During the show's [[Friends (season 2)|second season]], the character becomes romantically involved with her friend, Monica's older brother [[Roxanne Geller|Ross]], with whom she maintains a complicated [[on-again, off-again relationship|on-off relationship]] throughout the series. Together, the characters have a daughter, [[Emma Geller-Green|Emma]].\n\nThe role of Rachel was originally offered to  [[T\u00e9a Leoni]], the producer's first choice, and [[Courteney Cox]], both of whom declined, Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom ''[[The Naked Truth (TV series)|The Naked Truth]]'', and Cox in favor of playing Rachel's best friend Monica in ''Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Oral History of Friends: Jennifer Aniston Almost Didn't Play Rachel Green |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/04/friends-oral-history-jennifer-aniston-rachel-green |website=Vanity Fair |accessdate=11 February 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525080635/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/04/friends-oral-history-jennifer-aniston-rachel-green |archivedate=May 25, 2014 }}</ref> A virtually unknown actress at the time, who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms, Aniston auditioned for the role of Rachel after turning down an offer as a [[List of Saturday Night Live cast members|cast member]] on the [[sketch comedy show]] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. After acquiring the role and before ''Friends'' aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom, ''[[Muddling Through]]'', at the time, which was ultimately cancelled and allowed Aniston to remain on ''Friends''.\n\nCritical reception towards Rachel has remained consistently positive throughout ''Friends''{{'}} decade-long run, with ''[[The A.V. Club]] ''attributing much of the show's early success to the character. However, some of her storylines have been criticized, specifically her romantic relationship with her friend [[Joey Tribbiani]] during [[Friends (season 10)|season 10]]. Rachel's popularity established her as the show's [[breakout character]], who has since been named one of the greatest television characters of all time, while the character's second season haircut spawned an international phenomenon of its own. Named the \"Rachel\" after her, the character's [[Shag (hairstyle)|shag]] continues to be imitated by millions of women around the world and remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history, in spite of Aniston's own resentment of it. Rachel is also regarded as a style icon due to her influence on womenswear during the 1990s. Meanwhile, the character's relationship with Ross is often cited among television's most beloved.\n\nRachel is considered to be Aniston's [[Breakthrough role|breakout role]], credited with making her the show's most famous cast member and for spawning her successful film career. Praised for her performance as Rachel, Aniston won both an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series&nbsp;\u2013 Comedy Or Musical]].\n\n== Role ==\nRachel debuts in the [[Pilot (Friends)|pilot episode]] of ''Friends'' as a runaway bride who is distraught after abandoning her fianc\u00e9 [[List of Friends characters#Barry Farber|Barry Farber]] ([[Mitchell Whitfield]]) at the [[altar]] (In the 1st episode it was not Farber but Fenkel). She locates her high school best friend [[Monica Geller]] ([[Courteney Cox]]), the only person she knows in New York City, who agrees to let Rachel reside with her while she attempts to reorganize her life. Rachel meets and befriends Monica's friends [[Phoebe Buffay]] ([[Lisa Kudrow]]), [[Joey Tribbiani]] ([[Matt LeBlanc]]), and [[Chandler Bing]] ([[Matthew Perry]]), while reuniting with Monica's older brother [[Ross Geller]] ([[David Schwimmer]]), who has harbored unrequited romantic feelings for her since high school.

Portrayed by [[Jennifer Aniston]], the character was created by [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]] and [[Marta Kauffman]], and appeared in all of the show's [[List of Friends episodes|236 episodes]] during its decade-long run, from its premiere on September 22, 1994 to its finale on May 6, 2004. Introduced in the show's [[Pilot (Friends)|pilot]] as a na\u00efve runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend [[Monica Geller]] and relocates to New York City, Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled, inexperienced \"daddy's girl\" into a successful businesswoman. During the show's [[Friends (season 2)|second season]], the character becomes romantically involved with her friend, Monica's older brother [[Ross Geller|Ross]], with whom she maintains a complicated [[on-again, off-again relationship|on-off relationship]] throughout the series. Together, the characters have a daughter, [[Emma Geller-Green|Emma]].\n\nThe role of Rachel was originally offered to  [[T\u00e9a Leoni]], the producer's first choice, and [[Courteney Cox]], both of whom declined, Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom ''[[The Naked Truth (TV series)|The Naked Truth]]'', and Cox in favor of playing Rachel's best friend Monica in ''Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Oral History of Friends: Jennifer Aniston Almost Didn't Play Rachel Green |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/04/friends-oral-history-jennifer-aniston-rachel-green |website=Vanity Fair |accessdate=11 February 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525080635/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/04/friends-oral-history-jennifer-aniston-rachel-green |archivedate=May 25, 2014 }}</ref> A virtually unknown actress at the time, who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms, Aniston auditioned for the role of Rachel after turning down an offer as a [[List of Saturday Night Live cast members|cast member]] on the [[sketch comedy show]] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. After acquiring the role and before ''Friends'' aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom, ''[[Muddling Through]]'', at the time, which was ultimately cancelled and allowed Aniston to remain on ''Friends''.\n\nCritical reception towards Rachel has remained consistently positive throughout ''Friends''{{'}} decade-long run, with ''[[The A.V. Club]] ''attributing much of the show's early success to the character. However, some of her storylines have been criticized, specifically her romantic relationship with her friend [[Joey Tribbiani]] during [[Friends (season 10)|season 10]]. Rachel's popularity established her as the show's [[breakout character]], who has since been named one of the greatest television characters of all time, while the character's second season haircut spawned an international phenomenon of its own. Named the \"Rachel\" after her, the character's [[Shag (hairstyle)|shag]] continues to be imitated by millions of women around the world and remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history, in spite of Aniston's own resentment of it. Rachel is also regarded as a style icon due to her influence on womenswear during the 1990s. Meanwhile, the character's relationship with Ross is often cited among television's most beloved.\n\nRachel is considered to be Aniston's [[Breakthrough role|breakout role]], credited with making her the show's most famous cast member and for spawning her successful film career. Praised for her performance as Rachel, Aniston won both an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series&nbsp;\u2013 Comedy Or Musical]].\n\n== Role ==\nRachel debuts in the [[Pilot (Friends)|pilot episode]] of ''Friends'' as a runaway bride who is distraught after abandoning her fianc\u00e9 [[List of Friends characters#Barry Farber|Barry Farber]] ([[Mitchell Whitfield]]) at the [[altar]] (In the 1st episode it was not Farber but Fenkel).

In 1810, the whole [[Hawaiian Islands]] became [[unification of Hawaii|unified]] when [[Kauai|Kaua\u02bbi]] and [[Niihau|Ni\u02bbihau]] joined the Hawaiian Kingdom voluntarily. Two major dynastic families ruled the kingdom: the [[House of Kamehameha]] and the [[House of Kal\u0101kaua]].\n\nThe Kingdom won recognition from major European powers. The [[United States]] became its chief trading partner. The U.S. [[Hawaiian Kingdom\u2013United States relations|watched]] over the Kingdom lest some other power (such as [[British Empire|Britain]] or [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]) threaten to seize control. Hawaii was forced to adopt [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|a new constitution in 1887]] when King [[Kal\u0101kaua]] was threatened with violence by the [[Honolulu Rifles]], a white, anti-monarchist militia, to sign it.

Three years later the Island of Hawaii was passed to [[Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu]]'s son, [[K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d]], while religious authority was passed to the ruler's nephew, Kamehameha.\n\n[[File:\"Aniheneho.

Eventually, Kaua\u02bbi's chief swore allegiance to Kamehameha. The unification ended the [[ancient Hawaii]]an society, transforming it into an independent constitutional monarchy crafted in the traditions and manner of European monarchs.\n\n=== Kamehameha dynasty ===\n{{Main|House of Kamehameha}}\nFrom 1810 to 1893, the Hawaiian Kingdom was ruled by two major dynastic families: the [[House of Kamehameha]] and the [[House of Kal\u0101kaua|Kal\u0101kaua Dynasty]]. Five members of the Kamehameha family led the government styled as Kamehameha. Lunalilo was a member of the House of Kamehameha through his mother. Liholiho (Kamehameha II) and Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III) were direct sons of Kamehameha the Great. During Liholiho's and Kauikeaouli's reigns, the primary wife of Kamehameha the Great, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]], ruled as [[Regent|Queen Regent]] and ''[[Kuhina Nui]]'', or [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]].\n\n== Economic, social, and cultural transformation ==\n{{History of Hawaii}}\nEconomic and demographic factors in the 19th century reshaped the islands. Their consolidation into one unified political entity led to international trade. Under Kamehameha (1795\u20131819), [[sandalwood]] was exported to [[Qing dynasty|China]]. That led to the introduction of money and trade throughout the islands.\n\nFollowing Kamehameha's death the succession was overseen by his principal wife, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Ka'ahumanu]], who was designated as regent over the new king, Liholiho, who was a minor.\n\nQueen Ka'ahumanu eliminated various prohibitions ([[kapu]]) governing women's behavior. They included men and women eating together and women eating bananas. She also overturned the old religion as the Christian missionaries arrived in the islands. A major contribution of the missionaries was to develop a written Hawaiian language. That led to very high levels of literacy in Hawaii, above 90 percent in the latter half of the 19th century. The development of writing aided in the consolidation of government. Written constitutions enumerating the power and duties of the King were developed.\n\nIn 1848, the [[Great M\u0101hele]] was promulgated by King Liholihog. It instituted formal property rights to the land and followed the customary control of the land prior to this declaration. Ninety-eight percent of the land was assigned to the [[Ali\u02bbi|Ali'i]], chiefs or nobles. Two percent went to the commoners. No land could be sold, only transferred to lineal descendant land manager.\nFor the natives, contact with the outer world represented demographic disaster, as a series of unfamiliar diseases such as smallpox decimated the natives. The [[Hawaii|Hawaiian population]] of natives fell from approximately 128,000 in 1778<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tom Dye|author2=Eric Komori|title=Pre-censal Population History of Hawai'i |work=New Zealand Journal of Archaeology 14 |url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/482/1/JL28007.pdf|year=1992|publisher=NA|page=3}}</ref> to 71,000 in 1853 and kept declining to 24,000 in 1920.

The missionaries and their children became a powerful elite into the mid-19th century. They provided the chief advisors and cabinet members of the kings and dominated the professional and merchant class in the cities.<ref>Harold W. Bradley, ''The American frontier in Hawaii: the pioneers, 1789\u20131843'' (Stanford university press, 1942).</ref>\n\nThe elites promoted the [[sugar]] [[Sugarcane|industry]] in order to modernize Hawaii's economy.

As a result, between 1850 and 1900 some 200,000 contract laborers from [[Qing dynasty|China]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Portugal]] and elsewhere came to Hawaii under fixed term contracts (typically for five years). Most returned home on schedule, but large numbers stayed permanently. By 1908 about 180,000 Japanese workers had arrived. No more were allowed in, but 54,000 remained permanently.<ref name=\"Beechert1985\">{{cite book|author=Edward D.

The army and navy used both traditional [[canoe]]s and uniforms including helmets made of natural materials and loincloths (called the Malo) as well as western technology like artillery cannons, muskets, and European ships.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} European advisors were captured, treated well and became Hawaiian citizens.{{Clarify|reason=When were they captured? By who?|date=December 2018}} When Kamehameha died in 1819 he left his son [[Kamehameha II|Liholiho]] a large arsenal with tens of thousands of soldiers and many warships. This helped put down the revolt at [[Kuamoo Burials|Kuamo\u02bbo]] later in 1819 and [[Humehume]]'s rebellion on Kauai in 1824.\n\nDuring the [[House of Kamehameha|Kamehameha dynasty]] the population in Hawaii was ravaged by epidemics following the arrival of outsiders. The military shrank with the population, so by the end of the Dynasty there was no Hawaiian navy and only an army, consisting of several hundred troops. After a French invasion that sacked [[Honolulu]] in 1849, [[Kamehameha III]] sought defense treaties with the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. During the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]] in Europe, Kamehameha III declared Hawaii a neutral state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiankingdom.org/hawn-territory.shtml |title=Hawaiian Territory |publisher=Hawaiian Kingdom |date= |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref> The United States government put strong pressure on [[Kamehameha IV]] to make trade exclusively to the United States even annexed the islands. To counterbalance this situation Kamehameha IV and [[Kamehameha V]] pushed for alliances with other foreign powers, especially [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]. Hawaii claimed uninhabited islands in the Pacific, including the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]], many of which came into conflict with American claims.\n\nFollowing the Kamehameha dynasty the royal guards were disbanded under [[Lunalilo]] after a barracks revolt in September 1873. A small army was restored under King [[Kal\u0101kaua|Kalakaua]] but failed to stop the 1887 Rebellion by the [[Reform Party (Hawaii)|Missionary Party]]. In 1891, [[Lili\u02bbuokalani|Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani]] came to power. The elections of 1892 were followed with petitions and requests from her administration to change the [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|constitution of 1887]]. <!-- prior sentence is very confusing and needs editing by someone with knowledge --> The US maintained a policy of keeping at least one [[cruiser]] in Hawaii at all times. On January 17, 1893, Lili\u02bbuokalani, believing the US military would intervene if she changed the constitution, waited for the {{USS|Boston|1884|6}} to leave port. Once it was known that Lili\u02bbuokalani was revising the constitution, the ''Boston'' was recalled and assisted the Missionary Party in her overthrow. Following the overthrow and the establishment of the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] the Kingdom's military was disarmed and disbanded. One hundred years later, in 1993, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Apology Resolution]], admitting wrongdoing and issuing a belated apology.\n\n== French Incident (1839) ==\n{{Main|Laplace affair}}\n\nUnder the rule of [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]], the powerful, newly converted Protestant widow of Kamehameha the Great, Catholicism was illegal in Hawaii, and in 1831 French Catholic priests were forcibly deported by chiefs loyal to her.

You will exact, if necessary with all the force that is yours to use, complete reparation for the wrongs which have been committed, and you will not quit those places until you have left in all minds a solid and lasting impression.''\n\nUnder the threat of war, King [[Kamehameha III]] signed the [[Edict of Toleration (Hawaii)|Edict of Toleration]] on July 17, 1839 and paid the $20,000 in compensation for the deportation of the priests and the incarceration and torture of converts, agreeing to Laplace's demands.

Admiral Thomas apologized to Kamehameha III for Paulet's actions, and restored Hawaiian sovereignty on July 31, 1843. In his restoration speech, Kamehameha III declared that ''\"[[Ua Mau ke Ea o ka \u02bb\u0100ina i ka Pono]]\"'' (The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness), the motto of the future State of Hawaii. The day was celebrated as [[Sovereignty Restoration Day|L\u0101 Ho\u02bbiho\u02bbi Ea]] (Sovereignty Restoration Day).\n\n== French invasion (1849) ==\n{{Main|French invasion of Honolulu}}\nIn August 1849, French admiral [[Louis Tromelin]] arrived in [[Honolulu Harbor]] with the ''La Poursuivante'' and ''Gassendi''. De Tromelin made ten demands to King [[Kamehameha III]] on August 22, mainly demanding that full religious rights be given to Catholics, (a decade earlier, during the French Incident the ban on Catholicism had been lifted, but Catholics still enjoyed only partial religious rights). On August 25 the demands had not been met. After a second warning was made to the civilians, French troops overwhelmed the [[skeleton crew|skeleton force]] and captured [[Honolulu Fort]], spiked the [[Coastal artillery|coastal guns]] and destroyed all other weapons they found (mainly muskets and ammunition). They raided government buildings and general property in Honolulu, causing damage that amounted to $100,000. After the raids the invasion force withdrew to the fort. De Tromelin eventually recalled his men and left Hawaii on September 5.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\nAnticipating foreign encroachment on Hawaiian territory, King Kamehameha III dispatched a delegation to the United States and Europe to secure the recognition of Hawaiian independence. [[Ha\u02bbalilio|Timoteo Ha\u02bbalilio]], [[William Richards (Hawaii)|William Richards]] and [[George Simpson (HBC administrator)|Sir George Simpson]] were commissioned as joint Ministers Plenipotentiary on April 8, 1842. Simpson left for Great Britain while Ha\u02bbalilio and Richards to the United States on July 8, 1842. The Hawaiian delegation secured the assurance of US President [[John Tyler]] on December 19, 1842 of Hawaiian independence and then met Simpson in Europe to secure formal recognition by the United Kingdom and France. On March 17, 1843, King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe of France]] recognized Hawaiian independence at the urging of King [[Leopold I of Belgium]]. On April 1, 1843, [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], on behalf of [[Queen Victoria]], assured the Hawaiian delegation, \"Her Majesty's Government was willing and had determined to recognize the independence of the [[Sandwich Islands]] under their present sovereign.\"\n\n=== Anglo-Franco Proclamation ===\n[[File:La Kuokoa o Hawaii Nei.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Flier for the 30th anniversary celebration of the 1843 treaty]]\nOn November 28, 1843, at the Court of London, the British and French Governments formally recognized Hawaiian independence. The \"Anglo-Franco Proclamation\", a joint declaration by France and Britain, signed by King Louis-Philippe and Queen Victoria, assured the Hawaiian delegation:\n<blockquote>\nHer Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Majesty the King of the French, taking into consideration the existence in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands) of a government capable of providing for the regularity of its relations with foreign nations, have thought it right to engage, reciprocally, to consider the Sandwich Islands as an Independent State, and never to take possession, neither directly or under the title of Protectorate, or under any other form, of any part of the territory of which they are composed.\n\nThe undersigned, Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs, and the Ambassador Extraordinary of His Majesty the King of the French, at the Court of London, being furnished with the necessary powers, hereby declare, in consequence, that their said Majesties take reciprocally that engagement.\n\nIn witness whereof the undersigned have signed the present declaration, and have affixed thereto the seal of their arms.\n\nDone in duplicate at London, the 28th day of November, in the year of our Lord, 1843.<br />\n\" 'ABERDEEN.

They were required to board under the direction of [[Amos Starr Cooke]] and his wife. The princes and chiefs eligible to be rulers were: [[Moses Kek\u016b\u0101iwa|Moses Kekuiwa]], [[Kamehameha IV|Alexander Liholiho]], [[Kamehameha V|Lot Kamehameha]], [[Victoria Kam\u0101malu|Victoria Kamamalu]], [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Emma Rooke]], [[Lunalilo|William Lunalilo]], [[Kal\u0101kaua|David Kalakaua]], [[Lili\u02bbuokalani|Lydia Kamaka\u2019eha]], [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop|Bernice Pauahi]], [[Elizabeth Keka\u02bbaniau|Elizabeth Keka`aniau]], [[Jane Loeau]], [[Abigail Maheha]], [[Peter Kaeo|Peter Young Kaeo]], [[James Kaliokalani]], [[John William Pitt Kinau|John Pitt Kina\u2019u]] and [[Mary Polly Paaaina|Mary Pa\u02bba\u02bb\u0101ina]], officially declared by King Kamehameha III in 1844.[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015408/1844-07-20/ed-1/seq-1/]\n\n== Succession crisis and monarchial elections ==\nDynastic rule by the Kamehameha family ended in 1872 with the death of Kamehameha V. Upon his deathbed, he summoned High Chiefess [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]] to declare his intentions of making her heir to the throne. Bernice refused the crown, and Kamehameha V died without naming an heir.\n\nThe refusal of Bishop to take the crown forced the legislature of the kingdom to [[Election|elect]] a new monarch. From 1872 to 1873, several relatives of the Kamehameha line were nominated. In [[Hawaii monarchal election, 1873|a ceremonial popular vote and a unanimous legislative vote]], [[Lunalilo|William C. Lunalilo]], grandnephew of Kamehameha I, became Hawai\u02bbi's first of two [[Elective monarchy|elected monarchs]] but reigned only from 1873 to 1874 because of his early death due to tuberculosis at the age of 39.\n\n== Kal\u0101kaua dynasty ==\n[[File:Kalakaua Grant state visit 1874.jpg|thumb|King [[Kal\u0101kaua]] meeting U.S. President [[Ulysses S.

Once again, the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom needed an election to fill the royal vacancy. [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Queen Emma]], widow of Kamehameha IV, was nominated along with [[Kal\u0101kaua|David Kal\u0101kaua]]. The [[Honolulu Courthouse riot|1874 election]] was a nasty political campaign in which both candidates resorted to mudslinging and innuendo. David Kal\u0101kaua became the second elected King of Hawaii but without the ceremonial popular vote of Lunalilo. The choice of the legislature was controversial, and U.S. and British troops were called upon to suppress rioting by Queen Emma's supporters, the ''[[Emmaites]]''.\n\nKal\u0101kaua officially proclaimed his sister, Lili\u02bbuokalani would succeed to the throne upon his death.  Hoping to avoid uncertainty in the monarchy's future,  Kalakaua had named a line of succession in his will, so that after Lili\u2019uokalani the throne should succeed to Princess [[Ka\u02bbiulani|Victoria Ka\u02bbiulani]], then to Queen Consort [[Kapi\u02bbolani|Kapi\u2019olani]], followed by her sister, [[Poomaikelani|Princess Po\u2019omaikalani]], then Prince [[David Kaw\u0101nanakoa|David Lamea Kawananakoa]] and last was Prince [[Jonah K\u016bhi\u014d Kalaniana\u02bbole]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18910318.2.57&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1|title=Daily Alta California 18 March 1891 \u2014 California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>  Although, the will was not an official line of succession or a proper proclamation according to kingdom law.

Thurston]], Minister of Interior under King Kal\u0101kaua.  The constitution was proclaimed by the king after a meeting of 3,000 residents including an armed militia demanded he sign it or be deposed. The document created a [[constitutional monarchy]] like the one that existed in United Kingdom, stripping the King of most of his personal authority and empowering the legislature and establishing cabinet government. It has since become widely known as the \"Bayonet Constitution\" because of the threat of force used to gain Kal\u0101kaua's cooperation.\n\nThe [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|1887 constitution]] empowered the citizenry to elect members of the House of Nobles (who had previously been appointed by the King). It increased the value of property a citizen must own to be eligible to vote above the previous Constitution of 1864 and denied voting rights to Asians who comprised a large proportion of the population (a few Japanese and some Chinese had previously become [[Naturalization|naturalized]] and now lost voting rights they had previously enjoyed). This guaranteed a voting monopoly to wealthy native Hawaiians and Europeans. The Bayonet Constitution continued allowing the monarch to appoint cabinet ministers, but stripped him of the power to dismiss them without approval from the Legislature.\n\n=== Lili\u02bbuokalani's Constitution ===\n[[File:Liliuokalani, c. 1891.jpg|thumb|[[Lili\u02bbuokalani|Lili'uokalani]]]]\nIn 1891, Kal\u0101kaua died and his sister Lili\u02bbuokalani assumed the throne. She came to power during an economic crisis precipitated in part by the [[McKinley Tariff]]. By rescinding the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, the new tariff eliminated the previous advantage Hawaiian exporters enjoyed in trade to U.S. markets. Many Hawaiian businesses and citizens were feeling the pressures of the loss of revenue, so Lili\u02bbuokalani proposed a [[lottery]] and opium licensing to bring in additional revenue for the government. Her ministers and closest friends tried to dissuade her from pursuing the bills, and these controversial proposals were used against her in the looming constitutional crisis.\n\nLili\u02bbuokalani wanted to restore power to the monarch by abrogating the 1887 Constitution. The queen launched a campaign resulting in a petition to proclaim a new Constitution.\nMany citizens and residents who in 1887 had forced Kal\u0101kaua to sign the \"Bayonet Constitution\" became alarmed when three of her recently appointed cabinet members informed them that the queen was planning to unilaterally proclaim her new Constitution.<ref>[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/liliuokalani/hawaii/hawaii-7.html Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen, Appendix A] \"The three ministers left Mr. Parker to try to dissuade me from my purpose; and in the meantime they all (Peterson, Cornwell, and Colburn) went to the government building to inform Thurston and his part of the stand I took.\"</ref>  Some cabinet ministers were reported to have feared for their safety after upsetting the queen by not supporting her plans.<ref>[http://morganreport.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=804-805 Morgan Report, p804-805] \"Every one knows how quickly Colburn and Peterson, when they could escape from the palace, called for help from Thurston and others, and how afraid Colburn was to go back to the palace.\"</ref>\n\n=== Overthrow ===\n{{Main|Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom}}\n[[File:USS Boston landing force, 1893 (PP-36-3-002).jpg|thumb|left|[[USS Boston (1884)|USS ''Boston'''s]] landing force on duty at the Arlington Hotel, Honolulu, at the time of the overthrow, January 1893<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/h56000/h56555c.htm|title=U.S. Navy History site|publisher=}}</ref>]]\n\nIn 1893, local businessmen and politicians, composed of six non-native Hawaiian Kingdom subjects, five American nationals, one British national, and one German national,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/annexation/blount/br0588.html|title=Blount Report \u2013 Page 588|publisher=}}</ref> all of whom were living and doing business in Hawaii, overthrew the queen, her cabinet and her marshal, and took over the government of the Hawaiian Kingdom.\n\nHistorians suggest that businessmen were in favor of overthrow and annexation to the U.S. in order to benefit from more favorable trade conditions with its main export market.<ref>Kinzer, Stephen.

During this time, members of the former government lobbied in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] for the United States to restore the Hawaiian Kingdom. President [[Grover Cleveland]] considered the overthrow to have been an illegal act of war; he refused to consider annexation of the islands and initially worked to restore the Queen to her throne. Between December 14, 1893 and January 11, 1894 a standoff occurred between the [[United States]], [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom]] against the Provisional Government to pressure them into returning the Queen known as the [[Black Week (Hawaii)|Black Week]]. This incident drove home the message that President Cleveland wanted Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani's return to power, and so on July 4, 1894 the Republic of Hawaii was requested to wait for President Cleveland's second term to finish. As lobbying continued in Washington during 1894, the royalist faction was secretly amassing an army of 600 strong led by former [[Captain of the guard|Captain of the Guard]] [[Samuel Nowlein]]. In 1895 they attempted a [[1895 Wilcox rebellion|counter-rebellion]], and [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] was arrested when a weapons cache was found on the palace grounds. She was tried by a military tribunal of the Republic, convicted of treason, and placed under permanent house arrest in her own home.\n\nOn January 24, 1895 while under house arrest [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] was forced to sign a five-page declaration as \"Liliuokalani Dominis\" in which she formally abdicated the throne in return for the release and commutation of the death sentences of her jailed supporters, including Minister Joseph Nawahi, Prince Kawananakoa, Robert Wilcox, and Prince Jonah Kuhio:\n\n{{quote|Before ascending the throne, for fourteen years, or since the date of my proclamation as heir apparent, my official title had been simply Liliuokalani.

[[Kamehameha I]] had conquered Maui and Molokai five years prior in the [[Battle of Kepaniwai]], but they were abandoned when Kamehameha's Big Island possession was under threat and later reconquered by the aged King [[Kahekili II]] of Maui. His domain comprised six of the major islands of the Hawaiian chain, and with [[Kaumualii]]'s peaceful surrender, Kauai and Niihau were added to his territories. [[Kamehameha II]] assumed de facto control of Kauai and Niihau when he kidnapped Kaumualii, ending his vassal rule over the islands.\n\nIn 1822, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]] and her husband [[Kaumualii|King Kaumuali\u02bbi]] traveled with Captain William Sumner to find [[Nihoa]], as her generation had only known the island through songs and [[Hawaiian religion|myths]]. Later, King [[Kamehameha IV]] sailed there to officially annex the island. Kamehameha IV and Kal\u0101kaua would later claim other islands in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Archipelago]], including [[Pearl and Hermes Atoll]], [[Necker Island (Hawaii)|Necker Island]], [[Laysan]], [[Lisianski Island]], [[Kure Atoll|Ocean (Kure) Atoll]], [[Midway Atoll]], [[French Frigate Shoals]], [[Maro Reef]] and [[Gardner Pinnacles]], as well as [[Palmyra Atoll]], [[Johnston Atoll]] and [[Jarvis Island]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Several of these islands had previously been claimed by the United States under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856. The Stewart Islands, or [[Sikaiana]] Atoll, near the [[Solomon Islands]], were ceded to Hawaii in 1856 by its residents, but the cession was never formalized by the Hawaiian government.\n\n== Royal estates ==\n[[File:Lowering the Hawaiian flag at Annexation ceremony (PPWD-8-3-006).jpg|thumb|On August 12, 1898, the flag of the Hawaiian Kingdom over \u02bbIolani Palace was lowered to raise the [[Flag of the United States|United States flag]] to signify annexation.]]\n\nEarly in its history, the Hawaiian Kingdom was governed from several locations including coastal towns on the islands of Hawai\u02bbi and Maui ([[Lahaina, Hawaii|L\u0101hain\u0101]]). It wasn't until the reign of Kamehameha III that a capital was established in Honolulu on the Island of O\u02bbahu.\n\nBy the time Kamehameha V was king, he saw the need to build a royal palace fitting of the Hawaiian Kingdom's new found prosperity and standing with the royals of other nations. He commissioned the building of [[Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale|the palace at Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale]]. He died before it was completed. Today, the palace houses the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai\u02bbi.\n\nDavid Kal\u0101kaua shared the dream of Kamehameha V to build a palace, and eagerly desired the trappings of European royalty. He commissioned the construction of [[\u02bbIolani Palace]]. In later years, the palace would become his sister's makeshift prison under guard by the forces of the Republic of Hawaii, the site of the official raising of the U.S. flag during annexation, and then territorial governor's and legislature's offices.

In 1810, the whole [[Hawaiian Islands]] became [[unification of Hawaii|unified]] when [[Kauai|Kaua\u02bbi]] and [[Niihau|Ni\u02bbihau]] joined the Hawaiian Kingdom voluntarily. Two major dynastic families ruled the kingdom: the [[House of Kamehameha]] and the [[House of Kal\u0101kaua]].\n\nThe Kingdom won recognition from major European powers. The [[United States]] became its chief trading partner.

Hawaii was forced to adopt [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|a new constitution in 1887]] when King [[Kal\u0101kaua]] was threatened with violence by the [[Honolulu Rifles]], a white, anti-monarchist militia, to sign it.

Eventually, Kaua\u02bbi's chief swore allegiance to Kamehameha. The unification ended the [[ancient Hawaii]]an society, transforming it into an independent constitutional monarchy crafted in the traditions and manner of European monarchs.\n\n=== Kamehameha dynasty ===\n{{Main|House of Kamehameha}}\nFrom 1810 to 1893, the Hawaiian Kingdom was ruled by two major dynastic families: the [[House of Kamehameha]] and the [[House of Kal\u0101kaua|Kal\u0101kaua Dynasty]]. Five members of the Kamehameha family led the government styled as Kamehameha. Lunalilo was a member of the House of Kamehameha through his mother. Liholiho (Kamehameha II) and Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III) were direct sons of Kamehameha the Great. During Liholiho's and Kauikeaouli's reigns, the primary wife of Kamehameha the Great, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]], ruled as [[Regent|Queen Regent]] and ''[[Kuhina Nui]]'', or [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]].\n\n== Economic, social, and cultural transformation ==\n{{History of Hawaii}}\nEconomic and demographic factors in the 19th century reshaped the islands. Their consolidation into one unified political entity led to international trade. Under Kamehameha (1795\u20131819), [[sandalwood]] was exported to [[Qing dynasty|China]]. That led to the introduction of money and trade throughout the islands.\n\nFollowing Kamehameha's death the succession was overseen by his principal wife, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Ka'ahumanu]], who was designated as regent over the new king, Liholiho, who was a minor.\n\nQueen Ka'ahumanu eliminated various prohibitions ([[kapu]]) governing women's behavior. They included men and women eating together and women eating bananas. She also overturned the old religion as the Christian missionaries arrived in the islands. A major contribution of the missionaries was to develop a written Hawaiian language. That led to very high levels of literacy in Hawaii, above 90 percent in the latter half of the 19th century. The development of writing aided in the consolidation of government. Written constitutions enumerating the power and duties of the King were developed.\n\nIn 1848, the [[Great M\u0101hele]] was promulgated by King Liholihog. It instituted formal property rights to the land and followed the customary control of the land prior to this declaration. Ninety-eight percent of the land was assigned to the [[Ali\u02bbi|Ali'i]], chiefs or nobles. Two percent went to the commoners. No land could be sold, only transferred to lineal descendant land manager.\nFor the natives, contact with the outer world represented demographic disaster, as a series of unfamiliar diseases such as smallpox decimated the natives. The [[Hawaii|Hawaiian population]] of natives fell from approximately 128,000 in 1778<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tom Dye|author2=Eric Komori|title=Pre-censal Population History of Hawai'i |work=New Zealand Journal of Archaeology 14 |url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/482/1/JL28007.pdf|year=1992|publisher=NA|page=3}}</ref> to 71,000 in 1853 and kept declining to 24,000 in 1920.

The missionaries and their children became a powerful elite into the mid-19th century. They provided the chief advisors and cabinet members of the kings and dominated the professional and merchant class in the cities.<ref>Harold W. Bradley, ''The American frontier in Hawaii: the pioneers, 1789\u20131843'' (Stanford university press, 1942).</ref>\n\nThe elites promoted the [[sugar]] [[Sugarcane|industry]] in order to modernize Hawaii's economy. American capital set up a series of plantations after 1850.<ref>Julia Flynn Siler, ''Lost Kingdom: Hawaii's Last Queen, the Sugar Kings and America's First Imperial Adventure'' (2012).</ref> Few natives were willing to work on the sugar plantations and so recruiters fanned out across Asia and Europe. As a result, between 1850 and 1900 some 200,000 contract laborers from [[Qing dynasty|China]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Portugal]] and elsewhere came to Hawaii under fixed term contracts (typically for five years). Most returned home on schedule, but large numbers stayed permanently. By 1908 about 180,000 Japanese workers had arrived. No more were allowed in, but 54,000 remained permanently.<ref name=\"Beechert1985\">{{cite book|author=Edward D.

The army and navy used both traditional [[Canoe|canoes]] and uniforms including helmets made of natural materials and loincloths (called the Malo) as well as western technology like artillery cannons, muskets, and European ships.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} European advisors were captured, treated well and became Hawaiian citizens.{{Clarify|reason=When were they captured? By who?|date=December 2018}} When Kamehameha died in 1819 he left his son [[Kamehameha II|Liholiho]] a large arsenal with tens of thousands of soldiers and many warships. This helped put down the revolt at [[Kuamoo Burials|Kuamo\u02bbo]] later in 1819 and [[Humehume]]'s rebellion on Kauai in 1824.\n\nDuring the [[House of Kamehameha|Kamehameha dynasty]] the population in Hawaii was ravaged by epidemics following the arrival of outsiders. The military shrank with the population, so by the end of the Dynasty there was no Hawaiian navy and only an army, consisting of several hundred troops. After a French invasion that sacked [[Honolulu]] in 1849, [[Kamehameha III]] sought defense treaties with the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. During the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]] in Europe, Kamehameha III declared Hawaii a neutral state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiankingdom.org/hawn-territory.shtml |title=Hawaiian Territory |publisher=Hawaiian Kingdom |date= |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref> The United States government put strong pressure on [[Kamehameha IV]] to make trade exclusively to the United States even annexed the islands. To counterbalance this situation Kamehameha IV and [[Kamehameha V]] pushed for alliances with other foreign powers, especially [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]. Hawaii claimed uninhabited islands in the Pacific, including the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]], many of which came into conflict with American claims.\n\nFollowing the Kamehameha dynasty the royal guards were disbanded under [[Lunalilo]] after a barracks revolt in September 1873. A small army was restored under King [[Kal\u0101kaua|Kalakaua]] but failed to stop the 1887 Rebellion by the [[Reform Party (Hawaii)|Missionary Party]]. In 1891, [[Lili\u02bbuokalani|Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani]] came to power. The elections of 1892 were followed with petitions and requests from her administration to change the [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|constitution of 1887]]. <!-- prior sentence is very confusing and needs editing by someone with knowledge --> The US maintained a policy of keeping at least one [[cruiser]] in Hawaii at all times. On January 17, 1893, Lili\u02bbuokalani, believing the US military would intervene if she changed the constitution, waited for the {{USS|Boston|1884|6}} to leave port. Once it was known that Lili\u02bbuokalani was revising the constitution, the ''Boston'' was recalled and assisted the Missionary Party in her overthrow. Following the overthrow and the establishment of the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] the Kingdom's military was disarmed and disbanded. One hundred years later, in 1993, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Apology Resolution]], admitting wrongdoing and issuing a belated apology.\n\n== French Incident (1839) ==\n{{Main|Laplace affair}}\n\nUnder the rule of [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]], the powerful, newly converted Protestant widow of Kamehameha the Great, Catholicism was illegal in Hawaii, and in 1831 French Catholic priests were forcibly deported by chiefs loyal to her.

In his restoration speech, Kamehameha III declared that ''\"[[Ua Mau ke Ea o ka \u02bb\u0100ina i ka Pono]]\"'' (The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness), the motto of the future State of Hawaii.

De Tromelin made ten demands to King [[Kamehameha III]] on August 22, mainly demanding that full religious rights be given to Catholics, (a decade earlier, during the French Incident the ban on Catholicism had been lifted, but Catholics still enjoyed only partial religious rights). On August 25 the demands had not been met. After a second warning was made to the civilians, French troops overwhelmed the [[skeleton crew|skeleton force]] and captured [[Honolulu Fort]], spiked the [[Coastal artillery|coastal guns]] and destroyed all other weapons they found (mainly muskets and ammunition). They raided government buildings and general property in Honolulu, causing damage that amounted to $100,000. After the raids the invasion force withdrew to the fort. De Tromelin eventually recalled his men and left Hawaii on September 5.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\nAnticipating foreign encroachment on Hawaiian territory, King Kamehameha III dispatched a delegation to the United States and Europe to secure the recognition of Hawaiian independence.

On March 17, 1843, King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe of France]] recognized Hawaiian independence at the urging of King [[Leopold I of Belgium]].

Upon his deathbed, he summoned High Chiefess [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]] to declare his intentions of making her heir to the throne. Bernice refused the crown, and Kamehameha V died without naming an heir.\n\nThe refusal of Bishop to take the crown forced the legislature of the kingdom to [[Election|elect]] a new monarch. From 1872 to 1873, several relatives of the Kamehameha line were nominated. In [[Hawaii monarchal election, 1873|a ceremonial popular vote and a unanimous legislative vote]], [[Lunalilo|William C.

Once again, the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom needed an election to fill the royal vacancy. [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Queen Emma]], widow of Kamehameha IV, was nominated along with [[Kal\u0101kaua|David Kal\u0101kaua]]. The [[Honolulu Courthouse riot|1874 election]] was a nasty political campaign in which both candidates resorted to mudslinging and innuendo. David Kal\u0101kaua became the second elected King of Hawaii but without the ceremonial popular vote of Lunalilo. The choice of the legislature was controversial, and U.S. and British troops were called upon to suppress rioting by Queen Emma's supporters, the ''[[Emmaites]]''.\n\nKal\u0101kaua officially proclaimed his sister, Lili\u02bbuokalani would succeed to the throne upon his death.  Hoping to avoid uncertainty in the monarchy's future,  Kalakaua had named a line of succession in his will, so that after Lili\u2019uokalani the throne should succeed to Princess [[Ka\u02bbiulani|Victoria Ka\u02bbiulani]], then to Queen Consort [[Kapi\u02bbolani|Kapi\u2019olani]], followed by her sister, [[Poomaikelani|Princess Po\u2019omaikalani]], then Prince [[David Kaw\u0101nanakoa|David Lamea Kawananakoa]] and last was Prince [[Jonah K\u016bhi\u014d Kalaniana\u02bbole]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18910318.2.57&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1|title=Daily Alta California 18 March 1891 \u2014 California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>  Although, the will was not an official line of succession or a proper proclamation according to kingdom law.

Thurston]], Minister of Interior under King Kal\u0101kaua.  The constitution was proclaimed by the king after a meeting of 3,000 residents including an armed militia demanded he sign it or be deposed. The document created a [[constitutional monarchy]] like the one that existed in United Kingdom, stripping the King of most of his personal authority and empowering the legislature and establishing cabinet government. It has since become widely known as the \"Bayonet Constitution\" because of the threat of force used to gain Kal\u0101kaua's cooperation.\n\nThe [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|1887 constitution]] empowered the citizenry to elect members of the House of Nobles (who had previously been appointed by the King). It increased the value of property a citizen must own to be eligible to vote above the previous Constitution of 1864 and denied voting rights to Asians who comprised a large proportion of the population (a few Japanese and some Chinese had previously become [[Naturalization|naturalized]] and now lost voting rights they had previously enjoyed). This guaranteed a voting monopoly to wealthy native Hawaiians and Europeans. The Bayonet Constitution continued allowing the monarch to appoint cabinet ministers, but stripped him of the power to dismiss them without approval from the Legislature.\n\n=== Lili\u02bbuokalani's Constitution ===\n[[File:Liliuokalani, c. 1891.jpg|thumb|[[Lili\u02bbuokalani|Lili'uokalani]]]]\nIn 1891, Kal\u0101kaua died and his sister Lili\u02bbuokalani assumed the throne. She came to power during an economic crisis precipitated in part by the [[McKinley Tariff]]. By rescinding the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, the new tariff eliminated the previous advantage Hawaiian exporters enjoyed in trade to U.S. markets. Many Hawaiian businesses and citizens were feeling the pressures of the loss of revenue, so Lili\u02bbuokalani proposed a [[lottery]] and opium licensing to bring in additional revenue for the government. Her ministers and closest friends tried to dissuade her from pursuing the bills, and these controversial proposals were used against her in the looming constitutional crisis.\n\nLili\u02bbuokalani wanted to restore power to the monarch by abrogating the 1887 Constitution. The queen launched a campaign resulting in a petition to proclaim a new Constitution.\nMany citizens and residents who in 1887 had forced Kal\u0101kaua to sign the \"Bayonet Constitution\" became alarmed when three of her recently appointed cabinet members informed them that the queen was planning to unilaterally proclaim her new Constitution.<ref>[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/liliuokalani/hawaii/hawaii-7.html Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen, Appendix A] \"The three ministers left Mr. Parker to try to dissuade me from my purpose; and in the meantime they all (Peterson, Cornwell, and Colburn) went to the government building to inform Thurston and his part of the stand I took.\"</ref>  Some cabinet ministers were reported to have feared for their safety after upsetting the queen by not supporting her plans.<ref>[http://morganreport.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=804-805 Morgan Report, p804-805] \"Every one knows how quickly Colburn and Peterson, when they could escape from the palace, called for help from Thurston and others, and how afraid Colburn was to go back to the palace.\"</ref>\n\n=== Overthrow ===\n{{Main|Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom}}\n[[File:USS Boston landing force, 1893 (PP-36-3-002).jpg|thumb|left|[[USS Boston (1884)|USS ''Boston'''s]] landing force on duty at the Arlington Hotel, Honolulu, at the time of the overthrow, January 1893<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/h56000/h56555c.htm|title=U.S. Navy History site|publisher=}}</ref>]]\n\nIn 1893, local businessmen and politicians, composed of six non-native Hawaiian Kingdom subjects, five American nationals, one British national, and one German national,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/annexation/blount/br0588.html|title=Blount Report \u2013 Page 588|publisher=}}</ref> all of whom were living and doing business in Hawaii, overthrew the queen, her cabinet and her marshal, and took over the government of the Hawaiian Kingdom.\n\nHistorians suggest that businessmen were in favor of overthrow and annexation to the U.S. in order to benefit from more favorable trade conditions with its main export market.<ref>Kinzer, Stephen.

During this time, members of the former government lobbied in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] for the United States to restore the Hawaiian Kingdom. President [[Grover Cleveland]] considered the overthrow to have been an illegal act of war; he refused to consider annexation of the islands and initially worked to restore the Queen to her throne. Between December 14, 1893 and January 11, 1894 a standoff occurred between the [[United States]], [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom]] against the Provisional Government to pressure them into returning the Queen known as the [[Black Week (Hawaii)|Black Week]]. This incident drove home the message that President Cleveland wanted Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani's return to power, and so on July 4, 1894 the Republic of Hawaii was requested to wait for President Cleveland's second term to finish. As lobbying continued in Washington during 1894, the royalist faction was secretly amassing an army of 600 strong led by former [[Captain of the guard|Captain of the Guard]] [[Samuel Nowlein]]. In 1895 they attempted a [[1895 Wilcox rebellion|counter-rebellion]], and [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] was arrested when a weapons cache was found on the palace grounds. She was tried by a military tribunal of the Republic, convicted of treason, and placed under permanent house arrest in her own home.\n\nOn January 24, 1895 while under house arrest [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] was forced to sign a five-page declaration as \"Liliuokalani Dominis\" in which she formally abdicated the throne in return for the release and commutation of the death sentences of her jailed supporters, including Minister Joseph Nawahi, Prince Kawananakoa, Robert Wilcox, and Prince Jonah Kuhio:\n\n{{quote|Before ascending the throne, for fourteen years, or since the date of my proclamation as heir apparent, my official title had been simply Liliuokalani.

[[Kamehameha I]] had conquered Maui and Molokai five years prior in the [[Battle of Kepaniwai]], but they were abandoned when Kamehameha's Big Island possession was under threat and later reconquered by the aged King [[Kahekili II]] of Maui. His domain comprised six of the major islands of the Hawaiian chain, and with [[Kaumualii]]'s peaceful surrender, Kauai and Niihau were added to his territories. [[Kamehameha II]] assumed de facto control of Kauai and Niihau when he kidnapped Kaumualii, ending his vassal rule over the islands.\n\nIn 1822, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]] and her husband [[Kaumualii|King Kaumuali\u02bbi]] traveled with Captain William Sumner to find [[Nihoa]], as her generation had only known the island through songs and [[Hawaiian religion|myths]]. Later, King [[Kamehameha IV]] sailed there to officially annex the island. Kamehameha IV and Kal\u0101kaua would later claim other islands in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Archipelago]], including [[Pearl and Hermes Atoll]], [[Necker Island (Hawaii)|Necker Island]], [[Laysan]], [[Lisianski Island]], [[Kure Atoll|Ocean (Kure) Atoll]], [[Midway Atoll]], [[French Frigate Shoals]], [[Maro Reef]] and [[Gardner Pinnacles]], as well as [[Palmyra Atoll]], [[Johnston Atoll]] and [[Jarvis Island]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Several of these islands had previously been claimed by the United States under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856. The Stewart Islands, or [[Sikaiana]] Atoll, near the [[Solomon Islands]], were ceded to Hawaii in 1856 by its residents, but the cession was never formalized by the Hawaiian government.\n\n== Royal estates ==\n[[File:Lowering the Hawaiian flag at Annexation ceremony (PPWD-8-3-006).jpg|thumb|On August 12, 1898, the flag of the Hawaiian Kingdom over \u02bbIolani Palace was lowered to raise the [[Flag of the United States|United States flag]] to signify annexation.]]\n\nEarly in its history, the Hawaiian Kingdom was governed from several locations including coastal towns on the islands of Hawai\u02bbi and Maui ([[Lahaina, Hawaii|L\u0101hain\u0101]]). It wasn't until the reign of Kamehameha III that a capital was established in Honolulu on the Island of O\u02bbahu.\n\nBy the time Kamehameha V was king, he saw the need to build a royal palace fitting of the Hawaiian Kingdom's new found prosperity and standing with the royals of other nations. He commissioned the building of [[Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale|the palace at Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale]]. He died before it was completed. Today, the palace houses the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai\u02bbi.\n\nDavid Kal\u0101kaua shared the dream of Kamehameha V to build a palace, and eagerly desired the trappings of European royalty. He commissioned the construction of [[\u02bbIolani Palace]].

It is often considered to be one of the most turbulent and traumatic years of the [[20th century in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/31/us/1968-important-events/index.html|title=Eight unforgettable ways 1968 made history|first=Katie|last=McLaughlin|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\nThe year began with relative peace until January 21 when the North Vietnamese Army [[PAVN]] attacked the Marine base at [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]] Quang Tri Province, Vietnam. This was the beginning of the [[Battle of Khe Sanh]] and the attack focused US command on Khe Sanh near the [[DMZ]]. The initial attack was followed by the North Vietnamese country-wide launch of the [[Tet Offensive]] on January 30, 1968, resulting in a South Vietnamese-US victory, eliminating the [[Viet Cong]] as an effective fighting force. The attack included a North Vietnamese assassination attempt on South Vietnam's president [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] which failed. North Vietnam premised the attack on a South Vietnamese uprising against South Vietnam and US forces but this uprising did not occur as the South Vietnamese populace did not rally to the North. Also, on January 23 the North Korean government seized {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} and its crew of eighty-three in an attempt to divert attention from a failed January 21 assassination attempt on South Korean President [[Park Chung-hee]] known as the [[Blue House raid]]. In [[Greenland]] a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] on a [[Cold War]] mission known as [[Operation Chrome Dome]] [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash|crashed]] with four nuclear bombs on board. One airman was killed. The cleanup operation was informally known as Operation Freezelove, a play on words on the movie ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.\n\nFour to six thousand citizens of the city of [[Hu\u1ebf]], Vietnam, deemed political enemies, were either clubbed to death or buried alive by the North Vietnamese Army. This was known as the [[Massacre at Hue]].\n\nThe year also saw the highest level of US troop commitment when President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed legislation that increased the maximum number of United States troops active on the ground to five hundred and forty-nine thousand and five hundred (549,500). This did not count US forces in the [[South China Sea]], Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, North Vietnam, and China with reserves in the Philippines, [[Okinawa]], Japan, Korea, [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], the United States, and worldwide totaling over three million (3,000,000). South Vietnam in the same year fielded a total force of eight hundred and twenty thousand troops (820,000). It was also the most expensive year of the war, with a cost of $77.4 billion. The support of the United States for South Vietnam was at its peak. [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|Antiwar sentiment]] continued to grow as an increasing number of Americans questioned United States involvement in Vietnam, as the United States was drafting young men to fight for South Vietnam while South Vietnam did not have a draft for its own citizens; however, the war continued despite changing US public opinion.\n\nNorth Vietnam benefited politically from the [[Tet Offensive]] when [[Walter Cronkite]], a respected television newscaster, swayed many Americans and President Johnson, by giving his personal opinion on a national prime time editorial: \"It is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.\" This may have marked a transition in journalism where a news reporter became a news and policy maker. President Johnson cited Walter Cronkite's changed opinion as a factor in his decision not to seek reelection stating to his advisers: \"If I have lost Cronkite I have lost middle America.\" President Johnson later died on January 22, 1973, at age 64 from heart problems.\n\nOn April 4, civil rights activist [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.]]  The United States erupted in [[King assassination riots|violent riots]], the most severe of which occurred in [[1968 Washington, D.C. riots|Washington, D.C.]], [[1968 Chicago riots|Chicago]], and [[1968 Baltimore riots|Baltimore]]. Extensive areas of these and many other cities were looted, burned, and destroyed by the rioters and more than 40 people were killed during the month of protest, which led to greater racial tensions between Americans. Despite this, a landmark piece of legislation, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], which was President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s legacy, was passed by the expertise of President Johnson in April. This legislation was passed with bipartisan [[United States Congress|Congressional]] support and effectively prohibited housing discrimination based on race.\n\nThe [[1968 United States Presidential election]] became a referendum on the Vietnam War. A peace candidate had previously emerged in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] challenged the Vietnam War policies of President Johnson, who had refused to seek or accept another nomination for president and had endorsed his vice president, [[Hubert Humphrey]], for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Senator McCarthy's support came primarily from young people, most of whom were subject to the draft or were in deferred status. This divided the country by age as older citizens, a so-called silent majority, tended to support or not actively oppose government policies. This division of the populace encouraged Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] to seek the Democratic Presidential nomination. Senator Kennedy was assassinated after winning the [[California]] primary and defeating Senator Eugene McCarthy. The [[assassination of Robert F. Kennedy]] in June led to uncertainty in the race for the Democratic nomination for the [[President of the United States|presidency]]. After Vice President Humphrey won the Democratic nomination at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], another wave of violent protests emerged, this time between the mostly young antiwar demonstrators and police. The uncertainty within the Democratic Party benefited [[Richard Nixon]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], as he successfully won the presidential race by appealing to the \"Silent Majority\" under the promise \"Peace with Honor\". Nixon, a staunch anti-communist, had gained the voters' trust. A particularly strong showing by segregationist [[George Wallace]] of the [[American Independent Party]] in 1968's presidential election highlighted the strong element of racial division that continued to persist across the country.\n\nIn popular culture, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' was the most profitable film of the year, earning $56.7 million, while ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. \"[[Hey Jude]]\" by [[the Beatles]] was the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1968|hottest single of 1968]] in the U.S. according to [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]], demonstrating the continued popularity of bands associated with the [[British Invasion]] that began in 1964.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Incumbents ==\n=== Federal Government ===\n* [[President of the United States|President]]: [[Lyndon B.

It is often considered to be one of the most turbulent and traumatic years of the [[20th century in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/31/us/1968-important-events/index.html|title=Eight unforgettable ways 1968 made history|first=Katie|last=McLaughlin|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\nThe year began with relative peace until January 21 when the North Vietnamese Army [[PAVN]] attacked the Marine base at [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]] Quang Tri Province, Vietnam. This was the beginning of the [[Battle of Khe Sanh]] and the attack focused US command on Khe Sanh near the [[DMZ]]. The initial attack was followed by the North Vietnamese country-wide launch of the [[Tet Offensive]] on January 30, 1968, resulting in a South Vietnamese-US victory, eliminating the [[Viet Cong]] as an effective fighting force. The attack included a North Vietnamese assassination attempt on South Vietnam's president [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] which failed. North Vietnam premised the attack on a South Vietnamese uprising against South Vietnam and US forces but this uprising did not occur as the South Vietnamese populace did not rally to the North. Also, on January 23 the North Korean government seized {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} and its crew of eighty-three in an attempt to divert attention from a failed January 21 assassination attempt on South Korean President [[Park Chung-hee]] known as the [[Blue House raid]]. In [[Greenland]] a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] on a [[Cold War]] mission known as [[Operation Chrome Dome]] [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash|crashed]] with four nuclear bombs on board. One airman was killed. The cleanup operation was informally known as Operation Freezelove, a play on words on the movie ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.\n\nFour to six thousand citizens of the city of [[Hu\u1ebf]], Vietnam, deemed political enemies, were either clubbed to death or buried alive by the North Vietnamese Army. This was known as the [[Massacre at Hue]].\n\nThe year also saw the highest level of US troop commitment when President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed legislation that increased the maximum number of United States troops active on the ground to five hundred and forty-nine thousand and five hundred (549,500). This did not count US forces in the [[South China Sea]], Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, North Vietnam, and China with reserves in the Philippines, [[Okinawa]], Japan, Korea, [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], the United States, and worldwide totaling over three million (3,000,000). South Vietnam in the same year fielded a total force of eight hundred and twenty thousand troops (820,000). It was also the most expensive year of the war, with a cost of $77.4 billion. The support of the United States for South Vietnam was at its peak. [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|Antiwar sentiment]] continued to grow as an increasing number of Americans questioned United States involvement in Vietnam, as the United States was drafting young men to fight for South Vietnam while South Vietnam did not have a draft for its own citizens; however, the war continued despite changing US public opinion.\n\nNorth Vietnam benefited politically from the [[Tet Offensive]] when [[Walter Cronkite]], a respected television newscaster, swayed many Americans and President Johnson, by giving his personal opinion on a national prime time editorial: \"It is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.\" This may have marked a transition in journalism where a news reporter became a news and policy maker. President Johnson cited Walter Cronkite's changed opinion as a factor in his decision not to seek reelection stating to his advisers: \"If I have lost Cronkite I have lost middle America.\" President Johnson later died on January 22, 1973, at age 64 from heart problems.\n\nOn April 4, [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.]]  The United States erupted in [[King assassination riots|violent riots]], the most severe of which occurred in [[1968 Washington, D.C. riots|Washington, D.C.]], [[1968 Chicago riots|Chicago]], and [[1968 Baltimore riots|Baltimore]]. Extensive areas of these and many other cities were looted, burned, and destroyed by the rioters and more than 40 people were killed during the month of protest, which led to greater racial tensions between Americans. Despite this, a landmark piece of legislation, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], which was President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s legacy, was passed by the expertise of President Johnson in April. This legislation was passed with bipartisan [[United States Congress|Congressional]] support and effectively prohibited housing discrimination based on race.\n\nThe [[1968 United States Presidential election]] became a referendum on the Vietnam War. A peace candidate had previously emerged in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] challenged the Vietnam War policies of President Johnson, who had refused to seek or accept another nomination for president and had endorsed his vice president, [[Hubert Humphrey]], for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Senator McCarthy's support came primarily from young people, most of whom were subject to the draft or were in deferred status. This divided the country by age as older citizens, a so-called silent majority, tended to support or not actively oppose government policies. This division of the populace encouraged Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] to seek the Democratic Presidential nomination. Senator Kennedy was assassinated after winning the [[California]] primary and defeating Senator Eugene McCarthy. The [[assassination of Robert F. Kennedy]] in June led to uncertainty in the race for the Democratic nomination for the [[President of the United States|presidency]]. After Vice President Humphrey won the Democratic nomination at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], another wave of violent protests emerged, this time between the mostly young antiwar demonstrators and police. The uncertainty within the Democratic Party benefited [[Richard Nixon]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], as he successfully won the presidential race by appealing to the \"Silent Majority\" under the promise \"Peace with Honor\". Nixon, a staunch anti-communist, had gained the voters' trust. A particularly strong showing by segregationist [[George Wallace]] of the [[American Independent Party]] in 1968's presidential election highlighted the strong element of racial division that continued to persist across the country.\n\nIn popular culture, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' was the most profitable film of the year, earning $56.7 million, while ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. \"[[Hey Jude]]\" by [[the Beatles]] was the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1968|hottest single of 1968]] in the U.S. according to [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]], demonstrating the continued popularity of bands associated with the [[British Invasion]] that began in 1964.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Incumbents ==\n=== Federal Government ===\n* [[President of the United States|President]]: [[Lyndon B.
