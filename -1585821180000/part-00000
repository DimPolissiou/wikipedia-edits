Two PAF F-86F Sabres (Flt. Lt. M. N. Butt (leader) and Flt. Lt. M. Yunis) of No. 15 Squadron on Air Defence Alert (ADA) were scrambled from Sargodha Air Base to intercept the IAF aircraft. Butt attempted to bring down the Canberra by firing his Sabre's machine guns, but the Canberra was flying at an altitude of more than 50,000 feet \u2013 beyond the operational ceiling of the F-86F. When Yunis took over from his leader, the Canberra suddenly lost height while executing a turn over Rawalpindi. Yunis fired a burst that struck the Canberra at an altitude of 47,500 feet and brought it down over Rawat, near Rawalpindi, marking the first aerial victory of the PAF. Both crew members of the IAF Canberra, ejected and were captured by Pakistani authorities and were subsequently released after remaining in detention for some time.<ref>''History of the Pakistan Air Force 1947\u20131982'', Pakistan Air Force Book Club, 1982 {{page needed|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1965 India\u2013Pakistan War===\n{{Main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1965}}\nThe PAF fleet at the time consisted of 12 F-104 Starfighters, some 120 F-86 Sabres and around 20 B-57 Canberra bombers.<ref name=\"Pakistan's Air Power, by John Fricker (page 89)\">{{citation |first=John |last=Fricker |title=Pakistan's Air Power |work=[[Flight International]] |year=1969 |page=89 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200111.html?search=Pakistan%20Mirage%205 |accessdate=21 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114183912/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200111.html?search=Pakistan%20Mirage%205 |archive-date=14 January 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The PAF claims to have had complete air superiority over the battle area from the second day of operations.<ref name=\"Pakistan's Air Power, by John Fricker (page 90)\">{{citation |first=John |last=Fricker |title=Pakistan's Air Power |work=[[Flight International]] |year=1969 |page=90 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200112.html |accessdate=21 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112084257/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200112.html |archive-date=12 January 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> While, [[Arjan Singh|Air Chief Marshal Arjan Singh]] of the [[Indian Air Force]] claimed, despite been qualitative inferior, [[Indian Air Force|IAF]] achieved air superiority in three days in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 War]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/1965-war-we-achieved-air-superiority-in-three-days-says-air-force-marshal-arjan-singh_1805797.html |title=1965 war: We achieved air superiority in three days, says Air Force Marshal Arjan Singh |access-date=3 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614221636/http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/1965-war-we-achieved-air-superiority-in-three-days-says-air-force-marshal-arjan-singh_1805797.html |archive-date=14 June 2016 |url-status=live  |date=4 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMany publications have credited the PAF's successes to U.S. equipment, claiming it to be superior to the aircraft operated by the IAF and giving the PAF a \"qualitative advantage\".

Because Kahuta was close to the Indian border it was decided that the best way to deter an Indian attack would be to procure new advanced fighters and weaponry. These could be used to mount a retaliatory attack on India's nuclear research facilities at [[Trombay]] in the event of an Indian attack on Kahuta.

Two PAF F-86F Sabres (Flt. Lt. M. N. Butt (leader) and Flt. Lt. M. Yunis) of No. 15 Squadron on Air Defence Alert (ADA) were scrambled from Sargodha Air Base to intercept the IAF aircraft. Butt attempted to bring down the Canberra by firing his Sabre's machine guns, but the Canberra was flying at an altitude of more than 50,000 feet \u2013 beyond the operational ceiling of the F-86F. When Yunis took over from his leader, the Canberra suddenly lost height while executing a turn over Rawalpindi. Yunis fired a burst that struck the Canberra at an altitude of 47,500 feet and brought it down over Rawat, near Rawalpindi, marking the first aerial victory of the PAF. Both crew members of the IAF Canberra, ejected and were captured by Pakistani authorities and were subsequently released after remaining in detention for some time.<ref>''History of the Pakistan Air Force 1947\u20131982'', Pakistan Air Force Book Club, 1982 {{page needed|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1965 India\u2013Pakistan War===\n{{Main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1965}}\nThe PAF fleet at the time consisted of 12 F-104 Starfighters, some 120 F-86 Sabres and around 20 B-57 Canberra bombers.<ref name=\"Pakistan's Air Power, by John Fricker (page 89)\">{{citation |first=John |last=Fricker |title=Pakistan's Air Power |work=[[Flight International]] |year=1969 |page=89 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200111.html?search=Pakistan%20Mirage%205 |accessdate=21 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114183912/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200111.html?search=Pakistan%20Mirage%205 |archive-date=14 January 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The PAF claims to have had complete air superiority over the battle area from the second day of operations.<ref name=\"Pakistan's Air Power, by John Fricker (page 90)\">{{citation |first=John |last=Fricker |title=Pakistan's Air Power |work=[[Flight International]] |year=1969 |page=90 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200112.html |accessdate=21 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112084257/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200112.html |archive-date=12 January 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> While, [[Arjan Singh|Air Chief Marshal Arjan Singh]] of the [[Indian Air Force]] claimed, despite been qualitative inferior, [[Indian Air Force|IAF]] achieved air superiority in three days in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 War]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/1965-war-we-achieved-air-superiority-in-three-days-says-air-force-marshal-arjan-singh_1805797.html |title=1965 war: We achieved air superiority in three days, says Air Force Marshal Arjan Singh |access-date=3 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614221636/http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/1965-war-we-achieved-air-superiority-in-three-days-says-air-force-marshal-arjan-singh_1805797.html |archive-date=14 June 2016 |url-status=live  |date=4 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMany publications have credited the PAF's successes to U.S. equipment, claiming it to be superior to the aircraft operated by the IAF and giving the PAF a \"qualitative advantage\".

ACM Shamim told General Zia that, \"Indian aircraft could reach the area in 3 minutes whereas the PAF would take 8 minutes, allowing the Indians to attack the facility and return before the PAF could defend it\". Because Kahuta was close to the Indian border it was decided that the best way to deter an Indian attack would be to procure new advanced fighters and weaponry. These could be used to mount a retaliatory attack on India's nuclear research facilities at [[Trombay]] in the event of an Indian attack on Kahuta. It was decided the most suitable aircraft would be the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]], which the United States eventually agreed to supply after the PAF refused to purchase the [[Northrop F-5|F-5E]] and [[Northrop F-5|F-5G]].

A level of segregation between the genders is maintained. For example, early-morning parades are performed together but some parts of training, mainly physical exercises, are done with males and females separated. According to Squadron Leader Shazia Ahmed, the officer in charge of the first female cadets and a psychologist, this also improves confidence of the women.<ref name=\"11/05/05, BBC News, Pakistan's first women fighter pilots\" />\n\nIn 2005 it was reported that two batches in the Air Force Academy's flying wing contained 10 women, with many more in the engineering and aerospace wings. Cadet Saba Khan, from [[Quetta]] in [[Balochistan]], applied after reading a newspaper advertisement seeking female cadets. She was one of the first four women to pass the first stages of flying training on propeller-driven light aircraft and move onto faster jet-powered training aircraft.<ref name=\"11/05/05, BBC News, Pakistan's first women fighter pilots\" />\n\nIn March 2006, the PAF inducted a batch of 34 fighter pilots which included the organisation's first four female fighter pilots. Three years of training had been completed by the pilots at [[Pakistan Air Force Academy|PAF Academy Risalpur]] before they graduated and were awarded their Flying Badges during the ceremony. Certificates of honour were handed to the successful cadets by a \"delighted\" General Ahsan Saleem Hayat, vice chief of the Pakistan Army, who acknowledged that the PAF was the first of the Pakistan Armed Forces to introduce women to its combat units. One of the women, Flying Officer Nadia Gul, was awarded a trophy for best academic achievement. The other female graduates were Mariam Khalil, Saira Batool and the above-mentioned Saba Khan.<ref name=\"30 March 2006, BBC News, Pakistan gets women combat pilots\" /> A second batch of pilots, including 3 female pilots, graduated from the 117th GD(P) course at PAF Academy Risalpur in September 2006.
