About 60 years old, with a face like a mask, he is [[Charles Darnay]]'s uncle and twin brother of Charles Darnay's father (now deceased).\n\n===Marquis in Paris===\nWhile still handsome, fashionable, and exquisitely poised, the Marquis St. Evr\u00e9monde is out of favor at the royal court for reasons that are not specified.  In \"Monseigneur in Town\", the Marquis is greeted without warmth by \"Monseigneur\" (a great lord and senior courtier) at the latter's Parisian reception.  Snubbed, he waits until all Monseigneur's sycophants and hangers-on file out, then murmurs a curse sending Monseigneur to the Devil.  (The curse is uttered in a mirrored salon, possibly suggesting that it rebounds on the speaker.) The Marquis St. Evr\u00e9monde's carriage heads for his country chateau through the streets of Paris, at the break-neck pace favored by the nobility.  Although most pedestrians scatter in terror, his carriage runs over a little child; being one of Gaspard's.  The Marquis shows no remorse at the sight of the crushed body \u2014 inquiring whether his horses are alright \u2014 and, \"with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had paid for it\",<ref>[[#refDickens2003|Dickens 2003]], (Book 2, Chapter 7).</ref> throws a gold coin to the distraught father. The Defarges appear\u2014Ernest Defarge to comfort the grieving Gaspard; Madame Defarge to stand erect, stare at the Marquis boldly in the face and knit his Fate. The remainder of the crowd watches in cowed silence but an unknown hand throws the coin back into the carriage. Before driving on, the Marquis responds with cold contempt that he would willingly ride over any of \"you dogs\" and exterminate them. This scene foreshadows the oncoming revolution in France.\n\n===Marquis at his estate===\nThe Marquis St. Evr\u00e9monde appears in the two following chapters \"Monseigneur in the Country\" (when he is told by a road worker that a dust-covered figure was hanging on to the bottom of his carriage) and \"the \"Gorgon's Head\" (dining with his nephew, Charles Darnay). Dickens uses his account of the journey of the indifferent Marquis through the countryside surrounding his chateau to graphically describe the poverty and desperation of the peasantry.\n\nDuring the dinner between uncle and nephew, Charles Darnay apologizes for being detained in London.  He alludes to his danger there (his recent treason trial) wondering aloud if his uncle did not in fact orchestrate the accusations brought against him.  Charles further believes that if the Marquis were still in the French Court's good graces, he would obtain a ''[[lettre de cachet]]'' and have his nephew imprisoned in France.  His uncle confesses that for the honor of the family, he would do exactly that.\n\nThe dinner conversation between uncle and nephew reveals their diametrically opposed view of the rural peasantry.  St. Evr\u00e9monde the elder considers it an obligation of his family station to subjugate \"the vulgar\", (\"Repression is the only lasting philosophy\u2026\"). He regrets that recent reforms have placed some restraints on the formerly absolute powers of his class to abuse their inferiors; recalling that at an earlier date a peasant had been [[poniard]]ed in a neighbouring room for \"professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter\".  Charles Darnay, by contrast, hopes to honor his mother's dying wish by ameliorating the wrongs the family has caused.  When his uncle laughs at this, Charles renounces his rights to the Evr\u00e9monde title and lands, in favor of a new life in London.  His uncle, slyly, already knows that this \"new life\" includes an emigree doctor and his daughter.\n\nThey retire for the night.\n\n===Death of the Marquis and aftermath===\nAt the conclusion of Chapter 9, the Marquis is found stabbed to death in his bed. \u201cThe Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added the one stone face waiting for two hundred years.\" (Chapter 9). All of his property is inherited by Darnay, who remains in London but instructs an agent to redress grievances as far as possible in the growing confusion of the pending revolution.\n\nA year later Gaspard, assassin of the Marquis and father of the child ridden down by his carriage, is captured and executed, his body left hanging above the village water fountain. Subsequently, the Evr\u00e9monde chateau is burned to the ground at night by \"Jacques\" revolutionaries while the abused villagers watch in grim silence and the officers of a neighboring royal garrison stand helpless because they know that their troops will probably no longer obey their orders.\n\nOnly later in the novel, during the trial of Charles Darnay, is the secret of the Marquis and his brother exposed: [[Alexandre Manette]]'s diary from the Bastille details how in 1767 the Evr\u00e9monde brothers (the younger initially helped by the elder) had abducted and abused a pregnant peasant wife causing her death, fatally wounded her brother who tried to protect her and had brought about the deaths of both the girl's husband and father as well. Manette tries to alert the authorities to the Evr\u00e9monde crimes but his letter is passed on to the aristocratic brothers. This was the reason he was imprisoned in the Bastille; likewise this was the inspiration of a lifelong hatred of the Evr\u00e9mondes by the last member of the wronged girl's family-her sister [[Madame Defarge]] who married Manette's servant [[Ernest Defarge]].\n\n===Names===\nThe Marquis St. Evr\u00e9monde is referred to as \"Monseigneur\" and \"Monsieur.\" These three different titles all refer to the same person: people who are below the Marquis in rank refer to him as \"Monseigneur\" or \"Monsieur,\" while people of equal rank refer to him as the \"Marquis.\"\n\nThe patronym \"Evr\u00e9monde\", suggests an Anglo-French conglomerate, (\"every\" plus \"tout le monde\").  Phonetically, it sounds like \u201cEveryman.\u201d\nAnd, when the phrases \"evre\" and \"monde\" are separately translated from French into English, they mean fever and world, making the name \"Feverworld\".\n\nThe note on the knife in the Marquis chest is signed \"Jacques\"; a common nickname used by the aristocracy for the peasant was \"[[Jacquerie|Jacques Goodman]]\".\n\n==Cinematic and Theatrical Portrayals==\nIn the 2008 [[Broadway musical]] adaptation of '[[A Tale of Two Cities (musical)|A Tale of Two Cities]],' the Marquis St. Evr\u00e9monde is played by [[Les Minski]].\n\nOn film he has been played by such actors as [[Basil Rathbone]] (1935) and [[Christopher Lee]] (1958). In 2003, the Rathbone portrayal of St. Evr\u00e9monde was nominated for [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains]] as one of the Top 50 Villains.<ref>[http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/handv400.pdf AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains Nominees]</ref>\n\nOn television, he has been portrayed by [[Barry Morse]] (1980), [[Max Adrian]] (1958), [[Jerome Willis]] (1965), [[Heron Carvic]] (1957), [[Morris Perry]] (1980) and [[Jean-Marc Bory]] (1989).\n\nOn radio he has been portrayed by [[John Moffatt (actor)|John Moffatt]] and [[Clive Merrison]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{A Tale of Two Cities}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Evremonde, Marquis}}\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1859]]\n[[Category:A Tale of Two Cities characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional marquesses and marchionesses]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Male literary villains]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #DEDEE2\n| name        = Marquis St. Evr\u00e9monde\n| series      = [[A Tale of Two Cities]]\n| image       = File:T2C, Fred Barnard, Dr Manette's epistolary denunciation of the Evr\u00e9mondes brothers (III,8).jpeg\n| caption     = The Evr\u00e9monde brothers (left) by [[Fred Barnard]], 1870s\n| creator     = [[Charles Dickens]]\n| portrayer   = [[Basil Rathbone]]\n| nickname    = Monsieur the Marquis\n| gender      = Male\n| title       = Marquis\n| nationality = French\n}}\n\nThe '''Marquis St. Evr\u00e9monde''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Marquis or [[Monseigneur]] St. Evr\u00e9monde appears (in life) for only three chapters in Book the Second, symbolizing the pitiless, arrogant, French aristocracy.

Charles Darnay, by contrast, hopes to honor his mother\u2019s dying wish by ameliorating the wrongs the family has caused.  When his uncle laughs at this, Charles renounces his rights to the Evr\u00e9monde title and lands, in favor of a new life in London.  His uncle, slyly, already knows that this \"new life\" includes an emigree doctor and his daughter.\n\nThey retire for the night.\n\n===Death of the Marquis and aftermath===\nAt the conclusion of Chapter 9, the Marquis is found stabbed to death in his bed. \u201cThe Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added the one stone face waiting for two hundred years.\" (Chapter 9). All of his property is inherited by Darnay, who remains in London but instructs an agent to redress grievances as far as possible in the growing confusion of the pending revolution.\n\nA year later Gaspard, assassin of the Marquis and father of the child ridden down by his carriage, is captured and executed, his body left hanging above the village water fountain. Subsequently the Evr\u00e9monde chateau is burned to the ground at night by \"Jacques\" revolutionaries while the abused villagers watch in grim silence and the officers of a neighboring royal garrison stand helpless because they know that their troops will probably no longer obey their orders.\n\nOnly later in the novel, during the trial of Charles Darnay, is the secret of the Marquis and his brother exposed: [[Alexandre Manette]]'s diary from the Bastille details how in 1767 the Evr\u00e9monde brothers (the younger initially helped by the elder) had abducted and abused a pregnant peasant wife causing her death, fatally wounded her brother who tried to protect her and had brought about the deaths of both the girl's husband and father as well. Manette tries to alert the authorities to the Evr\u00e9monde crimes but his letter is passed on to the aristocratic brothers. This was the reason he was imprisoned in the Bastille; likewise this was the inspiration of a lifelong hatred of the Evr\u00e9mondes by the last member of the wronged girl's family-her sister [[Madame Defarge]] who married Manette's servant [[Ernest Defarge]].\n\n===Names===\nThe Marquis St. Evr\u00e9monde is referred to as \"Monseigneur\" and \"Monsieur.\" These three different titles all refer to the same person: people who are below the Marquis in rank refer to him as \"Monseigneur\" or \"Monsieur,\" while people of equal rank refer to him as the \"Marquis.\"\n\nThe patronym \"Evr\u00e9monde\", suggests an Anglo-French conglomerate, (\"every\" plus \"tout le monde\").  Phonetically, it sounds like \u201cEveryman.\u201d\nAnd, when the phrases \"evre\" and \"monde\" are separately translated from French into English, they mean fever and world, making the name \"Feverworld\".\n\nThe note on the knife in the Marquis chest is signed \"Jacques\"; a common nickname used by the aristocracy for the peasant was \"[[Jacquerie|Jacques Goodman]]\".\n\n==Cinematic and Theatrical Portrayals==\nIn the 2008 [[Broadway musical]] adaptation of '[[A Tale of Two Cities (musical)|A Tale of Two Cities]],' the Marquis St. Evr\u00e9monde is played by [[Les Minski]].\n\nOn film he has been played by such actors as [[Basil Rathbone]] (1935) and [[Christopher Lee]] (1958). In 2003, the Rathbone portrayal of St. Evr\u00e9monde was nominated for [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains]] as one of the Top 50 Villains.<ref>[http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/handv400.pdf AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains Nominees]</ref>\n\nOn television, he has been portrayed by [[Barry Morse]] (1980), [[Max Adrian]] (1958), [[Jerome Willis]] (1965), [[Heron Carvic]] (1957), [[Morris Perry]] (1980) and [[Jean-Marc Bory]] (1989).\n\nOn radio he has been portrayed by [[John Moffatt (actor)|John Moffatt]] and [[Clive Merrison]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{A Tale of Two Cities}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Evremonde, Marquis}}\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1859]]\n[[Category:A Tale of Two Cities characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional marquesses and marchionesses]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Male literary villains]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: Subsequently \u2192 Subsequently,, \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_St._Evr%C3%A9monde"}

The test investigates whether or not a work includes at least two women conversing about a topic other than a man. Sometimes a requirement that the two women must have names is added, which is a rule the podcast adheres to.<ref>Racic, Monica (March 3, 2018) \"[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/do-this-years-best-picture-oscar-nominees-pass-the-bechdel-test Do This Year's Best Picture Nominees Pass the Bechdel Test?]\" ''The New Yorker'' Retrieved November 12, 208.</ref> For the purposes of the show, the exchange only needs to be two lines of dialogue. A commonality of many movies that pass are that often only this minimum is reached typically by an inconsequential conversation or one in which the two lines are nested within a larger conversation that is about men.\n\nThe hosts often discuss the limitations of the Bechdel Test and, despite using it as their namesake, primarily employ it to initiate a larger discussion about the depiction and uses of female-identifying characters in film.<ref> Bryan, Scott; Lane, Tim; Furlan, Julia (February 8, 2018) \"[https://www.buzzfeed.com/scottybryan/27-podcasts-you-need-to-start-listening-to-in-2018 27 Podcasts You Need to Start Listening to in 2018]\" ''BuzzFeed'' Retrieved November 12, 2018.</ref>\n\nThey occasionally reference and utilize similar tests of representation, such as the [[Vito Russo test]], the [[Ava_DuVernay#DuVernay_test|DuVernay Test]], and the [[Mako Mori Test]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.glaad.org/releases/glaad-introduces-studio-responsibility-index-report-lgbt-images-films-released-big-six|title=GLAAD Introduces 'Studio Responsibility Index,' Report on LGBT Images in Films Released by 'Big Six' Studios|date=2013-08-20|work=GLAAD|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en}}</ref><ref> Douglas, Nick (October 10, 2017) \"[https://lifehacker.com/the-bechdel-test-and-other-media-representation-tests-1819324045 The Bechdel Test and Other Media Representation Tests, Explained]\" ''Lifehacker'' Retrieved November 12, 2018.</ref>\n\n== Format and structure ==\nThe podcast is informally comedic, and formatted in an improvisational style. They frequently mention supplemental running jokes, such as Loftus' obsession with actor [[Alfred Molina]], and Durante's reminder of her Master's Degree in [[Screenwriting]] from [[Boston University]].<ref>Bulnes, Rebecca (July 7, 2017). \"[https://aux.avclub.com/the-bechdel-cast-swoons-over-alfred-molina-in-its-best-1798288459 The Bechdel Cast Swoons Over Alfred Molina in its Best Episode Yet]\" ''The A.V.

Durante then briefly recaps the film at the top of the episode with interjection from Loftus and the guest. This is followed by analyzing and discussing the representation of women through an intersectional lens, alternating in tone between serious and jocular.<ref> Reghay, Nayomi (May 27, 2017). \"[https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/the-bechdel-test-podcast/ The Bechdel Cast Roasts Your Favorite Movie with a Hilarious, Feminist Lens]\" ''The Daily Dot'' Retrieved November 12, 2018.</ref> \n\nAt the end of each episode they determine whether or not the film passes the [[Bechdel test]], as well as rate it on a \"nipple scale\" from 0 to 5 nipples based on how female-identifying characters are portrayed overall.<ref> Kukla, Becky (September 12, 2018). \"[https://culturess.com/2018/08/25/10-feminist-podcasts-to-listen-to-right-now/ 10 Feminist Podcasts We Should All Be Listening to Right Now]\" ''Culturess'' Retrieved November 12, 2018.</ref>\n\nEpisodes typically range from 45 minutes to 80 minutes, and are released once a week on Thursdays and twice a month on [[Patreon]].

The test investigates whether or not a work includes at least two women conversing about a topic other than a man. Sometimes a requirement that the two women must have names is added, which is a rule the podcast adheres to.<ref>Racic, Monica (March 3, 2018) \"[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/do-this-years-best-picture-oscar-nominees-pass-the-bechdel-test Do This Year's Best Picture Nominees Pass the Bechdel Test?]\" ''The New Yorker'' Retrieved November 12, 208.</ref> For the purposes of the show, the exchange only needs to be two lines of dialogue. A commonality of many movies that pass are that often only this minimum is reached typically by an inconsequential conversation or one in which the two lines are nested within a larger conversation that is about men.\n\nThe hosts often discuss the limitations of the Bechdel Test and, despite using it as their namesake, primarily employ it to initiate a larger discussion about the depiction and uses of female-identifying characters in film.<ref> Bryan, Scott; Lane, Tim; Furlan, Julia (February 8, 2018) \"[https://www.buzzfeed.com/scottybryan/27-podcasts-you-need-to-start-listening-to-in-2018 27 Podcasts You Need to Start Listening to in 2018]\" ''BuzzFeed'' Retrieved November 12, 2018.</ref>\n\nThey occasionally reference and utilize similar tests of representation, such as the [[Vito Russo test]], the [[Ava_DuVernay#DuVernay_test|DuVernay Test]], and the [[Mako Mori Test]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.glaad.org/releases/glaad-introduces-studio-responsibility-index-report-lgbt-images-films-released-big-six|title=GLAAD Introduces 'Studio Responsibility Index,' Report on LGBT Images in Films Released by 'Big Six' Studios|date=2013-08-20|work=GLAAD|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en}}</ref><ref> Douglas, Nick (October 10, 2017) \"[https://lifehacker.com/the-bechdel-test-and-other-media-representation-tests-1819324045 The Bechdel Test and Other Media Representation Tests, Explained]\" ''Lifehacker'' Retrieved November 12, 2018.</ref>\n\n== Format and structure ==\nThe podcast is informally comedic, and formatted in an improvisational style. They frequently mention supplemental running jokes, such as Loftus' obsession with actor [[Alfred Molina]], and Durante's reminder of her Master's Degree in [[Screenwriting]] from [[Boston University]].<ref>Bulnes, Rebecca (July 7, 2017). \"[https://aux.avclub.com/the-bechdel-cast-swoons-over-alfred-molina-in-its-best-1798288459 The Bechdel Cast Swoons Over Alfred Molina in its Best Episode Yet]\" ''The A.V.

Durante then briefly recaps the film at the top of the episode with interjection from Loftus and the guest.

{"title_page": "Complexity class", "text_new": "[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among several important complexity classes]]\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], a '''complexity class''' is a set of [[Computational problem|problems]] of related resource-based complexity. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

These classes are important because they help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of allowable error. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 0. Another is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/2 for strings in the language and with error probability 0 for strings not in the language. Finally, the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time) is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/3. The class '''BPP''' is at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown.\n\n====Boolean circuit models====\n\nThe classes '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' and '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' are defined using [[Boolean circuit]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Interactive  proof models====\n\nClasses like '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using [[Interactive proof system]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

These classes are important because they help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of allowable error. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 0. Another is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/2 for strings in the language and with error probability 0 for strings not in the language. Finally, the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time) is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/3. The class '''BPP''' is at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most a polynomial slowdown.\n\n====Boolean circuit models====\n\nThe classes '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' and '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' are defined using [[Boolean circuit]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Interactive  proof models====\n\nClasses like '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using [[Interactive proof system]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\n\nThe team classification was calculated by adding up the times in the general classification of the three highest ranking cyclists per team; the team with the least time was the winner.\n\n===Stage winners===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Stage characteristics and winners<ref name=\"mdc1932\">{{cite web|url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1932.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829141232/http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1932.php|archive-date=29 August 2012|access-date=28 October 2016|url-status=dead|publisher=M\u00e9moire du cyclisme|title=26\u00e8me Tour de France 1932|language=French}}</ref>{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=30}}<ref name=\"topten\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cvccbike.com/tour/top_ten.html#1932 |title=Tour de France GC top ten |author=Arian Zwegers |publisher=CVCC |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gWiBhPaH?url=http://www.cvccbike.com/tour/top_ten.html |archivedate=4 May 2009 |url-status=live |accessdate=20 April 2009 }}</ref>\n|-\n!

Billie believes her father is dead and has never known her mother. Her only known relative in Salem is her brother [[Austin Reed (fiction)|Austin Reed]]. Luckily, [[Carrie Brady]] befriends her and gives Billie a place to stay. It took a while before Billie can get clean and rid her life of past demons.\n\nEventually, Billie decides to turn her life around and starts her own cosmetics company, ''Countess Wilhelmina''. [[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] buys out ''Countess Wilhelmina'' to spite Billie. Later that year, Billie befriends [[Tony DiMera]]. He brings up 49% of Titan Industries and then brings Billie in to run the ''Countess Wilhelmina'' division.\n\nBillie's father [[Curtis Reed (Days of our Lives)|Curtis Reed]], who had been presumed dead, returns. Curtis, who got Billie addicted to drugs as a young girl and [[rape]]d her, is eventually murdered in Nov 1993, and Billie is arrested for killing him. However, Billie refuses to tell [[Bo Brady]] how she knows Curtis and she makes her brother, Austin, keep quiet. Billie thinks that if Bo learns the truth, he won't love her. Nevertheless, Bo falls in love with Billie during the trial and is determined to prove that she is innocent.\n\nBillie and Austin are both shocked when they learn Kate was married to Curtis Reed. Eventually Billie admits that Curtis is her father. [[Stefano DiMera]] had killed Curtis in self-defense and framed Billie. Billie is let go and Bo tells her that he loves her no matter what. Billie and Austin are also reunited with Kate, the mother they thought abandoned them. Kate tells them that Curtis had taken them from her and she believed they had all been killed in a car crash. Curtis has actually faked their deaths and changed their names, after abandoning Kate at the side of the road, pregnant with their half-brother [[Lucas Roberts]].\n\nIn May 1994 Bo and Billie discover a woman named Gina who looks just like Bo's first wife, Hope. She has no memories of her past and Bo is convinced there is no way Hope could have survived the explosion all those years ago. Bo and Billie become engaged Dec 1994\n\nBo and Billie try to marry in Jan 1995, but the \"Desecrator\" struck and a falling chandelier almost kills them. They try again, but learn that they could not marry if there was any chance that Gina could be Hope. In order to help them, Gina signs a paper declaring that Hope is dead and Bo and Billie are finally married in Feb 1995. Gina opens a puzzle box and is proven to be Hope Brady, Bo's wife. Bo and Hope get a divorce so Billie and Bo can marry legally. But soon after the divorce papers are signed, Billie realizes that Bo is still in love with Hope, his one true love, so she leaves Salem in September 1995 to let them be together as a family with their son.\n\nBillie returns a year later in September 1996 and moves into the Kiriakis Mansion. She begins to date Franco Kelly, which upsets Bo, who is now getting ready to remarry Hope. Bo insists Franco is dangerous, but Hope accuses him of being jealous. The night before Bo and Hope's wedding, Bo gets caught in the middle of a massive storm and ends stranded on an island with Billie. Desperate to make it to his wedding, Bo tried to swim to shore, but almost drowned. Billie rescues him and helps him back to the cabin. Bo was in a hypothermic state, so help his get warm, Billie strips all their clothing and snuggled close to Bo. Hope, looking for Bo, arrived in time to witness the close encounter and jumped to the wrong conclusion. Upset, she calls off the wedding, much to Bo's despair, and he vows to get Hope back.\n\nBillie soon discovered that Bo was going undercover in an effort to expose and bring down drug lord J.L. King in Feb 1997. Billie gets in over her head with JL King and was forced to play along as Bo's girlfriend or risk Bo getting killed. They were also forced to keep up their ruse in front of Hope, otherwise their cover would be blown. Bo reminds Billie that he only sees her as a friend and Hope is the only woman he loves.\n\nBo and Billie were forced to travel to Rome with King, where he had arranged a wedding for them to test them. Coincidentally, Hope and Franco were also in Rome during that time and King invited them to the ceremony. To prove loyalty to JL, Bo agreed. The wedding went off without a hitch, to Billie's delight and Hope's devastation. (June 1997)\n\nKing was arrested in Rome soon afterwards. One of his goons, Max, kidnapped Billie and tied her to a bed where he injected her with heroin and other drugs. While under the influence, she saw visions of her dead father Curtis, who tormented her. Bo found Billie and saved her from becoming hooked on drugs again. Bo, believing Hope had moved on and no longer loved him anymore, made love to Billie. As a result of their lovemaking, Billie discovered she was pregnant (Jan 1998).\n\nDespite Billie's pregnancy and his commitment to be there for the baby, he still longed for Hope and told Billie this. Billie taunted Hope about her and Bo being lovers in Rome, even though she knew Bo really only loved Hope. Hope began looking for her missing years as Gina and Bo started helping her. Bo and Hope begin to reconcile. When she was around five months into her pregnancy, she followed Bo and Hope to New Orleans and was accosted by two young men. As a result, Billie went into premature labor and gave birth to a stillborn daughter, whom she named Georgia. (summer 1998) She buried her daughter in the swamp.\n\nShe then faked a fall after a fight with Hope and blamed Hope for her miscarriage. The guilt Hope had about Billie losing her baby kept Bo and Hope apart. Bo was there for Billie during the loss of their daughter, but still told her that Hope was the one he loved and wanted to build a future with, not Billie. Billie was outraged. Then everyone found out she had lied about the miscarriage and Bo would have nothing to do with her (fall 1998). He kept trying to win back Hope (and eventually succeeded). Billie stayed in Salem a little longer, and dated Roman Brady. After then being rejected by Nicholas Alamain, who was in love with Kate, she decided she had enough of Salem and moved back to Paris in Oct 1999.\n\n===2002\u201308===\nHope's disdain for Billie only grew over time. When Billie returns to Salem in 2002 and joins the police force, it only gets worse. Billie swears her motives are pure and not to create more trouble for Bo and Hope. She has a short-lived relationship with [[Jack Deveraux]] that never really gets off the ground. However her real reason for returning is to cause more problems for Bo and Hope.

Billie believes her father is dead and has never known her mother. Her only known relative in Salem is her brother [[Austin Reed (fiction)|Austin Reed]]. Luckily, [[Carrie Brady]] befriends her and gives Billie a place to stay. It took a while before Billie can get clean and rid her life of past demons.\n\nEventually, Billie decides to turn her life around and starts her own cosmetics company, ''Countess Wilhelmina''. [[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] buys out ''Countess Wilhelmina'' to spite Billie. Later that year, Billie befriends [[Tony DiMera]]. He brings up 49% of Titan Industries and then brings Billie in to run the ''Countess Wilhelmina'' division.\n\nBillie's father [[Curtis Reed (Days of our Lives)|Curtis Reed]], who had been presumed dead, returns. Curtis, who got Billie addicted to drugs as a young girl and [[rape]]d her, is eventually murdered in Nov 1993, and Billie is arrested for killing him. However, Billie refuses to tell [[Bo Brady]] how she knows Curtis and she makes her brother, Austin, keep quiet. Billie thinks that if Bo learns the truth, he won't love her. Nevertheless, Bo falls in love with Billie during the trial and is determined to prove that she is innocent.\n\nBillie and Austin are both shocked when they learn Kate was married to Curtis Reed. Eventually Billie admits that Curtis is her father. [[Stefano DiMera]] had killed Curtis in self-defense and framed Billie. Billie is let go and Bo tells her that he loves her no matter what. Billie and Austin are also reunited with Kate, the mother they thought abandoned them. Kate tells them that Curtis had taken them from her and she believed they had all been killed in a car crash. Curtis has actually faked their deaths and changed their names, after abandoning Kate at the side of the road, pregnant with their half-brother [[Lucas Roberts]].\n\nIn May 1994 Bo and Billie discover a woman named Gina who looks just like Bo's first wife, Hope. She has no memories of her past and Bo is convinced there is no way Hope could have survived the explosion all those years ago. Bo and Billie become engaged Dec 1994\n\nBo and Billie try to marry in Jan 1995, but the \"Desecrator\" struck and a falling chandelier almost kills them. They try again, but learn that they could not marry if there was any chance that Gina could be Hope. In order to help them, Gina signs a paper declaring that Hope is dead and Bo and Billie are finally married in Feb 1995. Gina opens a puzzle box and is proven to be Hope Brady, Bo's wife. Bo and Hope get a divorce so Billie and Bo can marry legally. But soon after the divorce papers are signed, Billie realizes that Bo is still in love with Hope, his one true love, so she leaves Salem in September 1995 to let them be together as a family with their son.\n\nBillie returns a year later in September 1996 and moves into the Kiriakis Mansion. She begins to date Franco Kelly, which upsets Bo, who is now getting ready to remarry Hope. Bo insists Franco is dangerous, but Hope accuses him of being jealous. The night before Bo and Hope's wedding, Bo gets caught in the middle of a massive storm and ends stranded on an island with Billie. Desperate to make it to his wedding, Bo tried to swim to shore, but almost drowned. Billie rescues him and helps him back to the cabin. Bo was in a hypothermic state, so help his get warm, Billie strips all their clothing and snuggled close to Bo. Hope, looking for Bo, arrived in time to witness the close encounter and jumped to the wrong conclusion. Upset, she calls off the wedding, much to Bo's despair, and he vows to get Hope back.\n\nBillie soon discovered that Bo was going undercover in an effort to expose and bring down drug lord J.L. King in Feb 1997. Billie gets in over her head with JL King and was forced to play along as Bo\u2019s girlfriend or risk Bo getting killed. They were also forced to keep up their ruse in front of Hope, otherwise their cover would be blown. Bo reminds Billie that he only sees her as a friend and Hope is the only woman he loves.\n\nBo and Billie were forced to travel to Rome with King, where he had arranged a wedding for them to test them. Coincidentally, Hope and Franco were also in Rome during that time and King invited them to the ceremony. To prove loyalty to JL, Bo agreed. The wedding went off without a hitch, to Billie\u2019s delight and Hope\u2019s devastation. (June 1997)\n\nKing was arrested in Rome soon afterwards. One of his goons, Max, kidnapped Billie and tied her to a bed where he injected her with heroin and other drugs. While under the influence, she saw visions of her dead father Curtis, who tormented her. Bo found Billie and saved her from becoming hooked on drugs again. Bo, believing Hope had moved on and no longer loved him anymore, made love to Billie. As a result of their lovemaking, Billie discovered she was pregnant (Jan 1998).\n\nDespite Billie's pregnancy and his commitment to be there for the baby, he still longed for Hope and told Billie this. Billie taunted Hope about her and Bo being lovers in Rome, even though she knew Bo really only loved Hope. Hope began looking for her missing years as Gina and Bo started helping her. Bo and Hope begin to reconcile. When she was around five months into her pregnancy, she followed Bo and Hope to New Orleans and was accosted by two young men. As a result, Billie went into premature labor and gave birth to a stillborn daughter, whom she named Georgia. (summer 1998) She buried her daughter in the swamp.\n\nShe then faked a fall after a fight with Hope and blamed Hope for her miscarriage. The guilt Hope had about Billie losing her baby kept Bo and Hope apart. Bo was there for Billie during the loss of their daughter, but still told her that Hope was the one he loved and wanted to build a future with, not Billie. Billie was outraged. Then everyone found out she had lied about the miscarriage and Bo would have nothing to do with her (fall 1998). He kept trying to win back Hope (and eventually succeeded). Billie stayed in Salem a little longer, and dated Roman Brady. After then being rejected by Nicholas Alamain, who was in love with Kate, she decided she had enough of Salem and moved back to Paris in Oct 1999.\n\n===2002\u201308===\nHope's disdain for Billie only grew over time. When Billie returns to Salem in 2002 and joins the police force, it only gets worse. Billie swears her motives are pure and not to create more trouble for Bo and Hope. She has a short-lived relationship with [[Jack Deveraux]] that never really gets off the ground. However her real reason for returning is to cause more problems for Bo and Hope. She assists [[Larry Welch]] in kidnapping Hope and Zack because she believes Larry is working for the [[ISA (Days of our Lives)|ISA]]. However, she can't stand seeing what this was doing to Bo and when she goes to stand up against Larry, he shoots her. Fortunately she survives and leaves Salem when she is released from the hospital in early 2003 to join the ISA in London.\n\nWhen the Salem stalker murders began she has a message for Bo saying she knows who the killer is but she goes missing along that same time.\n\nWhen Bo helps rescue the victims of the Salem Stalker, he bumps into Billie on the mysterious island.

Recently, she finds herself involved with another man who is not exactly available: [[Steve Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Steve \"Patch\" Johnson]]. Steve feels very pressured by Kayla's hopes that he will remember their past, and he rebels by starting to see Billie.\n\nWhile she is drunk, she has sex with Nick Fallon, who has developed strong feelings for her daughter Chelsea.

She uses her connections to help her younger half brother [[Philip Kiriakis]] find his missing son, Tyler. She works on finding the campus rapist.
