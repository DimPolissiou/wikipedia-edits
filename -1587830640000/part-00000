prefecture-level city in southeast of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. The administrative seat of Nyingchi is [[Bayi District]]. The Chinese claim part of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], which is one of the states of India, as part of the prefecture. (See [[South Tibet dispute]].)\n\nNyingchi is the location of [[Buchu Monastery]].\n\n==Geography and landmarks==\nThe prefecture-level city contains the [[Namcha Barwa]] Peak, and the [[Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon]], located in [[M\u00eadog County]], which attracts significant tourism and geoscientific and biological study to the area.\n\nApproximately 90 kilometers west of [[Gongbo'gyamda County]], is the alpine [[Pagsum Lake|Basum Lake]] in the upper catchment area of the [[Ba River (China)|Ba River]], the largest tributary of the [[Nyang River]] lying on average about {{convert|3,538|m}} above sea level. The lake surface is on average about 3,538 meters above sea level. Covering an area of {{convert|25.9|km2|abbr=on}}, the surrounding is populated by a diverse wildlife including [[leopard]]s, [[bear]]s, [[goat]]s, musk deer and Tibetan snow lions. In 1997, the Basum Lake was listed by the [[World Tourism Organization]] as a top tourist attraction. The lake also contains an inlet with a [[Gelug]] monastery. East of Nyingchi County, is the Seche La Mountain, a mountain of the [[Nyainqentanglha]] Mountain Range, which forms part of the watershed of the Nyang River and the [[Polung Zangbo]] River. Benri La Mountain near the small town of [[Nyingchi County|Dagze]] is a known sacred site of the Tibetan [[Bon]] Sect. Considered by Tibetans as one of the four great holy mountains in Tibet, on every tenth day of the eighth month of the [[Tibetan calendar]], a day of intense worshipping called \"Nangbolhasoi,\" is performed (meaning \"seeking for treasures from immortals.\")\n\n[[Bayi, Nyingchi County|Bayi Town]] is the administrative seat of Nyingchi, located 406 kilometers east of [[Lhasa]]. The vicinity is known for its [[cypress]]es which can grow up to 30 meters.\n\nThe Nangpo Gully, located about 50 kilometers northwest from [[Gongbo'gyamda County]], is one of the northern tributaries of the [[Nyang River]] and its upper stream is formed by the confluence of Yangwo, Gyixing and Boru streams. The area contains the [[hot spring]]s the Nun's Hot Springs, the Lama's Hot Springs and the Boru Hot Springs and many old [[pine tree]]s and [[cypress]]es, and caves. At the foot of the gully is the Yellow sect (Gelug) [[Bagar Monastery]], which was built during the period of the [[Fifth Dalai Lama]]. The cave above the monastery contains [[mural]]s of holy animals and Buddhist images, and below the cave is the famous [[karst]] springs. show jade-red bear branches, forming a \"Red Cloud Gully\" of 5 kilometers. The cobbles in the bed of the stream look like scattered pearls, so this place is also called \"Pearl Shoal.\" The scenes here are unique and beautiful.\n\n[[Lamaling Monastery|Burqug Lamaling Monastery]] is located on the third terrace on the left bank of the lower reaches of the [[Nyang River]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[subtropical highland climate|subtropical highland]] (Cwb).<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\">{{Cite web |url=//en.climate-data.org/location/227757/ |title=Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table for Nyingchi |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=2017-03-20 }}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=Y\n|single line=Y\n|location=Nyingchi (1981&ndash;2010 normals)\n|Jan high C= 8.9\n|Feb high C=10.2\n|Mar high C=13.5\n|Apr high C=16.6\n|May high C=19.5\n|Jun high C=21.6\n|Jul high C=22.3\n|Aug high C=22.1\n|Sep high C=20.5\n|Oct high C=17.4\n|Nov high C=13.7\n|Dec high C=10.1\n\n|Jan mean C= 1.0\n|Feb mean C= 2.8\n|Mar mean C= 5.9\n|Apr mean C= 8.9\n|May mean C=12.1\n|Jun mean C=15.1\n|Jul mean C=16.2\n|Aug mean C=15.7\n|Sep mean C=13.9\n|Oct mean C=10.3\n|Nov mean C= 5.5\n|Dec mean C= 1.7\n\n|Jan low C= \u22124.7\n|Feb low C= \u22122.3\n|Mar low C=  1.0\n|Apr low C=  3.8\n|May low C=  7.0\n|Jun low C= 10.8\n|Jul low C= 12.0\n|Aug low C= 11.6\n|Sep low C=  9.9\n|Oct low C=  5.6\n|Nov low C= \u22120.3\n|Dec low C= \u22124.2\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation mm=  1.3\n|Feb precipitation mm=  4.4\n|Mar precipitation mm= 19.0\n|Apr precipitation mm= 46.2\n|May precipitation mm= 75.3\n|Jun precipitation mm=119.2\n|Jul precipitation mm=143.3\n|Aug precipitation mm=122.2\n|Sep precipitation mm=110.5\n|Oct precipitation mm= 45.4\n|Nov precipitation mm=  4.7\n|Dec precipitation mm=  1.0\n\n|Jan humidity = 49\n|Feb humidity = 53\n|Mar humidity = 58\n|Apr humidity = 63\n|May humidity = 65\n|Jun humidity = 72\n|Jul humidity = 76\n|Aug humidity = 76\n|Sep humidity = 76\n|Oct humidity = 66\n|Nov humidity = 56\n|Dec humidity = 50\n|source 1= China Meteorological Administration<ref name=\"cma graphical\">{{cite web|url=http://data.cma.cn/data/weatherBk.html |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7f51 - WeatherBk Data |publisher=[[China Meteorological Administration]] |language = zh-cn |accessdate=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Forestry and agriculture ==\n[[File:Gongbo&#039;gyamda, Nyingchi, Tibet, China - panoramio (19).jpg|thumb|[[Basum Tso|Basum Lake]] in [[Gongbo'gyamda County]]]]\n\"According to local forestry officials, Nyingchi hosts the country's largest primitive forest region that covers 26.4 billion cubic metres, storing over 800 million cubic metres of wood.\"<ref name = \"tibettravelplanner\">{{Cite web\n| title = Tibet travel guide of Nyingchi Region, Bayi Town\n| accessdate = 2013-10-20\n| url = http://www.tibettravelplanner.com/reg_nyingchi.htm\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808015208/http://www.tibettravelplanner.com/reg_nyingchi.htm\n| archive-date = 2014-08-08\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> The forests of Bomi, Zayu and Loyu have ancient dragon spruces which reach heights of over 80 metres and diameters of 2.5 metres.

This is the second largest airport in TAR and is closer to LAC than any other airport in the region. While the airport terminal is meant for civil aviation, it is known that Chinese airports, especially those in TAR, are essentially \u2018dual-use\u2019 \u2013 meant for both civil and military use. As Xinhua had announced in 2015, China is carrying out an \u2018integration\u2019 of civil-military airports in order to \u2018strengthen aviation safety and combat support capabilities\u2019. This will include joint maintenance of airport support facilities, joint flight safety support and joint airport management. Incidentally, one of the first airports to implement the aforesaid \u2018integration\u2019 was the Lhasa Gonggar Airport in TAR, having completed the process in 2015 itself. It can therefore be said that Nyingchi airport gives the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) an additional operational base in TAR, and one that is right opposite the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh Overall, this development is in keeping with the recent increase in the tempo of PLAAF activities in TAR. }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[Guangdong]] province announced that it plans to invest more than RMB 400 million (US$63 million) in Nyingchi's tourism industry.

'''Linzhi''', is a prefecture-level city in southeast of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. The administrative seat of Nyingchi is [[Bayi District]]. The Chinese claim part of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], which is one of the states of India, as part of the prefecture. (See [[South Tibet dispute]].)\n\nNyingchi is the location of [[Buchu Monastery]].\n\n==Geography and landmarks==\nThe prefecture-level city contains the [[Namcha Barwa]] Peak, and the [[Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon]], located in [[M\u00eadog County]], which attracts significant tourism and geoscientific and biological study to the area.\n\nApproximately 90 kilometers west of [[Gongbo'gyamda County]], is the alpine [[Pagsum Lake|Basum Lake]] in the upper catchment area of the [[Ba River (China)|Ba River]], the largest tributary of the [[Nyang River]] lying on average about {{convert|3,538|m}} above sea level. The lake surface is on average about 3,538 meters above sea level. Covering an area of {{convert|25.9|km2|abbr=on}}, the surrounding is populated by a diverse wildlife including [[leopard]]s, [[bear]]s, [[goat]]s, musk deer and Tibetan snow lions. In 1997, the Basum Lake was listed by the [[World Tourism Organization]] as a top tourist attraction. The lake also contains an inlet with a [[Gelug]] monastery. East of Nyingchi County, is the Seche La Mountain, a mountain of the [[Nyainqentanglha]] Mountain Range, which forms part of the watershed of the Nyang River and the [[Polung Zangbo]] River. Benri La Mountain near the small town of [[Nyingchi County|Dagze]] is a known sacred site of the Tibetan [[Bon]] Sect. Considered by Tibetans as one of the four great holy mountains in Tibet, on every tenth day of the eighth month of the [[Tibetan calendar]], a day of intense worshipping called \"Nangbolhasoi,\" is performed (meaning \"seeking for treasures from immortals.\")\n\n[[Bayi, Nyingchi County|Bayi Town]] is the administrative seat of Nyingchi, located 406 kilometers east of [[Lhasa]]. The vicinity is known for its [[cypress]]es which can grow up to 30 meters.\n\nThe Nangpo Gully, located about 50 kilometers northwest from [[Gongbo'gyamda County]], is one of the northern tributaries of the [[Nyang River]] and its upper stream is formed by the confluence of Yangwo, Gyixing and Boru streams. The area contains the [[hot spring]]s the Nun's Hot Springs, the Lama's Hot Springs and the Boru Hot Springs and many old [[pine tree]]s and [[cypress]]es, and caves. At the foot of the gully is the Yellow sect (Gelug) [[Bagar Monastery]], which was built during the period of the [[Fifth Dalai Lama]]. The cave above the monastery contains [[mural]]s of holy animals and Buddhist images, and below the cave is the famous [[karst]] springs. show jade-red bear branches, forming a \"Red Cloud Gully\" of 5 kilometers. The cobbles in the bed of the stream look like scattered pearls, so this place is also called \"Pearl Shoal.\" The scenes here are unique and beautiful.\n\n[[Lamaling Monastery|Burqug Lamaling Monastery]] is located on the third terrace on the left bank of the lower reaches of the [[Nyang River]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[subtropical highland climate|subtropical highland]] (Cwb).<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\">{{Cite web |url=//en.climate-data.org/location/227757/ |title=Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table for Nyingchi |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=2017-03-20 }}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=Y\n|single line=Y\n|location=Nyingchi (1981&ndash;2010 normals)\n|Jan high C= 8.9\n|Feb high C=10.2\n|Mar high C=13.5\n|Apr high C=16.6\n|May high C=19.5\n|Jun high C=21.6\n|Jul high C=22.3\n|Aug high C=22.1\n|Sep high C=20.5\n|Oct high C=17.4\n|Nov high C=13.7\n|Dec high C=10.1\n\n|Jan mean C= 1.0\n|Feb mean C= 2.8\n|Mar mean C= 5.9\n|Apr mean C= 8.9\n|May mean C=12.1\n|Jun mean C=15.1\n|Jul mean C=16.2\n|Aug mean C=15.7\n|Sep mean C=13.9\n|Oct mean C=10.3\n|Nov mean C= 5.5\n|Dec mean C= 1.7\n\n|Jan low C= \u22124.7\n|Feb low C= \u22122.3\n|Mar low C=  1.0\n|Apr low C=  3.8\n|May low C=  7.0\n|Jun low C= 10.8\n|Jul low C= 12.0\n|Aug low C= 11.6\n|Sep low C=  9.9\n|Oct low C=  5.6\n|Nov low C= \u22120.3\n|Dec low C= \u22124.2\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation mm=  1.3\n|Feb precipitation mm=  4.4\n|Mar precipitation mm= 19.0\n|Apr precipitation mm= 46.2\n|May precipitation mm= 75.3\n|Jun precipitation mm=119.2\n|Jul precipitation mm=143.3\n|Aug precipitation mm=122.2\n|Sep precipitation mm=110.5\n|Oct precipitation mm= 45.4\n|Nov precipitation mm=  4.7\n|Dec precipitation mm=  1.0\n\n|Jan humidity = 49\n|Feb humidity = 53\n|Mar humidity = 58\n|Apr humidity = 63\n|May humidity = 65\n|Jun humidity = 72\n|Jul humidity = 76\n|Aug humidity = 76\n|Sep humidity = 76\n|Oct humidity = 66\n|Nov humidity = 56\n|Dec humidity = 50\n|source 1= China Meteorological Administration<ref name=\"cma graphical\">{{cite web|url=http://data.cma.cn/data/weatherBk.html |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7f51 - WeatherBk Data |publisher=[[China Meteorological Administration]] |language = zh-cn |accessdate=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Forestry and agriculture ==\n[[File:Gongbo&#039;gyamda, Nyingchi, Tibet, China - panoramio (19).jpg|thumb|[[Basum Tso|Basum Lake]] in [[Gongbo'gyamda County]]]]\n\"According to local forestry officials, Nyingchi hosts the country's largest primitive forest region that covers 26.4 billion cubic metres, storing over 800 million cubic metres of wood.\"<ref name = \"tibettravelplanner\">{{Cite web\n| title = Tibet travel guide of Nyingchi Region, Bayi Town\n| accessdate = 2013-10-20\n| url = http://www.tibettravelplanner.com/reg_nyingchi.htm\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808015208/http://www.tibettravelplanner.com/reg_nyingchi.htm\n| archive-date = 2014-08-08\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> The forests of Bomi, Zayu and Loyu have ancient dragon spruces which reach heights of over 80 metres and diameters of 2.5 metres.

This is the second largest airport in TAR and is closer to LAC than any other airport in the region. While the airport terminal is meant for civil aviation, it is known that Chinese airports, especially those in TAR, are essentially \u2018dual-use\u2019 \u2013 meant for both civil and military use. As Xinhua had announced in 2015, China is carrying out an \u2018integration\u2019 of civil-military airports in order to \u2018strengthen aviation safety and combat support capabilities\u2019. This will include joint maintenance of airport support facilities, joint flight safety support and joint airport management. Incidentally, one of the first airports to implement the aforesaid \u2018integration\u2019 was the Lhasa Gonggar Airport in TAR, having completed the process in 2015 itself. It can therefore be said that Nyingchi airport gives the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) an additional operational base in TAR, and one that is right opposite the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh Overall, this development is in keeping with the recent increase in the tempo of PLAAF activities in TAR. }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[Guangdong]] province announced that it plans to invest more than RMB 400 million (US$63 million) in Nyingchi's tourism industry.

Shortly after its construction it was burnt out in 1881, but rebuilt to its original designs in 1884. Its listed Grade II status probably derives in part from its connections with the Gilbert Scott family of architects but also from its contribution to the history of the development of boathouses in the late 19th century. Early history in college rowing depended on the use of rowing 'barges' of which very few now survive. The University College Boathouse was one of the early examples of the move of the boathouse onto dry land. Rather ironically in1999 the boathouse was once again subject to fire which effectively destroyed it and has led to these proposals to remove what is left and rebuild on the same site, but in a contemporary design.}}</ref>\n* St Laurence's Church, [[Frodsham]], Cheshire: organ case,{{sfn|Pevsner|Hubbard|1971|p=221}} 1882<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npor.org.uk/NPORView.html?RI=H00016

Shortly after its construction it was burnt out in 1881, but rebuilt to its original designs in 1884. Its listed Grade II status probably derives in part from its connections with the Gilbert Scott family of architects but also from its contribution to the history of the development of boathouses in the late 19th century. Early history in college rowing depended on the use of rowing 'barges' of which very few now survive. The University College Boathouse was one of the early examples of the move of the boathouse onto dry land. Rather ironically in1999 the boathouse was once again subject to fire which effectively destroyed it and has led to these proposals to remove what is left and rebuild on the same site, but in a contemporary design.}}</ref>\n* St Laurence's Church, [[Frodsham]], Cheshire: organ case,{{sfn|Pevsner|Hubbard|1971|p=221}} 1882<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npor.org.uk/NPORView.html?RI=H00016

American Historian [[Albert T. Olmstead]] describes in his work \"''History of the Persian Empire''\" how the [[Persians|Persian]] General Vaumisa wins a battle in the Autiyara districts located in Tyari and mentions that this is where the Assyrian Christians of the Tyari tribe maintained their independence.<ref>Olmstead, Albert T. (1970). ''History of the Persian Empire''. University of Chicago Press, p. 114</ref>  \n\nIn Classical [[Syriac language|Syriac]] the word Tyare is the plural form of a sheepfold, or grazing area. Indeed, the Assyrians of Tyare were renowned even amongst neighboring Kurds and [[Armenians]] for their [[yogurt]], [[cheese]] and other dairy products mostly made from [[sheep]] or [[goat milk|goat's milk]]. They were also famous for their [[textiles]]<ref name=\":0\" />, which again were spun and woven from sheep's wool. They also made woolen felt for their characteristic conical caps<ref>{{Cite book|last=Layard, Austen Henry, 1817-1894.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/12578949|title=Nineveh and Its Remains|date=1858|publisher=Appleton|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=194|oclc=12578949}}</ref>, and felt was also used for bedding.\n\nThese industries have continued to some extent in their rural settlements in Northern Iraq and North East Syria. One anecdote mentions that, on the flight of Assyrians from Urmia, Iran to Bakuba, Iraq in 1918, the Tyare Assyrians reached the end of the thousand mile trek with more sheep than when they had originally set out.\n\n\n==Dialect==\n[[File:Tyariaccent.ogg|thumb|right|Sample of the Tyare dialect. Notice the usage of [\u03b8], [\u00f0] and [aw], and also the analytic approach regarding [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] (''otax'd deyeh'', \"bedroom of his\").]]\nLike [[Jilu#Neo-Aramaic dialect of J\u012bl\u016b|J\u012bl\u016b]], the Tyare dialect is a very distinct [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] dialect. Unlike the ''Jilu'', ''Baz'' and ''Gawar'' dialects (which are very similar to each other), this one is more \"thick\". It is, in a way, a sort of a \"[[working class]]\" accent of the Assyrian dialects. Dialects within Tyare, and especially the Western group, have more in common with [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] than with Iraqi Koine (similar to General Urmian). \n\nMany Tyare speakers can switch [[accent reduction|back and forth]] from Tyare to \"Assyrian Standard\" (or \"Iraqi Koine\") when conversing with Assyrian speakers of other dialects. Some speakers tend to adopt a form of verb conjugation that is closer to the Iraqi Koine or Urmian Standard. This is attributed to the growing exposure to Assyrian Standard-based literature, media, and its use as a [[liturgical]] language by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

(1994). ''Basic sentence structure in Assyrian Aramaic'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, VIII/1:83-107</ref> The following are [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] ways to express possession, using the word ''b\u0115t\u0101'' (\"house\") as a base:\n\n*my house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yi'' (\"house of mine\")\n*your ([[Grammatical gender|masc.]], sing.) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u016bx'' (\"house of yours\")\n*your (fem., sing.) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yax'' \n*your (plural) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u0115x\u016b'' (\"house of yours\")\n*3rd person (masc., sing.): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yeh'' (\"house of his\")\n*3rd person (fem., sing.): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u014d'' (\"house of hers\")\n*3rd person (plural): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u0115h\u0115'' (\"house of theirs\")\n\n===Consonants===\nThe Lower Tyare dialect, being [[Conservative (language)|conservative]], generally retains interdental fricative allophones ({{IPAblink|\u03b8}} and {{IPAblink|\u00f0}}) of alveolar stops ([[Voiceless alveolar stop|/t/]] and [[Voiced alveolar stop|/d/]], respectively). This is a feature present in ancient Aramaic (see ''[[begadkefat]]''). Examples:\n* \"Village\": ''m\u0101\u1e6f\u0101'' (like \"math\" said in [[Received Pronunciation]]) in Lower Tyare becomes ''m\u0101t\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n* \"Hand\": ''\u012b\u1e0f\u0101'' in Tyare becomes ''\u012bd\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n\nIn Upper Tyare, {{IPAblink|\u03b8}} is not present in native words. Instead, it becomes a voiceless postalveolar fricative {{IPAblink|\u0283}} after [[front vowel]]s and a voiceless alveolar stop {{IPAblink|t}} everywhere else. Examples:\n*\"Dead\" (masc. singular): ''m\u012b\u1e6f\u0101'' in Lower Tyare, ''m\u012b\u0161\u0101'' in Upper Tyare, and ''m\u012bt\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n*\"Chicken\": ''k\u1e6f\u0113\u1e6f\u0101'' in Lower Tyare, ''kt\u0113\u0161\u0101'' in Upper Tyare, and ''kt\u0113t\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n\nIn some words of foreign origin, [f] may be retained instead of [p]--this is a feature also present in [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Turoyo]]. Furthermore, a {{IPAblink|l}} after a [[stop consonant|voiceless stop]] may be [[assimilation (phonology)|perseveratively assimilated]] by some speakers, namely those with a \"thicker\" accent from [[Ashita]], where, ''letl\u012b'' (\"I don't have\") becomes ''lett\u012b'', and ''priql\u0101h'' (\"it's over\") would become ''priqq\u0101h''.\n\n===Vowels===\n*The [[schwa]] ({{IPA|/\u0259/}}), heard in the Standard Assyrian pronunciations of words like ''x'''\u0259'''\u0161k\u0101'' (\"darkness\"), ''b'''\u0259'''rq\u0101'' (\"lightning\") and ''d'''\u0259'''dw\u0101'' (\"housefly\"), is switched to the [[near-close front unrounded vowel]] {{IPAblink|\u026a}} in the Tyare dialects. This distinct [[vowel shift]] gives the dialect a stronger, \"uneducated\" sound to outside ears.\n* The {{IPAblink|o}} in words like ''t'''\u014d'''r\u0101'' (\"bull\") is [[diphthong]]ized, so it will have an [aw] sound instead (''t'''aw'''r\u0101''). \n* The {{IPAblink|u}} in the standard Assyrian pronunciation, as in ''m'''\u016b'''d\u012b'' (\"what\"), is retained as {{IPAblink|o}} (i.e. ''m'''\u014d'''\u1e0f\u012b'').\n* {{IPA|/a/}}, as commonly uttered in words like ''n'''\u0101'''\u0161\u0101'' (\"man\") and ''n'''\u0101'''r\u0101'' (\"river\") is usually more back {{IPAblink|\u0251}} in the Tyare dialects.<ref>Robinson, Theodore Henry (1915).

A broad cloth, \"Kammar band,\" or waist band, is folded several times round the trunk of the body, and a short cut-away jacket of amazing colors, worn over a thin cotton variegated shirt. The head-dress consists of conical felt cap as depicted in frescoes of Assyrians of thousands of years ago, and which has survived to this day.\"<ref>Brigadier-Gen. H.H. Austin (1920).

Among them are a number of Tyare men, whose wild looks, combined with the splendour of their dress and arms, are of great interest. Their jackets are one mass of gold embroidery, their shirts, with hanging sleeves, are striped satin; their trousers, of sailor cut, are silk, made from the cocoons of their own silkworms, woven with broad crimson stripes on a white ground, on which is a zigzag pattern; and their handsome jackboots are of crimson leather.

American Historian [[Albert T. Olmstead]] describes in his work \"''History of the Persian Empire''\" how the [[Persians|Persian]] General Vaumisa wins a battle in the Autiyara districts located in Tyari and mentions that this is where the Assyrian Christians of the Tyari tribe maintained their independence.<ref>Olmstead, Albert T. (1970). ''History of the Persian Empire''. University of Chicago Press, p. 114</ref>  \n\nIn Classical [[Syriac language|Syriac]] the word Tyare is the plural form of a sheepfold, or grazing area. Indeed, the Assyrians of Tyare were renowned even amongst neighboring Kurds and [[Armenians]] for their [[yogurt]], [[cheese]] and other dairy products mostly made from [[sheep]] or [[goat milk|goat's milk]]. They were also famous for their [[textiles]]<ref name=\":0\" />, which again were spun and woven from sheep's wool. They also made woolen felt for their characteristic conical caps<ref>{{Cite book|last=Layard, Austen Henry, 1817-1894.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/12578949|title=Nineveh and Its Remains|date=1858|publisher=Appleton|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=194|oclc=12578949}}</ref>, and felt was also used for bedding.\n\nThese industries have continued to some extent in their rural settlements in Northern Iraq and North East Syria. One anecdote mentions that, on the flight of Assyrians from Urmia, Iran to Bakuba, Iraq in 1918, the Tyare Assyrians reached the end of the thousand mile trek with more sheep than when they had originally set out.\n\n\n==Dialect==\n[[File:Tyariaccent.ogg|thumb|right|Sample of the Tyare dialect. Notice the usage of [\u03b8], [\u00f0] and [aw], and also the analytic approach regarding [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] (''otax'd deyeh'', \"bedroom of his\").]]\nLike [[Jilu#Neo-Aramaic dialect of J\u012bl\u016b|J\u012bl\u016b]], the Tyare dialect is a very distinct [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] dialect. Unlike the ''Jilu'', ''Baz'' and ''Gawar'' dialects (which are very similar to each other), this one is more \"thick\". It is, in a way, a sort of a \"[[working class]]\" accent of the Assyrian dialects. Dialects within Tyare, and especially the Western group, have more in common with [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] than with Iraqi Koine (similar to General Urmian). \n\nMany Tyare speakers can switch [[accent reduction|back and forth]] from Tyare to \"Assyrian Standard\" (or \"Iraqi Koine\") when conversing with Assyrian speakers of other dialects. Some speakers tend to adopt a form of verb conjugation that is closer to the Iraqi Koine or Urmian Standard. This is attributed to the growing exposure to Assyrian Standard-based literature, media, and its use as a [[liturgical]] language by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. Furthermore, it is customary for [[Assyrian folk/pop music|Assyrian artists]] to generally sing in ''Iraqi Koine'' for them to be intelligible and have widespread recognition. Songs in Tyare dialects are usually of the [[folk music|folk]]-dance music genre and would attract certain audiences.<ref>Solomon, Zomaya S. (1997).

(1994). ''Basic sentence structure in Assyrian Aramaic'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, VIII/1:83-107</ref> The following are [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] ways to express possession, using the word ''b\u0115t\u0101'' (\"house\") as a base:\n\n*my house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yi'' (\"house of mine\")\n*your ([[Grammatical gender|masc.]], sing.) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u016bx'' (\"house of yours\")\n*your (fem., sing.) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yax'' \n*your (plural) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u0115x\u016b'' (\"house of yours\")\n*3rd person (masc., sing.): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yeh'' (\"house of his\")\n*3rd person (fem., sing.): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u014d'' (\"house of hers\")\n*3rd person (plural): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u0115h\u0115'' (\"house of theirs\")\n\n===Consonants===\nThe Lower Tyare dialect, being [[Conservative (language)|conservative]], generally retains interdental fricative allophones ({{IPAblink|\u03b8}} and {{IPAblink|\u00f0}}) of alveolar stops ([[Voiceless alveolar stop|/t/]] and [[Voiced alveolar stop|/d/]], respectively). This is a feature present in ancient Aramaic (see ''[[begadkefat]]''). Examples:\n* \"Village\": ''m\u0101\u1e6f\u0101'' (like \"math\" said in [[Received Pronunciation]]) in Lower Tyare becomes ''m\u0101t\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n* \"Hand\": ''\u012b\u1e0f\u0101'' in Tyare becomes ''\u012bd\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n\nIn Upper Tyare, {{IPAblink|\u03b8}} is not present in native words. Instead, it becomes a voiceless postalveolar fricative {{IPAblink|\u0283}} after [[front vowel]]s and a voiceless alveolar stop {{IPAblink|t}} everywhere else. Examples:\n*\"Dead\" (masc. singular): ''m\u012b\u1e6f\u0101'' in Lower Tyare, ''m\u012b\u0161\u0101'' in Upper Tyare, and ''m\u012bt\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n*\"Chicken\": ''k\u1e6f\u0113\u1e6f\u0101'' in Lower Tyare, ''kt\u0113\u0161\u0101'' in Upper Tyare, and ''kt\u0113t\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n\nIn some words of foreign origin, [f] may be retained instead of [p]--this is a feature also present in [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Turoyo]]. Furthermore, a {{IPAblink|l}} after a [[stop consonant|voiceless stop]] may be [[assimilation (phonology)|perseveratively assimilated]] by some speakers, namely those with a \"thicker\" accent from [[Ashita]], where, ''letl\u012b'' (\"I don't have\") becomes ''lett\u012b'', and ''priql\u0101h'' (\"it's over\") would become ''priqq\u0101h''.\n\n===Vowels===\n*The [[schwa]] ({{IPA|/\u0259/}}), heard in the Standard Assyrian pronunciations of words like ''x'''\u0259'''\u0161k\u0101'' (\"darkness\"), ''b'''\u0259'''rq\u0101'' (\"lightning\") and ''d'''\u0259'''dw\u0101'' (\"housefly\"), is switched to the [[near-close front unrounded vowel]] {{IPAblink|\u026a}} in the Tyare dialects. This distinct [[vowel shift]] gives the dialect a stronger, \"uneducated\" sound to outside ears.\n* The {{IPAblink|o}} in words like ''t'''\u014d'''r\u0101'' (\"bull\") is [[diphthong]]ized, so it will have an [aw] sound instead (''t'''aw'''r\u0101''). \n* The {{IPAblink|u}} in the standard Assyrian pronunciation, as in ''m'''\u016b'''d\u012b'' (\"what\"), is retained as {{IPAblink|o}} (i.e. ''m'''\u014d'''\u1e0f\u012b'').\n* {{IPA|/a/}}, as commonly uttered in words like ''n'''\u0101'''\u0161\u0101'' (\"man\") and ''n'''\u0101'''r\u0101'' (\"river\") is usually more back {{IPAblink|\u0251}} in the Tyare dialects.<ref>Robinson, Theodore Henry (1915).

Their jackets are one mass of gold embroidery, their shirts, with hanging sleeves, are striped satin; their trousers, of sailor cut, are silk, made from the cocoons of their own silkworms, woven with broad crimson stripes on a white ground, on which is a zigzag pattern; and their handsome jackboots are of crimson leather. With their white or red peaked felt hats and twisted silk pagris or head-cloths, their rich girdles, jewelled daggers, and inlaid pistols, they are very imposing.\" <ref>Bird, Isabella (1891).

[[Phil Neal]] took over on a caretaker basis for 10 games; however he lost 7 of these and by Christmas, City were in the bottom half of Division One and had turned to former [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] manager [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]] to arrest the decline.

Manchester City's [[1996\u201397 in English football|1996\u201397 Division One]] campaign got underway. Despite decent form under caretaker manager [[Asa Hartford]], the board opted to appoint former Crystal Palace manager [[Steve Coppell]] as Ball's successor, only for him to resign after just 6 matches in charge and 33 days as manager, claiming that the job was too much pressure for him. [[Phil Neal]] took over on a caretaker basis for 10 games; however he lost 7 of these and by Christmas, City were in the bottom half of Division One and had turned to former [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] manager [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]] to arrest the decline. Manchester City finished 14th in the final table.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|1996\u201397 Football League}}\n{{:1996\u201397 Football League|transcludesection=First

In the second and third seasons, the show was relocated to [[Alberta]]. It is shown in the episode \"Rhyme Time\" that the characters lived in the U.S. because of the [[History of the United States|American history]] that Andy recited, and the second language they were taught was Spanish rather than French, which is taught as a second language in Canada. In the episode \"Gnome for the Holidays\", a building can be seen saying, \"US Post Office\". Also, an American flag can be seen in the mayor's office in the \"Wag the Kid\" and \"Little Foot\" episodes, and in the episode \"It Came from East Gackle\", FBI agents came to East Gackle.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Andrew \"Andy\" Larkin===\nAndy loves to prank people as well as annoy his friends and family (especially his sister), but often gets into trouble. His best friend is Danny and he has a crush on Lori. His catchphrase is \"Check, please!\".\n\n===Daniel \"Danny\" Tadeus Pickett===\nThe best friend and Andy's right-hand man, helping him out with countless pranks. His last name has always been [[Pickett (disambiguation)|Pickett]]. The name \"Danny Pickett\" is derived from [[Jim Kjelgaard|Jim Kjelgaard's]] ''[[Big Red (film)|Big Red]]''.\n\n===Lori Mackney===\nAndy's crush but she is dismayed by his childishness due to his pranking. It is hinted that she returns Andy's feelings and dislikes Jen because Lori thinks that Jen abuses Andy. She wears a green tank top, blue skirt and sandals. She is known as \"Lisa\" in the books.\n\n===The Larkin family===\n* '''Alfred \"Al\" Larkin''': Andy and Jen's father and Freida's husband and presumably \"The Mystery Prankster\", aka \"The Mystery Prankster of East Gackle\".\n* '''Frieda Larkin''': Andy and Jen's mother and Al's wife.\n* '''Jennifer \"Jen\" Larkin''': Andy's older sister who is always cranky and irritable. She blames her younger brother Andy for almost everything. She finds his pranks childish and unfunny.\n* '''Spank Larkin''': Andy's fat and lazy dog. Spank frequently yawns, especially after going for a walk.\n\n===Recurring/minor characters===\n* '''Teri''': Jen's best friend.\n* '''Jervis Coltrane''': A French snob who has a crush on Lori Mackney and dreams of being the Prime Minister of Canada.\n* '''Peter Lik and Andrew Leech''': Peter and Andrew are Andy's and Danny's nemeses. They are usually referred to as Lik and Leech.\n* '''Craig Bennett''': Jen's crush and one of the best athletes of East Gackle.\n* '''Martin Bonwick''': He is a stereotypically nervous nerd who very often gets bullied.\n* '''Victor \"Vic\" Muskowitz (Mush)''': The pizza delivery man of East Gackle who is a good friend of Andy and Danny and he sometimes helps them with pranks.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Jr.''': A dumb police officer who is the incompetent son of Steve Rowgee Sr.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Sr.''': A police officer who is an old man, who always commands Steve Rowgee Jr. (his son) and is nicknamed the Iron Fisted Maniac.\n* '''Principal DeRosa''': He is the bad-tempered principal of the school in East Gackle and the main antagonist who is obsessed with punishing Andy.\n* '''Mr. Hutchins''': One of the many teachers at East Gackle school, Andy likes to prank him more than the other teachers.\n* '''Mayor Henry K.

Roth's rival.\n* '''Clyde''': The janitor of the school.\n* '''Hazel Strinner''': She has a crush on Andy and Lori's protecting friend.\n* '''Louella Berman''': Frieda's best friend.\n* '''Mrs. Wibbles''': Principal DeRosa's secretary.\n* '''Norman Larkin''': Andy's grandfather and Al's father who is also a prankster, implying that the male side of the Larkin family comes from a long line of pranksters, apparently with the exception of Al, though several hints have been given that he is also a prankster, even greater than his son or father.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Voice actors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.\n\nIt was originally an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] movie with completely different voice actors and a promotion for [[Fox Kids]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Shortly after, a TV series was developed with new voice actors, and it aired on [[Teletoon]]. The first season was produced by [[Cin\u00e9Groupe]], with the participation of [[Saban Entertainment]] in production<ref name=cmp /> and distribution ([[Saban International]]).\n\nThe main production of the series moved to Canada in season 2, which was co-produced with the French studio [[SIP Animation]] (itself split from Saban Entertainment) and in association with German channel [[Super RTL]]. All the voice cast had to be replaced with this move with the exception of Andy Larkin's voice actor [[Ian James Corlett]], as he was Canadian himself. As Saban Entertainment had by then been acquired by Disney, distribution of this season was handled by Disney subsidiary [[Buena Vista International Television]].\n\nSeason 3 was a collaboration between Cin\u00e9Groupe and Super RTL, and distributed by the production company directly. The whole series was later added to Cin\u00e9Groupe distribution partner HG Distribution's catalogue.<ref name=hgdistribution>{{cite web|url=https://hgagnondistribution.com/en/titles/animation/whats-andy|title=What's With Andy?|date=6 August 2015|website=HG Distribution}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n''What's with Andy?'' originally aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/cinegroupe-shoots-whats-with-andy/|title=Cinegroupe shoots What's With Andy?|publisher=}}</ref> In Australia, where [[Just!

The main character is Andy Larkin, a mischievous youth and the self-proclaimed \"world's greatest prankster\". The show follows him as he tries to perform elaborate [[practical joke]]s, or pranks, on people in the fictional town of East Gackle.\n\nAndy's best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank. His antagonists include his older sister, Jen Larkin, and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech. Andy has a crush on a girl named Lori Mackney and usually tries to impress her. He often breaks the [[fourth wall]] when the [[freeze frame shot|screen freezes]] in [[black and white]] \u2013 a distinctive feature of the show referred to as \"Doodle Vision\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/new-cinegroupe-series-coming-teletoon-and-fox-family-channel|title=New Cinegroupe Series Coming To Teletoon And Fox Family Channel.|website=Animation World Network}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe first season of ''What's with Andy?'' was set in the United States. In the second and third seasons, the show was relocated to [[Alberta]]. It is shown in the episode \"Rhyme Time\" that the characters lived in the U.S. because of the [[History of the United States|American history]] that Andy recited, and the second language they were taught was Spanish rather than French, which is taught as a second language in Canada. In the episode \"Gnome for the Holidays\", a building can be seen saying, \"US Post Office\". Also, an American flag can be seen in the mayor's office in the \"Wag the Kid\" and \"Little Foot\" episodes, and in the episode \"It Came from East Gackle\", FBI agents came to East Gackle.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Andrew \"Andy\" Larkin===\nAndy loves to prank people as well as annoy his friends and family (especially his sister), but often gets into trouble. His best friend is Danny and he has a crush on Lori. His catchphrase is \"Check, please!\".\n\n===Daniel \"Danny\" Tadeus Pickett===\nThe best friend and Andy's right-hand man, helping him out with countless pranks. His last name has always been [[Pickett (disambiguation)|Pickett]]. The name \"Danny Pickett\" is derived from [[Jim Kjelgaard|Jim Kjelgaard's]] ''[[Big Red (film)|Big Red]]''.\n\n===Lori Mackney===\nAndy's crush but she is dismayed by his childishness due to his pranking. It is hinted that she returns Andy's feelings and dislikes Jen because Lori thinks that Jen abuses Andy. She wears a green tank top, blue skirt and sandals. She is known as \"Lisa\" in the books.\n\n===The Larkin family===\n* '''Alfred \"Al\" Larkin''': Andy and Jen's father and Freida's husband and presumably \"The Mystery Prankster\", aka \"The Mystery Prankster of East Gackle\".\n* '''Frieda Larkin''': Andy and Jen's mother and Al's wife.\n* '''Jennifer \"Jen\" Larkin''': Andy's older sister who is always cranky and irritable.

Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.\n\nIt was originally an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] movie with completely different voice actors and a promotion for [[Fox Kids]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Shortly after, a TV series was developed with new voice actors, and it aired on [[Teletoon]]. The first season was produced by [[Cin\u00e9Groupe]], with the participation of [[Saban Entertainment]] in production<ref name=cmp /> and distribution ([[Saban International]]).\n\nThe main production of the series moved to Canada in season 2, which was co-produced with the French studio [[SIP Animation]] (itself split from Saban Entertainment) and in association with German channel [[Super RTL]]. All the voice cast had to be replaced with this move with the exception of Andy Larkin's voice actor [[Ian James Corlett]], as he was Canadian himself. As Saban Entertainment had by then been acquired by Disney, distribution of this season was handled by Disney subsidiary [[Buena Vista International Television]].\n\nSeason 3 was a collaboration between Cin\u00e9Groupe and Super RTL, and distributed by the production company directly. The whole series was later added to Cin\u00e9Groupe distribution partner HG Distribution's catalogue.<ref name=hgdistribution>{{cite web|url=https://hgagnondistribution.com/en/titles/animation/whats-andy|title=What's With Andy?|date=6 August 2015|website=HG Distribution}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n''What's with Andy?'' originally aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/cinegroupe-shoots-whats-with-andy/|title=Cinegroupe shoots What's With Andy?|publisher=}}</ref> In Australia, where [[Just!

It is the only airport in Atyrau and one of the thirteen international airports in Kazakhstan.\n\nThe region is crucial for Kazakhstan's economy as it is very close to oil exploration sites and platforms on the [[Caspian Sea]]. The city is the base town for many oil and construction companies.\n\nIn 2007 ATMA completed the construction of the new terminal building and a new longer runway. Enclosing a total area of {{Convert|2000|m2|abbr=on}}, the new terminal can serve 600 passengers per hour. Passengers can also benefit from the modernized CIP and VIP lounges. There is [[Wi-Fi]] internet access all over the terminal including CIP and VIP lounges.

ATMA is a joint company between Ma\u011fdenli Yer Hizmetleri and [[Atyrau]] Regional Administration with both parties having a 50% share. It is the only airport in Atyrau and one of the thirteen international airports in Kazakhstan.\n\nThe region is crucial for Kazakhstan's economy as it is very close to oil exploration sites and platforms on the [[Caspian Sea]]. The city is the base town for many oil and construction companies.\n\nIn 2007 ATMA completed the construction of the new terminal building and a new longer runway. Enclosing a total area of {{Convert|2000|m2|abbr=on}}, the new terminal can serve 600 passengers per hour. Passengers can also benefit from the modernized CIP and VIP lounges. There is [[Wi-Fi]] internet access all over the terminal including CIP and VIP lounges. As a result of the renovation project, conveyor belt system is installed in both international and domestic arrival terminals and computerized check in banks became operational for easier passenger ticket processing. Boarding is done by transporting passengers by bus from the terminal to the plane.\n\nIn 2017, 609,071 passengers passed through this airport.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport-dest-list\n| [[Aeroflot]] | [[Sheremetyevo International Airport|Moscow\u2013Sheremetyevo]]<ref name=AeroflotToKZ>{{cite news|last1=L|first1=J|title=AEROFLOT Assumes Transaero Kazakhstan Operation from late-Oct 2015|url=http://airlineroute.net/2015/10/26/su-kazakhstan-w15/|accessdate=26 October 2015|publisher=Airline Route|date=26 October 2015}}</ref> \n|[[Air Astana]]|[[Aktau Airport|Aktau]], [[Almaty International Airport|Almaty]], [[Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport|Amsterdam]], [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Liu|first1=Jim|title=Air Astana schedules Atyrau \u2013 Frankfurt service in S18|url=https://www.routesonline.com/news/38/airlineroute/276918/air-astana-schedules-atyrau-frankfurt-service-in-s18/|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Routesonline|date=30 January 2018}}</ref> [[Istanbul Airport|Istanbul]], [[Nursultan Nazarbayev International Airport|Nur-Sultan]]\n| [[Air Astana]]<br />{{nowrap|operated by [[FlyArystan]]}} |[[Sary-Arka Airport|Karagandy]] (begins 21 April 2020)<ref>{{cite news |last1= |first1= |title=FlyArystan \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044b \u0438\u0437 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044b \u043f\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c|url=https://informburo.kz/novosti/flyarystan-otkryvaet-novye-reysy-iz-karagandy-po-vosmi-napravleniyam-.html|accessdate=28 February 2020 |work=Informburo}}</ref> \n<!-- -->\n|[[Bek Air]]|[[Almaty International Airport|Almaty]], [[Oral Ak Zhol Airport|Oral]] (all flights suspended)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kaminski-Morrow |first1=David |title=Bek Air grounded after fatal Fokker 100 accident at Almaty |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/safety/bek-air-grounded-after-fatal-fokker-100-accident-at-almaty/135945.article |website=FlightGlobal |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref>\n| [[Qazaq Air]] | [[Aktau Airport|Aktau]], [[Aktobe Airport|Aktobe]], [[Oral Ak Zhol Airport|Oral]]\n|{{nowrap|[[SCAT Airlines]]}}|[[Aktau Airport|Aktau]], [[Nursultan Nazarbayev International Airport|Nur-Sultan]]<ref name=SCAT_new_S19>{{cite news |last1=Liu |first1=Jim |title=SCAT further expands Nur-Sultan (Astana) network from June 2019 |url=https://www.routesonline.com/news/38/airlineroute/283904/scat-further-expands-nur-sultan-astana-network-from-june-2019/ |accessdate=16 April 2019 |work=Routesonline |date=16 April 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Cargo===\n{{Airport-dest-list\n|[[Coyne Airways]]|[[Oral Ak Zhol Airport|Oral]]\n|[[Silk Way Airlines]]|[[Aktau Airport|Aktau]], [[Heydar Aliyev International Airport|Baku]]\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Extreme points of Earth#Lowest attainable by transportation|Extreme points of Earth \u2013 Lowest attainable by transportation]]\n* [[List of places on land with elevations below sea level]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080229043439/http://www.atyrauairport.com/ Atyrau Airport official website]\n\n{{Portal bar|Aviation}}\n{{Airports in Kazakhstan}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Airports in Kazakhstan]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Atyrau]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atyrau_Airport"}
