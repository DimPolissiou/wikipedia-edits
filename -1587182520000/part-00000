Daily News, Retrieved on 7 January 2016.</ref> Ruhuna University was opened on 1 September 1978, fulfilling a desire of the people of the south to have a university in the region. It was housed in the Technical College buildings at Meddawatte, Matara with about 40 academics, 50 non-academics, and 275 students.\n \n===Inauguration of University college===\nThe enactment of the Universities Act No. 46 of 1978 enabled the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] to establish the Ruhuna University College. As a result, on 27 August 1978, the [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Prime Minister]] [[J. R. Jayawardene]] declared open the Ruhuna University College at Meddawatta, Matara, with Prof. Mervyn W. Thenabadu as its Director.\n\n=== Campus to University status ===\nThe Ruhuna University College was shifted to the new premises in 1984 following which it was elevated to full university status. The new location was selected for the main campus at Wellamadama, two kilometers from Matara facing Matara-Kataragama main road. Professor [[G. P. Samarawickrama]] was the first [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the University. Hon. [[Ronnie De Mel]], inaugurating the University after being elevated from [[campus]] to [[University]] status in 1984.\nDuring the past 25 years, it has witnessed considerable progress and development in the academic, research and outreach spheres with substantial improvement in intellectual and infrastructure resources and has emerged as a leader of higher education in Sri Lanka.\nTo date, it has produced about 50,000 graduates and over 75 postgraduates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ugc.ac.lk/downloads/statistics/stat_2015/Chapter%202.pdf |title=University Admission|publisher=University Grants Commission|format=PDF |access-date=14 October 2016}}</ref> Around 100 postgraduate students are pursuing master and doctoral programs in disciplines that are of relevance to the development of the region in particular and the country in general.\n\n==Governance and administration==\n\nThe University of Ruhuna is a [[public university|state university]] and depends on the government for much of its annual grant, which is provided by the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC). Due to this, its administration is heavily influenced by the UGC. Undergraduate education is completely free. The Governance of the university is under the provisions of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 and the Universities (Amendment) Act No. 7 of 1985 along with its own by-laws.\n\nThe university's administration is based upon that of the former [[University of Ceylon]] consisting of a dual structure of bodies: the Council (formally known as the [[University Court]] which is the governing body) and the [[Academic Senate]] (academic affairs).\n\nMuch of the appointments to officers and faculty are carried out by these bodies, however on the recommendations of the UGC.\n\n===Officers of the university===\n;Chancellor\nThe [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] is the head of the university and awards all [[academic degree|degrees]], although most duties are carried out by the Vice-chancellor. The appointment is made by the [[President of Sri Lanka]], to a distinguished person in academics, clergy or in the civil society. The chancellor is Rajakeeya Panditha Pallaththara Sri Sumanajothi Nahimi [[Thero]].\n\n;Vice-chancellor\nDay-to-day management of the University is undertaken by the [[Vice-chancellor]], appointed by the [[President of Sri Lanka]].
