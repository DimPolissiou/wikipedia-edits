{"title_page": "History of far-right movements in France", "text_new": "The '''[[far right|far-right]] tradition in [[France]]''' finds its origins in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] with [[Boulangism]] and the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. The modern \"far right\" or [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] grew out of two separate events of 1889: the splitting off in the Socialist International of those who chose the nation and the culmination of the \"Boulanger Affair\", which championed the demands of the former Minister of War General Georges Boulanger. The [[Dreyfus Affair]] provided one of the political division lines of France. [[Nationalism]], which had been before the Dreyfus Affair a left-wing and Republican ideology, turned after that to be a main trait of the right-wing and, moreover, of the far right. A new right emerged, and nationalism was reappropriated by the far right who turned it into a form of [[ethnic nationalism]], itself blended with anti-Semitism, [[xenophobia]], anti-Protestantism and [[anti-Masonry]]. The Action fran\u00e7aise, first founded as a review, was the matrix of a new type of counter-revolutionary right-wing, and continues to exist today. During the [[interwar period]], the ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'' (AF) and its youth militia, the ''[[Camelots du Roi]]'', were very active. [[Far right leagues]] organized riots.\n\nThe [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (OAS) was created in Madrid by French military opposed to the [[Algerian War|independence of Algeria]]. \n[[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] founded the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] (FN) party in 1972. At the [[1986 French legislative elections|1986 legislative elections]], the FN managed to obtain 35 seats, with 10% of the votes. [[Mark Frederiksen]], a French Algeria activist, created in April 1966 a [[neo-Nazi]] group, the [[FANE]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration d'action nationaliste et europ\u00e9enne'', Nationalist and European Federation of Action). However, in 1978, neo-Nazi members of the GNR-FANE broke again with the FN. During the 1980s, the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] managed to gather, under [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s leadership, most rival far-right tendencies of France, following a succession of splits and alliances with other, minor parties, during the 1970s.\n\n== Third Republic (1871\u20131914) ==\n{{further|French Third Republic}}\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] was a turning point in the political history of France and in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871\u20131940), established after the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the 1871 [[Paris Commune]]. The modern \"far right\" or radical right, grew out of two separate events of 1889.\n\nThe Socialist International was formed at the Paris Conference, which imposed doctrinal orthodoxy on socialists and demanded their allegiance to the international working class rather than their nation. This forced patriotic socialists to choose either their nation or the international workers' movement. Many chose their nation and fell into violent conflict with their former socialist comrades. Those who chose the nation and retained the strategy of violence, then used most often against their former comrades, formed much of the base of the radical right. Many of those people also proved susceptible to the blandishments of anti-Semitism, which has long been a hallmark of the radical right. This would include (socialist) [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], (communardes) [[Henri Rochefort]] and [[Gustave Paul Cluseret]], (Blanquists) Charles Bernard and [[Antoine Jourde]], among others.<ref>Zeev Sternhell, ''La Droite R\u00e9volutionaire, les origines fran\u00e7aises du fascisme, 1885-1914'' (Paris: Ed. du Seuil, 1978)</ref><ref>Robert Lynn Fuller, ''The Origins of the French Nationalist Movement, 1886-1914'' (McFarland, 2012)</ref>\n\n[[File:Georges_Ernest_Boulanger_by_Atelier_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|Georges Ernest Boulanger (1837\u20131891)]]\nThe second event of 1889 was the culmination of the \"Boulanger Affair\" which championed the vague demands of the former Minister of War General Georges Boulanger. Boulanger had attracted the support of many socialists by ordering lenient treatment of strikers when the army was called upon to suppress strikes. He also rattled his saber against Germany which pleased French patriots intent on taking revenge against the German Empire. But his saber-rattling scared the other ministers who dumped Boulanger from the government. When his champions mounted an electoral campaign to have him elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the government reacted by forcing him out of the Army. His backers then elected him to the Chamber again from Paris, where he gained the support of both conservatives, who loathed the Republic, and socialists with their own ideas about how the Republic should be remade. This joining of the left and right against the center formed the foundation upon which the radical right was built in subsequent years. Violent agitation in Paris on the election night in 1889 convinced the government to prosecute Boulanger in order to remove him from the political scene. Instead of facing trumped up charges, Boulanger fled to Belgium. His supporters, \"Boulangists\" afterward nursed an intense grievance against the Republic and reunited during the Dreyfus Affair to oppose the Republic and \"back the army\" once again.<ref>Fredric Seager, ''The Boulanger Affair, The Political Crossroads of France, 1886-1889'' (Cornell University Press, 1969)</ref><ref>William Irvine, ''The Boulanger Affair Reconsidered, Royalism, Boulagism, and the Origins of the Radical Right in France''(Oxford University Press, 1989)</ref><ref>Patrick Hutton ''The Cult of the Revolutionary Tradition: Blanquists in French Politics, 1864-1893'' (U. of California Press, 1981)</ref>\n\n=== The Dreyfus Affair and the foundation of the Action fran\u00e7aise ===\n{{main|Dreyfus Affair |Action fran\u00e7aise |French far-right leagues}}\n[[File:Degradation alfred dreyfus.jpg|thumb|upright|Degradation of Alfred Dreyfus, 1895]]\nIn 1894, a Jewish officer, [[Alfred Dreyfus]], was arrested on accusations of treason and sharing intelligence with the German Empire. The [[Dreyfus Affair]] provided one of the political fault lines of France. [[Nationalism]], which had been before the Dreyfus Affair a left-wing and Republican ideology, turned after that to be a main trait of the right-wing and, moreover, of the far right.<ref>[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extr\u00eame droite en France'' (1993)</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9mile Zola]] entered the political scene with his open letter \"[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]\", followed by other writers, artists and scholars supporting him with a \"Manifesto of the Intellectuals\", helping to define the meaning of the term \"[[intellectual]]\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/node/4256/full |title=Dreyfus and the Birth of Intellectual Protest |last=Read |first=Piers Paul|author-link=Piers Paul Read |year=2012|website=[[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]]|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref> while the left and right were at loggerheads, mainly over the questions of [[militarism]], [[nationalism]], [[justice]] and [[human rights]]. Until then, nationalism was a Republican, left-wing ideology, related to the [[French Revolution]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary Wars]]. It was a [[liberal nationalism]], formulated by [[Ernest Renan]]'s definition of the nation as a \"daily plebiscite\" and as formed by the subjective \"will to live together.\" Related to \"revanchism\", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism could then be sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, a debate thus opposed those who opposed the \"[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]\", such as [[Radicalism (historical)#France|radical]] [[Georges Clemenceau]], who declared that colonialism diverted France from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]\" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine), socialist [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] and nationalist [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], against [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republican]] [[Jules Ferry]], republican [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group.\n\nHowever, in the midst of the Dreyfus Affair, a new right emerged, and nationalism was appropriated by the far right who turned it into a form of [[ethnic nationalism]], itself blended with anti-Semitism, [[xenophobia]], anti-Protestantism and [[anti-Masonry]]. [[Charles Maurras]] (1868\u20131952), founder of \"[[integralism]]\" (or \"integral nationalism\"), created the term \"Anti-France\" to stigmatize \"internal foreigners\", or the \"four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners\" (his actual word for the latter being the far less polite ''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8ques]]''). A few years later, Maurras would join the monarchist ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'', created by [[Maurice Pujo]] and [[Henri Vaugeois]] in 1898. Maurras, who was an agnostic, spearheaded a monarchist and Catholic revival. He pragmatically conceived of religion as an [[ideology]] useful to unify the nation. Most French Catholics were conservatives, a trait that continues today. On the other hand, most Protestants, Jews and atheists belonged to the left. Henceforth, the Republicans' conception was, to the contrary, that only [[state secularism]] could peacefully bind together diverse religious and philosophical tendencies, and avoid any return to the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. Furthermore, Catholic priests were seen as a major reactionary force by the Republicans, among whom [[anti-clericalism]] became common. The [[Jules Ferry laws|Ferry laws]] on public education had been a first step for the Republic in rooting out the clerics' influence: they would be completed by the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1905 law on the separation of Church and State]].\n\nAction fran\u00e7aise, first founded as a review, was the matrix of a new type of counter-revolutionary right-wing, and continues to exist today. Action fran\u00e7aise was quite influential in the 1930s, in particular through its youth organization, the [[Camelots du Roi]], founded in 1908, and which engaged in many street brawls, etc. The Camelots du Roi included such figures as Catholic writer [[Georges Bernanos]] and [[Jean de Barrau]], member of the directing committee of the National Federation, and particular secretary of the [[Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans (1869-1926)|duc d'Orl\u00e9ans]] (1869\u20131926), the son of the [[Orleanist]] [[Philippe, comte de Paris|count of Paris]] (1838\u20131894) and hence Orleanist heir to the throne of France. Many members of the [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te|OAS]] terrorist group during the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362) were part of the monarchist movement. [[Jean Ousset]], Maurras' personal secretary, created the [[Catholic fundamentalist]] organization [[Cit\u00e9 catholique]], which would include OAS members and founded a branch in Argentina in the 1960s.\n\nApart from the Action fran\u00e7aise, several [[far-right league]]s were created during the Dreyfus Affair. Mostly anti-Semitic, they also represented a new right-wing tendency, sharing common traits such as [[anti-parliamentarism]], militarism, nationalism, and often engaged in street brawls. Thus, the nationalist poet [[Paul D\u00e9roul\u00e8de]] created in 1882 the anti-semitic [[Ligue des patriotes]] (League of Patriots), which at first focused on advocating 'revanche' (revenge) for the French defeat during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Along with [[Jules Gu\u00e9rin]], the journalist [[Edouard Drumont]] created the [[Antisemitic League of France]] in 1889. Also anti-masonic, the League became at the start of the 20th century the ''[[Grand Occident de France]]'', a name chosen in reaction against the masonic lodge of the ''[[Grand Orient de France]]''.\n\n== Between the wars ==\nDuring the [[Interwar France|interwar period]], the ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'' (AF) and its youth militia, the ''[[Camelots du Roi]]'', were very active in Paris.<ref>Eugen Weber, ''Action Fran\u00e7aise: Royalism and Reaction in Twentieth Century France'' (1962).</ref>  Apart from the AF, various [[far-right leagues]] were formed and opposed both ''[[Cartel des gauches]]'' (Coalition of the left) governments. [[Pierre Taittinger]] thus formed the ''[[Jeunesses Patriotes]]'' in 1924, which imitated the style of the [[Fascist]]s, although it remained a more traditional authoritarian movement. The following year, [[Georges Valois]] created ''[[Le Faisceau]]'', heavily inspired by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]]. In 1933, the year [[Hitler's rise to power|Adolf Hitler gained power]] in Germany, perfumer [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]] founded ''[[Solidarit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise]]'' and [[Marcel Bucard]] formed the ''[[Francisme]]'', which was subsidised by Mussolini. Another important league was [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Rocque]]'s ''[[Croix de Feu]]'', which formed the base for the ''[[Parti Social Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (PSF), the first mass party of the French right-wing.  Mussolini was much more popular in right-wing circles than Hitler due to the negative reaction many French conservatives had to Hitler's repression of dissident German conservatives and Catholics in 1933 and 1934.<ref>Robert J. Soucy, \"French press reactions to Hitler's first two years in power.\" ''Contemporary European History'' 7.1 (1998): 21-38.</ref>\n\nApart from the leagues, a group of [[Neosocialist]]s ([[Marcel D\u00e9at]], [[Pierre Renaudel]], etc.) were excluded in November 1933 from the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO, the socialist party) because of their revisionist stances and admiration for fascism. D\u00e9at would become one of the most ardent collaborationists during World War II.\n\nAnother major player in France's right-wing world between the wars was [[Jacques Doriot]]. Doriot had been expelled by the [[French Communist Party]] after proposing a [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] with other leftist parties, which at that time was seen as [[Social fascism|heresy]] by his party's hierarchy. Personally hurt and embittered by his expulsion, Doriot would slowly change sides, eventually openly denouncing communism and going on to found the [[Parti Populaire Francais]] or PPF, the largest pre-war right wing party. Other important figures of the 1930s include [[Xavier Vallat]], who would become General Commissioner for Jewish Affairs under [[Vichy France|Vichy]], members of the ''[[La Cagoule|Cagoule]]'' terrorist group ([[Eug\u00e8ne Deloncle]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Schueller]], the founder of ''[[L'Or\u00e9al]]'' cosmetic firm, [[Jacques Corr\u00e8ze]], [[Joseph Darnand]], who later founded the ''[[Service d'ordre l\u00e9gionnaire]]'' militia during Vichy, etc.).

The FN became stronger throughout the 1980s, managing to unite most far-right tendencies, passing electoral alliances with the right-wing [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR), while some FN members quit the party to join the RPR or the [[Union for a French Democracy]] (UDF). At the [[1986 French legislative elections|1986 legislative elections]], the FN managed to obtain 35 seats, with 10% of the votes.\n\nMeanwhile, other far-right tendencies gathered in [[Alain de Benoist]]'s ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' think-tank, heading a pro-European line. Some radical members of the \"national revolutionary\" tendency quit the FN to form other minor parties ([[Party of New Forces]], PFN, and [[French and European Nationalist Party]], PNFE).\n\n=== The French Third Position's relations with the National Front ===\n{{Further|Third Position}}\n[[Mark Frederiksen]], a French Algeria activist, created in April 1966 a [[neo-Nazi]] group, the [[FANE]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration d'action nationaliste et europ\u00e9enne'', Nationalist and European Federation of Action). The FANE boasted at most a hundred activists, including members such as [[Luc Michel]], now leader of the ''[[Parti communautaire national-europ\u00e9en]]'' (National European Communautary Party), [[Jacques Bastide]], [[Michel Faci]], [[Michel Caignet]] and [[Henri-Robert Petit]], a journalist and former [[Collaborationist]] who directed under the [[Vichy regime]] the newspaper ''[[Le Pilori]]''. The FANE maintained international contacts with the British group the [[League of Saint George]].<ref>[[Ray Hill|R. Hill]] & A. Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror- Inside Europe\u2019s Neo-Nazi Network'', London: Collins, 1988, pp.186-189</ref>\n\nThe FANE rallied [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s [[National Front (France)|National Front]] in 1974, gathered around [[Fran\u00e7ois Duprat]] and [[Alain Renault]]'s [[Revolutionary Nationalist Groups]] (GNR), which represented the [[Third Position|nationalist revolutionary]] tendency of the FN.\n\nBut in 1978, neo-Nazi members of the GNR-FANE broke again with the FN, taking with them sections of the FN youth movement, the [[G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Nation|Front National de la Jeunesse]].<ref name=Ann>[http://www.france-politique.fr/annuaire-extreme-droite.htm Annuaire de l'extr\u00eame droite en France] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> On the other hand, GNR activists closer to the [[Third Position]] (Jacques Bastide and Patrick Gorre)<ref name=Ann/> joined [[Jean-Gilles Malliarakis]] to found, on February 11, 1979, the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (France)|Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (''Mouvement nationaliste r\u00e9volutionnaire''), which became in 1985 [[Third Way (France)|Third Way]] (''Troisi\u00e8me Voie'').\n\nAfter this brief passage at the National Front, Mark Fredriksen created the ''Faisceaux nationalistes europ\u00e9ens'' ([[FANE]]) in July 1980. These would eventually merge with the ''[[Mouvement national et social ethniste]]'' in 1987, and then with the [[PNFE]] (French and European Nationalist Party) in January 1994, which also gathered former National Front members.\n\nDissolved first in September 1980 by [[Raymond Barre]]'s government, Fredriksen's group was recreated, and dissolved again in 1985 by [[Laurent Fabius]]' government. Finally, it was dissolved a third time in 1987 by [[Jacques Chirac]]'s government, on charges of \"violent demonstrations organised by this movement, which has as one of its expressed objective the establishment of a new [[Nazi]] regime,\" the \"[[paramilitary]] organisation of this association and its inciting of [[racial discrimination]].\"\n\n=== Alain de Benoist's ''Nouvelle Droite'' and the ''Club de l'Horloge'' ===\nIn the 1980s, [[Alain de Benoist]] became chief theorist of the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' movement, creating the think-tank [[GRECE]] in 1968, some of whose members were involved with the formation of the [[Club de l'Horloge]] in 1974. They advocated an [[ethno-nationalist]] stance focused on European culture, which advocated a return of [[paganism]]. Members of the GRECE quit the think tank in the 1980s, such as [[Pierre Vial]] who joined the FN, or [[Guillaume Faye]] who quit the organisation along with others members in 1986. Faye participated in 2006 in a conference in the US organised by ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'', a [[white separatist]] magazine published by the [[New Century Foundation]].\n\nAlain de Benoist occasionally contributed to the ''[[Mankind Quarterly]]'' review, which supports [[hereditarianism]] and is associated with the US think tank the [[Pioneer Fund]], headed by [[J. Philippe Rushton]], the author of ''[[Race, Evolution and Behavior]]'' (1995), which argues in favour of a biological conception of \"[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]\". GRECE and the Pioneer Fund are actively involved in the [[History of the race and intelligence controversy|race and intelligence debate]], postulating that there is an identifiable link between levels of intelligence and distinct [[ethnic group]]s.\n\nThe Club de l'horloge itself had been founded by [[Henry de Lesquen]], a former member of the conservative [[Rally for the Republic]], which he quit in 1984. Others members of the Club de l'horloge, such as [[Bruno M\u00e9gret]], later joined the FN after a short time in the RPR.\n\n=== Rise of the National Front in the 1980s and M\u00e9gret's split ===\nDuring the 1980s, the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] managed to gather, under [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s leadership, most rival far-right tendencies of France, following a succession of splits and alliances with other, minor parties, during the 1970s.\n\n==== Party of New Forces ====\nOne of those parties, the [[Party of New Forces]] (PFN, ''Parti des forces nouvelles''), was an offshoot of the National Front, formed from a 1973 split headed by [[:fr:Alain Robert (homme politique)|Alain Robert]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Brigneau]] who first organised the ''[[:fr:Comit\u00e9s faire front|Comit\u00e9 faire front]]'' which subsequently merged into the PFN.\n\nThe PFN was formed mainly by former members of [[Ordre Nouveau (1960s)|New Order]] (''Ordre nouveau'', 1969\u20131973), who had refused to merge into the FN at its 1972 creation. New Order, dissolved by Interior Minister [[Raymond Marcellin]] in 1973, was itself a successor to [[Occident (movement)|Occident]] (1964\u20131968) and of the [[Groupe Union D\u00e9fense|Union Defense Group]] (GUD, ''Groupe union d\u00e9fense'').\n\nClose to the [[Third Position]] and supporting a \"national-revolutionary\" thesis, this tendency maintained links with the FN, despite some tensions. The GUD, in particular, had published the satiric monthly ''Alternative'' with the [[Youth Front (France)|Youth Front]] (''Front de la jeunesse''), the youth organisation of the FN. They also had attempted alliances with other far-right parties in Europe, with New Order organising the alliance \"A Fatherland for Tomorrow\" (''Une patrie pour demain'') with the Spanish [[Falange]], the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI) and the German [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]].\n\nThis European strategy was continued by the PFN, who launched the [[Euroright]] alliance, with the MSI, the Spanish [[New Force (Spain)|New Force]] and the Belgian [[PFN (Belgium)|PFN]], for the [[1979 European Parliament election|1979 European elections]]. Headed by [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], the PFN won 1.3% of the vote. This electoral failure prompted [[Roland Gaucher]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Brigneau]] to quit the party and join Le Pen's National Front.\n\n==== 1981 Presidential election ====\nThe French far-right was divided in the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]], with both [[Pascal Gauchon]] (PFN) and Le Pen (FN) attempting, without success, to secure the 500 signatures from mayors necessary to stand as candidates. [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]) won those elections, competing against [[Jacques Chirac]] ([[Rally for the Republic]], RPR).\n\n==== 1983 elections and rise ====\nThese succeeding electoral defeats prompted the far-right to unify itself. In 1983, the FN managed to make its first electoral breakthrough, taking control of the town of [[Dreux]]: [[Jean-Pierre Stirbois]] obtained 17% of the votes in the first round, for the FN municipal list. In the second round, he merged his list with Chirac's RPR list (headed by [[Jean Hieaux]]), enabling the right to claim a victory against the [[French Left|left]]. Chirac supported the alliance with the far-right, claiming that the Socialist Party, allied with the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] in government, had no lessons to give.<ref>[[Franz-Olivier Giesbert]], ''La Trag\u00e9die du Pr\u00e9sident'', 2006, p 37-38</ref>\n\nThis first electoral success was confirmed at the [[1984 European Parliament election|1984 European elections]], the FN obtaining 10% of the votes. Two years later, the FN gained 35 deputies (nearly 10% of the votes) at the [[1986 French legislative elections|1986 legislative elections]], running under the label of \"''Rassemblement national''. Those elected included the monarchist [[Georges-Paul Wagner]].\n\nInternal disputes continued however to divide the far-right. Following the 1986 elections, which brought [[Jacques Chirac]] to power as [[Prime minister (France)|Prime Minister]], some hardliners inside the FN broke away to create the [[French and European Nationalist Party]] (PNFE, Parti Nationaliste Fran\u00e7ais et Europ\u00e9en), along with members of [[Mark Frederiksen]]'s Third Position [[FANE]]. Three former members of the PNFE were charged of having desecrated, in 1990, a Jewish cemetery in [[Carpentras]].<ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/1996-08-07_Articles_-La-profanation-de-Carpentras-a-ete-longuement-premeditee La profanation de Carpentras a \u00e9t\u00e9 longuement pr\u00e9m\u00e9dit\u00e9e], ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', 7 August 1996 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n==== M\u00e9gret's split, Le Pen's 2002 score and subsequent electoral fall ====\nThe most important split, however, was headed by [[Bruno M\u00e9gret]] in 1999. Taking many FN elected representatives and party officials with him, he then created the [[National Republican Movement]] (MNR). However, with an eye to the [[2007 French legislative election|2007 legislative elections]], he supported Le Pen's candidacy for the [[2007 French presidential election|presidential election]].\n\nDuring these presidential elections, [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] only took 10.4% of the vote, compared to his 16.9% [[2002 French presidential election|first round result in 2002]], qualifying him for the second round, where he achieved 17.79% against 82.21% for [[Jacques Chirac]] ([[Rally for the Republic]], RPR).\n\nWith only 1.85% in the second round of the [[2002 French legislative elections|2002 legislative elections]], the FN failed to gain any seats in the [[Deputies of the 12th French National Assembly|National Assembly]]. In the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]], Le Pen finished fourth, behind [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]]. [[Philippe de Villiers]], the [[Traditionalist Catholicism|Catholic traditionalist]] candidate of the [[Movement for France]] (especially strong in the conservative [[Vend\u00e9e]] region), was sixth, obtaining 2.23% of the vote.\n\nThis electoral slump for the FN was confirmed at the [[2007 French legislative elections|2007 legislative elections]], the FN obtaining only 0.08% of the votes in the second round, and therefore no seats.\n\n==== Le Pen's succession ====\n[[File:Le Pen, Marine-9586.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marine Le Pen]] succeeded her father as Front National leader in 2011]]\nThese electoral defeats, which contrasted with the high score obtained at the 2002 presidential elections, caused financial problems for the FN, which was forced to sell its headquarters, the ''[[Paquebot]]'', in [[Saint-Cloud]].

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] provided one of the political division lines of France. [[Nationalism]], which had been before the Dreyfus Affair a left-wing and Republican ideology, turned after that to be a main trait of the right-wing and, moreover, of the far right. A new right emerged, and nationalism was reappropriated by the far right who turned it into a form of [[ethnic nationalism]], itself blended with anti-Semitism, [[xenophobia]], anti-Protestantism and [[anti-Masonry]]. The Action fran\u00e7aise, first founded as a review, was the matrix of a new type of counter-revolutionary right-wing, and continues to exist today. During the [[interwar period]], the ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'' (AF) and its youth militia, the ''[[Camelots du Roi]]'', were very active. [[Far right leagues]] organized riots.\n\nThe [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (OAS) was created in Madrid by French military opposed to the [[Algerian War|independence of Algeria]]. \n[[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] founded the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] (FN) party in 1972. At the [[1986 French legislative elections|1986 legislative elections]], the FN managed to obtain 35 seats, with 10% of the votes. [[Mark Frederiksen]], a French Algeria activist, created in April 1966 a [[neo-Nazi]] group, the [[FANE]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration d'action nationaliste et europ\u00e9enne'', Nationalist and European Federation of Action). However, in 1978, neo-Nazi members of the GNR-FANE broke again with the FN. During the 1980s, the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] managed to gather, under [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s leadership, most rival far-right tendencies of France, following a succession of splits and alliances with other, minor parties, during the 1970s.\n\n== Third Republic (1871\u20131914) ==\n{{further|French Third Republic}}\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] was a turning point in the political history of France and in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871\u20131940), established after the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the 1871 [[Paris Commune]]. The modern \"far right\" or radical right, grew out of two separate events of 1889.\n\nThe Socialist International was formed at the Paris Conference, which imposed doctrinal orthodoxy on socialists and demanded their allegiance to the international working class rather than their nation. This forced patriotic socialists to choose either their nation or the international workers' movement. Many chose their nation and fell into violent conflict with their former socialist comrades. Those who chose the nation and retained the strategy of violence, then used most often against their former comrades, formed much of the base of the radical right. Many of those people also proved susceptible to the blandishments of anti-Semitism, which has long been a hallmark of the radical right. This would include (socialist) [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], (communardes) [[Henri Rochefort]] and [[Gustave Paul Cluseret]], (Blanquists) Charles Bernard and [[Antoine Jourde]], among others.<ref>Zeev Sternhell, ''La Droite R\u00e9volutionaire, les origines fran\u00e7aises du fascisme, 1885-1914'' (Paris: Ed. du Seuil, 1978)</ref><ref>Robert Lynn Fuller, ''The Origins of the French Nationalist Movement, 1886-1914'' (McFarland, 2012)</ref>\n\n[[File:Georges_Ernest_Boulanger_by_Atelier_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|Georges Ernest Boulanger (1837\u20131891)]]\nThe second event of 1889 was the culmination of the \"Boulanger Affair\" which championed the vague demands of the former Minister of War General Georges Boulanger. Boulanger had attracted the support of many socialists by ordering lenient treatment of strikers when the army was called upon to suppress strikes. He also rattled his saber against Germany which pleased French patriots intent on taking revenge against the German Empire. But his saber-rattling scared the other ministers who dumped Boulanger from the government. When his champions mounted an electoral campaign to have him elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the government reacted by forcing him out of the Army. His backers then elected him to the Chamber again from Paris, where he gained the support of both conservatives, who loathed the Republic, and socialists with their own ideas about how the Republic should be remade. This joining of the left and right against the center formed the foundation upon which the radical right was built in subsequent years. Violent agitation in Paris on the election night in 1889 convinced the government to prosecute Boulanger in order to remove him from the political scene. Instead of facing trumped up charges, Boulanger fled to Belgium. His supporters, \"Boulangists\" afterward nursed an intense grievance against the Republic and reunited during the Dreyfus Affair to oppose the Republic and \"back the army\" once again.<ref>Fredric Seager, ''The Boulanger Affair, The Political Crossroads of France, 1886-1889'' (Cornell University Press, 1969)</ref><ref>William Irvine, ''The Boulanger Affair Reconsidered, Royalism, Boulagism, and the Origins of the Radical Right in France''(Oxford University Press, 1989)</ref><ref>Patrick Hutton ''The Cult of the Revolutionary Tradition: Blanquists in French Politics, 1864-1893'' (U. of California Press, 1981)</ref>\n\n=== The Dreyfus Affair and the foundation of the Action fran\u00e7aise ===\n{{main|Dreyfus Affair |Action fran\u00e7aise |French far-right leagues}}\n[[File:Degradation alfred dreyfus.jpg|thumb|upright|Degradation of Alfred Dreyfus, 1895]]\nIn 1894, a Jewish officer, [[Alfred Dreyfus]], was arrested on accusations of treason and sharing intelligence with the German Empire.

Until then, nationalism was a Republican, left-wing ideology, related to the [[French Revolution]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary Wars]]. It was a [[liberal nationalism]], formulated by [[Ernest Renan]]'s definition of the nation as a \"daily plebiscite\" and as formed by the subjective \"will to live together.\" Related to \"revanchism\", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism could then be sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, a debate thus opposed those who opposed the \"[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]\", such as [[Radicalism (historical)#France|radical]] [[Georges Clemenceau]], who declared that colonialism diverted France from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]\" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine), socialist [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] and nationalist [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], against [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republican]] [[Jules Ferry]], republican [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group.\n\nHowever, in the midst of the Dreyfus Affair, a new right emerged, and nationalism was appropriated by the far right who turned it into a form of [[ethnic nationalism]], itself blended with anti-Semitism, [[xenophobia]], anti-Protestantism and [[anti-Masonry]]. [[Charles Maurras]] (1868\u20131952), founder of \"[[integralism]]\" (or \"integral nationalism\"), created the term \"Anti-France\" to stigmatize \"internal foreigners\", or the \"four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners\" (his actual word for the latter being the far less polite ''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8ques]]''). A few years later, Maurras would join the monarchist ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'', created by [[Maurice Pujo]] and [[Henri Vaugeois]] in 1898. Maurras, who was an agnostic, spearheaded a monarchist and Catholic revival. He pragmatically conceived of religion as an [[ideology]] useful to unify the nation. Most French Catholics were conservatives, a trait that continues today. On the other hand, most Protestants, Jews and atheists belonged to the left. Henceforth, the Republicans' conception was, to the contrary, that only [[state secularism]] could peacefully bind together diverse religious and philosophical tendencies, and avoid any return to the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. Furthermore, Catholic priests were seen as a major reactionary force by the Republicans, among whom [[anti-clericalism]] became common. The [[Jules Ferry laws|Ferry laws]] on public education had been a first step for the Republic in rooting out the clerics' influence: they would be completed by the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1905 law on the separation of Church and State]].\n\nAction fran\u00e7aise, first founded as a review, was the matrix of a new type of counter-revolutionary right-wing, and continues to exist today. Action fran\u00e7aise was quite influential in the 1930s, in particular through its youth organization, the [[Camelots du Roi]], founded in 1908, and which engaged in many street brawls, etc. The Camelots du Roi included such figures as Catholic writer [[Georges Bernanos]] and [[Jean de Barrau]], member of the directing committee of the National Federation, and particular secretary of the [[Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans (1869-1926)|duc d'Orl\u00e9ans]] (1869\u20131926), the son of the [[Orleanist]] [[Philippe, comte de Paris|count of Paris]] (1838\u20131894) and hence Orleanist heir to the throne of France. Many members of the [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te|OAS]] terrorist group during the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362) were part of the monarchist movement. [[Jean Ousset]], Maurras' personal secretary, created the [[Catholic fundamentalist]] organization [[Cit\u00e9 catholique]], which would include OAS members and founded a branch in Argentina in the 1960s.\n\nApart from the Action fran\u00e7aise, several [[far-right league]]s were created during the Dreyfus Affair. Mostly anti-Semitic, they also represented a new right-wing tendency, sharing common traits such as [[anti-parliamentarism]], militarism, nationalism, and often engaged in street brawls. Thus, the nationalist poet [[Paul D\u00e9roul\u00e8de]] created in 1882 the anti-semitic [[Ligue des patriotes]] (League of Patriots), which at first focused on advocating 'revanche' (revenge) for the French defeat during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Along with [[Jules Gu\u00e9rin]], the journalist [[Edouard Drumont]] created the [[Antisemitic League of France]] in 1889. Also anti-masonic, the League became at the start of the 20th century the ''[[Grand Occident de France]]'', a name chosen in reaction against the masonic lodge of the ''[[Grand Orient de France]]''.\n\n== Between the wars ==\nDuring the [[Interwar France|interwar period]], the ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'' (AF) and its youth militia, the ''[[Camelots du Roi]]'', were very active in Paris.<ref>Eugen Weber, ''Action Fran\u00e7aise: Royalism and Reaction in Twentieth Century France'' (1962).</ref>  Apart from the AF, various [[far-right leagues]] were formed and opposed both ''[[Cartel des gauches]]'' (Coalition of the left) governments. [[Pierre Taittinger]] thus formed the ''[[Jeunesses Patriotes]]'' in 1924, which imitated the style of the [[Fascist]]s, although it remained a more traditional authoritarian movement. The following year, [[Georges Valois]] created ''[[Le Faisceau]]'', heavily inspired by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]]. In 1933, the year [[Hitler's rise to power|Adolf Hitler gained power]] in Germany, perfumer [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]] founded ''[[Solidarit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise]]'' and [[Marcel Bucard]] formed the ''[[Francisme]]'', which was subsidised by Mussolini. Another important league was [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Rocque]]'s ''[[Croix de Feu]]'', which formed the base for the ''[[Parti Social Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (PSF), the first mass party of the French right-wing.  Mussolini was much more popular in right-wing circles than Hitler due to the negative reaction many French conservatives had to Hitler's repression of dissident German conservatives and Catholics in 1933 and 1934.<ref>Robert J. Soucy, \"French press reactions to Hitler's first two years in power.\" ''Contemporary European History'' 7.1 (1998): 21-38.</ref>\n\nApart from the leagues, a group of [[Neosocialist]]s ([[Marcel D\u00e9at]], [[Pierre Renaudel]], etc.) were excluded in November 1933 from the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO, the socialist party) because of their revisionist stances and admiration for fascism. D\u00e9at would become one of the most ardent collaborationists during World War II.\n\nAnother major player in France's right-wing world between the wars was [[Jacques Doriot]]. Doriot had been expelled by the [[French Communist Party]] after proposing a [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] with other leftist parties, which at that time was seen as [[Social fascism|heresy]] by his party's hierarchy. Personally hurt and embittered by his expulsion, Doriot would slowly change sides, eventually openly denouncing communism and going on to found the [[Parti Populaire Francais]] or PPF, the largest pre-war right wing party.

His campaign was organised by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]. [[Charles de Gaulle]] said of Tixier-Vignancourt: \"Tixier-Vignancour, that is Vichy, the [[Collaborationism|Collaboration]] proud of itself, the [[Milice]], the OAS\".\n\n== Fifth Republic ==\n[[File:Jean-Marie Le Pen 479834203 5030701e77 o.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] founded the Front National in 1972 and led them until 2011]]\n[[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] founded the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] (FN) party in 1972, along with former [[Occident (movement)|Occident]] member [[Jacques Bompard]], former [[Collaborationist]] [[Roland Gaucher]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Duprat]], who introduced the [[negationist]] thesis to France,<ref>[[Henry Rousso]], \"Les habits neufs du n\u00e9gationniste,\" in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n\u00b0318, March 2007, pp.26-28 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> and others nostalgics of [[Vichy France]], [[Catholic fundamentalist]]s, etc.<ref name=\"BioRFI\">[http://www.rfi.fr/francais/actu/articles/081/article_45894.asp Le Pen, son univers impitoyable], ''[[Radio France Internationale]]'', September 1, 2006 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Le Pen presented himself for the first time in the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], obtaining 0.74%.<ref name=\"BioRFI\"/> The electoral rise of the FN did not start until [[Jean-Pierre Stirbois]]'s victory, in 1983, in [[Dreux]]. The FN became stronger throughout the 1980s, managing to unite most far-right tendencies, passing electoral alliances with the right-wing [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR), while some FN members quit the party to join the RPR or the [[Union for a French Democracy]] (UDF). At the [[1986 French legislative elections|1986 legislative elections]], the FN managed to obtain 35 seats, with 10% of the votes.\n\nMeanwhile, other far-right tendencies gathered in [[Alain de Benoist]]'s ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' think-tank, heading a pro-European line. Some radical members of the \"national revolutionary\" tendency quit the FN to form other minor parties ([[Party of New Forces]], PFN, and [[French and European Nationalist Party]], PNFE).\n\n=== The French Third Position's relations with the National Front ===\n{{Further|Third Position}}\n[[Mark Frederiksen]], a French Algeria activist, created in April 1966 a [[neo-Nazi]] group, the [[FANE]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration d'action nationaliste et europ\u00e9enne'', Nationalist and European Federation of Action). The FANE boasted at most a hundred activists, including members such as [[Luc Michel]], now leader of the ''[[Parti communautaire national-europ\u00e9en]]'' (National European Communautary Party), [[Jacques Bastide]], [[Michel Faci]], [[Michel Caignet]] and [[Henri-Robert Petit]], a journalist and former [[Collaborationist]] who directed under the [[Vichy regime]] the newspaper ''[[Le Pilori]]''. The FANE maintained international contacts with the British group the [[League of Saint George]].<ref>[[Ray Hill|R. Hill]] & A. Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror- Inside Europe\u2019s Neo-Nazi Network'', London: Collins, 1988, pp.186-189</ref>\n\nThe FANE rallied [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s [[National Front (France)|National Front]] in 1974, gathered around [[Fran\u00e7ois Duprat]] and [[Alain Renault]]'s [[Revolutionary Nationalist Groups]] (GNR), which represented the [[Third Position|nationalist revolutionary]] tendency of the FN.\n\nBut in 1978, neo-Nazi members of the GNR-FANE broke again with the FN, taking with them sections of the FN youth movement, the [[G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Nation|Front National de la Jeunesse]].<ref name=Ann>[http://www.france-politique.fr/annuaire-extreme-droite.htm Annuaire de l'extr\u00eame droite en France] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> On the other hand, GNR activists closer to the [[Third Position]] (Jacques Bastide and Patrick Gorre)<ref name=Ann/> joined [[Jean-Gilles Malliarakis]] to found, on February 11, 1979, the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (France)|Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (''Mouvement nationaliste r\u00e9volutionnaire''), which became in 1985 [[Third Way (France)|Third Way]] (''Troisi\u00e8me Voie'').\n\nAfter this brief passage at the National Front, Mark Fredriksen created the ''Faisceaux nationalistes europ\u00e9ens'' ([[FANE]]) in July 1980. These would eventually merge with the ''[[Mouvement national et social ethniste]]'' in 1987, and then with the [[PNFE]] (French and European Nationalist Party) in January 1994, which also gathered former National Front members.\n\nDissolved first in September 1980 by [[Raymond Barre]]'s government, Fredriksen's group was recreated, and dissolved again in 1985 by [[Laurent Fabius]]' government. Finally, it was dissolved a third time in 1987 by [[Jacques Chirac]]'s government, on charges of \"violent demonstrations organised by this movement, which has as one of its expressed objective the establishment of a new [[Nazi]] regime,\" the \"[[paramilitary]] organisation of this association and its inciting of [[racial discrimination]].\"\n\n=== Alain de Benoist's ''Nouvelle Droite'' and the ''Club de l'Horloge'' ===\nIn the 1980s, [[Alain de Benoist]] became chief theorist of the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' movement, creating the think-tank [[GRECE]] in 1968, some of whose members were involved with the formation of the [[Club de l'Horloge]] in 1974. They advocated an [[ethno-nationalist]] stance focused on European culture, which advocated a return of [[paganism]]. Members of the GRECE quit the think tank in the 1980s, such as [[Pierre Vial]] who joined the FN, or [[Guillaume Faye]] who quit the organisation along with others members in 1986. Faye participated in 2006 in a conference in the US organised by ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'', a [[white separatist]] magazine published by the [[New Century Foundation]].\n\nAlain de Benoist occasionally contributed to the ''[[Mankind Quarterly]]'' review, which supports [[hereditarianism]] and is associated with the US think tank the [[Pioneer Fund]], headed by [[J. Philippe Rushton]], the author of ''[[Race, Evolution and Behavior]]'' (1995), which argues in favour of a biological conception of \"[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]\". GRECE and the Pioneer Fund are actively involved in the [[History of the race and intelligence controversy|race and intelligence debate]], postulating that there is an identifiable link between levels of intelligence and distinct [[ethnic group]]s.\n\nThe Club de l'horloge itself had been founded by [[Henry de Lesquen]], a former member of the conservative [[Rally for the Republic]], which he quit in 1984. Others members of the Club de l'horloge, such as [[Bruno M\u00e9gret]], later joined the FN after a short time in the RPR.\n\n=== Rise of the National Front in the 1980s and M\u00e9gret's split ===\nDuring the 1980s, the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] managed to gather, under [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s leadership, most rival far-right tendencies of France, following a succession of splits and alliances with other, minor parties, during the 1970s.\n\n==== Party of New Forces ====\nOne of those parties, the [[Party of New Forces]] (PFN, ''Parti des forces nouvelles''), was an offshoot of the National Front, formed from a 1973 split headed by [[:fr:Alain Robert (homme politique)|Alain Robert]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Brigneau]] who first organised the ''[[:fr:Comit\u00e9s faire front|Comit\u00e9 faire front]]'' which subsequently merged into the PFN.\n\nThe PFN was formed mainly by former members of [[Ordre Nouveau (1960s)|New Order]] (''Ordre nouveau'', 1969\u20131973), who had refused to merge into the FN at its 1972 creation. New Order, dissolved by Interior Minister [[Raymond Marcellin]] in 1973, was itself a successor to [[Occident (movement)|Occident]] (1964\u20131968) and of the [[Groupe Union D\u00e9fense|Union Defense Group]] (GUD, ''Groupe union d\u00e9fense'').\n\nClose to the [[Third Position]] and supporting a \"national-revolutionary\" thesis, this tendency maintained links with the FN, despite some tensions. The GUD, in particular, had published the satiric monthly ''Alternative'' with the [[Youth Front (France)|Youth Front]] (''Front de la jeunesse''), the youth organisation of the FN. They also had attempted alliances with other far-right parties in Europe, with New Order organising the alliance \"A Fatherland for Tomorrow\" (''Une patrie pour demain'') with the Spanish [[Falange]], the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI) and the German [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]].\n\nThis European strategy was continued by the PFN, who launched the [[Euroright]] alliance, with the MSI, the Spanish [[New Force (Spain)|New Force]] and the Belgian [[PFN (Belgium)|PFN]], for the [[1979 European Parliament election|1979 European elections]]. Headed by [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], the PFN won 1.3% of the vote. This electoral failure prompted [[Roland Gaucher]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Brigneau]] to quit the party and join Le Pen's National Front.\n\n==== 1981 Presidential election ====\nThe French far-right was divided in the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]], with both [[Pascal Gauchon]] (PFN) and Le Pen (FN) attempting, without success, to secure the 500 signatures from mayors necessary to stand as candidates. [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]) won those elections, competing against [[Jacques Chirac]] ([[Rally for the Republic]], RPR).\n\n==== 1983 elections and rise ====\nThese succeeding electoral defeats prompted the far-right to unify itself. In 1983, the FN managed to make its first electoral breakthrough, taking control of the town of [[Dreux]]: [[Jean-Pierre Stirbois]] obtained 17% of the votes in the first round, for the FN municipal list. In the second round, he merged his list with Chirac's RPR list (headed by [[Jean Hieaux]]), enabling the right to claim a victory against the [[French Left|left]]. Chirac supported the alliance with the far-right, claiming that the Socialist Party, allied with the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] in government, had no lessons to give.<ref>[[Franz-Olivier Giesbert]], ''La Trag\u00e9die du Pr\u00e9sident'', 2006, p 37-38</ref>\n\nThis first electoral success was confirmed at the [[1984 European Parliament election|1984 European elections]], the FN obtaining 10% of the votes. Two years later, the FN gained 35 deputies (nearly 10% of the votes) at the [[1986 French legislative elections|1986 legislative elections]], running under the label of \"''Rassemblement national''. Those elected included the monarchist [[Georges-Paul Wagner]].\n\nInternal disputes continued however to divide the far-right. Following the 1986 elections, which brought [[Jacques Chirac]] to power as [[Prime minister (France)|Prime Minister]], some hardliners inside the FN broke away to create the [[French and European Nationalist Party]] (PNFE, Parti Nationaliste Fran\u00e7ais et Europ\u00e9en), along with members of [[Mark Frederiksen]]'s Third Position [[FANE]]. Three former members of the PNFE were charged of having desecrated, in 1990, a Jewish cemetery in [[Carpentras]].<ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/1996-08-07_Articles_-La-profanation-de-Carpentras-a-ete-longuement-premeditee La profanation de Carpentras a \u00e9t\u00e9 longuement pr\u00e9m\u00e9dit\u00e9e], ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', 7 August 1996 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n==== M\u00e9gret's split, Le Pen's 2002 score and subsequent electoral fall ====\nThe most important split, however, was headed by [[Bruno M\u00e9gret]] in 1999. Taking many FN elected representatives and party officials with him, he then created the [[National Republican Movement]] (MNR). However, with an eye to the [[2007 French legislative election|2007 legislative elections]], he supported Le Pen's candidacy for the [[2007 French presidential election|presidential election]].\n\nDuring these presidential elections, [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] only took 10.4% of the vote, compared to his 16.9% [[2002 French presidential election|first round result in 2002]], qualifying him for the second round, where he achieved 17.79% against 82.21% for [[Jacques Chirac]] ([[Rally for the Republic]], RPR).\n\nWith only 1.85% in the second round of the [[2002 French legislative elections|2002 legislative elections]], the FN failed to gain any seats in the [[Deputies of the 12th French National Assembly|National Assembly]]. In the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]], Le Pen finished fourth, behind [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]]. [[Philippe de Villiers]], the [[Traditionalist Catholicism|Catholic traditionalist]] candidate of the [[Movement for France]] (especially strong in the conservative [[Vend\u00e9e]] region), was sixth, obtaining 2.23% of the vote.\n\nThis electoral slump for the FN was confirmed at the [[2007 French legislative elections|2007 legislative elections]], the FN obtaining only 0.08% of the votes in the second round, and therefore no seats.\n\n==== Le Pen's succession ====\n[[File:Le Pen, Marine-9586.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marine Le Pen]] succeeded her father as Front National leader in 2011]]\nThese electoral defeats, which contrasted with the high score obtained at the 2002 presidential elections, caused financial problems for the FN, which was forced to sell its headquarters, the ''[[Paquebot]]'', in [[Saint-Cloud]]. Le Pen then announced, in 2008, that he would not compete again in presidential elections, leaving the way for contest for the leadership of the FN between his daughter, [[Marine Le Pen]], whom he favoured,  and [[Bruno Gollnisch]].<ref>[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/politique/20080915.OBS1393/succession__le_pen_confie_preferer_sa_fille_a_bruno_gol.html Succession : Le Pen confie
