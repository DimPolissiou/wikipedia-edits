In 1611, the Tsar of Russia [[Shuysky Tribute|paid homage]] to the King of Poland.\n\n[[File:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1635.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|The [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] at its greatest extent after the [[Truce of Deulino]].

Starting in 1648, the [[Cossack]] [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] engulfed the south and east, eventually leaving Ukraine divided, with the eastern part, lost by the Commonwealth, becoming a dependency of the Tsardom of Russia. This was followed by the [[Deluge (history)|'Deluge']], a Swedish invasion of Poland, which marched through the Polish heartlands and ruined the country's population, culture and infrastructure\u2014around four million of Poland's eleven million inhabitants died in famines and epidemics throughout the 17th century.<ref name=\"britannica1\" /> However, under [[John III Sobieski]] the Commonwealth's military prowess was re-established, and in 1683 Polish forces played a major role in the [[Battle of Vienna]] against the [[Ottoman Army (15th-19th centuries)|Ottoman Army]], commanded by [[Kara Mustafa Pasha|Kara Mustafa]], the Grand Vizier of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Jan III Schultz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|King [[John III Sobieski]] defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] at the [[Battle of Vienna]] on 12 September 1683.]]\n\nSobieski's reign marked the end of the nation's golden era. Finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy, the Commonwealth fell into decline. The government became ineffective as a result of large-scale internal conflicts (e.g. [[Lubomirski Rebellion]] against [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] and rebellious [[confederation (Poland)|confederations]]) and corrupted legislative processes. The nobility fell under the control of a handful of ''[[magnat (Poland)|magnats]]'', and this, compounded with two relatively weak kings of the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] [[House of Wettin|Wettin dynasty]], [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]] and [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], as well as the rise of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]] after the [[Great Northern War]] only served to worsen the Commonwealth's plight. Despite this The Commonwealth-Saxony personal union gave rise to the emergence of the Commonwealth's first reform movement, and laid the foundations for the [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"gierowski2\" />\n\nDuring the later part of the 18th century, the Commonwealth made attempts to implement fundamental internal reforms; with the second half of the century bringing a much improved economy, significant population growth and far-reaching progress in the areas of education, intellectual life, art, and especially toward the end of the period, evolution of the social and political system. The most populous capital city of Warsaw replaced [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig) as the leading centre of commerce, and the role of the more prosperous townsmen increased.\n\n=== Partitions ===\n{{Main|History of Poland (1795\u20131918)|Partitions of Poland|}}\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw II August Poniatowski in coronation clothes.PNG|thumb|upright|[[Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus]], the last [[King of Poland]], ascended to the throne in 1764 and reigned until his abdication on 25 November 1795.]]\n\nThe [[Royal elections in Poland|royal election]] of 1764 resulted in the elevation of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw II August]] (a Polish aristocrat connected to the [[Czartoryski family]] faction of [[magnates]]) to the monarchy. However, as a one-time personal admirer of Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]], the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation, and his perceived necessity to remain in a political relationship with his Russian sponsor. This led to the formation of the 1768 [[Bar Confederation]], a ''szlachta'' rebellion directed against the Polish king and his Russian sponsors, which aimed to preserve Poland's independence and the szlachta's traditional privileges.\nAttempts at reform provoked the union's neighbours, and in 1772 the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition of the Commonwealth]] by Prussia, Russia and Austria took place; an act which the \"[[Partition Sejm]]\", under considerable duress, eventually \"ratified\" ''fait accompli''.<ref name=\"wydawnictwo\" /> Disregarding this loss, in 1773 the king established the [[Commission of National Education]], the first government education authority in Europe.

However, this document, accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies, generated strong opposition from the Commonwealth's nobles and conservatives as well as from Catherine II, who, determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong Commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the Polish-Lithuanian state. Russia was aided in achieving its goal when the [[Targowica Confederation]], an organisation of Polish nobles, appealed to the Empress for help. In May 1792, Russian forces crossed the Commonwealth's frontier, thus beginning the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792|Polish-Russian War]].\n\nThe defensive war fought by the Poles ended prematurely when the King, convinced of the futility of resistance, capitulated and joined the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation then took over the government. Russia and Prussia, fearing the mere existence of a Polish state, arranged for, and in 1793 executed, the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition of the Commonwealth]], which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence. Eventually, in 1795, following the failed [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]], the Commonwealth was [[Third Partition of Poland|partitioned one last time]] by all three of its more powerful neighbours, and with this, effectively ceased to exist.<ref name=\"gierowski3\" />\n\n=== Era of insurrections ===\n{{Main|Duchy of Warsaw|Grand Duchy of Posen||Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Congress Poland}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25|[[Partitions of Poland|The partitions of Poland]], carried out by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Russian Empire]], and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in [[First Partition of Poland|1772]], [[Second Partition of Poland|1793]] and [[Third Partition of Poland|1795]]]]\n\nPoles [[List of wars involving Poland|rebelled several times against the partitioners]], particularly near the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century.

However, over time the Russian monarch reduced Polish freedoms, and Russia annexed the country in virtually all but name. Meanwhile, the Prussian controlled territory of Poland came under increased Germanization. Thus, in the 19th century, only Austrian-ruled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], and particularly the [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w]], allowed free Polish culture to flourish.\n\nThroughout the period of the partitions, political and cultural repression of the Polish nation led to the organisation of a number of uprisings against the authorities of the occupying Russian, Prussian and Austrian governments. In 1830, the [[November Uprising]] began in Warsaw when, led by Lieutenant [[Piotr Wysocki]], young [[non-commissioned officer]]s at the [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Officer Cadet School]] in Warsaw revolted. They were joined by large segments of Polish society, and together forced Warsaw's Russian garrison to withdraw north of the city.\n\n[[File:MWP 1830 Arsenal.jpg|thumb|Capture of the [[Warsaw Arsenal]] by the Polish Army during the [[November Uprising]] against [[Tsarist autocracy]], 29 November 1830]]\n\nOver the course of the next seven months, Polish forces successfully defeated the Russian armies of Field Marshal [[Hans Karl von Diebitsch]] and a number of other Russian commanders; however, finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers, save distant France and the newborn United States, and with Prussia and Austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories, the Poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure. Upon the surrender of Warsaw to General [[Ivan Paskievich]], many Polish troops, feeling they could not go on, withdrew into Prussia and there laid down their arms. After the defeat, the semi-independent Congress Poland lost its constitution, army and legislative assembly, and was integrated more closely with the Russian Empire.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZ9eBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA249&dq=congress+poland+integration+paskevich#v=onepage&q=congress+poland+integration+paskevich&f=false|title=The Russian Empire: A Multi-ethnic History|first=Andreas|last=Kappeler|date=27 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317568100|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Spring of Nations]] (a series of revolutions which swept across Europe), Poles took up arms in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising of 1848]] to resist Prussian rule.

The [[January Uprising]] started out as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against [[conscription]] into the Imperial Russian Army. However, the insurrectionists, despite being joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and numerous politicians, were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support. They were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics and failed to win any major military victories. Afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and Poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural self-improvement. Congress Poland was rapidly industrialised towards the end of the 19th century, and successively transformed into the Empire's wealthiest and most developed subject.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kKR8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA181&dq=january+uprising+economic#v=onepage&q=january+uprising+economic&f=false|title=Poland From Partitions to EU Accession: A Modern Economic History, 1772\u20132004|first=Piotr|last=Kory\u015b|date=29 November 2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319971261|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=op5AAQAAIAAJ&q=congress+poland+richest+part&dq=congress+poland+richest+part|title=Zionism|first=Getzel|last=Kressel|date=6 September 1973|publisher=Keter Books|isbn=9780706513264|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDespite the political unrest experienced during the partitions, Poland did benefit from large-scale industrialisation and modernisation programs, instituted by the occupying powers, which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity.

Railways were restructured to direct traffic towards [[Warsaw]] instead of the former imperial capitals, a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a [[Gdynia|major seaport]] was opened on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] Coast, so as to allow Polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged [[Free City of Danzig]].\n\nThe inter-war period heralded in a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the First World War, the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition. For this reason, many exiled Polish activists, such as [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] (who would later become prime minister) returned home to help; a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures.

Polish territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944\u201345, eliminating the need for their respective (anti-Nazi) partisan forces in Poland (although the [[cursed soldiers]] continued to fight against the Soviets). Several sources note that Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe. [[Norman Davies]] wrote: \"Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK, which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance\";<ref name=\"google12\" /> [[Gregor Dallas]] wrote \"Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered around 400000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe\";<ref name=\"google13\" /> [[Mark Wyman]] wrote \"Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe\".<ref name=\"google14\" /> Certainly, Polish resistance was the largest resistance till German [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941.

This action angered many Poles who considered it a [[Yalta betrayal|betrayal]] by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organized by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new [[communist state|communist]] government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Anti-Communism in the Communist Bloc|As elsewhere in Communist Europe]], the Soviet influence over Poland was met with [[Cursed soldiers|armed resistance]] from the outset which continued into the 1950s.\n\nDespite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland<ref name=\"indianapolis\" /> (in particular the cities of [[Wilno]] and [[Lw\u00f3w]]) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of [[Red Army]] units on Poland's territory. Military alignment within the [[Warsaw Pact]] throughout the [[Cold War]] came about as a direct result of this change in Poland's political culture. In the European scene, it came to characterize the full-fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations.\n\nThe new communist government took control with the adoption of the [[Small Constitution of 1947|Small Constitution]] on 19 February 1947. The [[Polish People's Republic]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|was officially proclaimed in 1952]]. In 1956, after the death of [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]], the r\u00e9gime of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. [[Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic]] failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland|anti-communist opposition]] groups persisted. Despite this, Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\" />\n\nLabour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union \"[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]\" (\"''Solidarno\u015b\u0107''\"), which over time became a political force. Despite persecution and imposition of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law in 1981]], it eroded the dominance of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] and by 1989 had triumphed in Poland's first [[Contract Sejm|partially free and democratic parliamentary elections]] since the end of the Second World War. [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]], a Solidarity candidate, eventually [[1990 Polish presidential election|won the presidency in 1990]].

In the north-west is the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seacoast, which extends from the [[Bay of Pomerania]] to the [[Gda\u0144sk Bay|Gulf of Gda\u0144sk]]. This coast is marked by several [[spit (landform)|spits]], coastal lakes (former bays that have been cut off from the sea), and dunes. The largely straight coastline is indented by the [[Szczecin Lagoon]], the [[Bay of Puck]], and the [[Vistula Lagoon]].\n\nThe centre and parts of the north of the country lie within the [[North European Plain]]. Rising above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising four hilly districts of [[moraine]]s and [[moraine-dammed lake]]s formed during and after the [[Quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]]. These lake districts are the [[Pomerania]]n Lake District, the Greater Polish Lake District, the [[Kashubia]]n Lake District, and the [[Masurian Lake District]]. The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four and covers much of north-eastern Poland. The lake districts form part of the Baltic Ridge, a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]].\n\nSouth of the Northern European Plain are the regions of [[Lusatia]], [[Silesia]] and [[Masovia]], which are marked by broad ice-age river valleys. Farther south is a mountainous region, including the [[Sudetes]], the [[Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland]]s, the [[\u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Mountains]], and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], including the [[Beskids]].

Both processes shaped the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or [[loam]], while the ice age river valleys of the south often contain [[loess]]. The [[Polish Jura]], the [[Pieniny]], and the [[Western Tatras]] consist of [[limestone]], while the [[High Tatras]], the [[Beskids]], and the [[Karkonosze]] are made up mainly of [[granite]] and [[basalt]]s. The [[Polish Jura Chain]] has some of the oldest rock formation on the continent of Europe.\n\n[[File:Morskie Oko o poranku.jpg|thumb|[[Morskie Oko]] at the foothill of [[Tatra Mountains]] in southern Poland which average 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) in elevation]]\n\nPoland has 70 mountains over {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in elevation, all in the [[Tatras]].

Many power plants nationwide use Poland's position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in production of their energy.

This is to be achieved mainly through the construction of [[wind farm]]s and a number of [[hydroelectric]] stations.\n\nPoland has around 164,800,000,000 m<sup>3</sup> of proven natural gas reserves and around 96,380,000 barrels of proven oil reserves. These reserves are exploited by energy supply companies such as [[PKN Orlen]] (\"the only Polish company listed in the [[Fortune Global 500]]\"), [[PGNiG]]. However, the small amounts of fossil fuels naturally occurring in Poland is insufficient to satisfy the full energy consumption needs of the population. Therefore, the country is a net importer of oil and natural gas.\n\nThe 5 largest companies supplying Poland electricity are [[Polska Grupa Energetyczna|PGE]], [[Tauron Group|Tauron]], [[Enea SA|Enea]], [[:pl:Energa|Energa]] and [[Innogy|Innogy Poland]].\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{Main|Transport in Poland|List of airports in Poland|Highways in Poland}}\n[[File:Wezelsosnicafromthesky.JPG|thumb|[[A1 autostrada (Poland)|A1]], [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4]] motorways and [[National roads in Poland|express road 44]] junction near [[Gliwice]]]]\nTransport in Poland is provided by means of [[Rail transport in Poland|rail]], [[Roads and expressways in Poland|road]], [[Polish Merchant Navy|marine shipping]] and [[List of airports in Poland|air travel]].

In 1264, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], also known as a Charter of Jewish Liberties, granted [[Jews]] living in the Polish lands unprecedented legal rights not found anywhere in Europe. In 1424, the Polish king was pressed by the Bishops to issue the [[Edict of Wielu\u0144]], outlawing early Protestant [[Hussite|Hussitism]]. Then in 1573, the [[Warsaw Confederation]] marked the formal beginning of extensive religious freedoms granted to all faiths in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The act was not imposed by a king or consequence of war, but rather resulted from the actions of members of the Polish-Lithuanian society. It was also influenced by the events of the 1572 French [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], which prompted the Polish-Lithuanian nobility to see that no monarch would ever be able to carry out such reprehensible atrocities in Poland. The act is also credited with keeping the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth out of the [[Thirty Years' War]], fought between German Protestants and Catholics.<ref>Adam Zamojski, \"The Polish Way\".

It is compulsory that children participate in one year of formal education before entering the 1st class at no later than 7 years of age.

They will attend this school for three years during classes 7, 8, and 9. Students then take another compulsory exam to determine the upper secondary level school they will attend. There are several alternatives, the most common being the three years in a ''liceum'' or four years in a [[Technikum (Polish education)|technikum]]. Both end with a maturity examination ([[matura]]\u2014similar to French [[baccalaur\u00e9at]]), and may be followed by several forms of higher education, leading to [[licencjat]] or in\u017cynier (the Polish [[Bologna Process]] first cycle qualification), [[magister (degree)|magister]] (second cycle qualification) and eventually doktor (third cycle qualification).<ref name=\"The impact of the 1999 education reform in Poland\" />\n\nIn Poland, there are 500 university-level institutions for the pursuit of higher education.<ref>Central Statistical Office: [http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_E_szkoly_wyzsze_2008.pdf Studenci szk\u00f3\u0142 wy\u017cszych (\u0142\u0105cznie z cudzoziemcami) na dzie\u0144 30 XI 2008.] Number of students at Poland's institutions of higher education, as of 30 November 2008.

Other early compositions, such as the melody of ''[[Bogurodzica]]'' and ''[[God Is Born]]'' (a coronation [[Polonaise (dance)|polonaise]] for Polish kings by an unknown composer), may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, [[Miko\u0142aj z Radomia|Nicholas of Radom]], lived in the 15th century. During the 16th century, two main musical groups \u2013 both based in [[Krak\u00f3w]] and belonging to the King and Archbishop of [[Wawel]] \u2013 led to the rapid development of Polish renaissance music. [[Diomedes Cato]], a native-born Italian who lived in Krak\u00f3w from about the age of five, became a renowned lutenist at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.<ref name=\"The Music Courts of the Polish Vasas\" />\n\n{{Listen\n| header      = '''[[Fryderyk Chopin]]'''\n| filename    = Frederic Chopin - mazurka no. 4 in a minor, op. 17.ogg\n| title       = Mazurka no. 4 in a minor, op. 17\n| description = [[Mazurka]] ({{lang-pl|mazurek}}), stylized [[folk dance]] in [[triple meter]] (1832), commemorating the [[November Uprising]]\n| help        = no\n| pos         = left\n}}\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish baroque composers mostly wrote either [[liturgical music]] or secular compositions such as [[concerto]]s and [[sonata]]s for voices or instruments.

Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south, particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of [[Zakopane]].\n\nToday Poland has an active music scene, with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace. Polish jazz musicians such as [[Krzysztof Komeda]] created a unique style, which was most famous in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day. Since the fall of communism throughout Europe, Poland has become a major venue for large-scale music festivals, chief among which are the [[Open'er Festival]], [[Opole Festival]] and [[Sopot Festival]].\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Art in Poland|Young Poland|List of Polish artists}}\n[[File:The Lady with an Ermine.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' (1490) by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

[[Romanesque architecture]] is represented by [[St. Andrew's Church, Krak\u00f3w]], and [[St. Mary's Church, Gda\u0144sk]], is characteristic for the [[Brick Gothic]] style found in Poland. Richly decorated [[attic style|attics]] and [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] [[loggia]]s are the common elements of the Polish Renaissance architecture,<ref name=\"szydlowiec\" /><ref name=\"RENAISSANCE CULTURAL BACKGROUND\" /> as evident in the [[Pozna\u0144 City Hall|City Hall]] in Pozna\u0144. For some time the late renaissance style known as [[mannerism]], most notably in the [[Cracow Bishops' Palace in Kielce|Bishop's Palace]] in [[Kielce]], coexisted with the early baroque style, typified in the [[Saints Peter and Paul Church, Krak\u00f3w|Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Krak\u00f3w]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | image1 = St Mary's Krakow.jpg\n | width1 = 161\n | alt1 = Saint Mary's Church in Krak\u00f3w\n | caption1 = [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|St. Mary's Basilica]] on the [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Market Square]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]] is an example of [[Brick Gothic]] architecture.\n | image2 = Ayuntamiento, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 67-72 HDR.jpg \n | width2 = 140\n | alt2 = Pozna\u0144 City Hall\n | caption2 = [[Ratusz]], the 16th-century [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] City Hall in [[Pozna\u0144]] designed by Italian architects\n}}\n\nHistory has not been kind to Poland's architectural monuments. Nonetheless, a number of ancient structures has survived: castles, churches, and stately homes, often unique in the regional or European context. Some of them have been painstakingly restored, like [[Wawel Castle]], or completely reconstructed, including the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]] and [[Royal Castle in Warsaw|Royal Castle]] of Warsaw and the Old Town of [[Gda\u0144sk]].\n\nThe architecture of Gda\u0144sk is mostly of the Hanseatic variety, a Gothic style common among the former trading cities along the Baltic sea and in the northern part of Central Europe. The architectural style of [[Wroc\u0142aw]] is mainly representative of German architecture, since it was for centuries located within the Holy Roman Empire. The centres of [[Kazimierz Dolny]] and [[Sandomierz]] on the [[Vistula]] are good examples of well-preserved medieval towns. Poland's ancient capital, [[Krak\u00f3w]], ranks among the best-preserved [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and Renaissance urban complexes in Europe.\n\nThe second half of the 17th century is marked by [[baroque]] architecture. Side towers, such as those of [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki Palace]] in Bia\u0142ystok, are typical for the Polish baroque. The classical [[Silesian architecture|Silesian baroque]] is represented by the University in Wroc\u0142aw. The profuse decorations of the [[Branicki Palace, Warsaw|Branicki Palace]] in Warsaw are characteristic of the [[rococo]] style. The centre of Polish classicism was Warsaw under the rule of the last Polish king [[Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stanley|first=John|year=2004|title=Reviewed Work: Literary Activities and Attitudes in the Stanislavian Age in Poland (1764\u20131795): A Social System? by Jan I.J. van der Meer|journal=Canadian Slavonic Papers|volume=46|issue=1/2|pages=226\u2013229|jstor=40870954}}</ref>\nThe [[\u0141azienki Palace|Palace on the Water]] is the most notable example of Polish [[neoclassical architecture]].

In 1611, the Tsar of Russia [[Shuysky Tribute|paid homage]] to the King of Poland.\n\n[[File:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1635.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|The [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] at its greatest extent after the [[Truce of Deulino]].

Starting in 1648, the [[Cossack]] [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] engulfed the south and east, eventually leaving Ukraine divided, with the eastern part, lost by the Commonwealth, becoming a dependency of the Tsardom of Russia. This was followed by the [[Deluge (history)|'Deluge']], a Swedish invasion of Poland, which marched through the Polish heartlands and ruined the country's population, culture and infrastructure\u2014around four million of Poland's eleven million inhabitants died in famines and epidemics throughout the 17th century.<ref name=\"britannica1\" /> However, under [[John III Sobieski]] the Commonwealth's military prowess was re-established, and in 1683 Polish forces played a major role in the [[Battle of Vienna]] against the [[Ottoman Army (15th-19th centuries)|Ottoman Army]], commanded by [[Kara Mustafa Pasha|Kara Mustafa]], the Grand Vizier of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Jan III Schultz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|King [[John III Sobieski]] defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] at the [[Battle of Vienna]] on 12 September 1683.]]\n\nSobieski's reign marked the end of the nation's golden era. Finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy, the Commonwealth fell into decline. The government became ineffective as a result of large-scale internal conflicts (e.g. [[Lubomirski Rebellion]] against [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] and rebellious [[confederation (Poland)|confederations]]) and corrupted legislative processes. The nobility fell under the control of a handful of ''[[magnat (Poland)|magnats]]'', and this, compounded with two relatively weak kings of the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] [[House of Wettin|Wettin dynasty]], [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]] and [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], as well as the rise of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]] after the [[Great Northern War]] only served to worsen the Commonwealth's plight. Despite this The Commonwealth-Saxony personal union gave rise to the emergence of the Commonwealth's first reform movement, and laid the foundations for the [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"gierowski2\" />\n\nDuring the later part of the 18th century, the Commonwealth made attempts to implement fundamental internal reforms; with the second half of the century bringing a much improved economy, significant population growth and far-reaching progress in the areas of education, intellectual life, art, and especially toward the end of the period, evolution of the social and political system. The most populous capital city of Warsaw replaced [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig) as the leading centre of commerce, and the role of the more prosperous townsmen increased.\n\n=== Partitions ===\n{{Main|History of Poland (1795\u20131918)|Partitions of Poland|}}\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw II August Poniatowski in coronation clothes.PNG|thumb|upright|[[Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus]], the last [[King of Poland]], ascended to the throne in 1764 and reigned until his abdication on 25 November 1795.]]\n\nThe [[Royal elections in Poland|royal election]] of 1764 resulted in the elevation of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw II August]] (a Polish aristocrat connected to the [[Czartoryski family]] faction of [[magnates]]) to the monarchy. However, as a one-time personal admirer of Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]], the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation, and his perceived necessity to remain in a political relationship with his Russian sponsor. This led to the formation of the 1768 [[Bar Confederation]], a ''szlachta'' rebellion directed against the Polish king and his Russian sponsors, which aimed to preserve Poland's independence and the szlachta's traditional privileges.\nAttempts at reform provoked the union's neighbours, and in 1772 the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition of the Commonwealth]] by Prussia, Russia and Austria took place; an act which the \"[[Partition Sejm]]\", under considerable duress, eventually \"ratified\" ''fait accompli''.<ref name=\"wydawnictwo\" /> Disregarding this loss, in 1773 the king established the [[Commission of National Education]], the first government education authority in Europe.

However, this document, accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies, generated strong opposition from the Commonwealth's nobles and conservatives as well as from Catherine II, who, determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong Commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the Polish-Lithuanian state. Russia was aided in achieving its goal when the [[Targowica Confederation]], an organisation of Polish nobles, appealed to the Empress for help. In May 1792, Russian forces crossed the Commonwealth's frontier, thus beginning the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792|Polish-Russian War]].\n\nThe defensive war fought by the Poles ended prematurely when the King, convinced of the futility of resistance, capitulated and joined the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation then took over the government. Russia and Prussia, fearing the mere existence of a Polish state, arranged for, and in 1793 executed, the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition of the Commonwealth]], which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence. Eventually, in 1795, following the failed [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]], the Commonwealth was [[Third Partition of Poland|partitioned one last time]] by all three of its more powerful neighbours, and with this, effectively ceased to exist.<ref name=\"gierowski3\" />\n\n=== Era of insurrections ===\n{{Main|Duchy of Warsaw|Grand Duchy of Posen||Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Congress Poland}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25|[[Partitions of Poland|The partitions of Poland]], carried out by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Russian Empire]], and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in [[First Partition of Poland|1772]], [[Second Partition of Poland|1793]] and [[Third Partition of Poland|1795]]]]\n\nPoles [[List of wars involving Poland|rebelled several times against the partitioners]], particularly near the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century.

However, over time the Russian monarch reduced Polish freedoms, and Russia annexed the country in virtually all but name. Meanwhile, the Prussian controlled territory of Poland came under increased Germanization. Thus, in the 19th century, only Austrian-ruled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], and particularly the [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w]], allowed free Polish culture to flourish.\n\nThroughout the period of the partitions, political and cultural repression of the Polish nation led to the organisation of a number of uprisings against the authorities of the occupying Russian, Prussian and Austrian governments. In 1830, the [[November Uprising]] began in Warsaw when, led by Lieutenant [[Piotr Wysocki]], young [[non-commissioned officer]]s at the [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Officer Cadet School]] in Warsaw revolted. They were joined by large segments of Polish society, and together forced Warsaw's Russian garrison to withdraw north of the city.\n\n[[File:MWP 1830 Arsenal.jpg|thumb|Capture of the [[Warsaw Arsenal]] by the Polish Army during the [[November Uprising]] against [[Tsarist autocracy]], 29 November 1830]]\n\nOver the course of the next seven months, Polish forces successfully defeated the Russian armies of Field Marshal [[Hans Karl von Diebitsch]] and a number of other Russian commanders; however, finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers, save distant France and the newborn United States, and with Prussia and Austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories, the Poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure. Upon the surrender of Warsaw to General [[Ivan Paskievich]], many Polish troops, feeling they could not go on, withdrew into Prussia and there laid down their arms. After the defeat, the semi-independent Congress Poland lost its constitution, army and legislative assembly, and was integrated more closely with the Russian Empire.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZ9eBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA249&dq=congress+poland+integration+paskevich#v=onepage&q=congress+poland+integration+paskevich&f=false|title=The Russian Empire: A Multi-ethnic History|first=Andreas|last=Kappeler|date=27 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317568100|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Spring of Nations]] (a series of revolutions which swept across Europe), Poles took up arms in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising of 1848]] to resist Prussian rule.

The [[January Uprising]] started out as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against [[conscription]] into the Imperial Russian Army. However, the insurrectionists, despite being joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and numerous politicians, were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support. They were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics and failed to win any major military victories. Afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and Poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural self-improvement. Congress Poland was rapidly industrialised towards the end of the 19th century, and successively transformed into the Empire's wealthiest and most developed subject.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kKR8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA181&dq=january+uprising+economic#v=onepage&q=january+uprising+economic&f=false|title=Poland From Partitions to EU Accession: A Modern Economic History, 1772\u20132004|first=Piotr|last=Kory\u015b|date=29 November 2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319971261|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=op5AAQAAIAAJ&q=congress+poland+richest+part&dq=congress+poland+richest+part|title=Zionism|first=Getzel|last=Kressel|date=6 September 1973|publisher=Keter Books|isbn=9780706513264|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDespite the political unrest experienced during the partitions, Poland did benefit from large-scale industrialisation and modernisation programs, instituted by the occupying powers, which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity.

Railways were restructured to direct traffic towards [[Warsaw]] instead of the former imperial capitals, a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a [[Gdynia|major seaport]] was opened on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] Coast, so as to allow Polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged [[Free City of Danzig]].\n\nThe inter-war period heralded in a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the First World War, the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition. For this reason, many exiled Polish activists, such as [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] (who would later become prime minister) returned home to help; a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures.

Polish territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944\u201345, eliminating the need for their respective (anti-Nazi) partisan forces in Poland (although the [[cursed soldiers]] continued to fight against the Soviets). Several sources note that Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe. [[Norman Davies]] wrote: \"Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK, which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance\";<ref name=\"google12\" /> [[Gregor Dallas]] wrote \"Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered around 400000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe\";<ref name=\"google13\" /> [[Mark Wyman]] wrote \"Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe\".<ref name=\"google14\" /> Certainly, Polish resistance was the largest resistance till German [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941.

This action angered many Poles who considered it a [[Yalta betrayal|betrayal]] by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organized by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new [[communist state|communist]] government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Anti-Communism in the Communist Bloc|As elsewhere in Communist Europe]], the Soviet influence over Poland was met with [[Cursed soldiers|armed resistance]] from the outset which continued into the 1950s.\n\nDespite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland<ref name=\"indianapolis\" /> (in particular the cities of [[Wilno]] and [[Lw\u00f3w]]) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of [[Red Army]] units on Poland's territory. Military alignment within the [[Warsaw Pact]] throughout the [[Cold War]] came about as a direct result of this change in Poland's political culture. In the European scene, it came to characterize the full-fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations.\n\nThe new communist government took control with the adoption of the [[Small Constitution of 1947|Small Constitution]] on 19 February 1947. The [[Polish People's Republic]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|was officially proclaimed in 1952]]. In 1956, after the death of [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]], the r\u00e9gime of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. [[Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic]] failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland|anti-communist opposition]] groups persisted. Despite this, Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\" />\n\nLabour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union \"[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]\" (\"''Solidarno\u015b\u0107''\"), which over time became a political force. Despite persecution and imposition of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law in 1981]], it eroded the dominance of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] and by 1989 had triumphed in Poland's first [[Contract Sejm|partially free and democratic parliamentary elections]] since the end of the Second World War. [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]], a Solidarity candidate, eventually [[1990 Polish presidential election|won the presidency in 1990]].

In the north-west is the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seacoast, which extends from the [[Bay of Pomerania]] to the [[Gda\u0144sk Bay|Gulf of Gda\u0144sk]]. This coast is marked by several [[spit (landform)|spits]], coastal lakes (former bays that have been cut off from the sea), and dunes. The largely straight coastline is indented by the [[Szczecin Lagoon]], the [[Bay of Puck]], and the [[Vistula Lagoon]].\n\nThe centre and parts of the north of the country lie within the [[North European Plain]]. Rising above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising four hilly districts of [[moraine]]s and [[moraine-dammed lake]]s formed during and after the [[Quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]]. These lake districts are the [[Pomerania]]n Lake District, the Greater Polish Lake District, the [[Kashubia]]n Lake District, and the [[Masurian Lake District]]. The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four and covers much of north-eastern Poland. The lake districts form part of the Baltic Ridge, a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]].\n\nSouth of the Northern European Plain are the regions of [[Lusatia]], [[Silesia]] and [[Masovia]], which are marked by broad ice-age river valleys. Farther south is a mountainous region, including the [[Sudetes]], the [[Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland]]s, the [[\u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Mountains]], and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], including the [[Beskids]].

Both processes shaped the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or [[loam]], while the ice age river valleys of the south often contain [[loess]]. The [[Polish Jura]], the [[Pieniny]], and the [[Western Tatras]] consist of [[limestone]], while the [[High Tatras]], the [[Beskids]], and the [[Karkonosze]] are made up mainly of [[granite]] and [[basalt]]s. The [[Polish Jura Chain]] has some of the oldest rock formation on the continent of Europe.\n\n[[File:Morskie Oko o poranku.jpg|thumb|[[Morskie Oko]] at the foothill of [[Tatra Mountains]] in southern Poland which average 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) in elevation]]\n\nPoland has 70 mountains over {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in elevation, all in the [[Tatras]].

Many power plants nationwide use Poland's position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in production of their energy.

This is to be achieved mainly through the construction of [[wind farm]]s and a number of [[hydroelectric]] stations.\n\nPoland has around 164,800,000,000 m<sup>3</sup> of proven natural gas reserves and around 96,380,000 barrels of proven oil reserves. These reserves are exploited by energy supply companies such as [[PKN Orlen]] (\"the only Polish company listed in the [[Fortune Global 500]]\"), [[PGNiG]]. However, the small amounts of fossil fuels naturally occurring in Poland is insufficient to satisfy the full energy consumption needs of the population. Therefore, the country is a net importer of oil and natural gas.\n\nThe 5 largest companies supplying Poland electricity are [[Polska Grupa Energetyczna|PGE]], [[Tauron Group|Tauron]], [[Enea SA|Enea]], [[:pl:Energa|Energa]] and [[Innogy|Innogy Poland]].\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{Main|Transport in Poland|List of airports in Poland|Highways in Poland}}\n[[File:Wezelsosnicafromthesky.JPG|thumb|[[A1 autostrada (Poland)|A1]], [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4]] motorways and [[National roads in Poland|express road 44]] junction near [[Gliwice]]]]\nTransport in Poland is provided by means of [[Rail transport in Poland|rail]], [[Roads and expressways in Poland|road]], [[Polish Merchant Navy|marine shipping]] and [[List of airports in Poland|air travel]].

In 1264, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], also known as a Charter of Jewish Liberties, granted [[Jews]] living in the Polish lands unprecedented legal rights not found anywhere in Europe. In 1424, the Polish king was pressed by the Bishops to issue the [[Edict of Wielu\u0144]], outlawing early Protestant [[Hussite|Hussitism]]. Then in 1573, the [[Warsaw Confederation]] marked the formal beginning of extensive religious freedoms granted to all faiths in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The act was not imposed by a king or consequence of war, but rather resulted from the actions of members of the Polish-Lithuanian society. It was also influenced by the events of the 1572 French [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], which prompted the Polish-Lithuanian nobility to see that no monarch would ever be able to carry out such reprehensible atrocities in Poland. The act is also credited with keeping the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth out of the [[Thirty Years' War]], fought between German Protestants and Catholics.<ref>Adam Zamojski, \"The Polish Way\".

It is compulsory that children participate in one year of formal education before entering the 1st class at no later than 7 years of age.

They will attend this school for three years during classes 7, 8, and 9. Students then take another compulsory exam to determine the upper secondary level school they will attend. There are several alternatives, the most common being the three years in a ''liceum'' or four years in a [[Technikum (Polish education)|technikum]]. Both end with a maturity examination ([[matura]]\u2014similar to French [[baccalaur\u00e9at]]), and may be followed by several forms of higher education, leading to [[licencjat]] or in\u017cynier (the Polish [[Bologna Process]] first cycle qualification), [[magister (degree)|magister]] (second cycle qualification) and eventually doktor (third cycle qualification).<ref name=\"The impact of the 1999 education reform in Poland\" />\n\nIn Poland, there are 500 university-level institutions for the pursuit of higher education.<ref>Central Statistical Office: [http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_E_szkoly_wyzsze_2008.pdf Studenci szk\u00f3\u0142 wy\u017cszych (\u0142\u0105cznie z cudzoziemcami) na dzie\u0144 30 XI 2008.] Number of students at Poland's institutions of higher education, as of 30 November 2008.

Other early compositions, such as the melody of ''[[Bogurodzica]]'' and ''[[God Is Born]]'' (a coronation [[Polonaise (dance)|polonaise]] for Polish kings by an unknown composer), may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, [[Miko\u0142aj z Radomia|Nicholas of Radom]], lived in the 15th century. During the 16th century, two main musical groups \u2013 both based in [[Krak\u00f3w]] and belonging to the King and Archbishop of [[Wawel]] \u2013 led to the rapid development of Polish renaissance music. [[Diomedes Cato]], a native-born Italian who lived in Krak\u00f3w from about the age of five, became a renowned lutenist at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.<ref name=\"The Music Courts of the Polish Vasas\" />\n\n{{Listen\n| header      = '''[[Fryderyk Chopin]]'''\n| filename    = Frederic Chopin - mazurka no. 4 in a minor, op. 17.ogg\n| title       = Mazurka no. 4 in a minor, op. 17\n| description = [[Mazurka]] ({{lang-pl|mazurek}}), stylized [[folk dance]] in [[triple meter]] (1832), commemorating the [[November Uprising]]\n| help        = no\n| pos         = left\n}}\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish baroque composers mostly wrote either [[liturgical music]] or secular compositions such as [[concerto]]s and [[sonata]]s for voices or instruments.

Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south, particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of [[Zakopane]].\n\nToday Poland has an active music scene, with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace. Polish jazz musicians such as [[Krzysztof Komeda]] created a unique style, which was most famous in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day. Since the fall of communism throughout Europe, Poland has become a major venue for large-scale music festivals, chief among which are the [[Open'er Festival]], [[Opole Festival]] and [[Sopot Festival]].\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Art in Poland|Young Poland|List of Polish artists}}\n[[File:The Lady with an Ermine.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' (1490) by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

[[Romanesque architecture]] is represented by [[St. Andrew's Church, Krak\u00f3w]], and [[St. Mary's Church, Gda\u0144sk]], is characteristic for the [[Brick Gothic]] style found in Poland. Richly decorated [[attic style|attics]] and [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] [[loggia]]s are the common elements of the Polish Renaissance architecture,<ref name=\"szydlowiec\" /><ref name=\"RENAISSANCE CULTURAL BACKGROUND\" /> as evident in the [[Pozna\u0144 City Hall|City Hall]] in Pozna\u0144. For some time the late renaissance style known as [[mannerism]], most notably in the [[Cracow Bishops' Palace in Kielce|Bishop's Palace]] in [[Kielce]], coexisted with the early baroque style, typified in the [[Saints Peter and Paul Church, Krak\u00f3w|Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Krak\u00f3w]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | image1 = St Mary's Krakow.jpg\n | width1 = 161\n | alt1 = Saint Mary's Church in Krak\u00f3w\n | caption1 = [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|St. Mary's Basilica]] on the [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Market Square]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]] is an example of [[Brick Gothic]] architecture.\n | image2 = Ayuntamiento, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 67-72 HDR.jpg \n | width2 = 140\n | alt2 = Pozna\u0144 City Hall\n | caption2 = [[Ratusz]], the 16th-century [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] City Hall in [[Pozna\u0144]] designed by Italian architects\n}}\n\nHistory has not been kind to Poland's architectural monuments. Nonetheless, a number of ancient structures has survived: castles, churches, and stately homes, often unique in the regional or European context. Some of them have been painstakingly restored, like [[Wawel Castle]], or completely reconstructed, including the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]] and [[Royal Castle in Warsaw|Royal Castle]] of Warsaw and the Old Town of [[Gda\u0144sk]].\n\nThe architecture of Gda\u0144sk is mostly of the Hanseatic variety, a Gothic style common among the former trading cities along the Baltic sea and in the northern part of Central Europe. The architectural style of [[Wroc\u0142aw]] is mainly representative of German architecture, since it was for centuries located within the Holy Roman Empire. The centres of [[Kazimierz Dolny]] and [[Sandomierz]] on the [[Vistula]] are good examples of well-preserved medieval towns. Poland's ancient capital, [[Krak\u00f3w]], ranks among the best-preserved [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and Renaissance urban complexes in Europe.\n\nThe second half of the 17th century is marked by [[baroque]] architecture. Side towers, such as those of [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki Palace]] in Bia\u0142ystok, are typical for the Polish baroque. The classical [[Silesian architecture|Silesian baroque]] is represented by the University in Wroc\u0142aw. The profuse decorations of the [[Branicki Palace, Warsaw|Branicki Palace]] in Warsaw are characteristic of the [[rococo]] style. The centre of Polish classicism was Warsaw under the rule of the last Polish king [[Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stanley|first=John|year=2004|title=Reviewed Work: Literary Activities and Attitudes in the Stanislavian Age in Poland (1764\u20131795): A Social System? by Jan I.J. van der Meer|journal=Canadian Slavonic Papers|volume=46|issue=1/2|pages=226\u2013229|jstor=40870954}}</ref>\nThe [[\u0141azienki Palace|Palace on the Water]] is the most notable example of Polish [[neoclassical architecture]].

It is a project of the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]], in collaboration with (since 1971) [[Boston University]].<ref name=\"Mahmood, Levy, Vasan, Wang 2013 61752\u20133\"/>  Various health professionals from the hospitals and universities of [[Greater Boston]] staff the project.\n\n==History==\nIn 1948, the study was commissioned by Congress, with a choice made between Framingham, Massachusetts and [[Paintsville, Kentucky]]. Framingham was chosen when residents showed more general interest in heart research than Paintsville. Thomas Royle Dawber was Director of the study from 1949 to 1966. He was appointed as chief epidemiologist shortly after the start of the project, when it was not progressing well.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Richmond | title=Obituary: Thomas Royle Dawber | journal=BMJ | year=2006 | volume=332 | pages=122 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/332/7533/122 | format=fee required | doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7533.122 | issue=7533| pmc=1326951 }}</ref>\nThe study had been intended to last 20 years; however, interest grew in part due to Dr. Dawber's efforts to promote the study and engage in fundraising after he had been transferred to Boston to accept a chairmanship of preventive medicine. \nBy 1968, it was debated whether the original study had served its purpose and should be terminated as scheduled. A committee gathered and considered that, after 20 years of research, the Framingham study should come to an end, since their hypothesis had been tested and extensive information concerning heart diseases had been gathered. Despite this conclusion, Congress failed to accept the recommendation, instead voting to continue the study. \nThe study has been split into different segments, or \"cohorts\".\n*The Original Cohort, founded in 1948, consisted of 5,209 men and women. Requirements for entry were an age between 30 and 62 years at the time of first examination, with no history of heart attack or stroke. Due to lukewarm interest at first, doctors, nurses and healthcare workers volunteered for the study to set an example for patients.\n*The Offspring Cohort, founded in 1971, was a second generation study for which children of the Original Cohort were eligible. Spouses were also eligible if they had become pregnant with or sired two or more children by a participant in the Offspring Cohort.\n*The Omni One Cohort, founded in 1994, looked at the possible influence of race and heritage as heart risk factors, as well as the changing racial background of Framingham.\n*The Generation Three Cohort, founded in 2002, was a third generation study consisting of children of the Offspring Cohort and grandchildren of the Original Cohort participants. Minimum age for acceptance was 20 years.\n*The Omni Two Cohort, founded in 2003, was a second generation study involving children of Omni Cohort participants. While the Original Cohort had been spaced over decades, the Omni Cohort had a much shorter generational window. On account of this, participants as young as 13 years of age were eligible for the Omni Two Cohort.\n\n==Strengths and weaknesses==\nOver 3,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers have been published related to the Framingham Heart Study. It is generally accepted that the work is outstanding in its scope and duration, and overall is considered very useful.\n\nIt was rightly assumed from the start of the Framingham Heart Study that cardiac health can be influenced by lifestyle and environmental factors, and by inheritance. The Framingham Heart Study is the source of the term ''[[risk factor]]''. Before the Framingham Heart Study, doctors had little sense of heart disease prevention. In the 1950s, it was believed that clogging of arteries and narrowing of arteries ([[atherosclerosis]], [[arteriosclerosis]]) were normal parts of aging, and that they occurred universally as people became older. High blood pressure ([[hypertension]]) and elevated serum cholesterol ([[hypercholesterolemia]]) were also seen as normal consequences of aging in the 1950s, and no treatment was available. These and further risk factors, such as [[homocysteine]], were gradually discovered over the years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kannel WB | date = Feb 1976 | title = Some lessons in cardiovascular epidemiology from Framingham | url = | journal = Am J Cardiol | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 269\u201382 | doi=10.1016/0002-9149(76)90323-4| pmid = 1246956 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lloyd-Jones DM, O'Donnell CJ, D'Agostino RB, Massaro J, Silbershatz H, Wilson PW | date = Apr 2001 | title = Applicability of cholesterol-lowering primary prevention trials to a general population: the Framingham Heart Study | url = | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 161 | issue = 7| pages = 949\u201354 | doi=10.1001/archinte.161.7.949| pmid = 11295957 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sundstr\u00f6m J, Vasan RS | year = 2005 | title = Homocysteine and heart failure: a review of investigations from the Framingham Heart Study | url = | journal = Clin Chem Lab Med | volume = 43 | issue = 10| pages = 987\u201392 | doi=10.1515/cclm.2005.173| pmid = 16197286 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Donnell CJ, Elosua R | date = Mar 2008 | title = Cardiovascular risk factors.

Increased cholesterol and elevated blood pressure increase risk of heart disease. Exercise decreases risk of heart disease, and obesity increases it.\n;1970s: Elevated blood pressure increases risk of stroke. In women who are postmenopausal, risk of heart disease is increased, compared with women who are premenopausal. [[Psychosocial]] factors affect risk of heart disease.\n;1980s: High levels of [[HDL cholesterol]] reduce risk of heart disease. No empirical evidence found to confirm the rumor that filtered cigarettes lower risk of heart disease as opposed to non-filters.\n;1990s: Having an enlarged left ventricle of the heart ([[left ventricular hypertrophy]]) increases risk of stroke. Elevated blood pressure can progress to heart failure. Framingham Risk Score is published, and correctly predicts 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) events.

Lifetime risk of developing elevated blood pressure is 90%. Obesity is a risk factor for heart failure. Serum [[aldosterone]] levels predict risk of elevated blood pressure. Lifetime risk for obesity is approximately 50%. The \"SHARe\" project is announced, a [[genome]] wide association study within the Framingham Heart Study.

It is a project of the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]], in collaboration with (since 1971) [[Boston University]].<ref name=\"Mahmood, Levy, Vasan, Wang 2013 61752\u20133\"/>  Various health professionals from the hospitals and universities of [[Greater Boston]] staff the project.\n\n==History==\nIn 1948, the study was commissioned by Congress, with a choice made between Framingham, Massachusetts and [[Paintsville, Kentucky]]. Framingham was chosen when residents showed more general interest in heart research than Paintsville. Thomas Royle Dawber was Director of the study from 1949 to 1966. He was appointed as chief epidemiologist shortly after the start of the project, when it was not progressing well.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Richmond | title=Obituary: Thomas Royle Dawber | journal=BMJ | year=2006 | volume=332 | pages=122 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/332/7533/122 | format=fee required | doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7533.122 | issue=7533| pmc=1326951 }}</ref>\nThe study had been intended to last 20 years; however, interest grew in part due to Dr. Dawber's efforts to promote the study and engage in fundraising after he had been transferred to Boston to accept a chairmanship of preventive medicine. \nBy 1968, it was debated whether the original study had served its purpose and should be terminated as scheduled. A committee gathered and considered that, after 20 years of research, the Framingham study should come to an end, since their hypothesis had been tested and extensive information concerning heart diseases had been gathered. Despite this conclusion, Congress failed to accept the recommendation, instead voting to continue the study. \nThe study has been split into different segments, or \"cohorts\".\n*The Original Cohort, founded in 1948, consisted of 5,209 men and women. Requirements for entry were an age between 30 and 62 years at the time of first examination, with no history of heart attack or stroke. Due to lukewarm interest at first, doctors, nurses and healthcare workers volunteered for the study to set an example for patients.\n*The Offspring Cohort, founded in 1971, was a second generation study for which children of the Original Cohort were eligible. Spouses were also eligible if they had become pregnant with or sired two or more children by a participant in the Offspring Cohort.\n*The Omni One Cohort, founded in 1994, looked at the possible influence of race and heritage as heart risk factors, as well as the changing racial background of Framingham.\n*The Generation Three Cohort, founded in 2002, was a third generation study consisting of children of the Offspring Cohort and grandchildren of the Original Cohort participants. Minimum age for acceptance was 20 years.\n*The Omni Two Cohort, founded in 2003, was a second generation study involving children of Omni Cohort participants. While the Original Cohort had been spaced over decades, the Omni Cohort had a much shorter generational window. On account of this, participants as young as 13 years of age were eligible for the Omni Two Cohort.\n\n==Strengths and weaknesses==\nOver 3,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers have been published related to the Framingham Heart Study. It is generally accepted that the work is outstanding in its scope and duration, and overall is considered very useful.\n\nIt was rightly assumed from the start of the Framingham Heart Study that cardiac health can be influenced by lifestyle and environmental factors, and by inheritance. The Framingham Heart Study is the source of the term ''[[risk factor]]''. Before the Framingham Heart Study, doctors had little sense of heart disease prevention. In the 1950s, it was believed that clogging of arteries and narrowing of arteries ([[atherosclerosis]], [[arteriosclerosis]]) were normal parts of aging, and that they occurred universally as people became older. High blood pressure ([[hypertension]]) and elevated serum cholesterol ([[hypercholesterolemia]]) were also seen as normal consequences of aging in the 1950s, and no treatment was available. These and further risk factors, such as [[homocysteine]], were gradually discovered over the years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kannel WB | date = Feb 1976 | title = Some lessons in cardiovascular epidemiology from Framingham | url = | journal = Am J Cardiol | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 269\u201382 | doi=10.1016/0002-9149(76)90323-4| pmid = 1246956 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lloyd-Jones DM, O'Donnell CJ, D'Agostino RB, Massaro J, Silbershatz H, Wilson PW | date = Apr 2001 | title = Applicability of cholesterol-lowering primary prevention trials to a general population: the Framingham Heart Study | url = | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 161 | issue = 7| pages = 949\u201354 | doi=10.1001/archinte.161.7.949| pmid = 11295957 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sundstr\u00f6m J, Vasan RS | year = 2005 | title = Homocysteine and heart failure: a review of investigations from the Framingham Heart Study | url = | journal = Clin Chem Lab Med | volume = 43 | issue = 10| pages = 987\u201392 | doi=10.1515/cclm.2005.173| pmid = 16197286 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Donnell CJ, Elosua R | date = Mar 2008 | title = Cardiovascular risk factors.

Some of these genes include important virulence factors.<ref>Steen JA, Steen JA, Harrison P, Seemann T, Wilkie I, et al. (2010) Fis Is Essential for Capsule Production in Pasteurella multocida and Regulates Expression\nof Other Important Virulence Factors. PLoS Pathog 6(2): e1000750. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000750</ref>\n\n== Role of Fis in bacterial motility ==\n\nThe role of fis is well studied in E. coli, but its role in [[pseudomonads]] has only been examined briefly. Recent studies in [[Enterobacteriaceae]] have shown that ''fis'' positively regulates the flagellar movement of bacteria. Observations in ''Pseudomonas putida'' demonstrate ''fis'' reduced the migration of ''P. putida'' onto the apices of barley roots and thereby the competitiveness of bacteria on the roots. It was also observed that the overexpression of ''fis'' drastically reducing swimming motility and facilitated the formation of P. putida biofilm. It is possible that the elevated expression of Fis is important in the adaptation of P. putida during colonization of plant roots by promoting biofilm formation when the migration of bacteria is no longer advantageous.<ref>Jakovleva, Julia, et al. \"Fis regulates the competitiveness of Pseudomonas putida on barley roots by inducing biofilm formation.\" Microbiology 158.Pt 3 (2012): 708-720.</ref>\n\nIt was demonstrated that Fis is essential for the stability of the linear [[plasmid]] [[pBSSB1]] and affects the motility of\n[[S. Typhi]].<ref>Zhang, Haifang, et al. \"Fis Is Essential for the Stability of Linear Plasmid pBSSB1 and Affects the Motility of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhi.\" PLoS ONE 7.7 (2012): e37462.</ref>\n\nFis buffers decrease of negative supercoiling in [[TyrT operon|tyrT]] and rrnA expression. The upstream FIS binding site of rrnA is required for this and it's probable that FIS enables local DNA curvature.
