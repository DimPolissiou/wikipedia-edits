The venue opened on 16 December 2008, and was known as the O<sub>2</sub> until 4 September 2014, when it was rebranded as the 3Arena, due to the takeover of the telecommunications company [[O2 (Ireland)|O2 Ireland]] by [[Three Ireland]].\n\nSince opening the venue has been host to some of the world's best known music, comedy, and other acts.

It was built on the site of the former [[Point Theatre]], a smaller music venue which operated from 1988 to 2007, retaining only some of the outer facade preserved from its original role as a railway goods handling station. The venue opened on 16 December 2008, and was known as the O<sub>2</sub> until 4 September 2014, when it was rebranded as the 3Arena, due to the takeover of the telecommunications company [[O2 (Ireland)|O2 Ireland]] by [[Three Ireland]].\n\nSince opening the venue has been host to some of the world's best known music, comedy, and other acts.

The club's first chairman, Pepi Popp, designed the still unchanged FC 05 crest.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> \n\nThe new team played in various local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. The home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], the later venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1.

FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later, and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]].

FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). \nSchweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2.

Bundesliga, but was not able to keep pace in the new league. \nIn 2001, Schweinfurt qualified for promotion to 2. Bundesliga after finishing 3rd in [[2000\u201301 Regionalliga|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. \nDespite of a decent first half of the tier-two season, the team finally could not avoid relegation after one year.\nThe club made it into the last sixteen of the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled, and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\n\n===Recent years: 2016\u2013today===\n[[File:2018-08-17 1.

With promotion to Gauliga Bayern in 1933, however, the existing venue proved to be more and more inadequate.\n\nThe club's necessity finally motivated local industrialist [[Willy Sachs]] to the donation of a football stadium to the City of [[Schweinfurt]], where the patron designated a privileged right of use for FC Schweinfurt 05. The new [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]],<ref name=\"Willy Sachs Stadion\"/> built by German architect [[Paul Bonatz]], was opened on 23 July 1936 in the presence of leading politicians of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Cicero\"/> The stadium saw its first game three days later with a 2\u20132 draw between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1935 German football championship|1935]] German champion [[FC Schalke 04]].<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> Attandance record was 22,500 at a friendly between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1.

Besides the football field, the stadium offers [[track and field]] facilities, and is equipped with a classical [[Marathon]] gate. Premises at the stadium include changing rooms for players, coaches, and referees. Speaker cabins and a press area are available in the grandstand.\n\nThe stadium has been renovated and equipped with [[floodlights]] in 2001 in order to meet the requirements for [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2. Bundesliga]]. In addition, an electronic [[scoreboard]] was contributed by Schweinfurt's [[Ball bearing|large]] industry.

Built in the \"retro-classic\" style modeled after past venues like Pittsburgh's [[Forbes Field]], PNC Park also introduced unique features, such as the use of [[limestone]] in the building's facade.<ref name=\"official\"/> The park also features a riverside concourse, steel truss work, an extensive out-of-town scoreboard, and local eateries. Several tributes to former Pirate [[Roberto Clemente]] were incorporated into the ballpark, which included renaming the [[Roberto Clemente Bridge|Sixth Street Bridge]] behind it in his honor. In addition to Pirates regular season and postseason home games, PNC Park has hosted other sporting events, including the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], and numerous concerts.\n\nPNC Park is widely considered one of the best ballparks in America because of its location, views of the Pittsburgh skyline and Allegheny River, timeless design, and clear angles of the field from every seat.<ref name=\"kdka15\">[https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2015/07/27/pnc-park-voted-best-ballpark-in-america-by-fans/ PNC Park Voted Best Ballpark In America By Fans]</ref><ref name=\"wapo2017\">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/sports/how-many-mlb-parks-have-you-visited/ How many ballparks have you visited?

Funded in conjunction with [[Heinz Field]] and the [[David L. Lawrence Convention Center]], the park was constructed for $216&nbsp;million over a 24-month span, faster than most modern stadiums. Built in the \"retro-classic\" style modeled after past venues like Pittsburgh's [[Forbes Field]], PNC Park also introduced unique features, such as the use of [[limestone]] in the building's facade.<ref name=\"official\"/> The park also features a riverside concourse, steel truss work, an extensive out-of-town scoreboard, and local eateries. Several tributes to former Pirate [[Roberto Clemente]] were incorporated into the ballpark, which included renaming the [[Roberto Clemente Bridge|Sixth Street Bridge]] behind it in his honor. In addition to Pirates regular season and postseason home games, PNC Park has hosted other sporting events, including the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], and numerous concerts.\n\nPNC Park is widely considered one of the best ballparks in America because of its location, views of the Pittsburgh skyline and Allegheny River, timeless design, and clear angles of the field from every seat.<ref name=\"kdka15\">[https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2015/07/27/pnc-park-voted-best-ballpark-in-america-by-fans/ PNC Park Voted Best Ballpark In America By Fans]</ref><ref name=\"wapo2017\">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/sports/how-many-mlb-parks-have-you-visited/ How many ballparks have you visited?
