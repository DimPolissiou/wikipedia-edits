Of all his wealth, he retained only two gold rings each with a gem larger than an acorn, a mare, a brave female dog capable to attack even the dragons, and a vegetable garden, where he lived with his wife. He used to spend the days hoeing the earth, his wife spinning linen and wool. However they were happy in the quiet of the fields and in the tranquility of a solitary life. The only thing missing them was a son.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=426}}\n\nOne morning the king went to the seashore and caught a big red fish, who, before dying, said to him:\n{{Cquote|Divide me into four pieces, the part that is on the side of the head you will give it to your wife, the middle part you will eat it, from the part of the tail you will give a piece to the mare and another to the dog, you will plant the thorns in the garden.}}\n\nThe king fulfilled the instructions of the fish. Time passed and his wife gave birth to two male twins, Zjerma{{efn|The term ''zjerma'' is the archaic form of Albanian ''zjarm'', which means \"fire\".{{sfn|Demiraj|1997|p=47}}}} and Handa,{{efn|The term ''handa'' is the archaic form of Albanian ''hana'', which means \"moon\".{{sfn|Demiraj|1997|p=20}}}} the one with the sun and the other with the moon in their forehead; while the mare gave birth to two foals, the dog to two puppies, and two silver swords appeared in the garden. The mother raised her twins with care, and the father taught them to ride even without a saddle, to use the spear and the bow, the sword and the dagger, and to hunt in the mountains and forests.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=427}}\n\n===King's death and Twins' departure===\nWhen the twins became nineteen, the old man fell ill and realized he was joined by the black [[ora (mythology)|ora]]. He called his sons in front of the bed, he recommended them never to forget that in their veins pure king's blood flowed, to love each other as they had done until that day, to take care of their old mother, and to leave a good name, doing good to everyone, wherever they happened to pass. Before dying he gave each of them one of his gold [[Magic ring|rings]]. They buried him with all his weapons and [[Vajtim|mourned]] him for nine days and for nine nights. The queen suffered a lot for her husband's death, but she was comforted by her two sons. So she went back to spinning linen and wool all day. A farmer started to work in the garden, while his wife took care of the housework.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=427\u2013428}}\n\nAfter a year, the twins got bored, and Zjerma pointed out to Handa that they were still in the flower of their youth and that they had royal blood in their hearts, that the world is wide and that they were able to travel it from all sides, in order to gain fame and conquer some kingdom, to rise again in the high glory of their ancestors. So he proposed to gird their silver swords, to mount on their steeds, to take with them the two dogs who were not afraid to attack even the dragons, and to depart. As for their mother, although old, she was healthy and there was already someone who could help her. Handa accepted his brother's proposal, so the two said goodbye to the mother and left with the horses and the dogs.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}}\n\nOn their journey they came to a source that was at the foot of a flowering almond tree, where the road split. There they decided to separate and follow their own destiny, according to the choice of the horses, [[Besa (Albanian culture)|swearing]] to be in that place every year on the same day. In the event that one of the two had found himself in danger and had thus needed the help of the other, the gem of the ring would have lost its radiance, darkening and eventually becoming completely black, so the other would have rushed to the rescue. The two brothers hug each other, subsequently the horse of Zjerma went towards the way on the right and that of Handa towards the other on the left.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}}\n\n===Zjerma's journey===\nAfter a few days, Zjerma arrived in a city where he noticed that all the streets were empy and the houses were closed. At some point he arrived in front of the great temple of the Sun, where he saw an old man crying, thus Zjerma asked him for informations about that mysterious situation.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}} The old man answered that the [[kulshedra]] appeared about a month before at the sources of the river and blocked the waters causing drought in the region. All the valiant heroes who tried to slay the monster were defeated and perished. So the elders suggested to the king to find an agreement with the monster if she was willing to release the waters. She accepted only on the condition of receiving daily the offering of one of the most beautiful virgins. The old man told Zjerma that his daughter was sent the day before, while king's daughter Bardhakuqja (\"Whitered\") was sent that day, and the king had promised his daughter in marriage to whatever man succeeded in slaying the dragon.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}}\n\nZjerma then promised the old man that he would avenge his daughter and departed immediately with his animal companions.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}} The hero soon reached a dark valley, in the midst of high mountains, where the head of the river consisted of a deep and wide abyss, at the bottom of which the monster lived. There the wretched virgin was tied to a boulder, almost lifeless. Seeing the princess, still radiant in her great beauty, Zjerma felt all his blood stirring in his veins. Her big blue eyes saw Zjerma, and immediately she told him to go away to save his life. But the hero was there to save her and free the city, thus he dismounted and freed the princess. Because he was very tired, he wanted to rest holding his head on her knees before the arrival of the monster, so he lay down on the ground and soon fell asleep.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}}\n\n====Dragon slayer====\nAt noon the water began to move and the beauty realized that the [[kulshedra]] was about to come out, however she did not have the courage to wake Zjerma up, and began to cry, but a tear woke him up. Zjerma mounted his horse and brandished the silver sword, waiting for the monster. The water was boiling and from its waves the seven heads of the kulshedra emerged, of which, the central one was horned and with a seven-pointed crown. Poison was flowing between her teeth and forked tongues were hissing, while her mouths were spitting fire. When the kulshedra jumped to the ground Zjerma saw that her body was similar to that of a giant lizard, but equipped with a segmented armor, made of bone hard as steel. In the back there was a serpentine tail with nine knots and covered with hard scales. Her legs were short, but large and robust, with curved claws as hard as iron. On her back she had a kind of fish fin that dilated and narrowed by means of certain mobile antennas that ended like boar tusks. She had wings like those of a bat, but nine times larger than those of a large hawk.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=430}}\n\nWhen the kulshedra was about to pounce, Zjerma attacked her together with the horse and went up to the monster, while the dog bit her behind. The kulshedra writhed spitting flames and hissing from her mouths, striving to bite the enemies and crush them with her tail, but the horse trampled on her with its paws denting the bony armor and breaking the scales that protected her body, while the hero uninterruptedly wounded her with the sword, cutting off her heads, in vain because they leapt from the ground and sticked to the bloody necks again. He realized that he would have to cut off her central head to kill her. Meanwhile, a thick black cloud covered the valley, full of thunders and lightning.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=430}} Finally Zjerma's sword struck and cut off the central head, and a torrent of boiling black blood erupted along with flames from the neck, accompanied by a very loud screech.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=431}}\n\n==Classification==\nThe tale is [[Aarne\u2013Thompson]] type 303, \"The Twins or Blood Brothers\" including also the ATU type 300, \"The Dragon Slayer\".

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified.|Asimov, 1980<ref>{{Cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt|last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon |year=1980 |location= New York|pages= 286-287}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

His father bought Asimov a used typewriter at age 16.{{r|nichols19690803}} His first published work was a humorous item on the birth of his brother for Boys High School's literary journal in 1934. In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 12\u201313, 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one-third of the way down the first column of page 100, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1942 printing of his short story \"[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Gold |publisher=Voyager <!-- was Eos --> |date=1996 <!-- was 2003 --> |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=0-00-648202-3 |pages=224\u2013225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Counting the Eons |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |date=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented ... the word|title-link=Counting the Eons }}</ref>\n\nIn the same story, Asimov also coined the term \"positronic\" (the counterpart to \"electronic\" for [[positron]]s).<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/positronic Oxford Dictionary website] entry for \"positronic\"</ref>\n\nAsimov coined the term \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" in his [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[mathematical statistics]] to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]. Asimov said later that he should have called it psychosociology. It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942\u20131944) which would later be collected as the 1951 [[fix-up]] novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Psychohistory |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=4\u20138 |publisher=Davis Publications |date=July 1988 |issn=0162-2188}}</ref> Somewhat later, the term \"[[psychohistory]]\" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.\n\n=== Other writings ===\nIn addition to his interest in science, Asimov was interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Egyptians'' (1967)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968),\n<ref>{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of the World]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite book |title=Asimov's Chronology of the World |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1991 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nHe published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes\u2014covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969\u2014and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970),{{efn|Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (1980), pp. 464\u2013465: \"Of all the books I have ever worked on, I think ''Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare'' gave me the most pleasure, day in, day out. For months and months I lived and thought Shakespeare, and I don't see how there can be any greater pleasure in the world\u2014any pleasure, that is, that one can indulge in for as much as ten hours without pause, day after day indefinitely.\"}} ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980).<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 112</ref>\n\nAsimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\">{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\">{{cite book|title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/asimovlaughsagai00isaa }}</ref>\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by \"J\") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by \"M\"), Asimov published ''[[The Sensuous Dirty Old Man]]'' under the byline \"Dr. 'A{{'\"}}<ref>''In Joy Still Felt'' p. 569</ref> (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972). However, by 2016, some of Asimov's behavior towards women was described as [[sexual harassment]] and cited as an example of historically problematic behavior by men in science fiction communities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dont-look-away-fighting-sexual-harassment-in-the-scifi-1785704207|title=Don't Look Away: Fighting Sexual Harassment in the Scifi/Fantasy Community|last=Hines|first=Jim C.|date=August 29, 2016|work=io9|access-date=December 18, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAsimov published [[Autobiographies of Isaac Asimov|three volumes of autobiography]].

The epilogue was written by his widow [[Janet Asimov]] after his death.

In it they offer advice on how to maintain a positive attitude and stay productive when dealing with discouragement, distractions, rejection, and thick-headed editors. The book includes many quotations, essays, anecdotes, and husband-wife dialogues about the ups and downs of being an author.<ref>{{cite book|title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |last=Asimov |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Asimov |last2=Asimov |first2=Isaac |date=1987 |publisher=Walker & Co. |location=New York |isbn=0-8027-0945-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/howtoenjoywritin00asim_0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book362.html |title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |publisher=John H.

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A\u2013D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., \"D-73\" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter). An extra 'year day' is added for a total of 365 days.<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |chapter=The Week Excuse |title=The Tragedy of the Moon |pages=48\u201358 |publisher=Doubleday and Co |date=1973 |isbn=0-440-18999-3|title-link=The Tragedy of the Moon }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nAsimov won more than a dozen annual awards for particular works of science fiction and a half dozen lifetime awards.<ref name=SFAwards>[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html#179 \"Asimov, Isaac\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016200502/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html |date=October 16, 2012 }}.

(Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories). Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920\u20131954''. Doubleday, 1979.</ref> versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.</ref>\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied,\n\n{{quote|I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign. Asimov was dismayed over the pardon extended to Nixon by [[Gerald Ford|his successor]]: \"I was not impressed by the argument that it has spared the nation an ordeal.

In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing.

Asimov: A Memoir'' p. 246</ref> Asimov disapproved of the [[New Wave science fiction|New Wave]]'s growing influence, however, stating in 1967 \"I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model. In my opinion, her mysteries are the best ever written, far better than the Sherlock Holmes stories, and [[Hercule Poirot]] is the best detective fiction has seen. Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best?\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 379</ref> He enjoyed Sherlock Holmes, but considered [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to be \"a slapdash and sloppy writer.\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 391</ref>\n\nAsimov also enjoyed humorous stories, particularly those of [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref>Asimov (1979) ''In Memory Yet Green'' p. 90</ref>\n\nIn non-fiction writing, Asimov particularly admired the writing style of [[Martin Gardner]], and tried to emulate it in his own science books. On meeting Gardner for the first time in 1965, Asimov told him this, to which Gardner answered that he had based his own style on Asimov's.<ref>Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1980) p. 369</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n[[Paul Krugman]], holder of a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]], has stated Asimov's concept of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] inspired him to become an economist.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/who-are-you-calling-dense/ |title=The Conscience of a Liberal, 'Who Are You Calling Dense?' |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |last=Krugman |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Krugman |work=The New York Times |date=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nJohn Jenkins, who has reviewed the vast majority of Asimov's written output, once observed, \"It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the 1950s have been affected by Asimov, either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/NonAsimov/White.html |title=Review of an Asimov biography, 'The Unauthorized Life' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> Along with such figures as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Karl Popper]], Asimov left his mark as one of the most distinguished [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinarians]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|title=Ten Cheers for Interdisciplinarity: The Case for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Research|url=http://drnissani.net/mnissani/pagepub/10CHEERS.HTM|journal=Social Science Journal |date=1997 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=201\u2013216 |doi=10.1016/s0362-3319(97)90051-3}}</ref> \"Few individuals\", writes [[Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering|James L.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified.|Asimov, 1980<ref>{{Cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt|last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon |year=1980 |location= New York|pages= 286-287}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

His father bought Asimov a used typewriter at age 16.{{r|nichols19690803}} His first published work was a humorous item on the birth of his brother for Boys High School's literary journal in 1934. In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 12\u201313, 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a [[Frankenstein]] plot in which they destroyed their creators.\n\nThe robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made\". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994.

Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters.

He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]].

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine.

Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar.

(Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories). Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8.

I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign.

In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing.

I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model.

The degree of regulation varies widely by country. Most of these countries allow brothels, at least in theory, as they are considered to be less problematic than [[street prostitution]]. In parts of [[Australia]], for example, brothels are legal and regulated. Regulation includes planning controls and licensing and registration requirements, and there may be other restrictions.

The first group performed only in the temple sex-rites; the second group had the run of the grounds and catered to its visitors as well; and the third and lowest class lived on the temple grounds but were free to seek out customers in the streets. In later years, [[sacred prostitution]] and similar classifications of females were known to have existed in Greece, Rome, India, China, and Japan.{{sfn|Murphy|1983| }}\n\n===Europe===\nState brothels/bordellos with regulated prices existed in ancient [[Athens]], created by the legendary lawmaker [[Solon]]. These brothels catered for a predominantly male clientele, with women of all ages and young men providing sexual services (see [[Prostitution in ancient Greece]]). In ancient Rome female slaves provided sexual services for soldiers, with brothels being located close to barracks and city walls. Brothels existed everywhere. The custom was to display lit candles to signal that they were open.\n\nBefore the appearance of effective [[contraception]], [[infanticide]] was common in brothels. Unlike usual infanticide&mdash;where historically girls were more likely to be killed at birth&mdash; a brothel site at Ashkelon in Israel revealed that nearly all of the babies were boys.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14401305 ''Roman dead baby 'brothel' mystery deepens''], BBC</ref>\n\n[[File:1537 Braunschweiger Monogrammist Bordellszene anagoria.JPG|thumb|left|Brothel scene; [[Brunswick Monogrammist]], 1537; [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin]]]]\nCities first began setting up municipal brothels between 1350 and 1450 CE.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Timeline--Prostitution|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000117|work=Should prostitution be legal?|publisher=ProCon.org|accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> Municipalities often owned, operated, and regulated the legal brothels.

Not only did the towns restrict where a keeper could open a brothel, but they also put constraints on when the brothel could be open. For example, most brothels were forbidden to be open for business on Sunday and religious holidays. The reason for this is not completely clear. Some scholars believe these restrictions were enforced to make the prostitutes go to church but others argue that it was to keep parishioners in church and out of the brothels. Either way, it was a day of no revenue for the keeper.\n\nAlthough brothels were set up as a sexual outlet for men, not all men were allowed to enter them. Clerics, married men, and Jews were prohibited.{{sfn|Bennett|1989|pp=100\u2013134}} Often, foreigners such as sailors and traders were the main source of revenue. Local men who frequented the brothels mainly consisted of single men; laws restricting the patrons were not always enforced. Government officials or police would periodically do searches of the brothels to cut down on the number of unpermitted customers. However, since the government was so closely related to the church, common punishments were minor. These restrictions were put in place to protect the wives of married men from any sort of infection.\n\n[[File:William Hogarth - A Rake's Progress - Tavern Scene.jpg|right|thumb|The Brothel Scene from ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' by [[William Hogarth]], 1735]]\nMultiple restrictions were placed on the residents of brothels. One limitation prohibited prostitutes from borrowing money from her brothel keeper. Prostitutes paid high prices to the brothel keeper for the basic necessities of life: room and board, food, clothes, and toiletries. Room and board was often a price set by the local government but the price for everything else could add up to a common woman's entire earnings. Prostitutes were sometimes prohibited from having a special lover. Some regulations put on prostitutes were made to protect their clients. A woman was kicked out if she was found to have a sexually transmitted disease. Also, the prostitutes were not allowed to pull men into the brothel by their clothing, harass them in the street, or detain them over unpaid debts.{{sfn|Karras|1996|pp=32\u201347}} Clothing worn by prostitutes was regulated as well and had to be distinguishable from that of respectable women. In some places, a prostitute had to have a yellow stripe on her clothing while in others red was the differentiating color. Other towns required harlots to don special headdresses or restricted the wardrobe of proper women. All restrictions placed on prostitutes were put in place not only to protect them but nearby citizens as well.\n\nEven with all the regulations placed on legalized brothels and those people associated with the establishments, they were fated to be done away with. Because of a [[syphilis]] epidemic throughout Europe, many brothels were shut down during the end of the Middle Ages.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Brief History of Brothels|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/a-brief-history-of-brothels-523946.html|publisher=The Independent Newspaper|accessdate=23 July 2017|date=21 January 2006}}</ref> This epidemic had been brought on by Spanish and French military pillages after the return of Christopher Columbus from the newly discovered Americas. The church and citizens alike feared that men who frequented brothels would bring the disease home and infect morally upright people.\n\nFrom the 12th century, brothels in London were located in a district known as the [[Liberty of the Clink]]. This area was traditionally under the authority of the [[Bishop of Winchester]], not the civil authorities. From 1161, the bishop was granted the power to license prostitutes and brothels in the district. This gave rise to the slang term ''Winchester Goose'' for a prostitute. Women who worked in these brothels were denied Christian burial and buried in the unconsecrated graveyard known as [[Cross Bones]].\n\n[[File:Arnaldo Dell'Ira (1903-1943) Sala d'aspetto per la casa di M.me B.,1939.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of a luxurious brothel: \"Waiting room in the house of M.me B.\", project by Italian architect [[Arnaldo dell'Ira]], Rome, 1939.]]\n[[File:Interior of a brothel in Naples, Italy 1945 (1) - Five prostitutes waiting for customers.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of a brothel in [[Naples]], Italy, 1945]]\n\nBy the 16th century, the area was also home to many theatres, (including the [[Globe Theatre]], associated with [[William Shakespeare]]), but brothels continued to thrive. A famous London brothel of the time was ''Holland's Leaguer''. Patrons supposedly included [[James I of England]] and his favourite, [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]]. It was located in a street that still bears its name{{sfn|Walford|1878|pp=29-44}} and also inspired the 1631 play, ''[[Holland's Leaguer (play)|Holland's Leaguer]]''. [[Charles I of England]] licensed a number of brothels including the [[Silver Cross Tavern]] in London, which retains its licence to modern day because it was never revoked.\n\nThe authorities of Medieval Paris followed the same path as those in London and attempted to confine prostitution to a particular district. [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (1226\u20131270) designated nine streets in the [[Beaubourg]] [[Historical quarters of Paris|Quartier]] where it would be permitted. In the early part of the 19th century, state-controlled legal brothels (then known as \"''maisons de tol\u00e9rance''\" or \"''maisons closes''\") started to appear in several French cities. By law, they had to be run by a woman (typically a former prostitute) and their external appearance had to be discreet. The ''maisons'' were required to light a red lantern when they were open (from which is derived the term [[red-light district]]) and the prostitutes were only permitted to leave the ''maisons'' on certain days and only if accompanied by its head. By 1810, Paris alone had 180 officially approved brothels.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, some Paris brothels, such as [[le Chabanais]] and [[le Sphinx]], were internationally known for the luxury they provided. The French government sometimes included a visit to the ''Chabanais'' as part of the program for foreign guests of state, disguising it as a ''visit with the President of the Senate'' in the official program.<ref name=sz>Die Sphinx im Freudenhaus, ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 17 August 1996. {{in lang|de}}</ref> The ''Hotel Marigny'', established in 1917 in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris]], was one of several that were well known for catering to gay male clients.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sin city: show celebrates the Paris brothel that was loved by Cary Grant |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/sin-city-show-celebrates-the-paris-brothel-that-was-loved-by-cary-grant-1815759.html |newspaper=The Independent |date= 6 November 2009|accessdate=30 January 2011 |first=Genevieve |last=Roberts}}</ref> Premises suspected of being gay brothels, including the Hotel Marigny, were however subject to frequent police raids,{{sfn|Jackson|2009|p=29}} perhaps indicating less tolerance for them from the authorities.\n\nIn most European countries, brothels were made illegal after World War II. France outlawed brothels in 1946, after a campaign by [[Marthe Richard]]. The backlash against them was in part due to their wartime collaboration with the Germans during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupation of France]]. Twenty-two Paris brothels had been commandeered by the Germans for their exclusive use; some had made a great deal of money by catering for German officers and soldiers.<ref name=daily>Peter Allen, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1175836/Sleeping-enemy-How-horizontal-collaborators-Paris-brothels-enjoyed-golden-age-entertaining-Hitlers-troops.html Sleeping with the enemy: How 'horizontal collaborators' in Paris brothels enjoyed a golden age entertaining Hitler's troops], ''Daily Mail'', 1 May 2009</ref> One brothel in the [[Monmartre]] District of the French capital was part of an escape network for [[prisoner of war|POW]]s and downed airmen.{{sfn|Regan|1992|p=37}}\n\nItaly made brothels illegal in 1959. The 2010s decade has seen the introduction of sex dolls and sexbots on the premises of some brothels.{{sfn|Levy|2007|pp=833-858}}\n\n===East Asia===\nBrothels have been used formally in [[China]] for prostitution and [[entertainment]] since [[Ancient China]] in its [[feudal]] period. For much of China's ancient and imperial history, brothels were owned by wealthy [[merchants]], typically stereotyped as \"madams\", and engaged in business in urban areas such as the Capital city. Prostitutes, or \"[[courtesans]]\" as they were known, were well-dressed and groomed to the proper table and drinking [[manners]](\u79ae). A Chinese prostitute may have been artistic and skilled at practices such as [[dancing]], playing [[musical instruments]], [[singing]] and conversing in [[verse (poetry)|verse]]. Prostitution was not [[outlawed]] in ancient and imperial China (although prostitutes were not considered fit for marriage to men of respectable social ranking) and instead prostitutes hosted in street brothels were popularly placed in the same [[social class]] as female [[artisans]] and regarded as elegant, albeit tainted, beings, most notably courtesans who used similar means to entertain members of [[nobility]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinawhisper.com/top-10-famous-prostitutes-in-chinese-history/|title=The 8 Famous Prostitutes in Chinese History|date=14 April 2013|accessdate=29 September 2016}}</ref> Both young women and men worked as prostitutes in these elaborate brothel settings, though historical records and works of [[literature]] have widely [[Romanticism|romanticized]] the free-flowing, artistic nature of female prostitutes.\n\nThe practice of hosting prostitutes in these elaborate brothels spread to surrounding regions of [[Chinese culture sphere|Chinese cultural influence]], notably in [[Japan]] after the sixth century [[AD]], where prostitutes and courtesans evolved to develop the ''[[Oiran]]'' and ''[[Geisha]]'' entertainment professions. Again, the ''geisha'' of Japan emphasized good table manners, artistic skills, elegant styling and sophisticated, tactical conversational skills. The practice also spread to [[Korea]], where prostitutes evolved into the [[Korean people|Korean]] ''[[kisaeng]]''.\n\n===India===\nThe governments of many Indian [[princely state]]s had regulated [[prostitution in India]] prior to the 1860s. The [[British Raj]] enacted the [[Prostitution in colonial India#Cantonment Act of 1864|Cantonment Act of 1864]] to regulate [[prostitution in colonial India]] as a matter of accepting a necessary evil so that the British soldiers could seek sexual gratification when away from their homes.<ref name=tambe2005>{{cite journal|last=Tambe|first=Ashwini|title=The Elusive Ingenue:A transnational Feminist Analysis of European Prostitution in Colonial Bombay|journal=Gender and Society|volume=19|issue=2|date=19 February 2005|pages=160\u201379|doi=10.1177/0891243204272781}}</ref> The Cantonment Acts regulated and structured prostitution in the British [[military bases]] which provided for about twelve to fifteen Indian women kept in brothels called ''chaklas'' for each regiment of thousand British [[soldier]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-24530198|title=Horrors of India's brothels documented|date=2013-11-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-02|language=en-GB}}</ref> They were licensed by military officials and were allowed to consort with soldiers only.<ref name=bhandari2010>{{cite journal|last=Bhandari|first=Sudhanshu|title=Prostitution in Colonial India|url=http://www.mainstreamweekly.net/article2142.html|accessdate=October 13, 2012|journal=Mainstream Weekly|date=June 19, 2010|volume=XLVIII|number=26}}</ref>\n\nBrothels in India came into life in the early 1920s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.escortgirlgurgaon.com/blog/5-interesting-effects-of-poor-market-conditions-on-indian-escort-industry/#Indian-brothels-history|title=5 Interesting Effects of Poor Market Conditions on Indian Escort Industry\u2014LifeSide|website=www.escortgirlgurgaon.com|access-date=2017-07-27|date=2017-07-22}}</ref> when dance groups in [[Maharashtra]] such as ''Lavani'' and dance-drama performance artists, ''called Tamasha'' artists, functioned as prostitutes. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Rege|first=Sharmila|date=2002|title=Conceptualising Popular Culture: 'Lavani' and 'Powada' in Maharashtra|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4411876|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=37|issue=11|pages=1038\u20131047|issn=0012-9976}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dalitweb.org/?p=2556,%20https://www.dalitweb.org/?p=2556|title=The linked caste slavery of the Kolhatis and the Bedias {{!}} Savari|date=2014-04-28|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Notably, such professions were strongly connected to caste and income levels.<ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" /> Enormous amounts of money earned made the show's organizers move the show to different parts of India such as [[Lucknow]], [[Jaipur]] and [[Kolkata]], giving birth to the modern brothel industry in India.{{Clarify|reason=statement lacks any information about when, where and how much of the details|date=December 2018}}\n\n===United States===\nFrom 1911 to 1913 the [[United States Department of Justice]] undertook the task of collecting information on the numbers of prostitutes in brothels in order to use this information against the much feared \"[[White slavery (prostitution)|White Slave Traffic]]\".{{sfn|Woolston|1969|p=38}}  This effort collected information from 318 cities of 26 Eastern states. It estimated about 100,000 women to be working in brothels at the time, yet some estimated the total number of prostitutes to be as high as 500,000.{{sfn|Woolston|1969|p=39}}\n\nDuring the late nineteenth century, brothels in the United States were no secret. George Kneeland articulated his growing concern about the organized sex business in America well, saying that prostitution had grown into a \"highly commercialized and profitable business that penetrated the deepest recesses of the political, cultural and economic life of the city.\"{{sfn|Kneeland|Davis|1913| }} Brothels were commonly referred to as \"disorderly houses\", and their residents were called by many names, some [[Euphemism|euphemistic]]\u2014e.g., \"abandoned woman\", \"bawd good-time daisy\", \"fallen angel\", \"fille de joie\", \"jeweled bird\", \"lady of the evening\", \"shady lady\", \"soiled dove\", \"wanton woman\", and \"woman of the town\"\u2014and some less kind\u2014e.g., \"hooker\", \"slut\", and \"whore\".{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=5}} As the 19th century went on, prostitution as a profession became more common, rather than just occasionally necessitated soliciting. As a result of these changes, the way prostitution was practiced changed.{{sfn|Walkoitz|1982| }}  Many prostitutes still practiced their trade independently, but the new class of professional prostitutes created a demand for a location to do their regular business, and the brothel served this purpose.{{sfn|Rosen|1983| }}\n \t\nVisitors could easily find disorderly houses by merely opening up the local or statewide directories, such as the 1895 ''Travelers' Guide of Colorado''.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=4}} This 66-page manual helped the interested client decide which brothel was right for him. These manuals did not attract by using euphemistic language, and though bold by standards of the time, were not crude. Some examples read: \"Twenty young ladies engaged nightly to entertain guest\", and \"Strangers cordially welcome\".  In some areas, brothels simply could not be ignored. A nineteenth-century authority describes the city of New Orleans as such: \"The extent of licentiousness and prostitution here is truly appalling and doubtless without a parallel in the whole civilized world. The indulgence and practice is so general and common that men seldom seek to cover up their acts or go in disguise.\"{{sfn|Fernando|1963|p=254}}\n\nThe average house held five to twenty working girls; some higher end brothels also employed staff servants, musicians, and a bouncer. The typical brothel contained several bedrooms, all furnished. Some upscale brothels were much larger; such is the case with that owned by Mary Ann Hall of [[Arlington, Virginia]].{{sfn|Webb|2004|p=26}}  It is described as \"a rather grand house with twenty-five rooms and was enclosed by a brick wall. The interior was elegantly furnished. The principle rooms on the first floor contained large oil paintings, Brussels carpets, red plush 'parlor furniture', \u00e9tag\u00e8res (a shelf for small ornaments), and numerous items of silver plate.\"{{sfn|Milner Associates|loc=Appendix II}}  An archeological dig of the area outside of Mary Ann Hall's estate revealed a high quality of material superior to those in surrounding working-class areas.  This included many champagne bottles and corks, wire cages from such bottles, perfume bottles, high-quality porcelain with gilt edging, along with remnants of exotic foods\u2014coconut shells and berry seeds, bones from beef, fish, and pork indicating that elegant meals were being eaten at this high-class brothel.{{sfn|Milner Associates|pp=111\u2013197}}  These \"five and ten dollar parlor houses\" attracted wealthy men, who used the facilities much as a gentlemen's social club,{{sfn|Rosen|1983|p= 86}} where they made business and political connections, met with associates, and had exquisite dinners with wine, champagne, and women. Brothels were not only for the wealthy.  \"One-dollar houses\" were visited by those of the working class. A 1910 Kansas vice report compares the two: \"A few brothels were equipped with expensive furniture and furnishings including the finest of upholstered chairs, well-done paintings and costly rugs, which others were hovels of repulsive squalor.\"{{sfn|Johnson|1911|p=98}}\n\nWomen joined brothels from all walks of life. The average prostitute was approximately 21,{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=6}} but many were as young as 13 or as old as 50. Typically thought of as an escape for young, poor, troubled women, brothels sometimes attracted those less expected. Trained musicians and singers sometimes were lured into it by their interest in easy money and fun times.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=19}} Some others turned to brothels to get out of their boring, abusive, or otherwise unfulfilling marriages. Although they might be of various classes, ethnicities, and ages, most women who began or joined brothels had a shared goal: quick money.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=6}} Ironically, many found themselves always indebted to their mistresses. Her lack of credit made a prostitute unable to buy items necessary for her trade herself (powder, cosmetics, perfumes, and \"evening wear\") but was forced to buy them through her madam.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=8}}\n\nSome madams, often former prostitutes themselves, rose to become independently wealthy. One was Mary Ann Hall of Arlington, Virginia. Clearly attractive and a good businesswoman, Mary Ann purchased a lot and built a brick house. That would be the location of an upscale brothel for another 40 years, sitting right at the foot of Capitol Hill. Her brothel was very lucrative, and Mary Ann was able to buy multiple slaves and even a summer home. She was responsible for the behavior of her prostitutes, which could prove challenging since drug abuse was common. A large focus for madams was keeping their business transactions discreet and staying on the good side of the law, which they did so by contributing money to charitable organizations, schools, and churches.\n\nDespite those efforts, much of the profit still went to legal fines and fees, since prostitution was largely illegal. Timely payment of these fines could guarantee a madam that her business could continue without fear of being shut down, usually. Brothels were expected to pay significantly higher rent than others.{{sfn|Webb|2004|pp=24\u201333}} Another upscale bordello was the Big Brick in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], built and operated by [[Grace Peixotto]], the daughter of the Rev. Solomon Cohen Peixotto, and the madam of the most infamous brothel in the history of the city.{{sfn|Jones|2006|pp=19\u201323}}\n\nA madam stayed involved in her business. Running a house with so many in it required skill. A brothel required the purchase of regular food and food preparation. A madam had to monitor the cleanliness of the brothel, including the sheets, which had to be changed several times in an evening, and a stock of wines and liquors for clientele. She was the boss of the brothel and so a madam fired and hired servants, maids, and prostitutes. New faces in the brothel were desired by patrons and so madams had to find new women to recruit. Sometimes, that meant taking in a less-than-desired woman but one with youth and good looks. The \"new\" prostitute received training, cosmetics, and clothes from the madam. A prostitute from Kansas City is recorded as saying that she is no match for the \"proper\" behavior and dress required for the famous Ice Palace in Chicago.{{sfn|Rosen|1983|p=87}}\n\nDisorderly houses or any other dwelling used for purposes of selling sex or other lewd acts in the early 20th century were illegal with a few exceptions: the states of Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, and South Carolina. Penalties could range from $1,000 and time in jail, to much smaller fines.{{sfn|Rosen|1983| }}\n\n===Military brothels===\n\nUntil recently, in several armies around the world, mobile brothels were attached to the army as auxiliary units, especially attached to combat units on long-term deployments abroad. Because it is a controversial subject, military brothels and the women who provided sex services in them were often designated with creative [[euphemism]]s. Examples of such jargon are {{lang|fr|la bo\u00eete \u00e0 bonbons}} ({{lang-en|\"the sweet box\"}}), replacing the term \"{{lang|fr|[[bordel militaire de campagne]]}}\". [[France]] used mobile brothels during the [[First World War]], the [[Second World War]] and the [[First Indochina War]] to supply sex services to French soldiers who were facing combat in areas where brothels were unusual, such as at the [[front line]] or in isolated garrisons.<ref>World Association of International Studies [http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 article] retrieved on March 10, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612081843/http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 |date=June 12, 2007 }}</ref>{{sfn|Windrow|2004| }} Brothels were outlawed in France in 1946; but the [[French Foreign Legion]] continued to use mobile brothels until the late 1990s.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], women drawn from throughout the [[Far East]] were forced into [[sexual slavery]] by the occupation armies of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in brothels known as [[Ianjo]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://japanfocus.org/products/details/2373 |title=Japan's 'Comfort Women': It's time for the truth |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-15 |publisher=[[The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109083324/http://japanfocus.org/products/details/2373 |archivedate=January 9, 2009 }}</ref> These women were referred to as \"[[comfort women]]\" (kanji=\u6170\u5b89\u5a66; hiragana=\u3044\u3042\u3093\u3075).

Such situations exist in many parts of the world, but the region most often associated with these policies is [[Prostitution in Asia|Asia]]. When brothels are illegal they may nevertheless operate in the guise of a legitimate business, such as massage parlors, saunas or spas.\n\nIn other places, prostitution itself may be legal, but many activities which surround it (such as operating a brothel, pimping, and soliciting in a public place) are illegal, often making it very difficult for people to engage in prostitution without breaking any law. This is the situation, for example, in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]].\n\nIn a few countries, prostitution and operating a brothel is legal and regulated. The degree of regulation varies widely by country. Most of these countries allow brothels, at least in theory, as they are considered to be less problematic than [[street prostitution]]. In parts of [[Australia]], for example, brothels are legal and regulated. Regulation includes planning controls and licensing and registration requirements, and there may be other restrictions. However, the existence of licensed brothels does not stop illegal brothels from operating.

The 'kakum' or temple was dedicated to the goddess [[Ishtar]] and housed three grades of women. The first group performed only in the temple sex-rites; the second group had the run of the grounds and catered to its visitors as well; and the third and lowest class lived on the temple grounds but were free to seek out customers in the streets. In later years, [[sacred prostitution]] and similar classifications of females were known to have existed in Greece, Rome, India, China, and Japan.{{sfn|Murphy|1983| }}\n\n===Europe===\nState brothels/bordellos with regulated prices existed in ancient [[Athens]], created by the legendary lawmaker [[Solon]]. These brothels catered for a predominantly male clientele, with women of all ages and young men providing sexual services (see [[Prostitution in ancient Greece]]). In ancient Rome female slaves provided sexual services for soldiers, with brothels being located close to barracks and city walls. Brothels existed everywhere. The custom was to display lit candles to signal that they were open.\n\nBefore the appearance of effective [[contraception]], [[infanticide]] was common in brothels. Unlike usual infanticide&mdash;where historically girls were more likely to be killed at birth&mdash; a brothel site at Ashkelon in Israel revealed that nearly all of the babies were boys.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14401305 ''Roman dead baby 'brothel' mystery deepens''], BBC</ref>\n\n[[File:1537 Braunschweiger Monogrammist Bordellszene anagoria.JPG|thumb|left|Brothel scene; [[Brunswick Monogrammist]], 1537; [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin]]]]\nCities first began setting up municipal brothels between 1350 and 1450 CE.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Timeline--Prostitution|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000117|work=Should prostitution be legal?|publisher=ProCon.org|accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> Municipalities often owned, operated, and regulated the legal brothels.

Not only did the towns restrict where a keeper could open a brothel, but they also put constraints on when the brothel could be open. For example, most brothels were forbidden to be open for business on Sunday and religious holidays. The reason for this is not completely clear. Some scholars believe these restrictions were enforced to make the prostitutes go to church but others argue that it was to keep parishioners in church and out of the brothels. Either way, it was a day of no revenue for the keeper.\n\nAlthough brothels were set up as a sexual outlet for men, not all men were allowed to enter them. Clerics, married men, and Jews were prohibited.{{sfn|Bennett|1989|pp=100\u2013134}} Often, foreigners such as sailors and traders were the main source of revenue. Local men who frequented the brothels mainly consisted of single men; laws restricting the patrons were not always enforced. Government officials or police would periodically do searches of the brothels to cut down on the number of unpermitted customers. However, since the government was so closely related to the church, common punishments were minor. These restrictions were put in place to protect the wives of married men from any sort of infection.\n\n[[File:William Hogarth - A Rake's Progress - Tavern Scene.jpg|right|thumb|The Brothel Scene from ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' by [[William Hogarth]], 1735]]\nMultiple restrictions were placed on the residents of brothels. One limitation prohibited prostitutes from borrowing money from her brothel keeper. Prostitutes paid high prices to the brothel keeper for the basic necessities of life: room and board, food, clothes, and toiletries. Room and board was often a price set by the local government but the price for everything else could add up to a common woman's entire earnings. Prostitutes were sometimes prohibited from having a special lover. Some regulations put on prostitutes were made to protect their clients. A woman was kicked out if she was found to have a sexually transmitted disease. Also, the prostitutes were not allowed to pull men into the brothel by their clothing, harass them in the street, or detain them over unpaid debts.{{sfn|Karras|1996|pp=32\u201347}} Clothing worn by prostitutes was regulated as well and had to be distinguishable from that of respectable women. In some places, a prostitute had to have a yellow stripe on her clothing while in others red was the differentiating color. Other towns required harlots to don special headdresses or restricted the wardrobe of proper women. All restrictions placed on prostitutes were put in place not only to protect them but nearby citizens as well.\n\nEven with all the regulations placed on legalized brothels and those people associated with the establishments, they were fated to be done away with. Because of a [[syphilis]] epidemic throughout Europe, many brothels were shut down during the end of the Middle Ages.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Brief History of Brothels|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/a-brief-history-of-brothels-523946.html|publisher=The Independent Newspaper|accessdate=23 July 2017|date=21 January 2006}}</ref> This epidemic had been brought on by Spanish and French military pillages after the return of Christopher Columbus from the newly discovered Americas. The church and citizens alike feared that men who frequented brothels would bring the disease home and infect morally upright people.\n\nFrom the 12th century, brothels in London were located in a district known as the [[Liberty of the Clink]]. This area was traditionally under the authority of the [[Bishop of Winchester]], not the civil authorities. From 1161, the bishop was granted the power to license prostitutes and brothels in the district. This gave rise to the slang term ''Winchester Goose'' for a prostitute. Women who worked in these brothels were denied Christian burial and buried in the unconsecrated graveyard known as [[Cross Bones]].\n\n[[File:Arnaldo Dell'Ira (1903-1943) Sala d'aspetto per la casa di M.me B.,1939.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of a luxurious brothel: \"Waiting room in the house of M.me B.\", project by Italian architect [[Arnaldo dell'Ira]], Rome, 1939.]]\n[[File:Interior of a brothel in Naples, Italy 1945 (1) - Five prostitutes waiting for customers.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of a brothel in [[Naples]], Italy, 1945]]\n\nBy the 16th century, the area was also home to many theatres, (including the [[Globe Theatre]], associated with [[William Shakespeare]]), but brothels continued to thrive. A famous London brothel of the time was ''Holland's Leaguer''. Patrons supposedly included [[James I of England]] and his favourite, [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]]. It was located in a street that still bears its name{{sfn|Walford|1878|pp=29-44}} and also inspired the 1631 play, ''[[Holland's Leaguer (play)|Holland's Leaguer]]''. [[Charles I of England]] licensed a number of brothels including the [[Silver Cross Tavern]] in London, which retains its licence to modern day because it was never revoked.\n\nThe authorities of Medieval Paris followed the same path as those in London and attempted to confine prostitution to a particular district. [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (1226\u20131270) designated nine streets in the [[Beaubourg]] [[Historical quarters of Paris|Quartier]] where it would be permitted. In the early part of the 19th century, state-controlled legal brothels (then known as \"''maisons de tol\u00e9rance''\" or \"''maisons closes''\") started to appear in several French cities. By law, they had to be run by a woman (typically a former prostitute) and their external appearance had to be discreet. The ''maisons'' were required to light a red lantern when they were open (from which is derived the term [[red-light district]]) and the prostitutes were only permitted to leave the ''maisons'' on certain days and only if accompanied by its head. By 1810, Paris alone had 180 officially approved brothels.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, some Paris brothels, such as [[le Chabanais]] and [[le Sphinx]], were internationally known for the luxury they provided. The French government sometimes included a visit to the ''Chabanais'' as part of the program for foreign guests of state, disguising it as a ''visit with the President of the Senate'' in the official program.<ref name=sz>Die Sphinx im Freudenhaus, ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 17 August 1996. {{in lang|de}}</ref> The ''Hotel Marigny'', established in 1917 in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris]], was one of several that were well known for catering to gay male clients.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sin city: show celebrates the Paris brothel that was loved by Cary Grant |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/sin-city-show-celebrates-the-paris-brothel-that-was-loved-by-cary-grant-1815759.html |newspaper=The Independent |date= 6 November 2009|accessdate=30 January 2011 |first=Genevieve |last=Roberts}}</ref> Premises suspected of being gay brothels, including the Hotel Marigny, were however subject to frequent police raids,{{sfn|Jackson|2009|p=29}} perhaps indicating less tolerance for them from the authorities.\n\nIn most European countries, brothels were made illegal after World War II. France outlawed brothels in 1946, after a campaign by [[Marthe Richard]]. The backlash against them was in part due to their wartime collaboration with the Germans during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupation of France]]. Twenty-two Paris brothels had been commandeered by the Germans for their exclusive use; some had made a great deal of money by catering for German officers and soldiers.<ref name=daily>Peter Allen, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1175836/Sleeping-enemy-How-horizontal-collaborators-Paris-brothels-enjoyed-golden-age-entertaining-Hitlers-troops.html Sleeping with the enemy: How 'horizontal collaborators' in Paris brothels enjoyed a golden age entertaining Hitler's troops], ''Daily Mail'', 1 May 2009</ref> One brothel in the [[Monmartre]] District of the French capital was part of an escape network for [[prisoner of war|POW]]s and downed airmen.{{sfn|Regan|1992|p=37}}\n\nItaly made brothels illegal in 1959. The 2010s decade has seen the introduction of sex dolls and sexbots on the premises of some brothels.{{sfn|Levy|2007|pp=833-858}}\n\n===East Asia===\nBrothels have been used formally in [[China]] for prostitution and [[entertainment]] since [[Ancient China]] in its [[feudal]] period. For much of China's ancient and imperial history, brothels were owned by wealthy [[merchants]], typically stereotyped as \"madams\", and engaged in business in urban areas such as the Capital city. Prostitutes, or \"[[courtesans]]\" as they were known, were well-dressed and groomed to the proper table and drinking [[manners]](\u79ae). A Chinese prostitute may have been artistic and skilled at practices such as [[dancing]], playing [[musical instruments]], [[singing]] and conversing in [[verse (poetry)|verse]]. Prostitution was not [[outlawed]] in ancient and imperial China (although prostitutes were not considered fit for marriage to men of respectable social ranking) and instead prostitutes hosted in street brothels were popularly placed in the same [[social class]] as female [[artisans]] and regarded as elegant, albeit tainted, beings, most notably courtesans who used similar means to entertain members of [[nobility]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinawhisper.com/top-10-famous-prostitutes-in-chinese-history/|title=The 8 Famous Prostitutes in Chinese History|date=14 April 2013|accessdate=29 September 2016}}</ref> Both young women and men worked as prostitutes in these elaborate brothel settings, though historical records and works of [[literature]] have widely [[Romanticism|romanticized]] the free-flowing, artistic nature of female prostitutes.\n\nThe practice of hosting prostitutes in these elaborate brothels spread to surrounding regions of [[Chinese culture sphere|Chinese cultural influence]], notably in [[Japan]] after the sixth century [[AD]], where prostitutes and courtesans evolved to develop the ''[[Oiran]]'' and ''[[Geisha]]'' entertainment professions. Again, the ''geisha'' of Japan emphasized good table manners, artistic skills, elegant styling and sophisticated, tactical conversational skills. The practice also spread to [[Korea]], where prostitutes evolved into the [[Korean people|Korean]] ''[[kisaeng]]''.\n\n===India===\nThe governments of many Indian [[princely state]]s had regulated [[prostitution in India]] prior to the 1860s. The [[British Raj]] enacted the [[Prostitution in colonial India#Cantonment Act of 1864|Cantonment Act of 1864]] to regulate [[prostitution in colonial India]] as a matter of accepting a necessary evil.<ref name=tambe2005>{{cite journal|last=Tambe|first=Ashwini|title=The Elusive Ingenue:A transnational Feminist Analysis of European Prostitution in Colonial Bombay|journal=Gender and Society|volume=19|issue=2|date=19 February 2005|pages=160\u201379|doi=10.1177/0891243204272781}}</ref> The Cantonment Acts regulated and structured prostitution in the British [[military bases]] which provided for about twelve to fifteen Indian women kept in brothels called ''chaklas'' for each regiment of thousand British [[soldier]]s.

It estimated about 100,000 women to be working in brothels at the time, yet some estimated the total number of prostitutes to be as high as 500,000.{{sfn|Woolston|1969|p=39}}\n\nDuring the late nineteenth century, brothels in the United States were no secret. George Kneeland articulated his growing concern about the organized sex business in America well, saying that prostitution had grown into a \"highly commercialized and profitable business that penetrated the deepest recesses of the political, cultural and economic life of the city.\"{{sfn|Kneeland|Davis|1913| }} Brothels were commonly referred to as \"disorderly houses\", and their residents were called by many names, some [[Euphemism|euphemistic]]\u2014e.g., \"abandoned woman\", \"bawd good-time daisy\", \"fallen angel\", \"fille de joie\", \"jeweled bird\", \"lady of the evening\", \"shady lady\", \"soiled dove\", \"wanton woman\", and \"woman of the town\"\u2014and some less kind\u2014e.g., \"hooker\", \"slut\", and \"whore\".{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=5}} As the 19th century went on, prostitution as a profession became more common, rather than just occasionally necessitated soliciting. As a result of these changes, the way prostitution was practiced changed.{{sfn|Walkoitz|1982| }}  Many prostitutes still practiced their trade independently, but the new class of professional prostitutes created a demand for a location to do their regular business, and the brothel served this purpose.{{sfn|Rosen|1983| }}\n \t\nVisitors could easily find disorderly houses by merely opening up the local or statewide directories, such as the 1895 ''Travelers' Guide of Colorado''.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=4}} This 66-page manual helped the interested client decide which brothel was right for him. These manuals did not attract by using euphemistic language, and though bold by standards of the time, were not crude. Some examples read: \"Twenty young ladies engaged nightly to entertain guest\", and \"Strangers cordially welcome\".  In some areas, brothels simply could not be ignored. A nineteenth-century authority describes the city of New Orleans as such: \"The extent of licentiousness and prostitution here is truly appalling and doubtless without a parallel in the whole civilized world. The indulgence and practice is so general and common that men seldom seek to cover up their acts or go in disguise.\"{{sfn|Fernando|1963|p=254}}\n\nThe average house held five to twenty working girls; some higher end brothels also employed staff servants, musicians, and a bouncer. The typical brothel contained several bedrooms, all furnished. Some upscale brothels were much larger; such is the case with that owned by Mary Ann Hall of [[Arlington, Virginia]].{{sfn|Webb|2004|p=26}}  It is described as \"a rather grand house with twenty-five rooms and was enclosed by a brick wall. The interior was elegantly furnished. The principle rooms on the first floor contained large oil paintings, Brussels carpets, red plush 'parlor furniture', \u00e9tag\u00e8res (a shelf for small ornaments), and numerous items of silver plate.\"{{sfn|Milner Associates|loc=Appendix II}}  An archeological dig of the area outside of Mary Ann Hall's estate revealed a high quality of material superior to those in surrounding working-class areas.  This included many champagne bottles and corks, wire cages from such bottles, perfume bottles, high-quality porcelain with gilt edging, along with remnants of exotic foods\u2014coconut shells and berry seeds, bones from beef, fish, and pork indicating that elegant meals were being eaten at this high-class brothel.{{sfn|Milner Associates|pp=111\u2013197}}  These \"five and ten dollar parlor houses\" attracted wealthy men, who used the facilities much as a gentlemen's social club,{{sfn|Rosen|1983|p= 86}} where they made business and political connections, met with associates, and had exquisite dinners with wine, champagne, and women. Brothels were not only for the wealthy.  \"One-dollar houses\" were visited by those of the working class. A 1910 Kansas vice report compares the two: \"A few brothels were equipped with expensive furniture and furnishings including the finest of upholstered chairs, well-done paintings and costly rugs, which others were hovels of repulsive squalor.\"{{sfn|Johnson|1911|p=98}}\n\nWomen joined brothels from all walks of life. The average prostitute was approximately 21,{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=6}} but many were as young as 13 or as old as 50. Typically thought of as an escape for young, poor, troubled women, brothels sometimes attracted those less expected. Trained musicians and singers sometimes were lured into it by their interest in easy money and fun times.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=19}} Some others turned to brothels to get out of their boring, abusive, or otherwise unfulfilling marriages. Although they might be of various classes, ethnicities, and ages, most women who began or joined brothels had a shared goal: quick money.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=6}} Ironically, many found themselves always indebted to their mistresses. Her lack of credit made a prostitute unable to buy items necessary for her trade herself (powder, cosmetics, perfumes, and \"evening wear\") but was forced to buy them through her madam.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=8}}\n\nSome madams, often former prostitutes themselves, rose to become independently wealthy. One was Mary Ann Hall of Arlington, Virginia. Clearly attractive and a good businesswoman, Mary Ann purchased a lot and built a brick house. That would be the location of an upscale brothel for another 40 years, sitting right at the foot of Capitol Hill. Her brothel was very lucrative, and Mary Ann was able to buy multiple slaves and even a summer home. She was responsible for the behavior of her prostitutes, which could prove challenging since drug abuse was common. A large focus for madams was keeping their business transactions discreet and staying on the good side of the law, which they did so by contributing money to charitable organizations, schools, and churches.\n\nDespite those efforts, much of the profit still went to legal fines and fees, since prostitution was largely illegal. Timely payment of these fines could guarantee a madam that her business could continue without fear of being shut down, usually. Brothels were expected to pay significantly higher rent than others.{{sfn|Webb|2004|pp=24\u201333}} Another upscale bordello was the Big Brick in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], built and operated by [[Grace Peixotto]], the daughter of the Rev. Solomon Cohen Peixotto, and the madam of the most infamous brothel in the history of the city.{{sfn|Jones|2006|pp=19\u201323}}\n\nA madam stayed involved in her business. Running a house with so many in it required skill. A brothel required the purchase of regular food and food preparation. A madam had to monitor the cleanliness of the brothel, including the sheets, which had to be changed several times in an evening, and a stock of wines and liquors for clientele. She was the boss of the brothel and so a madam fired and hired servants, maids, and prostitutes. New faces in the brothel were desired by patrons and so madams had to find new women to recruit. Sometimes, that meant taking in a less-than-desired woman but one with youth and good looks. The \"new\" prostitute received training, cosmetics, and clothes from the madam. A prostitute from Kansas City is recorded as saying that she is no match for the \"proper\" behavior and dress required for the famous Ice Palace in Chicago.{{sfn|Rosen|1983|p=87}}\n\nDisorderly houses or any other dwelling used for purposes of selling sex or other lewd acts in the early 20th century were illegal with a few exceptions: the states of Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, and South Carolina. Penalties could range from $1,000 and time in jail, to much smaller fines.{{sfn|Rosen|1983| }}\n\n===Military brothels===\n\nUntil recently, in several armies around the world, mobile brothels were attached to the army as auxiliary units, especially attached to combat units on long-term deployments abroad. Because it is a controversial subject, military brothels and the women who provided sex services in them were often designated with creative [[euphemism]]s. Examples of such jargon are {{lang|fr|la bo\u00eete \u00e0 bonbons}} ({{lang-en|\"the sweet box\"}}), replacing the term \"{{lang|fr|[[bordel militaire de campagne]]}}\". [[France]] used mobile brothels during the [[First World War]], the [[Second World War]] and the [[First Indochina War]] to supply sex services to French soldiers who were facing combat in areas where brothels were unusual, such as at the [[front line]] or in isolated garrisons.<ref>World Association of International Studies [http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 article] retrieved on March 10, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612081843/http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 |date=June 12, 2007 }}</ref>{{sfn|Windrow|2004| }} Brothels were outlawed in France in 1946; but the [[French Foreign Legion]] continued to use mobile brothels until the late 1990s.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], women drawn from throughout the [[Far East]] were forced into [[sexual slavery]] by the occupation armies of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in brothels known as [[Ianjo]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://japanfocus.org/products/details/2373 |title=Japan's 'Comfort Women': It's time for the truth |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-15 |publisher=[[The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109083324/http://japanfocus.org/products/details/2373 |archivedate=January 9, 2009 }}</ref> These women were referred to as \"[[comfort women]]\" (kanji=\u6170\u5b89\u5a66; hiragana=\u3044\u3042\u3093\u3075).
