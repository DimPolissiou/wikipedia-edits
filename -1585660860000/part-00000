On his return with the chronicler [[Ramon Muntaner|Ram\u00f3n Muntaner]], he was captured by the [[Venice|Venetians]] at [[Lordship of Negroponte|Negroponte]]. He had been released by 1310, when he distinguished himself at the siege of [[Almer\u00eda]] by killing the son of the King of [[Guadix]].\n\nIn 1313, he returned to [[Sicily]] to take part in the war then in hand with the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] and was created Lord of [[Catania]].

Minnesota won the Series four games to one, en route to winning the [[1987 World Series]] four games to three over the [[1987 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\n==Background==\nThe Detroit Tigers finished the 1987 regular season with the best record in all of baseball, at 98\u201364 (.605). They won the [[American League East]] by two games in thrilling fashion over the [[1987 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], overcoming a {{frac|3|1|2}}-game deficit with a week to go, and clinching the division -- [[1984 Detroit Tigers season|and their second postseason appearance in four years]] -- on the last day of the season with a 1\u20130 win over Toronto at Tiger Stadium. \n\nThe Twins, by contrast, finished with the worst record of any of the four teams that made the playoffs, at 85\u201377 (.525). Although they held off the [[1987 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] by two games to take the [[American League West]], they were clearly seen as the underdogs against the power of the Tigers in the 1987 ALCS. \n\nThe Twins would go on to win the first of [[1991 World Series|two]] World's Championships in the next four years. As for Detroit, after their elimination in this series, the Tigers would not see the playoffs again for [[2006 Detroit Tigers season|19 years]], when they [[2006 American League Championship Series|won the American League Pennant in 2006]].\n\n==Summary==\n\n===Minnesota Twins vs. Detroit Tigers===\n{{MLB Playoff Summary\n| summary =\n| winner = Minnesota\n| score = 4\u20131\n\n| score1 = Detroit Tigers \u2013 5, '''Minnesota Twins''' \u2013 8\n| date1 = October 7\n| loc1 = [[Hubert H.

Humphrey Metrodome]], with the Tigers throwing [[Doyle Alexander]] against the Twins' [[Frank Viola]]. In the bottom of the second, the Twins opened the scoring when third baseman [[Gary Gaetti]] homered off Alexander to give Minnesota a 1\u20130 lead. However, Detroit answered back the very next half-inning, as catcher [[Mike Heath]] homered to center field to tie the game. The game remained tied until the bottom of the fifth, when the Twins erupted for three runs. Gaetti led off the inning with his second round-tripper of the game, and [[Randy Bush]] followed by stroking a triple to right field and coming home on a double by [[Tom Brunansky]]. [[Steve Lombardozzi]] [[sacrifice bunt|sacrificed]] Brunansky to third, and he scored on a subsequent base hit by [[Dan Gladden]] to make it 4\u20131.\n\nBeginning in the top half of the sixth, however, Detroit staged a comeback. [[Kirk Gibson]] hit a home run that inning, and then Heath ripped an RBI single in the seventh that scored [[Larry Herndon]] to cut Minnesota's lead down to one. In the top of the eighth, the Tigers took a one-run lead with a pair of [[sacrifice fly|sacrifice flies]] off Twins reliever [[Jeff Reardon]] that scored Gibson and [[Alan Trammell]].\n\nIn the bottom of the eighth, however, Minnesota took the lead for good. A double by [[Kirby Puckett]] brought Gladden home to tie the game, and [[Don Baylor]] and Brunansky drove in the go-ahead runs off [[Willie Hern\u00e1ndez]] with a single and double, respectively. A single by [[Johnny Grubb]] and a walk to [[Lou Whitaker]] was all the Tigers could muster against Reardon in the ninth, as Gibson struck out to give the Twins an 8\u20135 victory and a 1\u20130 lead in the series.\n\n===Game 2===\nThursday, October 8, 1987, at [[Hubert H.

In the top of the second, the Tigers opened the scoring when [[Chet Lemon]] hit a two-run home run off Blyleven. In the bottom half of the inning, however, the Twins stormed back, as Gaetti doubled to right and scored on another double by Brunansky. After a walk to [[Greg Gagne (baseball)|Greg Gagne]], catcher [[Tim Laudner]] hit the third double of the inning off Morris, scoring both Brunansky and Gagne for a 3\u20132 Minnesota lead.\n\nThe Twins extended their lead in the fourth, as Bush singled and then stole second and third. After consecutive walks to Brunansky and Gagne, Gladden singled to left to drive in Bush and Brunansky. [[Kent Hrbek]] then added a homer in the fifth, giving Minnesota a 6\u20132 lead. Tigers second baseman [[Lou Whitaker]] touched Blyleven for a homer in the eighth, but the Twins hurler would allow nothing more. Former Tiger Juan Berenguer struck out the side in the ninth to hand the Twins a 6\u20133 victory and a 2\u20130 series lead.\n\n===Game 3===\nSaturday, October 10, 1987, at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road=Minnesota|RoadAbr=MIN\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=2|R5=0|R6=2|R7=2|R8=0|R9=0|RR=6|RH=8|RE=1\n|Home='''Detroit'''|HomeAbr=DET\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=5|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=2|H9=X|HR=7|HH=7|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Mike Henneman]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Jeff Reardon]] (1\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Greg Gagne (baseball)|Greg Gagne]] (1), [[Tom Brunansky]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Pat Sheridan]] (1)\n|}}\n\nThe Series shifted to Detroit for Game 3, with the Tigers' [[Walt Terrell]] facing the Twins' [[Les Straker]]. The two pitchers matched zeroes for the first two-and-a-half innings until the bottom of the third, when Detroit's [[Pat Sheridan]] doubled to left, moved to third on a single by Whitaker, and scored on a force out by Gibson that sent Whitaker to third. After Gibson stole second, a [[balk]] by Straker scored Whitaker, and a single by Trammell brought in Gibson. A double by Herndon then scored Trammell and Lemon to give the Tigers a 5\u20130 lead.\n\nIn the top of the fourth, the Twins cut Detroit's lead to 5\u20132 with a Gagne home run and a Bush single that scored Hrbek, and in the sixth they reduced the lead down to one with a two-run homer by Brunansky.  In the top of the seventh, a two-out single by Gaetti drove in Gladden and Gagne to give the Twins a 6\u20135 lead and put them on the cusp of taking a stranglehold on the series.\n\nFacing the prospect of blowing a 5\u20130 lead and falling behind three games to none, the Tigers rallied in the bottom of the eighth.  Minnesota brought in Reardon to get a two-inning save. After a lead-off single by Larry Herndon. After [[Jack Morris]] pinch ran for Herndon, Reardon got [[Tom Brookens]] to pop out to Hrbek on a sacrifice bunt attempt.

Although they held off the [[1987 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] by two games to take the [[American League West]], they were clearly seen as the underdogs against the power of the Tigers in the 1987 ALCS. \n\nThe Twins would go on to win the first of [[1991 World Series|two]] World's Championships in the next four years. As for Detroit, after their elimination in this series, the Tigers would not see the playoffs again for [[2006 Detroit Tigers season|19 years]], when they [[2006 American League Championship Series|won the American League Pennant in 2006]].\n\n==Summary==\n\n===Minnesota Twins vs. Detroit Tigers===\n{{MLB Playoff Summary\n| summary =\n| winner = Minnesota\n| score = 4\u20131\n\n| score1 = Detroit Tigers \u2013 5, '''Minnesota Twins''' \u2013 8\n| date1 = October 7\n| loc1 = [[Hubert H.

In the bottom of the second, the Twins opened the scoring when third baseman [[Gary Gaetti]] homered off Alexander to give Minnesota a 1\u20130 lead. However, Detroit answered back the very next half-inning, as catcher [[Mike Heath]] homered to center field to tie the game. The game remained tied until the bottom of the fifth, when the Twins erupted for three runs. Gaetti led off the inning with his second round-tripper of the game, and [[Randy Bush]] followed by stroking a triple to right field and coming home on a double by [[Tom Brunansky]]. [[Steve Lombardozzi]] [[sacrifice bunt|sacrificed]] Brunansky to third, and he scored on a subsequent base hit by [[Dan Gladden]] to make it 4\u20131.\n\nBeginning in the top half of the sixth, however, Detroit staged a comeback. [[Kirk Gibson]] hit a home run that inning, and then Heath ripped an RBI single in the seventh that scored [[Larry Herndon]] to cut Minnesota's lead down to one. In the top of the eighth, the Tigers took a one-run lead with a pair of [[sacrifice fly|sacrifice flies]] off Twins reliever [[Jeff Reardon]] that scored Gibson and [[Alan Trammell]].\n\nIn the bottom of the eighth, however, Minnesota took the lead for good. A double by [[Kirby Puckett]] brought Gladden home to tie the game, and [[Don Baylor]] and Brunansky drove in the go-ahead runs off [[Willie Hern\u00e1ndez]] with a single and double, respectively. A single by [[Johnny Grubb]] and a walk to [[Lou Whitaker]] was all the Tigers could muster against Reardon in the ninth, as Gibson struck out to give the Twins an 8\u20135 victory and a 1\u20130 lead in the series.\n\n===Game 2===\nThursday, October 8, 1987, at [[Hubert H.

In the top of the second, the Tigers opened the scoring when [[Chet Lemon]] hit a two-run home run off Blyleven. In the bottom half of the inning, however, the Twins stormed back, as Gaetti doubled to right and scored on another double by Brunansky. After a walk to [[Greg Gagne (baseball)|Greg Gagne]], catcher [[Tim Laudner]] hit the third double of the inning off Morris, scoring both Brunansky and Gagne for a 3\u20132 Minnesota lead.\n\nThe Twins extended their lead in the fourth, as Bush singled and then stole second and third. After consecutive walks to Brunansky and Gagne, Gladden singled to left to drive in Bush and Brunansky. [[Kent Hrbek]] then added a homer in the fifth, giving Minnesota a 6\u20132 lead. Tigers second baseman [[Lou Whitaker]] touched Blyleven for a homer in the eighth, but the Twins hurler would allow nothing more. Former Tiger Juan Berenguer struck out the side in the ninth to hand the Twins a 6\u20133 victory and a 2\u20130 series lead.\n\n===Game 3===\nSaturday, October 10, 1987, at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road=Minnesota|RoadAbr=MIN\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=2|R5=0|R6=2|R7=2|R8=0|R9=0|RR=6|RH=8|RE=1\n|Home='''Detroit'''|HomeAbr=DET\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=5|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=2|H9=X|HR=7|HH=7|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Mike Henneman]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Jeff Reardon]] (1\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Greg Gagne (baseball)|Greg Gagne]] (1), [[Tom Brunansky]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Pat Sheridan]] (1)\n|}}\n\nThe Series shifted to Detroit for Game 3, with the Tigers' [[Walt Terrell]] facing the Twins' [[Les Straker]].

In the top of the seventh, a two-out single by Gaetti drove in Gladden and Gagne to give the Twins a 6\u20135 lead and put them on the cusp of taking a stranglehold on the series.\n\nFacing the prospect of blowing a 5\u20130 lead and falling behind three games to none, the Tigers rallied in the bottom of the eighth.  Minnesota brought in Reardon to get a two-inning save. After a lead-off single by Larry Herndon. After [[Jack Morris]] pinch ran for Herndon, Reardon got [[Tom Brookens]] to pop out to Hrbek on a sacrifice bunt attempt. [[Pat Sheridan]], 1 for 6 lifetime versus Reardon, hit the first pitch he saw into the upper deck in right field for a two-run home run that restored Detroit's lead, 7\u20136.

He won his commission at the great [[Battle of Vienna]] in the following year; and during seven years of campaigning in [[Hungary]] rose to the rank of [[Rittmeister]]. A wound sustained at this time permanently injured his sight. For five years more, up to 1697, he was employed in the Italian campaigns, then he was called back to Hungary by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] and won on the field of the [[Battle of Zenta]] two grades of promotion.\n\nDe Mercy displayed great daring in the first campaigns of the [[Spanish Succession War]] in [[Italy]], twice fell into the hands of the enemy in rights at close quarters and for his conduct at the surprise of [[Battle of Cremona|Cremona]] (31 January 1702) received the thanks of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and the proprietary colonelcy of a newly raised [[cuirassier]] regiment. With this he took part in the Rhine campaign of 1703, and the [[Battle of Friedlingen]], and his success as an intrepid leader of raids and forays became well known to friend and foe. He was on that account selected early in 1704 to harry the dominions of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]]. He was soon afterwards promoted to ''[[Generalfeldwachtmeister]]'', in which rank he was engaged in the [[Battle of Schellenberg]] (2 July 1704).\n\nIn the rest of the war he was often distinguished by his fiery courage. He rose to be general of cavalry in the course of these ten years. His resolute leadership was conspicuous at the [[Battle of Peterwardein]] (1716) and he was soon afterwards made commander of the [[Banat]] of [[Temesvar]].\n\nAt the great [[Siege of Belgrade (1717)|Battle of Belgrade]] (1717) he led the second line of left wing cavalry in a brilliant and decisive charge which drove the forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] to their trenches. After the peace he resumed the administration of the Banat, which after more than 150 years of Turkish rule needed a capable governor. But before his work was done he was once more called away to a command in the field, this time in southern Italy, where he fought the [[Battle of Francavilla]] (20 June 1719), took [[Messina]] and besieged [[Palermo]]. For eleven years more he administered the Banat, reorganizing the country as a prosperous and civilized community.\n\nIn 1733 he was made a general field marshal in the army and in the Spring of that year he and the Irish-born Major General Baron [[O'Dea Castle|Francis Patrick O'Neillan]] assembled 50,000 men at [[Mantua]] in an effort to reclaim all that had been lost the previous year when the Austrians had been driven from Italy by the Franco-Spanish forces. \n\nMercy was killed on 29 June 1734 at the [[Battle of San Pietro|Battle of Parma]] while personally leading his troops. He left no children, and his name passed to Count Argenteau, from whom came the family of Mercy-Argenteau. He was the foster father of [[Florimund Count de Mercy d'Argenteau]], and his great-uncle was [[Franz von Mercy|Franz Freiherr von Mercy]].\n\nOn 3 August 2009, a bust of the count was unveiled in Central Park, [[Timi\u0219oara]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Anca Toma, [http://www.renasterea.ro/rb/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4112%3Adiplome-apartamente-i-hectolitri-de-bere-de-ziua-timioarei&Itemid=118 ''Diplome, apartamente \u015fi hectolitri de bere, de Ziua Timi\u015foarei'']{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Rena\u015fterea B\u0103n\u0103\u0163ean\u0103''; 4 August 2009.</ref>\n\n==References==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Mercy, Franz, Freiherr von}}\n<references/>\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mercy, Florimund}}\n[[Category:1666 births]]\n[[Category:1734 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Longwy]]\n[[Category:Counts of Austria]]\n[[Category:Field marshals of Austria]]\n[[Category:Austrian army commanders in the War of the Spanish Succession]]\n[[Category:Austrian military personnel of the War of the Polish Succession]]\n[[Category:Generals of the Holy Roman Empire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Onesource|date=July 2009}}\n\n{{Infobox military person\n| name          = Claudius Florimund de Mercy\n| image         = Grafmercy.jpg\n| image_size    = \n| caption       = Count Claudius Florimund de Mercy\n| nickname      = \n| birth_date    = 1666\n| birth_place   = [[Longwy]], [[Duchy of Lorraine]]\n| death_date    = 29 June 1734\n| death_place   = [[Parma]], [[Duchy of Parma]]\n| placeofburial = \n| allegiance    = {{flag|Holy Roman Empire}}\n| branch        = [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Army]]\n| serviceyears  = 1682\u20131734\n| rank          = ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]''\n| unit          = \n| commands      = \n| battles       = '''[[Great Turkish War]]'''\n*[[Battle of Vienna]]\n*[[Battle of Zenta]]\n'''[[War of the Spanish Succession]]'''\n*[[Battle of Cremona]]\n*[[Battle of Friedlingen]]\n*[[Battle of Schellenberg]]\n'''[[Austro-Turkish War of 1716\u201318|Austro-Turkish War]]'''\n*[[Battle of Peterwardein]]\n*[[Siege of Belgrade (1717)|Siege of Belgrade]]\n'''[[War of the Quadruple Alliance]]'''\n*[[Battle of Francavilla]]\n'''[[War of the Polish Succession]]'''\n*[[Battle of San Pietro|Battle of Parma]]\n}}\n\n'''Count Claudius Florimund [[de Mercy]]''' (1666 &ndash; 29 June 1734) was an [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] [[field marshal]], born at [[Longwy]] in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], now in [[France]].\n\nMercy entered the [[Austria]]n army as a volunteer in 1682.
