It has been closed since the disappearance of its fifth staff member, Lee Bo.]]\n\nThe '''Causeway Bay Books disappearances''' are a series of international [[Forced disappearance|disappearances]] concerning five staff members of [[Causeway Bay Books]], a former bookstore located in [[Causeway Bay]], [[Hong Kong]]. Between October and December 2015, five staff of Causeway Bay Books went missing. At least two of them disappeared in [[mainland China]], one in [[Thailand]]. One member was last seen in Hong Kong, and eventually revealed to be in [[Shenzhen]], across the Chinese border, without the travel documents necessary to have crossed the border through legal channels.\n\nIt was widely believed that the booksellers were detained in mainland China,<ref name=20160107guardianpull/><ref name=time4172407/> and in February 2016 [[Guangdong]] provincial authorities confirmed that all five had been taken into custody in relation to an old traffic case involving [[Gui Minhai]].<ref name=time4208964/> While response to the October disappearances had been muted, perhaps in recognition that unexplained disappearances and lengthy [[extrajudicial detention]]s are known to occur in mainland China,<ref name=bigstory1/> the unprecedented disappearance of a person in Hong Kong, and the bizarre events surrounding it, shocked the city and crystallised international concern over the possible abduction of Hong Kong citizens by [[Chinese public security bureau]] officials and their likely [[extraordinary rendition|rendition]], and the violation of several articles {{clarify|date=January 2019}} of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]]. In his report to the British government and parliament in early January 2016, foreign secretary [[Philip Hammond]] said the incident was \"a serious breach of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on Hong Kong and undermines the principle of [[one country, two systems]]\".<ref name=20160212theguardian/><ref name=bbc35557226/>\n\nFollowing the international focus on the disappearances, there were virtual reappearances by two of the missing men, Lee Bo, in the form of letters and photographs, and Gui Minhai, in a confessional video broadcast on national television, in which they insisted that their return to [[mainland China]] was voluntary but which failed to account for their movement across national borders. These efforts were widely derided by commentators as a farce and a charade, as they failed to satisfy concerns over the breach of \"one country, two systems\" and its practical and constitutional implications.<ref name=ejinsight20160129/><ref name=20160111vohk/>\n\nOn 16 June 2016, shortly after he returned to Hong Kong, [[Lam Wing-kee]] gave a long press conference in the presence of legislator [[Albert Ho]] in which he detailed the circumstances surrounding his eight-month detention, and describing how his confession and those of his associates had been scripted and stage-managed. Lam indicated the involvement of the [[Central Investigation Team]], which is under direct control of the highest level of the Beijing leadership. His revelations stunned Hong Kong and made headlines worldwide, prompting a flurry of counter-accusations and denials from mainland authorities and supporters.<ref name=\"AutoRQ-1\"/><ref name=20160616hongkongfp/>\n\n==Background==\nCauseway Bay Books (\u9285\u947c\u7063\u66f8\u5e97), located in [[Causeway Bay]], Hong Kong, was founded in 1994 by Lam Wing-kee.<ref name=nextmedia54595242/> It was one of about 110 independent Hong Kong bookshops that rent out space in upstairs locations to avoid high rents at street level.<ref name=20160108hongkongfp/> The bookstore sold a number of political books that are considered sensitive and banned in mainland China. [[Freedom of speech]] in Hong Kong is protected under [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]] Article 27, and these independent publishers thrive as they cater predominantly to people interested in the machinations of mainland politics.<ref name=time4172407/><ref name=nextmedia54595242/><ref name=20160108hongkongfp/> The bookstore became popular amongst mainland Chinese tourists for this reason.<ref name=nextmedia54595242/><ref name=20160108hongkongfp/><ref name=bbc34782266/> In 2014, the bookstore was sold to Mighty Current Media Company Limited (\u5de8\u6d41\u50b3\u5a92\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), a publishing house. During the time of the disappearances, the company had three shareholders: Gui Minhai, Sophie Choi and Lui Bo.{{r|Initium}} According to industry sources, Mighty Current is a prolific publisher with a number of publishing subsidiaries, and this group may be responsible for 30 to 60 percent of the output of salacious books about Chinese political figures that are widely available at newsstands and in book stores, including one at Hong Kong International Airport.<ref name=20160105nytimes/>\n\nAround the time of the disappearances, Gui Minhai was rumoured to have been working on a book regarding current CPC general secretary [[Xi Jinping]]'s personal love history, tentatively named ''Xi and His Six Women'' (\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\u548c\u4ed6\u7684\u516d\u500b\u5973\u4eba). The project was suggested to be linked to the disappearances.<ref name=20160107guardianpull/><ref name=20160105theguardian/><ref name=20160120nytimes/> The publishing house had also already gone to press with a book entitled ''2017: Upheaval in China'', but it was withdrawn by the author before publication.<ref name=20160120nytimes/>\n\nIn late 2013, Yiu Man-tin (\u59da\u6587\u7530), founder and chief editor of Morning Bell Press (\u6668\u9418\u66f8\u5c40) and a Hong Kong resident, was arrested in Shenzhen after he had been tricked there.<ref name=ejinsight20160104/><ref name=20140129nytimes/>{{r|Initium}} He was known to have been preparing to publish book by a Chinese writer residing in the US about Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping, entitled ''Godfather of China, Xi Jinping'' (\u4e2d\u570b\u6559\u7236\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73).<ref name=20140129nytimes/> Yiu was arrested by police in Shenzhen on charges of falsely labelling and smuggling industrial chemicals worth $220,000 in 2010 and was sentenced to prison for 10 years allegedly for smuggling, even though the real reason for the trumped up charges, in the eyes of many, was China's increasing restrictions on political expression under Xi.<ref name=ejinsight20160104/><ref name=20140129nytimes/> Two Hong Kong magazine publishers, Wong Kin-man and Wo Chung-hau, were arrested and tried in November 2015 for running an illegal business in China after sending copies of a political magazine to people on the mainland.{{r|Initium}}<ref name=20151109guardian/>\n\nChinese [[PEN International|PEN Center]] director [[Bei Ling]] alerted ''Apple Daily'' to Lee Bo's disappearance, and the journal reported on 1 January 2016 that Lee had become the fifth member of Causeway Bay Books to disappear. His wife was unwilling to speak to the press at the time, but filed a missing person's report with the Hong Kong police the following day.<ref name=20160105ejinsightunanswered/><ref name=nextmedia54599826/>\n\n=== Guangdong Action Plan ===\nAccording to ''The Sunday Times'', the mainland authorities had issued instructions on 25 April 2015 to eradicate illegal publications and those containing sexual content. ''The Sunday Times'' published what was described to be an alleged internal Communist Party document entitled \"Guangdong Action Plan\", a summary of which had been circulating in journalistic and political circles the previous week, and the full document gives apparent authorisation for excursions by Guangdong enforcers targeting authors, publishers and booksellers. In it, 14 publishing houses and 21 publications in Hong Kong were named.<ref name=thesundaytimes1659622 /><ref name=mingjingnews32000001467 />\n\n==Disappearances==\n'''Lui Bo''' (\u5442\u6ce2, age {{Age in years|1970}}) is the manager and one of the three shareholders of Mighty Current.

Lee Bo's wife has written a column for 20 years under the pen name of Syu Fei at ''[[Ta Kung Pao]]'' \u2013 owned by the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR|Liaison Office]]; Lee worked at [[Joint Publishing]] until he started work at the bookstore.{{R|20160111hongkongfpcolumn}} Since the disappearances of four of his colleagues, he had been doing anonymous interviews with [[BBC]] and various media. After the arrest of Yiu Man-tin and the disappearance of three of his colleagues, Lee went on record to say that their motive was purely economic, and that not setting foot in the mainland was the cost to bear for being in the publishing business.{{R|nextmedia329472}} Lee was last seen on 30 December 2015, while delivering books in [[Chai Wan]] to a certain unknown client.{{r|Lee1}} Choi, who had been expecting Lee home for dinner at around 7.15&nbsp;pm on 30 December, raised the alarm when he failed to return home.{{R|nextmedia54599826|20160103hongkongfp|bbc35219260}} Lee had apparently received an order for about ten books from a new customer and had arranged to hand them over in person that night.{{R|nextmedia54599826}} He descended his building in a lift with at least eight other people at around 6&nbsp;pm, and witnesses saw him being pushed by a group of men into a minivan, which sped away the moment he was securely on board.{{R|mingpao1452534776}} Choi, Lee Bo's wife, later received a telephone call from him from a Shenzhen number.{{R|nextmedia54599826|bbc35219260}} Uncharacteristically speaking in [[Mandarin Chinese]] and apparently with someone whispering over his shoulder,{{R|nextmedia54599826}} Lee said that he had to go to the mainland on urgent business and that he would not be back home for some time. He assured her that he was well but assisting with investigations. His wife was told to be discreet.{{r|20160105ejinsightunanswered|nextmedia54599826}} The Immigration Department has no record of Lee having left Hong Kong,{{R|ejinsight20160104}} and Hong Kong does not have any [[extradition]] agreement with the PRC.{{R|20160105nytimes}} The fact that his [[Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents|home return permit]] was left at home led many to fear that he may have somehow been abducted by the mainland [[Chinese public security bureau|public security bureau]] and [[Extraordinary rendition|rendition]]ed to [[Shenzhen]]. His disappearance is the only known disappearance that occurred in Hong Kong territory, and thus sparked even more concern on whether the integrity of \"one country, two systems\" is being maintained.{{R|bbc35219260|mingpao1451585098799|metrohk299289|nextmedia19436390|Ming1451757876466}}\n\n==Reactions to Lee Bo's disappearance==\n=== Local ===\n[[File:Kidnap by Kacey Wong.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Kacey Wong]] at the protest against booksellers' disappearances on 10 January with red noose bearing the Chinese characters for \"abduction\" as props]]\nAmongst local media outlets, only ''Apple Daily'' and ''Ming Pao'' ran coverage on their front pages initially, while other local newspapers carried only brief pieces about a missing person. Television viewers remarked that [[TVB]] did not run the story during its prime time news programmes for the first few days after news of the Lee Bo disappearance broke.<ref name=\"20160104ejinsight-howsafe\"/> Lee Bo's disappearance spurred renewed interest about Lam Wing-kee, and his family received a police visit the same day after chief executive CY Leung spoke publicly on the case.<ref name=mingpao1452017341/>\n\nHong Kong's Chief Secretary [[Carrie Lam (politician)|Carrie Lam]] said that the Hong Kong government cares about the well-being of its people, and assured the public that police were working on the case.<ref name=20160103hongkongfp/> [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[CY Leung]] stated in a press conference on 4 January 2016 that if mainland Chinese law officials were operating in Hong Kong, it would be \"unacceptable\" and a breach of the [[Basic Law]].{{r|CY1}}<ref name=\"20160105nytimes\" /><ref name=\"20160107guardianpull\" /><ref name=\"20160105ejinsightunanswered\" /><ref name=\"ejinsight20160111\" /><ref name=\"yahoo054725278\" /> Article 22 states that no department of the central, provincial, or municipal governments within China may interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region administers on its own.<ref name=basiclaw/> Leung furthermore hoped that \"anyone, especially Lee Bo himself, can provide relevant information\" about his disappearance.<ref name=mingpao1452017341/><ref name=20160105hkfp/><ref name=ejinsight20160109/> In January 2016, after it was revealed that all five men were in mainland China, Lam expressed confidence in the sincerity and goodwill of the PRC government, and said that Lee Bo's disappearance was an isolated case that needed a swift resolution, but it did not amount to a breakdown of one country two systems.<ref name=standnews/> The American Chamber of Commerce asserted that with the rule of law, Hong Kong was still a preferable springboard to invest from, compared with Shanghai or Beijing, but nevertheless expressed concern at the disappearances.<ref name=rthk1237613/>\n\nLeading pro-establishment figures cast doubt on the mainland's supposed role in the disappearances:<ref name=ejinsight20160111/> [[Ip Kwok-him]] said that it was possible to use mainland telephone lines in Hong Kong, so the phone call from a Shenzhen number did not necessarily mean Lee was in the mainland; he added that there was no evidence of abduction. After Lee's wife cancelled her police report, [[Yiu Si-wing]] disputed the need for LegCo to discuss his disappearance due to the cancellation; [[Michael Tien]] said that if Lee had voluntarily gone to the mainland, it could not be a question of mainland officials acting across the border; [[Wong Kwok-kin]] said that kidnappers demand ransoms and not cancellation of missing persons reports.<ref name=nextmedia19445201/> [[Regina Ip]] said it was odd that Lee would be able to apparently telephone his wife freely if he was in custody, unlike if he was detained in Hong Kong.<ref name=hkej1215102/> [[Ng Leung-sing]], during a [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]] discussion, claimed to have received a tip from \"an old friend\" that all five booksellers had taken clandestine speedboats to Wai Lingding Island ([[:zh:\u5916\u4f36\u4ec3\u5cf6|\u5916\u4f36\u4ec3\u5cf6]]), an island south of Hong Kong that is administratively part of mainland China with no border facilities, and had been arrested for seeking prostitutes.{{r|Ng1}} The allegations of prostitution, criticised by pro-democracy figures as [[character assassination]], were carried by TVB on its prime time evening news as the leading item.<ref name=ejinsight20160107a/> Ng later apologised under pressure, saying that he had repeated a rumour without having checked the facts but never mentioned Lee's name.<ref name=20160105nytimes/>{{r|Ng2}} Ng said he was merely trying to state that it was indeed possible to leave Hong Kong without identity documents, and that it was inappropriate to speculate at present. Lee's wife criticised Ng for his insincere apology.<ref name=metrohk299590/>\n\n[[Martin Lee]] said that \"according to all the evidence that has been reported, I believe that Mr. Lee had been taken against his will by certain law enforcement agents from across the border through illegal means\". He described the disappearances as the \"most worrying thing that has happened in Hong Kong since the handover in 1997\".<ref name=ejinsight20160111prominent/> [[Benny Tai]] and former chief secretary [[Anson Chan]] both said the case poses a genuine threat to the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which China ought to uphold. Former legislator [[Margaret Ng]] suggested that Hong Kong's status as a world city was coming into question, and said \"Hong Kong can be deemed to be no longer safe unless we have a clear resolution of the problem\".<ref name=ejinsight20160111prominent/> [[Albert Chan]] said \"this is the first time there has been such a clear violation of Hong Kong's law, a clear violation of 'one country, two systems' principle, that has taken place in such an open manner\", and [[Lee Cheuk-yan]], called the disappearances a \"milestone for suppression\".<ref name=bbc35275309/> [[Joseph Wong]], former secretary for the Hong Kong civil service, also said that the incident will have drastic consequences as foreign confidence in the one country two systems policy may be irreparably damaged, which may in turn jeopardise Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.<ref name=ejinsight20160113/>\n\nOn 10 January, in excess of 6,000 people attended a protest march from the Hong Kong government headquarters in Admiralty to the China Liaison Office in Sai Wan demanding Beijing to respect the one country, two systems agreement to preserve Hong Kong's autonomy.<ref name=ejinsight20160111/><ref name=20160110hongkongfprally/> ''Ta Kung Pao'' announced on the same day that Sophie Choi's regular \"Syu Fei\" column with the paper was temporarily suspended \u2013 a spokesman for the journal said that Choi had advised them just before the new year that she was unable to submit any copy in January.<ref name=20160111hongkongfpcolumn/> The Hong Kong police said that Lee Bo and his wife had met at a guesthouse in China on Saturday, 23 January.

He added that the disappearances \"immediately raise dire questions about the Chinese government's commitment to freedom to publish\".<ref name=20160114guardian/>\n\nOn the other hand, US-based writer Xi Nuo ({{zh|\u897f\u8afe|labels=no}}) released his book ''Xi Jinping and His Lovers'' that was turned down by Gui Minhai the previous year after he had received a visit from a Chinese government agent. Xi Nuo says his decision to publish the book was to challenge the Chinese authorities. \"I want to tell the Chinese authorities and [[Xi Jinping]], the president of China, that you are wrong. Completely wrong. You better release the five guys. Let them go back home\".<ref name=bbc35480229/> American and European associations of publishers and booksellers \u2013 including [[PEN American Center]], the [[Authors Guild]] and the [[Federation of European Publishers]] \u2013 jointly wrote to CY Leung, urging him to take action on the missing Causeway Bay booksellers and \"request a formal assurance from Beijing that it will respect Hong Kong's autonomy and abide by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration\".<ref name=20160218hongkongfp/>\n\n===National===\nThe [[Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Foreign Minister]] stated that despite Lee Bo's dual Hong Kong and British citizenship, Lee is above all a Chinese citizen.{{r|BBC3}} This is viewed as a rebuke to Britain and a characterisation of the disappearance as an internal matter.<ref name=ejinsight20160106/> Wang claimed that there was no evidence that the missing persons were taken by the Chinese government, and urged for an end to \"useless speculations.\" {{r|BBC3}} China's Foreign Ministry maintains that China opposes \"any foreign country interfering with China's domestic politics or interfering with Hong Kong affairs\".<ref name=ejinsight20160107a/>\n\n''[[Global Times]]'', a tabloid subsidiary of ''[[People's Daily]]'', wrote three successive belligerent editorials on the case,<ref name=nextmedia19445201/> an act viewed by Hong Kong media as an indirect recognition of China's role in the disappearances.<ref name=ejinsight20160109/><ref name=nextmedia19445201/><ref name=ltn1563388/> The first editorial, on 4 January, opined that the bookshop's business model depended on \"stirring up troubles on the mainland ...

Cohen]], expert in Chinese law at [[New York University]], said China's increasing assertiveness in the world represents \"not only the extending reach of Chinese law, but the extending reach of Chinese lawlessness.\"<ref name=20160108nytimes/> Willy Lam, professor at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned: \"Not just the publishing and media circles, but the entire Hong Kong society, including people who do business in [mainland] China, and who might have commercial disputes with Chinese companies or different parts of the Chinese government, might fear for their safety because of such a very dangerous precedent\".<ref name=rthk1233405/> \"Freedom from fear is a thing of the past for Hong Kong and this applies to everyone: businessmen or student,\" said a spokesman for the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.<ref name=20160210theguardian/>\n\nAlthough alternative options to doing business with China are few for the business sector, many companies large and small, including within the important financial sector, are uneasy about the changing political climate. The head of the one business association in Hong Kong said: \"The middle-class, the professionals, even the accountants: people are just freaked out about what is going on... The last bastion of Hong Kong's guarantees is the law. What we have left is our legal system, but people fear that this may be under attack too\". Steve Vickers, the principal of one local risk assessment firm said: \"The Hong Kong government appears to now have considerably diminished autonomy and the liaison office seems to be strengthening its position, [the disappearances have] certainly sent a chill through the business and social arenas in Hong Kong\".<ref name=20160210theguardian/>\n\n== Reappearances ==\n=== Gui Minhai ===\nChinese state media published an interview on 17 January where Gui Minhai confessed to causing the death of a student whilst driving under the influence of alcohol in 2005 and for which he supposedly received a two-year suspended sentence.<ref name=20160118hongkongfp /><ref name=now165502 /><ref name=xinhuanet1117800737 /><ref name=time4183967 /> He allegedly absconded before the damages could be settled. According to interviews with China Central Television and [[Xinhua News Agency]], Gui said that he had been consumed with guilt and had returned to China in October to face the consequences of his misdeed.<ref name=20160118hongkongfp /><ref name=now165502 /><ref name=xinhuanet1117800737 />\n\nIn the video footage Gui said: \"Returning to the Chinese mainland and surrendering was my personal choice and had nothing to do with anyone else. I should shoulder my responsibility and I don't want any individual or institutions to interfere, or viciously hype up my return\".<ref name=20160117hongkongfp /> Gui appealed for the public not to hype his disappearance.<ref name=20160118hongkongfpunconvincing />\n\nThe confession has been received with incredulity, and many of the facts surrounding his mysterious disappearance from Thailand, including the release of the video three months after him vanishing, have been called into question.<ref name=20160117hongkongfp /><ref name=scmp1902805 /> The president of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, [[Jasper Tsang]], said: \"the China Central Television (CCTV) report [and broadcast of Gui Minghai's confession] did not seem to be able to calm the public. As the case drags on, there will be more speculation\".<ref name=yahoo084600596 /> Human Rights Watch was quoted in the ''Wall Street Journal'' saying: \"Given that Gui has been held nearly three months incommunicado, in a secret location, and without a lawyer, his confession on state-controlled TV lacks credibility.\"<ref name=201601asiancorrespondent />\n\n''The Washington Post'' said: \"The narrative seems messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction. It feels illogical, absurd even. But that may be the point. Televised confessions don't tend to trade in logic, or truth. They trade in fear.\"<ref name=20160118wapo /><ref name=qz596565 /> Following China Central Television's release of videotaped confessions from Gui Minhai \u2013 and of Swedish NGO staffer Peter Dahlin, [[Reporters Without Borders]] condemned China's \"dissemination of forced 'confessions' that have no informational value\". The organisation urged the EU to sanction CCTV and Xinhua for \"knowingly peddling lies and statements presumably obtained under duress\".<ref name=yahoo082607414 /> Hong Kong's chief executive said that he was unable to act as \"the Gui Minhai case has not been reported to the Hong Kong police or the government\".<ref name=20151208guardian /><ref name=time4183967 />\n\nThe Swedish foreign ministry said an envoy had visited Gui in February,<ref name=\":0\"/> but Swedish diplomats had not been given access to him since.<ref name=\"scmp1966843\"/>\n\nOn October 2017, he was formally released and ended up living in the eastern city of Ningbo, under heavy police presence and surveillance. In January 2018, Gui was travelling to Beijing for a medical exam at the Swedish embassy, accompanying him were two Swedish diplomats from the Swedish Consulate in Shanghai. Before reaching Beijing, 10 men in plain clothes kidnapped him away yet again in front of the diplomats. Chinese officials said that he was seized for allegedly sharing secret information with Swedish diplomats and of meeting them illegally. This incident caused Sweden to summon the Chinese ambassador in Stockholm to explain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/world/asia/china-police-bookseller-train-gui-minhai.html |title=Chinese Police Seize Publisher From Train in Front of Diplomats|last=Buckley|first=Chris|date=22 January 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 February 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/01/23/sweden-summons-china-ambassador-bookseller-gui-minhai-reportedly-seized-train-front-diplomats/|title=Sweden summons China ambassador after bookseller Gui Minhai reportedly seized from train in front of diplomats|last=Lai|first=Catherine|date=23 January 2018|website=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|language=en-GB|access-date=14 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213003540/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/01/23/sweden-summons-china-ambassador-bookseller-gui-minhai-reportedly-seized-train-front-diplomats/|archive-date=13 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, Gui's daughter Angela claimed that the Swedish ambassador in Beijing, [[Anna Lindstedt]], invited her to a meeting in Stockholm with several Chinese businessmen at a hotel, at which the businessmen and Lindstedt apparently tried to trade Gui's freedom for Angela's silence on his case. Swedish authorities denied authorising the negotiations. Lindstedt was charged in December 2019, risking 10 years' imprisonment under Swedish law.<ref name=\"AJE_Lindstedt_charged\" />\n\nGui was awarded, in absentia, the 2019 [[Kurt Tucholsky#Legacy and honours|Kurt Tucholsky prize]] for persecuted authors. Chinese authorities reacted by cancelling planned visits to Sweden by two large delegations of businessmen.<ref name=\"AJE_Lindstedt_charged\" />\n\n=== Lee Bo ===\nAfter his wife reported his disappearance to the Hong Kong police, a letter purportedly handwritten by Lee Bo was faxed to Taiwan's [[Central News Agency (Taiwan)|Central News Agency]] on 4 January 2016, explaining that he had \"returned to the mainland using my own methods\" to work with \"concerned parties\".<ref name=\"bbc letter\" /> Saying that she believed the letter was written voluntarily, Lee Bo's wife withdrew her request for police help.<ref name=\"bbc letter\" /><ref name=abc7069766 /> However, the case remains open as Hong Kong police confirmed that a missing person report can only be cancelled by the subject in person.<ref name=20160108hongkongfp />\n\nOn 10 January 2016, ''[[Headline Daily]]'' claimed to have obtained an exclusive video in which Lee Bo claimed that he was safe and that his disappearance was merely a personal trip.<ref name=scmp1899705 /><ref name=20160110hongkongfprally /><ref name=headline1042590 /> It also published a letter, purporting to say that he was \"perplexed and puzzled\" about the reaction over the disappearances. He also condemned a protest that was to be held on the same day.<ref name=ejinsight20160111 /><ref name=scmp1899705 />\n\nAnother letter allegedly written by Lee Bo to his wife was sent to ''[[Sing Tao Daily]]'' on 17 January, the day Gui Minhai's confession was aired, in which Lee denounced his colleague's reprehensible lack of morals in connection with his car accident, and blamed Gui for the fate that had befallen him.<ref name=now165502 /> In it, Lee also said that he had become good friends with his captors.<ref name=nextmedia54660226 />\n\nOn 29 February 2016, Lee Bo met with Hong Kong police and then gave a televised interview on the Hong Kong-based [[Phoenix Television]] in an undisclosed location in mainland China, in what was his first public appearance since he went missing. He held to the story that was in the letters published by ''Sing Tao'', saying he \"resorted to illegal immigration\" to get to the mainland \"to cooperate in a judicial investigation\" as he did not want to draw attention to his visit. He denied that he was kidnapped, but did not give details as to how he actually entered Mainland China without his travel documents. Adding that his British citizenship had been sensationalised, Lee Bo says that he will abandon his [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode in the United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"AutoV4-1\"/><ref name=\"AutoV4-2\"/>\n\nOn 24 March, Lee Bo returned to Hong Kong and asked the authorities to drop the case like his three colleagues did before. He said he would never again sell banned books, and was transported back into the mainland in a vehicle with cross-border licence plates the next day.<ref name=\"scmp1930052\"/><ref name=\"scmp1930513\"/>\n\n=== Lui Bo and Cheung Jiping ===\nOn 4 February 2016, provincial authorities in [[Guangdong]] confirmed that Lui Bo, Cheung Jiping, and Lam Wing-kee had been taken into custody in relation to a case involving Gui Minhai.<ref name=time4208964 /><ref name=infoP201602041116 /> The Guangdong authorities accused them of being \"involved in illegal activities on the mainland\" saying that \"criminal compulsory measures were imposed on them\".<ref name=ibtimes2295403 /> On 28 February, the three men appeared on Phoenix Television along with Gui Minhai in which they confessed to conspiring with Gui to send banned books to mainland customers and expressed remorse for their \"illegal book trading\"; Lam, further claiming Gui's books were fabrication, having been compiled from information obtained from the internet and magazines, acknowledged that the books \"generated lots of rumours in society and brought a bad influence\".<ref name=20160229guardian/>\n\nPhoenix TV, citing police sources, said the three men showed \"good attitude\" by confessing and might be allowed to return to Hong Kong within the week while they await trial.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to the Hong Kong government, Lui Bo had returned to Hong Kong and met with Hong Kong police on the morning of 4 March. He requested that his missing person case be closed and expressed that he does not require assistance from the Hong Kong government and police.<ref name=\"AutoV4-3\"/> Cheung Jiping also came back to Hong Kong two days later, and also asked the Hong Kong police to drop his missing person case. It appears that both men returned to mainland China hours after meeting with the Hong Kong authorities.<ref name=\"scmp1922757\"/>\n\n===Lam Wing-kee===\nLam Wing-kee was the last bookseller with Hong Kong citizenship to be allowed to return to Hong Kong from the mainland, eight months after he disappeared. On 13 June, Lam cancelled his missing person's report with the police, repudiating police assistance.<ref name=\"scmp1975048\"/> Three days later, on the day he was due to return to the mainland, he held a press briefing in the presence of legislator [[Albert Ho]] during which he claimed that he was abducted by the mainland officials at the Hong Kong-China border control in [[Shenzhen]] on 24 October 2015.<ref name=\"Lam\"/> He revealed that he had been transported handcuffed and blindfolded to [[Ningbo]].<ref name=\"Lam\"/><ref name=scmp1976598/> Lam was not told what offence he had committed until after he was taken to Ningbo, where he was held in solitary confinement and under 24-hour guard by six teams of gaolers from the \"[[Central Case Examination Group|Central Investigation Team]]\" ({{zh|\u4e2d\u592e\u5c08\u6848\u7d44|labels=no}}) \u2013 a [[Cultural Revolution]]-era unit whose powers and authority exceed those of the [[Chinese public security bureau|public security bureau]]s (PSB), reporting to central leadership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hk01.com/\u793e\u6703\u65b0\u805e/26497/\u66f8\u5546\u5931\u8e64-\u4e2d\u592e\u5c08\u6848\u7d44\u70ba\u4e2d\u5171\u9ad8\u5c64\u89aa\u5175-\u59cb\u65bc\u6587\u9769-\u4e3b\u8cac\u7279\u5225\u4efb\u52d9|script-title=zh:\u3010\u66f8\u5546\u5931\u8e64\u3011\u4e2d\u592e\u5c08\u6848\u7d44\u70ba\u4e2d\u5171\u9ad8\u5c64\u89aa\u5175 \u59cb\u65bc\u6587\u9769 \u4e3b\u8cac\u7279\u5225\u4efb\u52d9|last=\u6797\u88d5\u83ef|first=\u912d\u79cb\u73b2|date=16 June 2016|website=\u9999\u6e2f01|language=zh-HK|access-date=14 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902142837/https://www.hk01.com/%E7%A4%BE%E6%9C%83%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E/26497/%E6%9B%B8%E5%95%86%E5%A4%B1%E8%B9%A4-%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E5%B0%88%E6%A1%88%E7%B5%84%E7%82%BA%E4%B8%AD%E5%85%B1%E9%AB%98%E5%B1%A4%E8%A6%AA%E5%85%B5-%E5%A7%8B%E6%96%BC%E6%96%87%E9%9D%A9-%E4%B8%BB%E8%B2%AC%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5%E4%BB%BB%E5%8B%99|archive-date=2 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"AutoRQ-3\"/> Lam felt he had no choice and signed away his rights of access to a lawyer and to inform family members of his detention.<ref name=hk01-26430/><ref name=\"scmp1976598\"/> During his detention, he was subject to frequent interrogations each lasting around 40 minutes during which he was repeatedly accused of illegally sending banned books to mainland China.<ref name=\"AutoRQ-4\"/>\n\nAfter March 2016, Lam was transferred to [[Shaoguan]], where he worked in a library, but was prevented from leaving the mainland.<ref name=\"hk01-26430\"/><ref name=\"20160616hongkongfp\"/> His release was conditional upon retrieving a hard drive from the bookstore containing lists of readers who had bought books from his business and without divulging any details of his detention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hk01.com/\u793e\u6703\u65b0\u805e/26430/\u6797\u69ae\u57fa\u8b49\u674e\u6ce2\u5728\u6e2f\u88ab\u6349\u8d70-\u611f\u6fc0\u6e2f\u4eba\u4e0a\u8857\u8072\u63f4|script-title=zh:\u6797\u69ae\u57fa\u8b49\u674e\u6ce2\u5728\u6e2f\u88ab\u6349\u8d70 \u611f\u6fc0\u6e2f\u4eba\u4e0a\u8857\u8072\u63f4|last=\u6881\u878d\u8ed2|first=\u912d\u79cb\u73b2, \u9ece\u6893\u7def|date=16 June 2016|website=\u9999\u6e2f01|language=zh-HK|access-date=14 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902142825/https://www.hk01.com/%E7%A4%BE%E6%9C%83%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E/26430/%E6%9E%97%E6%A6%AE%E5%9F%BA%E8%AD%89%E6%9D%8E%E6%B3%A2%E5%9C%A8%E6%B8%AF%E8%A2%AB%E6%8D%89%E8%B5%B0-%E6%84%9F%E6%BF%80%E6%B8%AF%E4%BA%BA%E4%B8%8A%E8%A1%97%E8%81%B2%E6%8F%B4|archive-date=2 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=scmp1976598/> He also stated that his confession on mainland TV in February was scripted, and that Lee Bo, who told him he was \"taken away from Hong Kong\", had also been forced to make a televised confession.<ref name=\"Lam\"/><ref name=hk01-26430/>\n\nLee Bo rejected Lam's assertions the next day, denying that he had told Lam how he ended up in the mainland or that he had handed over the bookstore's list of customers to mainland police.

It has been closed since the disappearance of its fifth staff member, Lee Bo.]]\n\nThe '''Causeway Bay Books disappearances''' are a series of international [[Forced disappearance|disappearances]] concerning five staff members of [[Causeway Bay Books]], a former bookstore located in [[Causeway Bay]], [[Hong Kong]]. Between October and December 2015, five staff of Causeway Bay Books went missing. At least two of them disappeared in [[mainland China]], one in [[Thailand]]. One member was last seen in Hong Kong, and eventually revealed to be in [[Shenzhen]], across the Chinese border, without the travel documents necessary to have crossed the border through legal channels.\n\nIt was widely believed that the booksellers were detained in mainland China,<ref name=20160107guardianpull/><ref name=time4172407/> and in February 2016 [[Guangdong]] provincial authorities confirmed that all five had been taken into custody in relation to an old traffic case involving [[Gui Minhai]].<ref name=time4208964/> While response to the October disappearances had been muted, perhaps in recognition that unexplained disappearances and lengthy [[extrajudicial detention]]s are known to occur in mainland China,<ref name=bigstory1/> the unprecedented disappearance of a person in Hong Kong, and the bizarre events surrounding it, shocked the city and crystallised international concern over the possible abduction of Hong Kong citizens by [[Chinese public security bureau]] officials and their likely [[extraordinary rendition|rendition]], and the violation of several articles {{clarify|date=January 2019}} of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]]. In his report to the British government and parliament in early January 2016, foreign secretary [[Philip Hammond]] said the incident was \"a serious breach of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on Hong Kong and undermines the principle of [[one country, two systems]]\".<ref name=20160212theguardian/><ref name=bbc35557226/>\n\nFollowing the international focus on the disappearances, there were virtual reappearances by two of the missing men, Lee Bo, in the form of letters and photographs, and Gui Minhai, in a confessional video broadcast on national television, in which they insisted that their return to [[mainland China]] was voluntary but which failed to account for their movement across national borders. These efforts were widely derided by commentators as a farce and a charade, as they failed to satisfy concerns over the breach of \"one country, two systems\" and its practical and constitutional implications.<ref name=ejinsight20160129/><ref name=20160111vohk/>\n\nOn 16 June 2016, shortly after he returned to Hong Kong, [[Lam Wing-kee]] gave a long press conference in the presence of legislator [[Albert Ho]] in which he detailed the circumstances surrounding his eight-month detention, and describing how his confession and those of his associates had been scripted and stage-managed. Lam indicated the involvement of the [[Central Investigation Team]], which is under direct control of the highest level of the Beijing leadership. His revelations stunned Hong Kong and made headlines worldwide, prompting a flurry of counter-accusations and denials from mainland authorities and supporters.<ref name=\"AutoRQ-1\"/><ref name=20160616hongkongfp/>\n\n==Background==\nCauseway Bay Books (\u9285\u947c\u7063\u66f8\u5e97), located in [[Causeway Bay]], Hong Kong, was founded in 1994 by Lam Wing-kee.<ref name=nextmedia54595242/> It was one of about 110 independent Hong Kong bookshops that rent out space in upstairs locations to avoid high rents at street level.<ref name=20160108hongkongfp/> The bookstore sold a number of political books that are considered sensitive and banned in mainland China. [[Freedom of speech]] in Hong Kong is protected under [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]] Article 27, and these independent publishers thrive as they cater predominantly to people interested in the machinations of mainland politics.<ref name=time4172407/><ref name=nextmedia54595242/><ref name=20160108hongkongfp/> The bookstore became popular amongst mainland Chinese tourists for this reason.<ref name=nextmedia54595242/><ref name=20160108hongkongfp/><ref name=bbc34782266/> In 2014, the bookstore was sold to Mighty Current Media Company Limited (\u5de8\u6d41\u50b3\u5a92\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), a publishing house. During the time of the disappearances, the company had three shareholders: Gui Minhai, Sophie Choi and Lui Bo.{{r|Initium}} According to industry sources, Mighty Current is a prolific publisher with a number of publishing subsidiaries, and this group may be responsible for 30 to 60 percent of the output of salacious books about Chinese political figures that are widely available at newsstands and in book stores, including one at Hong Kong International Airport.<ref name=20160105nytimes/>\n\nAround the time of the disappearances, Gui Minhai was rumoured to have been working on a book regarding current CPC general secretary [[Xi Jinping]]'s personal love history, tentatively named ''Xi and His Six Women'' (\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\u548c\u4ed6\u7684\u516d\u500b\u5973\u4eba). The project was suggested to be linked to the disappearances.<ref name=20160107guardianpull/><ref name=20160105theguardian/><ref name=20160120nytimes/> The publishing house had also already gone to press with a book entitled ''2017: Upheaval in China'', but it was withdrawn by the author before publication.<ref name=20160120nytimes/>\n\nIn late 2013, Yiu Man-tin (\u59da\u6587\u7530), founder and chief editor of Morning Bell Press (\u6668\u9418\u66f8\u5c40) and a Hong Kong resident, was arrested in Shenzhen after he had been tricked there.<ref name=ejinsight20160104/><ref name=20140129nytimes/>{{r|Initium}} He was known to have been preparing to publish book by a Chinese writer residing in the US about Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping, entitled ''Godfather of China, Xi Jinping'' (\u4e2d\u570b\u6559\u7236\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73).<ref name=20140129nytimes/> Yiu was arrested by police in Shenzhen on charges of falsely labelling and smuggling industrial chemicals worth $220,000 in 2010 and was sentenced to prison for 10 years allegedly for smuggling, even though the real reason for the trumped up charges, in the eyes of many, was China's increasing restrictions on political expression under Xi.<ref name=ejinsight20160104/><ref name=20140129nytimes/> Two Hong Kong magazine publishers, Wong Kin-man and Wo Chung-hau, were arrested and tried in November 2015 for running an illegal business in China after sending copies of a political magazine to people on the mainland.{{r|Initium}}<ref name=20151109guardian/>\n\nChinese [[PEN International|PEN Center]] director [[Bei Ling]] alerted ''Apple Daily'' to Lee Bo's disappearance, and the journal reported on 1 January 2016 that Lee had become the fifth member of Causeway Bay Books to disappear. His wife was unwilling to speak to the press at the time, but filed a missing person's report with the Hong Kong police the following day.<ref name=20160105ejinsightunanswered/><ref name=nextmedia54599826/>\n\n=== Guangdong Action Plan ===\nAccording to ''The Sunday Times'', the mainland authorities had issued instructions on 25 April 2015 to eradicate illegal publications and those containing sexual content. ''The Sunday Times'' published what was described to be an alleged internal Communist Party document entitled \"Guangdong Action Plan\", a summary of which had been circulating in journalistic and political circles the previous week, and the full document gives apparent authorisation for excursions by Guangdong enforcers targeting authors, publishers and booksellers. In it, 14 publishing houses and 21 publications in Hong Kong were named.<ref name=thesundaytimes1659622 /><ref name=mingjingnews32000001467 />\n\n==Disappearances==\n'''Lui Bo''' (\u5442\u6ce2, age {{Age in years|1970}}) is the manager and one of the three shareholders of Mighty Current.

Lee Bo's wife has written a column for 20 years under the pen name of Syu Fei at ''[[Ta Kung Pao]]'' \u2013 owned by the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR|Liaison Office]]; Lee worked at [[Joint Publishing]] until he started work at the bookstore.{{R|20160111hongkongfpcolumn}} Since the disappearances of four of his colleagues, he had been doing anonymous interviews with [[BBC]] and various media. After the arrest of Yiu Man-tin and the disappearance of three of his colleagues, Lee went on record to say that their motive was purely economic, and that not setting foot in the mainland was the cost to bear for being in the publishing business.{{R|nextmedia329472}} Lee was last seen on 30 December 2015, while delivering books in [[Chai Wan]] to a certain unknown client.{{r|Lee1}} Choi, who had been expecting Lee home for dinner at around 7.15&nbsp;pm on 30 December, raised the alarm when he failed to return home.{{R|nextmedia54599826|20160103hongkongfp|bbc35219260}} Lee had apparently received an order for about ten books from a new customer and had arranged to hand them over in person that night.{{R|nextmedia54599826}} He descended his building in a lift with at least eight other people at around 6&nbsp;pm, and witnesses saw him being pushed by a group of men into a minivan, which sped away the moment he was securely on board.{{R|mingpao1452534776}} Choi, Lee Bo's wife, later received a telephone call from him from a Shenzhen number.{{R|nextmedia54599826|bbc35219260}} Uncharacteristically speaking in [[Mandarin Chinese]] and apparently with someone whispering over his shoulder,{{R|nextmedia54599826}} Lee said that he had to go to the mainland on urgent business and that he would not be back home for some time. He assured her that he was well but assisting with investigations. His wife was told to be discreet.{{r|20160105ejinsightunanswered|nextmedia54599826}} The Immigration Department has no record of Lee having left Hong Kong,{{R|ejinsight20160104}} and Hong Kong does not have any [[extradition]] agreement with the PRC.{{R|20160105nytimes}} The fact that his [[Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents|home return permit]] was left at home led many to fear that he may have somehow been abducted by the mainland [[Chinese public security bureau|public security bureau]] and [[Extraordinary rendition|rendition]]ed to [[Shenzhen]]. His disappearance is the only known disappearance that occurred in Hong Kong territory, and thus sparked even more concern on whether the integrity of \"one country, two systems\" is being maintained.{{R|bbc35219260|mingpao1451585098799|metrohk299289|nextmedia19436390|Ming1451757876466}}\n\n==Reactions to Lee Bo's disappearance==\n=== Local ===\n[[File:Kidnap by Kacey Wong.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Kacey Wong]] at the protest against booksellers' disappearances on 10 January with red noose bearing the Chinese characters for \"abduction\" as props]]\nAmongst local media outlets, only ''Apple Daily'' and ''Ming Pao'' ran coverage on their front pages initially, while other local newspapers carried only brief pieces about a missing person. Television viewers remarked that [[TVB]] did not run the story during its prime time news programmes for the first few days after news of the Lee Bo disappearance broke.<ref name=\"20160104ejinsight-howsafe\"/> Lee Bo's disappearance spurred renewed interest about Lam Wing-kee, and his family received a police visit the same day after chief executive CY Leung spoke publicly on the case.<ref name=mingpao1452017341/>\n\nHong Kong's Chief Secretary [[Carrie Lam (politician)|Carrie Lam]] said that the Hong Kong government cares about the well-being of its people, and assured the public that police were working on the case.<ref name=20160103hongkongfp/> [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[CY Leung]] stated in a press conference on 4 January 2016 that if mainland Chinese law officials were operating in Hong Kong, it would be \"unacceptable\" and a breach of the [[Basic Law]].{{r|CY1}}<ref name=\"20160105nytimes\" /><ref name=\"20160107guardianpull\" /><ref name=\"20160105ejinsightunanswered\" /><ref name=\"ejinsight20160111\" /><ref name=\"yahoo054725278\" /> Article 22 states that no department of the central, provincial, or municipal governments within China may interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region administers on its own.<ref name=basiclaw/> Leung furthermore hoped that \"anyone, especially Lee Bo himself, can provide relevant information\" about his disappearance.<ref name=mingpao1452017341/><ref name=20160105hkfp/><ref name=ejinsight20160109/> In January 2016, after it was revealed that all five men were in mainland China, Lam expressed confidence in the sincerity and goodwill of the PRC government, and said that Lee Bo's disappearance was an isolated case that needed a swift resolution, but it did not amount to a breakdown of one country two systems.<ref name=standnews/> The American Chamber of Commerce asserted that with the rule of law, Hong Kong was still a preferable springboard to invest from, compared with Shanghai or Beijing, but nevertheless expressed concern at the disappearances.<ref name=rthk1237613/>\n\nLeading pro-establishment figures cast doubt on the mainland's supposed role in the disappearances:<ref name=ejinsight20160111/> [[Ip Kwok-him]] said that it was possible to use mainland telephone lines in Hong Kong, so the phone call from a Shenzhen number did not necessarily mean Lee was in the mainland; he added that there was no evidence of abduction. After Lee's wife cancelled her police report, [[Yiu Si-wing]] disputed the need for LegCo to discuss his disappearance due to the cancellation; [[Michael Tien]] said that if Lee had voluntarily gone to the mainland, it could not be a question of mainland officials acting across the border; [[Wong Kwok-kin]] said that kidnappers demand ransoms and not cancellation of missing persons reports.<ref name=nextmedia19445201/> [[Regina Ip]] said it was odd that Lee would be able to apparently telephone his wife freely if he was in custody, unlike if he was detained in Hong Kong.<ref name=hkej1215102/> [[Ng Leung-sing]], during a [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]] discussion, claimed to have received a tip from \"an old friend\" that all five booksellers had taken clandestine speedboats to Wai Lingding Island ([[:zh:\u5916\u4f36\u4ec3\u5cf6|\u5916\u4f36\u4ec3\u5cf6]]), an island south of Hong Kong that is administratively part of mainland China with no border facilities, and had been arrested for seeking prostitutes.{{r|Ng1}} The allegations of prostitution, criticised by pro-democracy figures as [[character assassination]], were carried by TVB on its prime time evening news as the leading item.<ref name=ejinsight20160107a/> Ng later apologised under pressure, saying that he had repeated a rumour without having checked the facts but never mentioned Lee's name.<ref name=20160105nytimes/>{{r|Ng2}} Ng said he was merely trying to state that it was indeed possible to leave Hong Kong without identity documents, and that it was inappropriate to speculate at present. Lee's wife criticised Ng for his insincere apology.<ref name=metrohk299590/>\n\n[[Martin Lee]] said that \"according to all the evidence that has been reported, I believe that Mr. Lee had been taken against his will by certain law enforcement agents from across the border through illegal means\". He described the disappearances as the \"most worrying thing that has happened in Hong Kong since the handover in 1997\".<ref name=ejinsight20160111prominent/> [[Benny Tai]] and former chief secretary [[Anson Chan]] both said the case poses a genuine threat to the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which China ought to uphold. Former legislator [[Margaret Ng]] suggested that Hong Kong's status as a world city was coming into question, and said \"Hong Kong can be deemed to be no longer safe unless we have a clear resolution of the problem\".<ref name=ejinsight20160111prominent/> [[Albert Chan]] said \"this is the first time there has been such a clear violation of Hong Kong's law, a clear violation of 'one country, two systems' principle, that has taken place in such an open manner\", and [[Lee Cheuk-yan]], called the disappearances a \"milestone for suppression\".<ref name=bbc35275309/> [[Joseph Wong]], former secretary for the Hong Kong civil service, also said that the incident will have drastic consequences as foreign confidence in the one country two systems policy may be irreparably damaged, which may in turn jeopardise Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.<ref name=ejinsight20160113/>\n\nOn 10 January, in excess of 6,000 people attended a protest march from the Hong Kong government headquarters in Admiralty to the China Liaison Office in Sai Wan demanding Beijing to respect the one country, two systems agreement to preserve Hong Kong's autonomy.<ref name=ejinsight20160111/><ref name=20160110hongkongfprally/> ''Ta Kung Pao'' announced on the same day that Sophie Choi's regular \"Syu Fei\" column with the paper was temporarily suspended \u2013 a spokesman for the journal said that Choi had advised them just before the new year that she was unable to submit any copy in January.<ref name=20160111hongkongfpcolumn/> The Hong Kong police said that Lee Bo and his wife had met at a guesthouse in China on Saturday, 23 January. Choi acknowledged he was well and that he was \"assisting in an investigation in the capacity of a witness\".<ref name=yahoo054725278/><ref name=rthk1237844/><ref name=20160124newsweek/> After the latest revelation, legislator [[Fernando Cheung]] criticised the CY Leung administration for limpness, remarking that \"up to now the whole handling of the Lee Bo fiasco is being conducted through unofficial means, bypassing the Hong Kong authorities, and Lee Bo seems to be releasing messages under the gun\".<ref name=20160124theguardian/>\n\n=== Authors and other publishers ===\nThe disappearances led to a very severe crisis of confidence within the publishing sector, with many booksellers being afraid to sell such books on mainland politics or featuring gossip on political figures.<ref name=20160114guardian/> As of 7 January 2016, over 500 publishers, writers, booksellers and members of the public had signed an online petition pledging to \"not fear the white terror and uphold the principle of publication freedom\". Some booksellers began to pull anti-China books off shelves.<ref name=reutersspooked/> Singapore-owned [[Page One (bookstore)|Page One]] removed some of the books published by Mighty Current \u2013 in particular many titles focusing on Xi Jinping \u2013 from their retail outlet at [[Hong Kong airport]].<ref name=20160107guardianpull/><ref name=ejinsight20160106pageone/> The head of Open Publishing decided to abort the publication of ''Xi Jinping's Nightmare'', which had already come back from the printers.<ref name=latimes20160120/> The author was unable to find a publisher in Hong Kong, and has gone to Taiwan.<ref name=20160114guardian/> Richard Charkin, president of the International Publishers Association expressed \"deep concern\" for the missing men and called for their safe return home. He added that the disappearances \"immediately raise dire questions about the Chinese government's commitment to freedom to publish\".<ref name=20160114guardian/>\n\nOn the other hand, US-based writer Xi Nuo ({{zh|\u897f\u8afe|labels=no}}) released his book ''Xi Jinping and His Lovers'' that was turned down by Gui Minhai the previous year after he had received a visit from a Chinese government agent. Xi Nuo says his decision to publish the book was to challenge the Chinese authorities. \"I want to tell the Chinese authorities and [[Xi Jinping]], the president of China, that you are wrong.

They trade in fear.\"<ref name=20160118wapo /><ref name=qz596565 /> Following China Central Television's release of videotaped confessions from Gui Minhai \u2013 and of Swedish NGO staffer Peter Dahlin, [[Reporters Without Borders]] condemned China's \"dissemination of forced 'confessions' that have no informational value\". The organisation urged the EU to sanction CCTV and Xinhua for \"knowingly peddling lies and statements presumably obtained under duress\".<ref name=yahoo082607414 /> Hong Kong's chief executive said that he was unable to act as \"the Gui Minhai case has not been reported to the Hong Kong police or the government\".<ref name=20151208guardian /><ref name=time4183967 />\n\nThe Swedish foreign ministry said an envoy had visited Gui in February,<ref name=\":0\"/> but Swedish diplomats had not been given access to him since.<ref name=\"scmp1966843\"/>\n\nOn October 2017, he was formally released and ended up living in the eastern city of Ningbo, under heavy police presence and surveillance. In January 2018, Gui was travelling to Beijing for a medical exam at the Swedish embassy, accompanying him were two Swedish diplomats from the Swedish Consulate in Shanghai. Before reaching Beijing, 10 men in plain clothes kidnapped him away yet again in front of the diplomats. Chinese officials said that he was seized for allegedly sharing secret information with Swedish diplomats and of meeting them illegally.

Swedish authorities denied authorising the negotiations.

He held to the story that was in the letters published by ''Sing Tao'', saying he \"resorted to illegal immigration\" to get to the mainland \"to cooperate in a judicial investigation\" as he did not want to draw attention to his visit. He denied that he was kidnapped, but did not give details as to how he actually entered Mainland China without his travel documents.

{"title_page": "Planets in astrology", "text_new": "{{astrology}}\n\n'''Planets in [[astrology]]''' have a meaning different from the modern [[astronomy|astronomical]] understanding of [[definition of planet|what a planet is]]. Before the [[scientific revolution|age]] of [[telescope]]s, the [[night sky]] was thought to consist of two very similar components: [[fixed stars]], which remained motionless in relation to each other, and \"wandering stars\" ({{lang-grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}} ''asteres planetai''), which moved relative to the fixed stars over the course of the year.\n\nTo the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and the other earliest astronomers, this group consisted of the five [[planet]]s visible to the [[naked eye]] and excluded [[Earth]]. Although strictly, the term ''planet'' applied only to those five [[astronomical object|objects]], the term was latterly broadened, particularly in the [[Middle Ages]], to include the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] (sometimes referred to as \"Lights\"<ref>Hone (1978), p.22</ref>), making a total of seven planets. Astrologers retain this definition today.\n\nTo ancient astrologers, the planets represented the will of the [[gods]] and their direct influence upon human affairs. To modern astrologers, the planets can represent basic drives or urges in the unconscious,<ref>Hone (1978) p. 19</ref> or energy flow regulators representing dimensions of experience.<ref>Arroyo (1989) pp. 7, 27</ref> They express themselves with different qualities in the twelve [[astrological sign|signs]] of the [[zodiac]] and in the twelve [[astrological house|houses]]. The planets are also related to each other in the form of [[astrological aspect|aspects]].\n\nModern astrologers differ on the source of the correlations between planetary positions and configurations, on the one hand, and characteristics and destinies of the natives, on the other. Hone writes that the planets exert it directly through [[gravitation]] or another, unknown influence.<ref>Hone (1978), p.19 8th paragraph</ref> Others hold that the planets have no direct influence in themselves, but are mirrors of basic organizing principles in the [[universe]]. In other words, the basic patterns of the universe repeat themselves everywhere, in [[fractal]]-like fashion, and \"as above, so below\".<ref>Copenhaver, Brian P. (1992) Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation with Notes and Introduction, Cambridge University Press: New York, NY.</ref> Therefore, the patterns that the planets make in the sky reflect the ebb and flow of basic human impulses. The planets are also associated, especially in the Chinese tradition, with the basic forces of nature.\n\nListed below are the specific meanings and domains associated with the astrological planets since ancient times, with the main focus on the Western astrological tradition. The planets in [[Hindu astrology]] are known as the [[Navagraha]] or \"nine realms\". In [[Chinese astrology]], the planets are associated with the life forces of yin and yang and the five [[Wu xing|elements]], which play an important role in the Chinese form of geomancy known as [[Feng Shui]]. Astrologers differ on the signs associated with each planet's [[exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]].\n\n==Planetary symbolism==\n{{main article|Astrological symbol}}\nThis table shows the astrological planets (as distinct from the astronomical) and the Greek and Roman deities associated with them. In most cases, the English name for planets derives from the name of a Roman god or goddess. Also of interest is the conflation of the Roman god with a similar Greek god. In some cases, it is the same deity with two different names.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!|Planet\n!|[[Astrological symbols|Symbol]]\n!|[[Roman mythology|Roman deity]]\n!|[[Greek mythology|Greek God]]\n!|[[Babylonian astrology|Babylonian God]]\n!Ancient Armenian names of planets and names of Gods\n!|[[Vedic mythology|Hindu God]]\n!|Connection\n!|Meaning (European)\n!|Meaning (Vedic)\n|----\n|[[Sun]]\n|[[File:Sun symbol.svg|20px|Sol]]\n|[[Sol Invictus|Sol]]<br>\n|\u1f2d\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ''([[Helios]])''<br>\u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd ''([[Apollo]])''\n|[[Shamash]]\n|\u0531\u0580\u0587 (Arev)\n\u0531\u0580\u0565\u0563 (Areg)\n\n\u0531\u0580\u0565\u0563\u0561 (Aregak)\n\n\u0531\u0580\u0583\u056b (Ar\u00fei)\n|\u0938\u0942\u0930\u094d\u092f ''([[Surya]])''\n|ancient\n|God of Prophecy and Solar Incarnation<br>Helios means \"sun.\"\n|The Sun God<br />Associated with ego, sense of purpose, and vitality. <br />Son of Aditi and Kashyap; Surya means \"the supreme light.\"\n|----\n|----EARTH\n|[[Moon]]\n|[[File:Moon symbol crescent.svg|20px|First quarter moon]]\n|[[Luna (goddess)|Luna]]<br>[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]\n|\u03a3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 ''([[Selene]])''<br>\u1f0c\u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2 ''([[Artemis]])''\n|[[Sin (mythology)|Sin]]\n|\u053c\u0578\u0582\u057d\u056b\u0576 (Lusin)\n\u0531\u0580\u056e\u056b\u0576 (Ar\u0107in)\n\n\u0539\u0561\u056d\u056e\u0561\u0576 (\u0164ax\u0107an)\n|\u091a\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 ''([[Chandra]])''\n|ancient\n|Goddess of Hunting and Lunar Incarnation<br>Selene means \"moon.\"\n| The Moon Goddess<br />Associated with emotions, the mother, and motherly instincts. <br />Chandra means \"shining.\"\n|----\n|[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]\n|[[File:Mercury symbol.svg|20px|Mercury]]\n|[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]\n|\u02bd\u1f19\u03c1\u03bc\u1fc6\u03c2 (''[[Hermes]]'')\n|[[Nabu]]\n|\u053c\u0578\u0582\u056e (Lu\u0107)\n\u0553\u0561\u0575\u056c\u0561\u056e\u0578\u0582 (\u00deayla\u0107u)\n\n\u0555\u057f\u0561\u0580\u056b\u057f (Otarit)\n\n\u0535\u0580\u0574\u0578\u0582 (Yermu)\n\n\u0544\u056b\u0570\u0580 (Mihr)\n|\u092c\u0941\u0927 ''([[Budha]])''\n|ancient\n|God of messengers, travel, and/or commerce.\n|A planet god known for his preserving and protecting nature to mankind and manhood.

They are the Moon, Mercury, Venus, The Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Sometimes, the Sun and Moon were referred to as \"the lights\" or the \"[[luminary (astrology)|luminaries]]\". [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] and [[Uranus]] can also just be seen with the naked eye, though no ancient culture appears to have taken note of them. The Classical planets fit neatly into the theories of [[Aristotle]] and [[Ptolemy]], they each are part of a [[Celestial sphere]]. The order of the Classical planets is determined by the rate of speed. The Moon moves the fastest and so she is considered to form the first celestial sphere above earth. Everything below the moon is part of the [[sublunary sphere]]. Mercury moves the second fastest and so he rules the next highest sphere.  Next is Venus, who takes about 260 days to revolve around the Sun. Following that is the Sun, then Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. \n\n[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|Conceptual framework for classical astrology]]\nThe astrological descriptions attached to the seven classical planets have been preserved since ancient times. Astrologers call the seven classical planets \"the seven personal and social planets\", because they are said to represent the basic human drives of every individual. The personal planets are the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. The social or transpersonal planets are Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter and Saturn are often called the first of the \"transpersonal\" or \"transcendent\" planets as they represent a transition from the inner personal planets to the outer modern, impersonal planets. The outer modern planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are often called the collective or transcendental planets.<ref>Michael Meyer at khaldea.com, Rob Hand \"Horoscope Symbols\"</ref> The following is a list of the planets and their associated characteristics.<ref>Jeff Mayo, ''Teach Yourself Astrology'', pp. 17\u201328, Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1964; Sasha Fenton ''Understanding Astrology'', pp. 106\u2013112, The Aquarian Press (Harper Collins), London, 1991; Derek and Julia Parker, ''The New Compleat Astrologer'', pp. 86\u201399, Crescent Books, New York, 1971; Maritha Pottinger ''Astro Essentials'', pp. 11\u201314, 17\u201318, ACS Publications, San Diego, 1991</ref>\n\n===Moon===\n[[File:Patera di Parabiago - MI - Museo archeologico - Diana - Luna - 25-7-2003 - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 25-7-2003.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Luna or Diana, wearing a crescent-moon crown and driving her ox-drawn chariot ''([[biga (chariot)|biga]])'', on the [[Parabiago plate]] (2nd\u20135th centuries AD)]]\n\nThe [[Moon]] ([[File:Moon symbol crescent.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] and is exalted in [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]]. In classical Roman mythology, the Moon was [[Luna (mythology)|Luna]], at times identified with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. The Moon is large enough for its gravity to affect the Earth, stabilizing its orbit and producing the regular ebb and flow of the tides. The [[lunar day]] syncs up with its orbit around Earth in such a manner that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth and the other side, known as the \"[[far side of the Moon]]\" faces towards space.\n[[File:FullMoon2010.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Full Moon]]\n\nAstrologically speaking, the Moon is associated with a person's intuition, emotional make-up, [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] habits, rhythms, memories, moods and their ability to react and adapt to those around them. It is associated for some with the mother, maternal instincts or the urge to nurture, the home, the need for security and the past, especially early experiences and childhood. The 1st-century poet Manilius described the Moon, or ''Luna'', as melancholic. In medicine, the Moon is associated with the digestive system, stomach, breasts, the ovaries and menstruation (which does occur on a monthly cycle)<ref>Back de Sarany, G\u00e9za Ibid., 37.</ref> and the pancreas. Despite Manilius's assignation, the Moon is commonly associated with the [[phlegmatic]] humor; it ruled the [[animal spirit]]s. In modern astrology, the Moon is the primary native ruler of the fourth house, but traditionally it had its joy in the twelfth house.\n\nThe Moon or ''Luna'' is associated with Monday, the word Monday comes from the Old English word for Moon day or Moon's day, and in Romance languages, the name for Monday comes from ''luna'' (e.g., ''luni'' in Romanian, ''lundi'' in French, ''lunes'' in Spanish and ''lunedi'' in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated the Moon with the liberal art of [[grammar]].\n\nIn [[Chinese astrology]], the Moon represents [[Feng Shui#Yin and Yang|Yin]], the passive and receptive feminine life principle. In [[Indian astrology]], the Moon is called [[Chandra]] or [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] and represents the mind, queenship and mother. The north [[lunar node]] (called [[Rahu]]) and the south [[lunar node]] (called [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]) are considered to be of particular importance and are given an equal place alongside the seven classical planets as part of the nine [[navagraha]].\n\n===Mercury===\n[[File:Giambologna-mercurio6.jpg|thumb|upright|''Flying Mercury'' (late 16th-century) by [[Giambologna]]]]\n[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] ([[File:Mercury symbol.svg|15px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] and is exalted in [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]. In classical Roman mythology, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] is the messenger of the gods, noted for his speed and swiftness. Echoing this, the scorching, airless world Mercury circles the Sun on the fastest orbit of any planet. Mercury takes only 88 days to orbit the Sun, spending about 7.33 days in each sign of the zodiac. Mercury is so close to the Sun that only a brief period exists after the Sun has set where it can be seen with the naked eye, before following the Sun beyond the horizon.<ref>https://theastrocodex.com/2017/07/20/mercury-rulership-exaltation-detriment-fall/</ref>\n\nAstrologically speaking, Mercury represents the principles of communication, mentality, thinking patterns, rationality and reasoning, and adaptability and variability. Mercury governs schooling and education, the immediate environment of neighbors, siblings and cousins, transport over short distances, messages and forms of communication such as post, email and telephone, newspapers, journalism and writing, information gathering skills and physical dexterity. The 1st-century poet [[Marcus Manilius]] described Mercury as an inconstant, vivacious and curious planet.\n\n[[File:Mercury in color - Prockter07 centered.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]]]\nIn medicine, Mercury is associated with the nervous system, the brain, the respiratory system, the thyroid and the sense organs. It is traditionally held to be essentially cold and dry, according to its placement in the zodiac and in any aspects to other planets.\n\nIn modern astrology, Mercury is regarded as the ruler of the third house; traditionally, it had the joy in the eleventh house. Mercury is the messenger of the gods in mythology. It is the planet of day-to-day expression and relationships. Mercury's action is to take things apart and put them back together again. It is an opportunistic planet, decidedly unemotional and curious.\n\nMercury rules over Wednesday. In Romance languages, the word for Wednesday is often similar to Mercury (''miercuri'' in Romanian, ''mercredi'' in French, ''miercoles'' in Spanish and ''mercoled\u00ec'' in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated Mercury with the liberal art of [[dialectic]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nIn Chinese astrology Mercury represents [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]], the fourth element, therefore symbolizing communication, intelligence, and elegance.\n\n===Venus===\n[[File:Cardiff castle - Turm 3 Venus.jpg|thumb|upright|Venus, wearing the sign of Libra on her midsection, and Taurus at her feet, at [[Cardiff Castle]], [[Wales]]]]\n[[Venus]] ([[File:Venus symbol.svg|22px]]) is the traditional ruling planet of [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] and [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] and is exalted in [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]. In classical Roman mythology, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] is the goddess of love and beauty, famous for the passions she could stir among the gods. Her cults may represent the religiously legitimate charm and seduction of the divine by mortals, in contrast to the formal, contractual relations between most members of Rome's official pantheon and the state, and the unofficial, illicit manipulation of divine forces through magic. The ambivalence of her function is suggested in the etymological relationship of the root *venes- with Latin venenum (poison, venom), in the sense of \"a charm, magic philtre\".\n\nVenus orbits the Sun in 225 days, spending about 18.75 days in each sign of the zodiac. Venus is the second-brightest object in the night sky, the Moon being the brightest. It is usually beheld as a twin planet to Earth.\n\nAstrologically speaking, Venus is associated with the principles of harmony, beauty, refinement, affections, and the urge to sympathize and unite with others. It is involved with the desire for pleasure, comfort and ease. It governs romantic relations, marriage and business partnerships, sex (the origin of the words 'venery' and 'venereal'), the arts, fashion and social life. The 1st-century poet Marcus Manilius described Venus as generous and fecund and the lesser [[Benefic planet|benefic]].\n\n[[File:Venus-real color.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Venus]]]]\nThe planet [[Venus]] in medicine is associated with the lumbar region, the veins, parathyroids, throat and kidneys. Venus was thought to be moderately warm and moist and was associated with the [[phlegmatic]] humor. In modern astrology, Venus is the ruler of the seventh house; traditionally, it had the joy in the fourth house.\n\nVenus is the planet of Friday. In languages deriving from Latin, such as Romanian, Spanish, French, and Italian, the word for Friday often resembles the word Venus (''vineri'', ''viernes'', ''vendredi'' and ''venerd\u00ec'' respectively). Dante Alighieri associated Venus with the liberal art of [[rhetoric]].<ref>New Yorker, 20 May 2013.</ref> In [[Chinese astrology]], Venus is associated with the element [[metal (classical element)|metal]], which is unyielding, strong and persistent. In [[Indian astrology]], Venus is known as [[Shukra]] and represents wealth, pleasure and reproduction.

In classical Greek mythology, the Sun was represented by the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and [[Helios]] (Roman [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], and later by [[Apollo (mythology)|Apollo]], the god of light). The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, around which the Earth and other planets revolve and provides us with heat and light. The arc that the Sun travels in every year, rising and setting in a slightly different place each day, is therefore in reality a reflection of the Earth's own orbit around the Sun. This arc is larger the farther north or south from the equator latitude, giving a more extreme difference between day and night and between seasons during the year. The Sun travels through the twelve signs of the zodiac on its annual journey, spending about a month in each. The Sun's position on a person's birthday therefore determines what is usually called his or her \"sun\" sign. However, the sun sign allotment varies between Western (sign change around 22-23 of every month) and Hindu astrology (sign change around 14-15 of every month) due the different systems of planetary calculations, following the [[Tropical zodiac|tropical]] and [[Sidereal zodiac|sidereal]] definitions respectively.\n[[File:Sun920607.jpg|100px|thumb|left|The [[Sun]], the star at the center of the [[Solar System]]]]\nAstrologically speaking, the Sun is usually thought to represent the conscious [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]], the [[self (psychology)|self]] and its expression, personal power, pride and authority, leadership qualities and the principles of creativity, spontaneity, health and vitality, the sum of which is named the \"life force\". One of the first recorded references to Sun worship is from the [[Mesopotamian Religion]] and described in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]. The 1st-century poet [[Marcus Manilius]] in his epic, 8000-verse poem, ''Astronomica'', described the [[Sun]], or ''[[Sol (mythology)|Sol]]'', as benign and favorable. In medicine, the Sun is associated with the heart, circulatory system,<ref>Back de Surany, G\u00e9za. Manual de Astrolog\u00eda M\u00e9dica. \u00cdndigo.1988. 214 p\u00e1ginas, p. 32</ref> and the thymus. Additionally, humans depend on the sun to produce and obtain [[vitamin D]]; an important supplement aiding the body's immune system and bone health. In [[Ayurveda]], it rules over life-force ('''praan-shakti'''), governs bile temperament ('''pitta'''), stomach, bones and eyes. In modern astrology, the Sun is the primary native ruler of the fifth house, but traditionally it had its joy in the ninth house.\n\nThe Sun is associated with Sunday. [[Dante Alighieri]] associated the Sun with the [[liberal arts|liberal art]] of music. In [[Chinese astrology]], the Sun represents [[Feng Shui#Yin and Yang|Yang]], the active, assertive masculine life principle.\n\n===Mars===\n[[File:Muhammad ibn Muhammad Shakir Ruzmah-'i Nathani - Symbol of Mars - Walters W65914B - Full Page.jpg|thumb|upright|Early 18th-century illustration of Mars ''(al-mirrikh)'' for the Bestiary of [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] ''([[Walters Art Museum]])'']]\n[[Mars]] ([[File:Mars symbol.svg|22px]]) is the traditional ruling planet of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] and [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] and is exalted in [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]].

Both the soil of Mars and the hemoglobin of human blood are rich in iron and because of this they share its distinct deep red color.<ref name=\"Henbestibid\">Henbest, ibid</ref> He was second in importance only to Jupiter and Saturn, due to Mars being the most prominent of the military gods worshipped by the Roman legions. \n\nMars orbits the Sun in 687 days, spending about 57.25 days in each sign of the zodiac. It is also the first planet that orbits outside of Earth's orbit, making it the first planet that does not set along with the Sun. Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25\u201330% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO<sub>2</sub> ice (dry ice).\n\nAstrologically speaking, Mars is associated with confidence and self-assertion, aggression, confrontation, sexuality, energy, strength, ambition and impulsiveness. Mars governs sports, competitions and physical activities in general. The 1st-century poet Manilius, described the planet as ardent and as the lesser [[Malefic planet|malefic]]. In medicine, Mars presides over the [[sex organ|genitals]], the muscular system, the gonads and adrenal glands. It was traditionally held to be hot and excessively dry and ruled the [[choleric]] humor. It was associated with fever, accidents, trauma, pain and surgery.\n\n[[File:Mars Hubble.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Mars]]]]\nIn modern astrology, Mars is the primary native ruler of the first house. Traditionally however, Mars ruled both the third and tenth houses, and had its joy in the fifth house. While Venus tends to the overall relationship atmosphere, Mars is the passionate impulse and action, the masculine aspect, discipline, willpower and stamina.\n\nMars is associated with Tuesday and in Romance languages the word for Tuesday often resembles Mars (in Romanian, ''mar\u0163i'', in Spanish, ''martes'', in French, ''mardi'' and in Italian \"marted\u00ec\"). The English \"Tuesday\" is a modernised form of \"Tyr's Day\", Tyr being the Germanic analogue to Mars. Dante Alighieri associated Mars with the liberal art of [[arithmetic]]. In Chinese astrology, Mars is ruled by the element [[fire (classical element)|fire]], which is passionate, energetic and adventurous. In [[Indian astrology]], Mars is called [[Mangala]] and represents energy, confidence and ego. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n===Jupiter===<!-- This section is linked from [[Jupiter]] -->\n[[File:Fotothek df tg 0004463 Astronomie ^ Planet ^ Symbol.jpg|thumb|Jupiter enthroned, with the symbols of Pisces and Sagittarius at his feet ([[woodcut]] by [[Johannes Regiomontanus]], 1512)]]\n[[Jupiter]] ([[File:Jupiter symbol.svg|22px]]) is the traditional ruling planet of [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] and it is exalted in [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]].

Furthermore, Jupiter is usually the fourth-brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the Moon and Venus).\n\nAstrologically speaking, Jupiter is associated with the principles of growth, expansion, healing, prosperity, good fortune, and miracles. Jupiter governs long distance and foreign travel, big business and wealth, higher education, religion, and the law. It is also associated with the urge for freedom and exploration, as well with gambling and merrymaking.\n\n[[File:Jupiter.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Jupiter]] ]]\nThe 1st-century poet Manilius described Jupiter as temperate and benign, and the greater [[Benefic planet|benefic]]. It was regarded as warm and moist in nature, and therefore favorable to life. In medicine, Jupiter is associated with the liver, pituitary gland, and the disposition of fats; it governed the [[Humorism|sanguine]] humor. In modern astrology, Jupiter is the primary native ruler of the ninth house, but traditionally, Jupiter was assigned to both the second and ninth houses: the house of values and the house of beliefs, respectively, and had its joy in the second house of good luck.\n\nJupiter is associated with Thursday, and in Romance languages, the name for Thursday often comes from Jupiter (e.g., ''joi'' in Romanian, ''jeudi'' in French, ''jueves'' in Spanish, and ''gioved\u00ec'' in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated Jupiter with the liberal art of [[geometry]]. In Chinese astrology, Jupiter is ruled by the element [[wood (classical element)|wood]], which is patient, hard-working, and reliable.

In classical Roman mythology, [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] is the god of seeds, crops, and the harvest (agriculture), leader of the titans, father and founder of civilizations, social order, and conformity. The glyph is shaped like a scythe, but it is known as the \"crescent below the cross\", whereas Jupiter's glyph is the \"crescent above the cross\". Famous rings of the planet Saturn that enclose and surround it, reflect the idea of human limits. Saturn takes 29.5 years to orbit the Sun, spending about 2.46 years in each sign of the zodiac. During ancient Roman society, the Romans worshipped [[Saturn]] as the highest ranking and most important god among their pantheon of deities, sharing that same prestige with Jupiter.\n\nAstrologically speaking, [[Saturn]] is associated with focus, precision, nobility, ethics, civility, lofty goals, career, great achievements, dedication, authority figures, stability, virtues, productiveness, valuable hard lessons learned, destiny, structures, protective roles, balance, conservatism, and karma (reaping what you have sowed or divine cosmic justice) but with limitations, restrictions, boundaries, anxiety, tests, practicality, reality, and time. It concerns a person's sense of duty, commitment, responsibility, including their physical and emotional endurance in times of hardships. Saturn is fundamentally economical. Also represents the part of a person's concern with long-term planning or foresight. [[Saturn return|The Return of Saturn]] is said to mark significant events in each person's life. According to the 1st-century poet Manilius, Saturn is sad, morose, and cold, and is the greater [[Malefic planet|malefic]].

Meanings have had to be assigned to them by modern astrologers, usually according to the major events that occurred in the world at the time of their discovery. As these astrologers are usually Western, the social and historical events they describe have an inevitable Western emphasis. Astrologers consider the \"extra-Saturnian\" planets to be \"impersonal\" or [[generational planet|generational]] planets, meaning their effects are felt more across whole generations of society. Their effects in individuals depend upon how strongly they feature in that individual's birth-chart.

In classical Greek mythology, Uranus is the personification of the sky. The planet Uranus is very unusual among the planets in that it rotates on its side, so that it presents each of its poles to the Sun in turn during its orbit; causing both hemispheres to alternate between being bathed in light and lying in total darkness over the course of the orbit.\n\nUranus takes 84 years to orbit the Sun, spending about 7 years in each sign of the zodiac. Uranus was discovered to be a planet only in 1781 by [[Sir William Herschel]].\n\nAstrological interpretations associate Uranus with the principles of ingenuity, new or unconventional ideas, individuality, discoveries, electricity, inventions, democracy, and revolutions. Uranus, among all planets, most governs genius.\n\n[[File:Uranus2.jpg|100px|thumb|left|The planet [[Uranus]]]]\nUranus governs societies, clubs, and any group based on humanitarian or progressive ideals.

Uranus is also associated with Wednesday, alongside Mercury (since Uranus is in the higher octave of Mercury).\n\nIn art and literature, the discovery of Uranus coincided with the Romantic movement, which emphasized individuality and freedom of creative expression. Additionally, it is often linked to an individual's animal spirit.{{According to whom|date=September 2019}} When it comes to medicine, Uranus is believed to be particularly associated with the sympathetic nervous system, mental disorders, breakdowns and hysteria, spasms, and cramps.

It is also associated with [[nuclear armament]] due to such weapons using [[plutonium]], which was named after the dwarf planet. Nuclear research had its genesis in the 1930s and 40s and later gave rise to the polarized nuclear standoff of the Cold War, with the mass consumer societies of the United States and other democracies facing the totalitarian state of the USSR.

In medicine, Pluto is seen to be associated with regenerative forces in the body involving cell formation and the reproductive system.<ref name=\"theastrocodex.com\"/> The majority of traditional astrologers do not use Pluto as a ruling planet, but do use the planet for interpretation and predictive work, obliquely making reference to projections of influences from higher to lower dimensional spaces.<ref name=\"theastrocodex.com\"/> Pluto is considered by modern astrologers to be the primary native ruler of the eighth house and a higher octave of Mars that functions on a collective level.\n\n===Ceres===<!-- This section is linked from [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] -->\n[[File:Martial Reymond - Ceres with torch.jpg|thumb|upright|Ceres with a torch in search of Proserpina (medallion by [[Martial Reymond]], early 17th century)]]\n[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] ([[File:Ceres symbol.svg|19px]]) is the smallest identified [[dwarf planet]] in the solar system, but is significantly the largest object in the [[asteroid belt]]. It was discovered on 1 January 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi, and is named after Ceres, the Roman goddess of growing plants, the harvest, and of motherly love. It was the first asteroid discovered, taking up about one-third of the entire mass of its asteroid belt.<ref>E. V. Pitjeva, \"Precise determination of the motion of planets and some astronomical constants from modern observations\", 2004 International Astronomical Union, http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=303499</ref> The classification of Ceres has changed more than once and has been the subject of some disagreement.<ref>http://astrologyclub.org/asteroid-ceres/</ref> [[Johann Elert Bode]] believed Ceres to be the \"missing planet\" he had proposed to exist between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], at a distance of 419 million&nbsp;km (2.8&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]]) from the Sun. Ceres was assigned a planetary symbol, and [[List of Solar System bodies formerly regarded as planets|remained listed as a planet]] in astronomy books and tables for about half a century. The 2006 debate surrounding Pluto and what constitutes a [[planet]] led to Ceres being considered for reclassification as a planet, but in the end, Ceres and Pluto were classified as the first members of the new [[dwarf planet]] category.\n\nCeres passes through the zodiac every 4&nbsp;years and 7&nbsp;months, passing through a little more than 2\u00bd&nbsp;signs every year.\n\nIn mythology, Ceres is the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess [[Demeter]], and is the goddess of agriculture. The goddess (and metaphorically the planet) is also associated with the reproductive issues of an adult woman, as well as pregnancy and other major transitions in a woman's life, including the nine months of gestation time, family bonds and relationships. In the early 1800's after its discovery, {{Whose|date=September 2019}}, Ceres was seen as the ruling planet of [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. Due to its mythological connection to the harvest cycle, some modern astrologers feel Ceres should be the ruler of [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], however, many European astrologers see Ceres as ruling [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] with its observed connection to the practical, being of service and assisting. <ref>http://pandoraastrology.com/blog/ceres-rules-taurus</ref> Although a mother, Ceres is also the archetype of a virgin goddess which is associated with Virgo. Ceres may be epitomized by independent women who are often unmarried (since, according to myth, Ceres is an unmarried goddess who chose to become a mother without a husband or partner.) While the moon represents our ideal of \"motherhood\", Ceres would represent how our real and natural motherhood should be.<ref name=\"Martin, Helena pp. 333\u2013334\">Martin, Helena ''Planets in the astrological universe (los planetas en el universo astrol\u00f3gico)'', pp. 333\u2013334, Ed.

Returning to mythology, an early environmental villain is the figure of [[Erysichthon of Thessaly|Erysichthon]], the tearer up of the earth, who cut down trees in a grove sacred to Ceres-Demeter, for which he was punished by the goddess with fearful hunger. In this sense, Ceres became an emerging archetype in the awareness of [[climate change]] in the 21st century and is entering the collective consciousness as a need to take care of our natural and irreplaceable resources. Ceres represents a leap towards a future of ecological responsibility and knowledge. As an indicator for environmental or community activism, Ceres would represent for some astrologers the wave of the future.<ref>http://www.astrostar.com/articles/Ceres.htm</ref>\n\n==Other solar system bodies==\n{{see also|Asteroids in astrology}}\nSome [[asteroid]]s such as [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] ([[File:Pallas symbol.svg|x22px]]) and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] ([[File:Vesta symbol.svg|x22px]]), as well as dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], can sometimes be seen with binoculars (Vesta even with the naked eye), but these were not recognized as planetary, and perhaps not even noticed, until the early 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In the early 19th century, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[3 Juno|Juno]] ([[File:Juno symbol.svg|x22px]]), and the other two aforementioned asteroids were for a time regarded as planets. Although asteroids have been known to both astronomers and astrologers for more than 200 years, they are often ignored by astrologers. The tradition of some astrologers casting charts with minor planets originates with these asteroids. Since the discovery of [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]] ([[File:Chiron symbol.svg|x22px]]) in the 1970s, some astrologers have been casting the new \"planet\", although astronomers consider it a [[centaur (astronomy)|centaur]] (a kind of intermediate object between comet and asteroid).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astrology-numerology.com/chiron.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119141800/http://astrology-numerology.com/chiron.html |archivedate=19 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, several new planet-sized bodies, including [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]], [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], have been discovered, but not yet incorporated into mainstream astrological predictions, although some more avant-garde groups have attempted to incorporate them.<ref>[https://astrology.richardbrown.com/NewPlanets/ Richard Brown: New Planets]</ref><ref>[http://www.astrotransits.blogspot.com AstroTransits.blogspot.com New dwarf planets in Astrology (Sedna, Eris, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, 2002 TC302, Orcus, and others]</ref>\n\n[[Comet]]s and [[nova]]e have been observed and discussed for several thousand years. Comets in particular were portents of great interest to ancient people and given various astrological interpretations. Both phenomena are rarely visible to the naked-eye, and are ignored by most modern astrologers.}\n\n==Hypothetical planets==\nSome astrologers have hypothesized about the existence of unseen or undiscovered planets. In 1918, astrologer [[Sepharial]] proposed the existence of Earth's \"Dark Moon\" [[Lilith (hypothetical moon)|Lilith]], and since then, some astrologers have been using it in their charts; though the same name is also (and now, more commonly) used in astrology to refer to the axis of the actual Moon's orbit. The 20th-century German school of astrology known as Uranian astrology also claimed that many undiscovered planets existed beyond the orbit of Neptune, giving them names such as Cupido, Hades, Zeus, Kronos, Apollon, Admetos, Vulcanus, and Poseidon, and charting their supposed orbits. These orbits have not coincided, however, with more recent discoveries by astronomers of objects beyond Neptune.\n\nOther astrologers have focused on the theory that in time, all twelve signs of the zodiac will each have their own ruler, so that another two planets have yet to be discovered; namely the \"true\" rulers of Taurus and Virgo. The names of the planets mentioned in this regard by some are Vulcan (ruler of Virgo) and [[Apollo]], the Roman god of the Sun (ruler of Taurus).<ref>Linda Goodman, ''Sun Signs'', p226, Pan Books, London, 1982</ref> Another version of this theory states that the modern planets discovered so far correspond to the elements known to the ancients\u2014air (Uranus, god of the heavens), water (Neptune, god of the sea), and fire (Pluto, god of the underworld)\u2014which leaves the elements earth and [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] (the fifth element of the fiery upper air). In other words, it is claimed that the two planets to be discovered will be named after an [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] god or goddess (such as the [[Horae]]), and after [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]], the Roman and Greek god of the upper air and stars.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n[[File:Thema Mundi.svg|thumb|The [[Thema Mundi]]]]\n\n==Ruling planets of the astrological signs and houses==\n{{main article|Domicile (astrology)}}\nIn Western astrology, the symbolism associated with the planets also relates to the zodiac signs and houses of the horoscope in their various [[Ruling planet|rulerships]]. For instance, the description of Mars is masculine, impulsive, and active. Aries is ruled by Mars and has a similar description, representing an active, masculine [[archetype]].

Before the [[scientific revolution|age]] of [[telescope]]s, the [[night sky]] was thought to consist of two very similar components: [[fixed stars]], which remained motionless in relation to each other, and \"wandering stars\" ({{lang-grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}} ''asteres planetai''), which moved relative to the fixed stars over the course of the year.\n\nTo the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and the other earliest astronomers, this group consisted of the five [[planet]]s visible to the [[naked eye]] and excluded [[Earth]]. Although strictly, the term ''planet'' applied only to those five [[astronomical object|objects]], the term was latterly broadened, particularly in the [[Middle Ages]], to include the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] (sometimes referred to as \"Lights\"<ref>Hone (1978), p.22</ref>), making a total of seven planets. Astrologers retain this definition today.\n\nTo ancient astrologers, the planets represented the will of the [[gods]] and their direct influence upon human affairs. To modern astrologers, the planets can represent basic drives or urges in the unconscious,<ref>Hone (1978) p. 19</ref> or energy flow regulators representing dimensions of experience.<ref>Arroyo (1989) pp. 7, 27</ref> They express themselves with different qualities in the twelve [[astrological sign|signs]] of the [[zodiac]] and in the twelve [[astrological house|houses]]. The planets are also related to each other in the form of [[astrological aspect|aspects]].\n\nModern astrologers differ on the source of the correlations between planetary positions and configurations, on the one hand, and characteristics and destinies of the natives, on the other. Hone writes that the planets exert it directly through [[gravitation]] or another, unknown influence.<ref>Hone (1978), p.19 8th paragraph</ref> Others hold that the planets have no direct influence in themselves, but are mirrors of basic organizing principles in the [[universe]]. In other words, the basic patterns of the universe repeat themselves everywhere, in [[fractal]]-like fashion, and \"as above, so below\".<ref>Copenhaver, Brian P. (1992) Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation with Notes and Introduction, Cambridge University Press: New York, NY.</ref> Therefore, the patterns that the planets make in the sky reflect the ebb and flow of basic human impulses. The planets are also associated, especially in the Chinese tradition, with the basic forces of nature.\n\nListed below are the specific meanings and domains associated with the astrological planets since ancient times, with the main focus on the Western astrological tradition. The planets in [[Hindu astrology]] are known as the [[Navagraha]] or \"nine realms\". In [[Chinese astrology]], the planets are associated with the life forces of yin and yang and the five [[Wu xing|elements]], which play an important role in the Chinese form of geomancy known as [[Feng Shui]].

They are the Moon, Mercury, Venus, The Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Sometimes, the Sun and Moon were referred to as \"the lights\" or the \"[[luminary (astrology)|luminaries]]\". [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] and [[Uranus]] can also just be seen with the naked eye, though no ancient culture appears to have taken note of them. The Classical planets fit neatly into the theories of [[Aristotle]] and [[Ptolemy]], they each are part of a [[Celestial sphere]]. The order of the Classical planets is determined by the rate of speed. The Moon moves the fastest and so she is considered to form the first celestial sphere above earth. Everything below the moon is part of the [[sublunary sphere]]. Mercury moves the second fastest and so he rules the next highest sphere.  Next is Venus, who takes about 260 days to revolve around the Sun. Following that is the Sun, then Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. \n\n[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|Conceptual framework for classical astrology]]\nThe astrological descriptions attached to the seven classical planets have been preserved since ancient times. Astrologers call the seven classical planets \"the seven personal and social planets\", because they are said to represent the basic human drives of every individual. The personal planets are the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. The social or transpersonal planets are Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter and Saturn are often called the first of the \"transpersonal\" or \"transcendent\" planets as they represent a transition from the inner personal planets to the outer modern, impersonal planets. The outer modern planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are often called the collective or transcendental planets.<ref>Michael Meyer at khaldea.com, Rob Hand \"Horoscope Symbols\"</ref> The following is a list of the planets and their associated characteristics.<ref>Jeff Mayo, ''Teach Yourself Astrology'', pp. 17\u201328, Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1964; Sasha Fenton ''Understanding Astrology'', pp. 106\u2013112, The Aquarian Press (Harper Collins), London, 1991; Derek and Julia Parker, ''The New Compleat Astrologer'', pp. 86\u201399, Crescent Books, New York, 1971; Maritha Pottinger ''Astro Essentials'', pp. 11\u201314, 17\u201318, ACS Publications, San Diego, 1991</ref>\n\n===Moon===\n[[File:Patera di Parabiago - MI - Museo archeologico - Diana - Luna - 25-7-2003 - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 25-7-2003.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Luna or Diana, wearing a crescent-moon crown and driving her ox-drawn chariot ''([[biga (chariot)|biga]])'', on the [[Parabiago plate]] (2nd\u20135th centuries AD)]]\n\nThe [[Moon]] ([[File:Moon symbol crescent.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] and is exalted in [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]]. In classical Roman mythology, the Moon was [[Luna (mythology)|Luna]], at times identified with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. The Moon is large enough for its gravity to affect the Earth, stabilizing its orbit and producing the regular ebb and flow of the tides. The [[lunar day]] syncs up with its orbit around Earth in such a manner that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth and the other side, known as the \"[[far side of the Moon]]\" faces towards space.\n[[File:FullMoon2010.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Full Moon]]\n\nAstrologically speaking, the Moon is associated with a person's intuition, emotional make-up, [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] habits, rhythms, memories, moods and their ability to react and adapt to those around them. It is associated for some with the mother, maternal instincts or the urge to nurture, the home, the need for security and the past, especially early experiences and childhood. The 1st-century poet Manilius described the Moon, or ''Luna'', as melancholic. In medicine, the Moon is associated with the digestive system, stomach, breasts, the ovaries and menstruation (which does occur on a monthly cycle)<ref>Back de Sarany, G\u00e9za Ibid., 37.</ref> and the pancreas. Despite Manilius's assignation, the Moon is commonly associated with the [[phlegmatic]] humor; it ruled the [[animal spirit]]s. In modern astrology, the Moon is the primary native ruler of the fourth house, but traditionally it had its joy in the twelfth house.\n\nThe Moon or ''Luna'' is associated with Monday, the word Monday comes from the Old English word for Moon day or Moon's day, and in Romance languages, the name for Monday comes from ''luna'' (e.g., ''luni'' in Romanian, ''lundi'' in French, ''lunes'' in Spanish and ''lunedi'' in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated the Moon with the liberal art of [[grammar]].\n\nIn [[Chinese astrology]], the Moon represents [[Feng Shui#Yin and Yang|Yin]], the passive and receptive feminine life principle. In [[Indian astrology]], the Moon is called [[Chandra]] or [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] and represents the mind, queenship and mother. The north [[lunar node]] (called [[Rahu]]) and the south [[lunar node]] (called [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]) are considered to be of particular importance and are given an equal place alongside the seven classical planets as part of the nine [[navagraha]].\n\n===Mercury===\n[[File:Giambologna-mercurio6.jpg|thumb|upright|''Flying Mercury'' (late 16th-century) by [[Giambologna]]]]\n[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] ([[File:Mercury symbol.svg|15px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] and is exalted in [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]. In classical Roman mythology, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] is the messenger of the gods, noted for his speed and swiftness. Echoing this, the scorching, airless world Mercury circles the Sun on the fastest orbit of any planet. Mercury takes only 88 days to orbit the Sun, spending about 7.33 days in each sign of the zodiac. Mercury is so close to the Sun that only a brief period exists after the Sun has set where it can be seen with the naked eye, before following the Sun beyond the horizon.<ref>https://theastrocodex.com/2017/07/20/mercury-rulership-exaltation-detriment-fall/</ref>\n\nAstrologically speaking, Mercury represents the principles of communication, mentality, thinking patterns, rationality and reasoning, and adaptability and variability. Mercury governs schooling and education, the immediate environment of neighbors, siblings and cousins, transport over short distances, messages and forms of communication such as post, email and telephone, newspapers, journalism and writing, information gathering skills and physical dexterity. The 1st-century poet [[Marcus Manilius]] described Mercury as an inconstant, vivacious and curious planet.\n\n[[File:Mercury in color - Prockter07 centered.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]]]\nIn medicine, Mercury is associated with the nervous system, the brain, the respiratory system, the thyroid and the sense organs. It is traditionally held to be essentially cold and dry, according to its placement in the zodiac and in any aspects to other planets.\n\nIn modern astrology, Mercury is regarded as the ruler of the third house; traditionally, it had the joy in the eleventh house. Mercury is the messenger of the gods in mythology. It is the planet of day-to-day expression and relationships. Mercury's action is to take things apart and put them back together again. It is an opportunistic planet, decidedly unemotional and curious.\n\nMercury rules over Wednesday. In Romance languages, the word for Wednesday is often similar to Mercury (''miercuri'' in Romanian, ''mercredi'' in French, ''miercoles'' in Spanish and ''mercoled\u00ec'' in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated Mercury with the liberal art of [[dialectic]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nIn Chinese astrology Mercury represents [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]], the fourth element, therefore symbolizing communication, intelligence, and elegance.\n\n===Venus===\n[[File:Cardiff castle - Turm 3 Venus.jpg|thumb|upright|Venus, wearing the sign of Libra on her midsection, and Taurus at her feet, at [[Cardiff Castle]], [[Wales]]]]\n[[Venus]] ([[File:Venus symbol.svg|22px]]) is the traditional ruling planet of [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] and [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] and is exalted in [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]. In classical Roman mythology, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] is the goddess of love and beauty, famous for the passions she could stir among the gods. Her cults may represent the religiously legitimate charm and seduction of the divine by mortals, in contrast to the formal, contractual relations between most members of Rome's official pantheon and the state, and the unofficial, illicit manipulation of divine forces through magic. The ambivalence of her function is suggested in the etymological relationship of the root *venes- with Latin venenum (poison, venom), in the sense of \"a charm, magic philtre\".\n\nVenus orbits the Sun in 225 days, spending about 18.75 days in each sign of the zodiac. Venus is the second-brightest object in the night sky, the Moon being the brightest. It is usually beheld as a twin planet to Earth.\n\nAstrologically speaking, Venus is associated with the principles of harmony, beauty, refinement, affections, and the urge to sympathize and unite with others. It is involved with the desire for pleasure, comfort and ease. It governs romantic relations, marriage and business partnerships, sex (the origin of the words 'venery' and 'venereal'), the arts, fashion and social life. The 1st-century poet Marcus Manilius described Venus as generous and fecund and the lesser [[Benefic planet|benefic]].\n\n[[File:Venus-real color.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Venus]]]]\nThe planet [[Venus]] in medicine is associated with the lumbar region, the veins, parathyroids, throat and kidneys. Venus was thought to be moderately warm and moist and was associated with the [[phlegmatic]] humor. In modern astrology, Venus is the ruler of the seventh house; traditionally, it had the joy in the fourth house.\n\nVenus is the planet of Friday. In languages deriving from Latin, such as Romanian, Spanish, French, and Italian, the word for Friday often resembles the word Venus (''vineri'', ''viernes'', ''vendredi'' and ''venerd\u00ec'' respectively). Dante Alighieri associated Venus with the liberal art of [[rhetoric]].<ref>New Yorker, 20 May 2013.</ref> In [[Chinese astrology]], Venus is associated with the element [[metal (classical element)|metal]], which is unyielding, strong and persistent. In [[Indian astrology]], Venus is known as [[Shukra]] and represents wealth, pleasure and reproduction. In [[Norse Paganism]], the planet is associated to [[Freyja]], the goddess of love, beauty and fertility.<ref>https://theastrocodex.com/2017/08/01/venus-rulership-exaltation-detriment-fall/</ref>\n\n===Sun===\n{{Redirect|Sun sign|the such restricted astrology|Sun sign astrology}}\n[[File:Ilion---metopa.jpg|thumb|Helios on a relief from Ilion, early 4th-century BC]]\nThe [[Sun]] ([[File:Sun symbol.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] and is exalted in [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]. In classical Greek mythology, the Sun was represented by the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and [[Helios]] (Roman [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], and later by [[Apollo (mythology)|Apollo]], the god of light). The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, around which the Earth and other planets revolve and provides us with heat and light. The arc that the Sun travels in every year, rising and setting in a slightly different place each day, is therefore in reality a reflection of the Earth's own orbit around the Sun. This arc is larger the farther north or south from the equator latitude, giving a more extreme difference between day and night and between seasons during the year. The Sun travels through the twelve signs of the zodiac on its annual journey, spending about a month in each. The Sun's position on a person's birthday therefore determines what is usually called his or her \"sun\" sign. However, the sun sign allotment varies between Western (sign change around 22-23 of every month) and Hindu astrology (sign change around 14-15 of every month) due the different systems of planetary calculations, following the [[Tropical zodiac|tropical]] and [[Sidereal zodiac|sidereal]] definitions respectively.\n[[File:Sun920607.jpg|100px|thumb|left|The [[Sun]], the star at the center of the [[Solar System]]]]\nAstrologically speaking, the Sun is usually thought to represent the conscious [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]], the [[self (psychology)|self]] and its expression, personal power, pride and authority, leadership qualities and the principles of creativity, spontaneity, health and vitality, the sum of which is named the \"life force\". One of the first recorded references to Sun worship is from the [[Mesopotamian Religion]] and described in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]. The 1st-century poet [[Marcus Manilius]] in his epic, 8000-verse poem, ''Astronomica'', described the [[Sun]], or ''[[Sol (mythology)|Sol]]'', as benign and favorable. In medicine, the Sun is associated with the heart, circulatory system,<ref>Back de Surany, G\u00e9za. Manual de Astrolog\u00eda M\u00e9dica. \u00cdndigo.1988. 214 p\u00e1ginas, p. 32</ref> and the thymus. Additionally, humans depend on the sun to produce and obtain [[vitamin D]]; an important supplement aiding the body's immune system and bone health. In [[Ayurveda]], it rules over life-force ('''praan-shakti'''), governs bile temperament ('''pitta'''), stomach, bones and eyes. In modern astrology, the Sun is the primary native ruler of the fifth house, but traditionally it had its joy in the ninth house.\n\nThe Sun is associated with Sunday. [[Dante Alighieri]] associated the Sun with the [[liberal arts|liberal art]] of music. In [[Chinese astrology]], the Sun represents [[Feng Shui#Yin and Yang|Yang]], the active, assertive masculine life principle.\n\n===Mars===\n[[File:Muhammad ibn Muhammad Shakir Ruzmah-'i Nathani - Symbol of Mars - Walters W65914B - Full Page.jpg|thumb|upright|Early 18th-century illustration of Mars ''(al-mirrikh)'' for the Bestiary of [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] ''([[Walters Art Museum]])'']]\n[[Mars]] ([[File:Mars symbol.svg|22px]]) is the traditional ruling planet of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] and [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] and is exalted in [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]. [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] is the Roman god of war and bloodshed, whose symbol is a spear and shield. Both the soil of Mars and the hemoglobin of human blood are rich in iron and because of this they share its distinct deep red color.<ref name=\"Henbestibid\">Henbest, ibid</ref> He was second in importance only to Jupiter and Saturn, due to Mars being the most prominent of the military gods worshipped by the Roman legions. \n\nMars orbits the Sun in 687 days, spending about 57.25 days in each sign of the zodiac. It is also the first planet that orbits outside of Earth's orbit, making it the first planet that does not set along with the Sun. Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25\u201330% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO<sub>2</sub> ice (dry ice).\n\nAstrologically speaking, Mars is associated with confidence and self-assertion, aggression, confrontation, sexuality, energy, strength, ambition and impulsiveness. Mars governs sports, competitions and physical activities in general. The 1st-century poet Manilius, described the planet as ardent and as the lesser [[Malefic planet|malefic]]. In medicine, Mars presides over the [[sex organ|genitals]], the muscular system, the gonads and adrenal glands. It was traditionally held to be hot and excessively dry and ruled the [[choleric]] humor. It was associated with fever, accidents, trauma, pain and surgery.\n\n[[File:Mars Hubble.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Mars]]]]\nIn modern astrology, Mars is the primary native ruler of the first house. Traditionally however, Mars ruled both the third and tenth houses, and had its joy in the fifth house. While Venus tends to the overall relationship atmosphere, Mars is the passionate impulse and action, the masculine aspect, discipline, willpower and stamina.\n\nMars is associated with Tuesday and in Romance languages the word for Tuesday often resembles Mars (in Romanian, ''mar\u0163i'', in Spanish, ''martes'', in French, ''mardi'' and in Italian \"marted\u00ec\"). The English \"Tuesday\" is a modernised form of \"Tyr's Day\", Tyr being the Germanic analogue to Mars. Dante Alighieri associated Mars with the liberal art of [[arithmetic]]. In Chinese astrology, Mars is ruled by the element [[fire (classical element)|fire]], which is passionate, energetic and adventurous. In [[Indian astrology]], Mars is called [[Mangala]] and represents energy, confidence and ego. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n===Jupiter===<!-- This section is linked from [[Jupiter]] -->\n[[File:Fotothek df tg 0004463 Astronomie ^ Planet ^ Symbol.jpg|thumb|Jupiter enthroned, with the symbols of Pisces and Sagittarius at his feet ([[woodcut]] by [[Johannes Regiomontanus]], 1512)]]\n[[Jupiter]] ([[File:Jupiter symbol.svg|22px]]) is the traditional ruling planet of [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] and it is exalted in [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]].

Furthermore, Jupiter is usually the fourth-brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the Moon and Venus).\n\nAstrologically speaking, Jupiter is associated with the principles of growth, expansion, healing, prosperity, good fortune, and miracles. Jupiter governs long distance and foreign travel, big business and wealth, higher education, religion, and the law. It is also associated with the urge for freedom and exploration, as well with gambling and merrymaking.\n\n[[File:Jupiter.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Jupiter]] ]]\nThe 1st-century poet Manilius described Jupiter as temperate and benign, and the greater [[Benefic planet|benefic]]. It was regarded as warm and moist in nature, and therefore favorable to life. In medicine, Jupiter is associated with the liver, pituitary gland, and the disposition of fats; it governed the [[Humorism|sanguine]] humor. In modern astrology, Jupiter is the primary native ruler of the ninth house, but traditionally, Jupiter was assigned to both the second and ninth houses: the house of values and the house of beliefs, respectively, and had its joy in the second house of good luck.\n\nJupiter is associated with Thursday, and in Romance languages, the name for Thursday often comes from Jupiter (e.g., ''joi'' in Romanian, ''jeudi'' in French, ''jueves'' in Spanish, and ''gioved\u00ec'' in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated Jupiter with the liberal art of [[geometry]]. In Chinese astrology, Jupiter is ruled by the element [[wood (classical element)|wood]], which is patient, hard-working, and reliable.

The glyph is shaped like a scythe, but it is known as the \"crescent below the cross\", whereas Jupiter's glyph is the \"crescent above the cross\". Famous rings of the planet Saturn that enclose and surround it, reflect the idea of human limits. Saturn takes 29.5 years to orbit the Sun, spending about 2.46 years in each sign of the zodiac. During ancient Roman society, the Romans worshipped [[Saturn]] as the highest ranking and most important god among their pantheon of deities, sharing that same prestige with Jupiter.\n\nAstrologically speaking, [[Saturn]] is associated with focus, precision, nobility, ethics, civility, lofty goals, career, great achievements, dedication, authority figures, stability, virtues, productiveness, valuable hard lessons learned, destiny, structures, protective roles, balance, conservatism, and karma (reaping what you have sowed or divine cosmic justice) but with limitations, restrictions, boundaries, anxiety, tests, practicality, reality, and time. It concerns a person's sense of duty, commitment, responsibility, including their physical and emotional endurance in times of hardships. Saturn is fundamentally economical. Also represents the part of a person's concern with long-term planning or foresight. [[Saturn return|The Return of Saturn]] is said to mark significant events in each person's life. According to the 1st-century poet Manilius, Saturn is sad, morose, and cold, and is the greater [[Malefic planet|malefic]]. According to Claudius Ptolemy, \"Saturn is lord of the right ear, the spleen, the bladder, the phlegm, and the bones.\"<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3C* .html ''Tetrabiblos by Claudius Ptolemy''] published in the Loeb Classical Library, 1940</ref> Saturn symbolized processes and things that were dry and cold, which are necessary balancing aspects to maintain life.

The Indian and Chinese astrologies have tended to retain the ancient seven-planet system. Meanings have had to be assigned to them by modern astrologers, usually according to the major events that occurred in the world at the time of their discovery. As these astrologers are usually Western, the social and historical events they describe have an inevitable Western emphasis. Astrologers consider the \"extra-Saturnian\" planets to be \"impersonal\" or [[generational planet|generational]] planets, meaning their effects are felt more across whole generations of society. Their effects in individuals depend upon how strongly they feature in that individual's birth-chart. The following are their characteristics as accepted by most astrologers.<ref>Jeff Mayo, ''Ibid'', pp. 28\u201333, 1964; Sasha Fenton ''Ibid'', pp. 112\u2013115, 1991; Derek and Julia Parker, ''Ibid'', pp. 100\u2013105, 1971; Maritha Pottinger ''Ibid'', pp. 15\u201319, 1991</ref>\n\n===Uranus===\n[[File:Aion mosaic Glyptothek Munich W504.jpg|thumb|[[Syncretism|Syncretic]] figure of [[Aion (deity)|Aion]]-[[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] standing within a zodiac wheel, with a reclining [[Tellus (goddess)|Earth goddess]] and four children representing the [[Horae|Seasons]] ([[Roman mosaic|Roman-era mosaic]] from [[Sentinum]], AD 200-250)]]\n[[Uranus]] ([[File:Uranus's astrological symbol.svg|22px]]) is the modern ruling planet of [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] and is exalted in [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]]. In classical Greek mythology, Uranus is the personification of the sky. The planet Uranus is very unusual among the planets in that it rotates on its side, so that it presents each of its poles to the Sun in turn during its orbit; causing both hemispheres to alternate between being bathed in light and lying in total darkness over the course of the orbit.\n\nUranus takes 84 years to orbit the Sun, spending about 7 years in each sign of the zodiac. Uranus was discovered to be a planet only in 1781 by [[Sir William Herschel]].\n\nAstrological interpretations associate Uranus with the principles of ingenuity, new or unconventional ideas, individuality, discoveries, electricity, inventions, democracy, and revolutions. Uranus, among all planets, most governs genius.\n\n[[File:Uranus2.jpg|100px|thumb|left|The planet [[Uranus]]]]\nUranus governs societies, clubs, and any group based on humanitarian or progressive ideals. Uranus, the planet of sudden and unexpected changes, rules freedom and originality. In society, it rules radical ideas and people, as well as revolutionary events that upset established structures. Uranus is also associated with Wednesday, alongside Mercury (since Uranus is in the higher octave of Mercury).\n\nIn art and literature, the discovery of Uranus coincided with the Romantic movement, which emphasized individuality and freedom of creative expression. Additionally, it is often linked to an individual's animal spirit.{{According to whom|date=September 2019}} When it comes to medicine, Uranus is believed to be particularly associated with the sympathetic nervous system, mental disorders, breakdowns and hysteria, spasms, and cramps.

Pluto is also associated with Tuesday, alongside Mars since Pluto is the higher octave of that planet in astrology.\n\nIts entry in Cancer in 1914, the sign in which it was later discovered, coincided with World War I. It is also associated with [[nuclear armament]] due to such weapons using [[plutonium]], which was named after the dwarf planet. Nuclear research had its genesis in the 1930s and 40s and later gave rise to the polarized nuclear standoff of the Cold War, with the mass consumer societies of the United States and other democracies facing the totalitarian state of the USSR.

The goddess (and metaphorically the planet) is also associated with the reproductive issues of an adult woman, as well as pregnancy and other major transitions in a woman's life, including the nine months of gestation time, family bonds and relationships. In the early 1800's after its discovery, {{Whose|date=September 2019}}, Ceres was seen as the ruling planet of [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. Due to its mythological connection to the harvest cycle, some modern astrologers feel Ceres should be the ruler of [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], however, many European astrologers see Ceres as ruling [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] with its observed connection to the practical, being of service and assisting. <ref>http://pandoraastrology.com/blog/ceres-rules-taurus</ref> Although a mother, Ceres is also the archetype of a virgin goddess which is associated with Virgo. Ceres may be epitomized by independent women who are often unmarried (since, according to myth, Ceres is an unmarried goddess who chose to become a mother without a husband or partner.)

In this sense, Ceres became an emerging archetype in the awareness of [[climate change]] in the 21st century and is entering the collective consciousness as a need to take care of our natural and irreplaceable resources. Ceres represents a leap towards a future of ecological responsibility and knowledge.

In 1918, astrologer [[Sepharial]] proposed the existence of Earth's \"Dark Moon\" [[Lilith (hypothetical moon)|Lilith]], and since then, some astrologers have been using it in their charts; though the same name is also (and now, more commonly) used in astrology to refer to the axis of the actual Moon's orbit. The 20th-century German school of astrology known as Uranian astrology also claimed that many undiscovered planets existed beyond the orbit of Neptune, giving them names such as Cupido, Hades, Zeus, Kronos, Apollon, Admetos, Vulcanus, and Poseidon, and charting their supposed orbits. These orbits have not coincided, however, with more recent discoveries by astronomers of objects beyond Neptune.\n\nOther astrologers have focused on the theory that in time, all twelve signs of the zodiac will each have their own ruler, so that another two planets have yet to be discovered; namely the \"true\" rulers of Taurus and Virgo. The names of the planets mentioned in this regard by some are Vulcan (ruler of Virgo) and [[Apollo]], the Roman god of the Sun (ruler of Taurus).<ref>Linda Goodman, ''Sun Signs'', p226, Pan Books, London, 1982</ref> Another version of this theory states that the modern planets discovered so far correspond to the elements known to the ancients\u2014air (Uranus, god of the heavens), water (Neptune, god of the sea), and fire (Pluto, god of the underworld)\u2014which leaves the elements earth and [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] (the fifth element of the fiery upper air). In other words, it is claimed that the two planets to be discovered will be named after an [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] god or goddess (such as the [[Horae]]), and after [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]], the Roman and Greek god of the upper air and stars.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n[[File:Thema Mundi.svg|thumb|The [[Thema Mundi]]]]\n\n==Ruling planets of the astrological signs and houses==\n{{main article|Domicile (astrology)}}\nIn Western astrology, the symbolism associated with the planets also relates to the zodiac signs and houses of the horoscope in their various [[Ruling planet|rulerships]]. For instance, the description of Mars is masculine, impulsive, and active. Aries is ruled by Mars and has a similar description, representing an active, masculine [[archetype]]. Similarly, the first house is also ruled by Mars, and deals with a person's physical health and strength, and the manner in which they project themselves.\n\n'''Table 1: Modern [[Astrological sign|signs]], [[Astrological house|houses]] and [[planet]]ary associations'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

While most Cherokees in the area were forced out as part of the [[Cherokee removal]] of 1838, some managed to avoid detection and would later aide in road construction and mining operations.{{sfn|Barclay|1946|p=8-11}}\n\n===Early mining history===\n[[Image:Hiwasseemine-stack-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Boiler chimney marking the location where copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in 1843]]\nCopper was first discovered by a European American in the Copper Basin in August 1843 in a creek southwest of what would eventually become the Burra Burra Mine by a [[prospecting|prospector]] who was reportedly panning for gold.<ref name=brooks19>Brooks 1990, p. 19</ref> This discovery sparked interest among regional entrepreneurs and opportunists, although the lack of major roads in and out of the basin complicated early mining operations.<ref name=gms/> The first mining operations began in 1847, and that same year the first shipment of copper out of the basin took place.{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=30}} This consisted of 90 casks shipped by mule to [[Dalton, Georgia]], about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away, where the nearest railroad was located at that time.<ref name=\"dailycitizen\">{{Cite news |last=Jenkins |first=Robert |url=https://www.dailycitizen.news/news/local_news/civil-war-anniversary-the-east-tennessee-georgia-railroad/article_00987027-c1e6-510e-8651-300c41c5e604.html |title=Civil War anniversary: The East Tennessee & Georgia Railroad |date=October 9, 2010 |work=[[The Daily Citizen (Dalton, Georgia)|The Daily Citizen]] |access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The first purchase of land in the Copper Basin for mining activities occurred in 1849 when a British agent bought {{convert|400|acre}} for a price of $30,000.{{sfn|Frye|2017|p=7}}\n\nIn 1851, work began on a road through the Ocoee Gorge to connect the Copper Basin with the [[East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad]] in [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] to the west, which had been completed that same year.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bradley County Historical Society|date=1992|title=Reflections Past and Present: A Pictoral History of Bradley County, Tennessee|publisher=Taylor Publishing Company|page=31}}</ref> This road, which became known as the Old Copper Road, was completed in 1853, and is now part of U.S. Route 64.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 8</ref> The first smelter was constructed onsite in 1854, and began operations two years later.<ref name=emmons31>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 31</ref> This was done in an effort to reduce transportation costs.<ref name=brooks21>Brooks 1990, p. 21</ref> By 1857, four additional mines, the Tennessee, Mary's, Isabella, and Eureka were in operation in the Copper Basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1858, three companies, the Union Consolidated Mining Company, the Burra Burra Copper Company, and the Ducktown Copper Company, were formed to operate different mines in the basin and consolidate the small companies that operated these mines.<ref name=waters/> This early mining was accomplished with the use of picks and shovels, and mules were used transport copper ore out of the mines in carts.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

[[freestyle wrestling]] competition consists of a single-elimination tournament, with a [[repechage]] used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consists of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scores more points in each round is the winner of that rounds; the bout ends when one wrestler has won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are [[British
