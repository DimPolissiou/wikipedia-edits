{"title_page": "Feminist performance art", "text_new": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\nAccording to scholar Virginia Mackenny, [[performance art]] is a great tool to mold and remold gender because performance art, in most instances, includes a direct subversion to everyday conventions. MacKenny also writes that feminist performance Art had a large presence \u201cin the late '60s and early '70s in America when, in the climate of protest constituted by the civil rights movement and [[second wave feminism]].\" There are several movements that fall under the category of feminist performance art, including Feminist Postmodernism, which took place during 1960-1970 and focused on the exploitation of women's bodies as a means for profit. Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n==[[Yoko Ono]]==\n\n=== Overview ===\nOno belonged to a generation of early feminist performance artists but is unique among them for her international fame as John Lennon\u2019s wife in the late 60s and 70s.  During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the Beatles grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough.

Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Yoko Ono ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nOno belonged to a generation of early feminist performance artists but is unique among them for her international fame as John Lennon\u2019s wife in the late 60s and 70s.  During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the Beatles grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough. You take care of it afterwards.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> After Sean\u2019s birth, she ran the couple\u2019s business while Lennon stayed home as \u201chousehusband.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Ono\u2019s hands off approach to parenting is a source of controversy because she was simultaneously too motherly and not motherly enough.\n\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Feminist art]]\n", "name_user": "EMVRay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added a hyperlink to yoko ono", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_performance_art"}

It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A '''wristwatch''' is designed to be worn around the [[wrist]], attached by a [[watch strap]] or other type of [[bracelet]], including [[metal bands]], [[leather straps]] or any other kind of bracelet. A '''[[pocket watch]]''' is designed for a person to carry in a [[pocket]], often attached to a chain. The study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].\n\nWatches progressed in the 17th&nbsp;century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th&nbsp;century.  During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by [[clockwork]], powered by winding a [[mainspring]], and keeping time with an oscillating [[balance wheel]]. These are called ''[[mechanical watch]]es''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christopherward.com/blog/quartz-vs-automatic/|title=CWorld {{!}} Christopher Ward {{!}} QUARTZ VS AUTOMATIC|website=www.christopherward.com|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://est1897.co.uk/what-is-a-watch-movement-quartz-automatic-manual-kinetic|title=What is a Watch Movement?

For mechanical watches, various extra features called \"[[Complication (horology)|complications]]\", such as moon-phase displays and the different types of [[tourbillon]], are sometimes included.<ref>Wikipedia: sections under Functions.</ref> Most electronic quartz watches, on the other hand, include time-related features such as [[timer]]s, [[chronograph]]s and [[Alarm clock|alarm]] functions.

The first thing to be improved was the [[escapement]]. The verge escapement was replaced in quality watches by the [[Escapement#Cylinder escapement|cylinder escapement]], invented by [[Thomas Tompion]] in 1695 and further developed by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] in the 1720s. Improvements in manufacturing such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by [[Robert Hooke]] allowed some increase in the volume of watch production, although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well into the 19th century.\n\nA major cause of error in balance wheel timepieces, caused by changes in [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the [[balance spring]] from temperature changes, was solved by the bimetallic [[Balance wheel|temperature compensated balance wheel]] invented in 1765 by [[Pierre Le Roy]] and improved by [[Thomas Earnshaw]]. The [[lever escapement]] was the single most important technological breakthrough, and was invented by [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] in 1759 and improved by Josiah Emery in 1785, although it only gradually came into use from about 1800 onwards, chiefly in Britain.\n[[File:Acta Eruditorum - II orologi, 1737 \u2013 BEIC 13458392.jpg|thumb|A watch drawn in [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1737]]\nThe British had predominated in watch manufacture for much of the 17th and 18th centuries, but maintained a system of production that was geared towards high-quality products for the elite.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVUSauNST8EC&dq=British+Watch+Company+mass+production&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Manufacturing Time: Global Competition in the Watch Industry, 1795\u20132000|author=Glasmeier, Amy|year=2000|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> Although there was an attempt to modernise clock manufacture with [[mass production]] techniques and the application of duplicating tools and machinery by the British Watch Company in 1843, it was in the [[United States]] that this system took off.

[[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an armed watch. The oldest surviving wristwatch (then described as a bracelet watch) is one made in 1806 and given to [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]].<ref name=Bruton183>{{cite book |last=Bruton |first=Eric |date=2000 |title=The History of Clocks & Watches |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |page=183 |isbn=0316853550}}</ref> From the beginning, wristwatches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket watches up until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Evolu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=The Evolution of the Wristwatch|access-date=8 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208200615/http://vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|archive-date=8 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the 19th century, when the importance of synchronizing maneuvers during war, without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signaling, was increasingly recognized. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a \"Watch Wristlet\" design in 1893, but they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> During the [[First Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents became paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin & Webb]] began production of their successful \"campaign watch\" for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at Sudan in 1898]] and accelerated production for the [[Second Boer War]] a few years later.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> In continental Europe, [[Girard-Perregaux]] and other Swiss watchmakers began supplying German naval officers with wristwatches in about 1880.<ref name=Bruton183 />\n\nEarly models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap but, by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company Dimier Fr\u00e8res & Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. [[Hans Wilsdorf]] moved to London in 1905 and set up his own business, Wilsdorf & Davis, with his brother-in-law Alfred Davis, providing quality timepieces at affordable prices; the company later became [[Rolex]].<ref>Rolex Jubilee Vade Mecum published by the Rolex Watch Company in 1946.</ref> Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|first=John E.|last=Brozek|publisher=International Watch Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch and opened up a mass market in the postwar era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the war, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. The [[War Office]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Paul |year=2004 |title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight |publisher=Hyperion Press |isbn=0-7868-8571-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/wingsofmadnessal0000hoff }}</ref> By the end of the war, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on: the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that \"the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire.\" By 1930, the ratio of a wrist to pocket watches was 50 to 1. The first successful [[self-winding watch|self-winding]] system was invented by [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923.\n\n====Quartz====\nThe commercial introduction of the [[quartz watch]] in 1969 in the form of the Omega [[Omega Electroquartz|Beta 21]] and the Seiko [[Astron (wristwatch)|Astron]] was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at perhaps 5 or 6 beats per second, they used a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]] [[resonator]] which vibrated at 8,192&nbsp;Hz, driven by a battery-powered [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator circuit]]. Since the 1980s, more quartz watches than mechanical ones have been marketed.\n\n====Hamilton Electric====\nHamilton Electric were the pioneers of the first electric watch <ref>https://wornandwound.com/hamilton-electric-the-race-to-create-the-worlds-first-battery-powered-watch/ Worlds first battery powered watch </ref> unlike the Quartz and the Bulova Accutron this was the first movement to use a battery as a source to oscillate the balance wheel. Hamilton released two models of the Electric: the first released was the Hamilton 500 on 3 January 1957, which was produced into 1959. This model had problems with the contact wires misaligning and the watch returned to Hamilton for alignment. The Hamilton 505 was an improvement on the 500 and was more reliable: the contact wires were removed and a non-adjustable contact on the balance assembly delivered the power to the balance wheel.\n\n== Movement ==\n[[File:Watch Mechanical Quartz Comparison.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of movements move the hands differently as shown in this 2-second exposure.

The movement is fitted with a cylinder escapement.]]\n\nA [[movement (clockwork)|movement]] of a watch is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date, month and day). Movements may be entirely mechanical, entirely electronic (potentially with no moving parts), or they might be a blend of both. Most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have electronic movements, with mechanical hands on the [[watch face]] indicating the time.\n\n=== Mechanical ===\n{{Main|Mechanical watch}}\nCompared to electronic movements, mechanical watches are less accurate, often with errors of seconds per day, and they are sensitive to position, temperature<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/temperature|title= Temperature | work = Advice on Your Timepiece |publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> and magnetism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/magnetism|title=Magnetism| work=Advice on Your Timepiece|publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> They are also costly to produce, require regular maintenance and adjustments, and are more prone to failures. Nevertheless, the craftsmanship of mechanical watches still attracts interest from part of the watch-buying public, especially among the watch collectors. [[Skeleton watch]]es are designed to leave the mechanism visible for aesthetic purposes.\n\nA mechanical movement uses an [[escapement]] mechanism to control and limit the unwinding and winding parts of a spring, converting what would otherwise be a simple unwinding into a controlled and periodic energy release. A mechanical movement also uses a [[balance wheel]] together with the [[balance spring]] (also known as a hairspring) to control the motion of the gear system of the watch in a manner analogous to the [[pendulum]] of a [[pendulum clock]]. The [[tourbillon]], an optional part for mechanical movements, is a rotating frame for the escapement, which is used to cancel out or reduce the effects of [[gravity|gravitational]] bias to the timekeeping. Due to the complexity of designing a tourbillon, they are very expensive, and only found in prestigious watches.\n\nThe [[pin-lever escapement]] (called the Roskopf movement after its inventor, [[Georges Frederic Roskopf]]), which is a cheaper version of the fully levered movement, was manufactured in huge quantities by many Swiss manufacturers as well as by [[Timex Group USA|Timex]], until it was replaced by quartz movements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |title=The original pin-pallet |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205103752/http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |title=The Roskopf Watch |publisher=Musketeer.ch |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150312/http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watkinsr.id.au/buffat.html|title=Buffat The Roskopf watch|website=Watkinsr.id.au|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTuning-fork watches use a type of electromechanical movement. Introduced by [[Bulova]] in 1960, they use a tuning fork with a precise frequency (most often 360 [[hertz]]) to drive a mechanical watch. The task of converting electronically pulsed fork vibration into rotary movements is done via two tiny jeweled fingers, called pawls. [[Electric watch#Types of electric watches|Tuning-fork watches]] were rendered obsolete when electronic quartz watches were developed. [[Quartz watch]]es were cheaper to produce besides being more accurate.\n\n{{Main|Mainspring}}\nTraditional mechanical watch movements use a spiral spring called a [[mainspring]] as a power source. In ''manual watches'' the spring must be rewound periodically by the user by turning the watch crown. Antique [[pocketwatch]]es were wound by inserting a separate key into a hole in the back of the watch and turning it. Most modern watches are designed to run 40&nbsp; hours on a winding and thus must be wound daily, but some run for several days and a few have 192-hour mainsprings and are wound weekly.\n\n==== Automatic watches ====\n{{Main|Automatic watch}}\n[[File:Jaeger-Lecoultre-p1000838.jpg|thumb|[[Automatic watch]]: An eccentric weight, called a rotor, swings with the movement of the wearer's body and winds the spring]]\n[[File:Seiko 5 Automatic 21 Jewels.png|thumb|upright|Seiko 5 Automatic Watch 21 Jewels]]\n\nA ''self-winding'' or ''automatic'' watch is one that rewinds the mainspring of a mechanical movement by the natural motions of the wearer's body. The first self-winding mechanism was invented for pocket watches in 1770 by Abraham-Louis Perrelet,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ | title=Watchmaking in Europe and China: Watches & Wonders | work=[[Richemont]] | publisher=Worldtempus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011232012/http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ |archivedate=11 October 2012}}</ref> but the first \"[[self-winding watch|self-winding]]\", or \"automatic\", wristwatch was the invention of a British watch repairer named [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923. This type of watch winds itself without requiring any special action by the wearer. It uses an eccentric weight, called a winding rotor, which rotates with the movement of the wearer's wrist. The back-and-forth motion of the winding rotor couples to a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] to wind the mainspring automatically. Self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer's wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound.\n\nIn April 2014 the Swatch Group launched the ''sistem51'' wristwatch. It has a purely mechanical movement consisting of only 51 parts, including a novel self-winding mechanism with a transparent oscillating weight. So far, it is the only mechanical movement manufactured entirely on a fully automated assembly line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/featured/exclusive-an-inside-view-of-the-eta-high-tech-swatch-sistem51-production-in-boncourt-in-the-swiss-jura/|title=EXCLUSIVE: An inside view of the ETA high-tech Swatch Sistem51 production in Boncourt in the Swiss Jura \u2013 Watch-Insider.com|date=3 December 2014|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> The low parts count and the automated assembly make it an inexpensive mechanical Swiss watch, which can be considered a successor to ''Roskopf'' movements, although of higher quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/news/swatch-sistem51-swiss-watchmaking-revolution|title=Swatch Sistem51 a Swiss-made watchmaking revolution|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Electronic ===\n{{See also|Electric watch|Quartz clock}}\n[[File:Csem-beta1.jpg|thumb|upright|First quartz wristwatch BETA 1 developed by CEH, Switzerland, 1967]]\nElectronic movements, also known as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a [[quartz]] [[crystal]] which is made to vibrate by the [[piezoelectric effect]]. A varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so, in combination with some electronic components, it functions as an [[quartz oscillator|oscillator]]. It [[resonance|resonates]] at a specific highly stable frequency, which is used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism. Most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to provide a traditional analog display of the time, a feature most consumers still prefer.\n\nIn 1959 [[Seiko]] placed an order with Epson (a daughter company of Seiko and the 'brain' behind the quartz revolution) to start developing a quartz wristwatch. The project was codenamed 59A. By the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Seiko had a working prototype of a portable quartz watch which was used as the time measurements throughout the event.\n\nThe first prototypes of an electronic quartz wristwatch (not just ''portable'' quartz watches as the Seiko timekeeping devices at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964) were made by the CEH research laboratory in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. From 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192&nbsp; Hz quartz oscillator, a thermo-compensation module, and an in-house-made, dedicated integrated circuit (unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later Seiko Astron wristwatch). As a result, the BETA 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the International Chronometric Competition held at the Observatory of Neuch\u00e2tel in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Pioneering_Work_on_the_Quartz_Electronic_Wristwatch,_1962-1967 |title=Milestones:Pioneering Work on the Quartz Electronic Wristwatch, 1962\u20131967 |publisher=Ieeeghn.org |date= |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> In 1970, 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch, including the [[Omega Electroquartz]] as well as [[Patek Philippe]], [[Rolex Oysterquartz]] and Piaget.\n\n[[File:Seiko 35A.jpg|thumb|Quartz Movement of the Seiko Astron, 1969 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2010-006)]]\n\nThe first quartz watch to enter production was the [[Seiko]] [[Astron (wristwatch)|35 SQ Astron]], which hit the shelves on 25 December 1969, swiftly followed by the Swiss Beta 21, and then a year later the prototype of one of the world's most accurate wristwatches to date: the [[Omega Marine Chronometer]].

This ended\u2014in less than a decade\u2014almost 100 years of dominance by the mechanical wristwatch legacy. Modern quartz movements are produced in very large quantities, and even the cheapest wristwatches typically have quartz movements. Whereas mechanical movements can typically be off by several seconds a day, an inexpensive quartz movement in a child's wristwatch may still be accurate to within half a second per day\u2014ten times more accurate than a mechanical movement.<ref>Quartz mechanisms usually have a resonant frequency of 32768&nbsp; Hz, chosen for ease of use (being 2<sup>15</sup>). Using a simple 15 stage divide-by-two circuit, this is turned into a 1 pulse per second signal responsible for the watch's timekeeping.</ref>\n\nAfter a consolidation of the mechanical watch industry in Switzerland during the 1970s, mass production of quartz wristwatches took off under the leadership of the [[Swatch Group]] of companies, a Swiss conglomerate with vertical control of the production of Swiss watches and related products. For quartz wristwatches, subsidiaries of Swatch manufacture [[Watch battery|watch batteries]] (Renata), oscillators ([[Oscilloquartz]], now Micro Crystal AG) and integrated circuits (Ebauches Electronic SA, renamed [[EM Microelectronic-Marin]]). The launch of the new SWATCH brand in 1983 was marked by bold new styling, design, and marketing. Today, the Swatch Group maintains its position as the world's largest watch company.\n\n[[Seiko]]'s efforts to combine the quartz and mechanical movements bore fruit after 20 years of research, leading to the introduction of the [[Seiko]] [[Spring Drive]], first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in September 2005. The Spring Drive keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery, using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring, without the need for a balance wheel either.\n\nIn 2010, Miyota ([[Citizen Watch]]) of [[Japan]] introduced a newly developed movement that uses a 3-pronged quartz crystal that was exclusively produced for [[Bulova]] to be used in the Precisionist or Accutron II line, a new type of quartz watch with ultra-high frequency (262.144&nbsp;kHz) which is claimed to be accurate to +/\u2212 10 seconds a year and has a smooth sweeping second hand rather than one that jumps each second.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/03/23/bulova-introduces-the-most-accurate-watch-in-the-world-the-precisionist/ |title=Bulova introduces the most accurate watch in the world, the Precisionist |publisher=Crunch gear |date = 23 March 2010 |accessdate= 8 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nRadio time signal watches are a type of electronic quartz watch which synchronizes ([[time transfer]]s) its time with an external [[Time signal#Radio time signals|time source]] such as in [[atomic clock]]s, time signals from [[GPS]] navigation satellites, the German [[DCF77]] signal in Europe, [[WWVB]] in the US, and others.

However, other than the radio receiver, these watches are normal quartz watches in all other aspects.\n\nElectronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity. Usually, the electricity is provided by a replaceable [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding. The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the [[Hamilton Watch Company]] of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].\n\nWatch batteries (strictly speaking cells, as a battery is composed of multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose. They are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more). In most cases, replacing the battery requires a trip to a watch-repair shop or watch dealer; this is especially true for watches that are water-resistant, as special tools and procedures are required for the watch to remain water-resistant after battery replacement. Silver-oxide and lithium batteries are popular today; mercury batteries, formerly quite common, are no longer used, for environmental reasons. Cheap batteries may be alkaline, of the same size as silver-oxide cells but providing shorter life. Rechargeable batteries are used in some [[solar-powered watch]]es.\n\nSome electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer. For instance, Seiko's [[Automatic quartz|kinetic-powered quartz watches]] use the motion of the wearer's arm: turning a rotating weight which causes a tiny [[Electrical generator|generator]] to supply power to charge a rechargeable battery that runs the watch. The concept is similar to that of self-winding spring movements, except that electrical power is generated instead of mechanical spring tension.\n\n[[Solar powered watch]]es are powered by light. A [[photovoltaic cell]] on the face ([[dial (measurement)|dial]]) of the watch converts light to electricity, which is used to charge a [[rechargeable battery]] or [[capacitor]]. The movement of the watch draws its power from the rechargeable battery or capacitor. As long as the watch is regularly exposed to fairly strong light (such as sunlight), it never needs a battery replacement. Some models need only a few minutes of sunlight to provide weeks of energy (as in the Citizen [[Eco-Drive]]). Some of the early solar watches of the 1970s had innovative and unique designs to accommodate the array of solar cells needed to power them (Synchronar, Nepro, Sicura and some models by Cristalonic, Alba, Seiko, and Citizen). As the decades progressed and the efficiency of the solar cells increased while the power requirements of the movement and display decreased, solar watches began to be designed to look like other conventional watches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soluhr.com/|title=History of the Solar Wristwatch|work=Soluhr.com|accessdate=17 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812141728/http://www.soluhr.com/|archive-date=12 August 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA rarely used power source is the temperature difference between the wearer's arm and the surrounding environment (as applied in the [[Citizen Watch Co., Ltd|Citizen]] [[Eco-Drive]] Thermo).\n\n== Display ==\n=== Analog ===\n[[File:Poljot-Aviator-3133.jpg|thumb|[[Poljot]] [[chronograph]]]]\n[[File:Casio AE12.jpg|alt=Casio AE12|thumb|Casio AE12 LCA (liquid-crystal-analog) watch]]\nTraditionally, watches have displayed the time in analog form, with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand. Many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute. Watches powered by quartz usually have a second hand that snaps every second to the next marker. Watches powered by a mechanical movement appears to have a gliding second hand, although it is actually not gliding; the hand merely moves in smaller steps, typically 1/5 of a second, corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance wheel. In some escapements (for example the ''duplex'' escapement), the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance wheel, typically 1/2-second in those watches, or even every four beats (two periods, 1 second), in the ''double duplex'' escapement. A truly gliding second hand is achieved with the ''tri-synchro regulator'' of [[Spring Drive]] watches. All of the hands are normally mechanical, physically rotating on the dial, although a few watches have been produced with \"hands\" that are simulated by a [[liquid crystal display|liquid-crystal display]].\n\nAnalog display of the time is nearly universal in watches sold as jewelry or collectibles, and in these watches, the range of different styles of hands, numbers, and other aspects of the analog dial is very broad. In watches sold for timekeeping, analog display remains very popular, as many people find it easier to read than digital display; but in timekeeping watches the emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading of the time under all conditions (clearly marked digits, easily visible hands, large watch faces, etc.). They are specifically designed for the left wrist with the stem (the knob used for changing the time) on the right side of the watch; this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist. This is the case if one is right-handed and the watch is worn on the left wrist (as is traditionally done). If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.\n\nAnalog watches, as well as clocks, are often marketed showing a display time of approximately 1:50 or 10:10. This creates a visually pleasing smile-like face on the upper half of the watch, in addition to enclosing the manufacturer's name. Digital displays often show a time of 12:08, where the increase in the number of active segments or pixels gives a positive feeling.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/28/business/media/28adco.html|title=Why Time Stands Still for Watchmakers|work=New York Times|accessdate=28 November 2008|date=28 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Ten Ten Tenet|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/market/clockhands.asp|work=Snopes.com|publisher=Barbara and David P.

This was only sold for a few years, as production problems and returned (faulty) product forced the company to cease production.\n\nMost watches with LED displays required that the user press a button to see the time displayed for a few seconds because LEDs used so much power that they could not be kept operating continuously. Usually, the LED display color would be red. Watches with LED displays were popular for a few years, but soon the LED displays were superseded by [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs), which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use, with the display always visible and no need to push a button before seeing the time. Only in darkness would a button need to be pressed to light the display with a tiny light bulb, later illuminating LEDs.<ref>{{US Patent|4096550}}: W. Boller, M. Donati, J. Fingerle, P.

In 1985, Casio produced the CFX-400 scientific calculator watch. In 1987 Casio produced a watch that could dial telephone numbers and Citizen revealed one that would react to voice. In 1995 Timex released a watch which allowed the wearer to download and store data from a computer to their wrist. Some watches, such as the [[Timex Datalink#Timex Datalink USB|Timex Datalink USB]], feature [[dot matrix]] displays. Since their apex during the late 1980s to mid-1990s high technology fad, digital watches have mostly become simpler, less expensive timepieces with little variety between models.\n\n<gallery widths=\"270px\" heights=\"270px\">\nFile:Jumphour.jpg|[[Cort\u00e9bert (watch manufacturer)|''Cort\u00e9bert'']] digital mechanical pocket watch (1890s)\nFile:Cortjump1.jpg|''Cort\u00e9bert'' digital mechanical wristwatch (1920s)\nFile:PulsarLED.jpg|A silver Pulsar [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] watch from 1976.\nFile:Timex T5E901 Ironman Triathlon 30 Lap FLIX.jpg|A [[Timex Group|Timex]] digital watch with an always-on display of the time and date\n</gallery>\n\n=== Illuminated ===\n{{more citations needed|subsection|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Tritium-watch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An illuminated watch face, using tritium]]\nMany watches have displays that are illuminated, so they can be used in darkness. Various methods have been used to achieve this.\n\nMechanical watches often have [[luminous paint]] on their hands and hour marks. In the mid-20th century, radioactive material was often incorporated in the paint, so it would continue to glow without any exposure to light. [[Radium]] was often used but produced small amounts of radiation outside the watch that might have been hazardous.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan's Vintage Watches|url=http://alanwatch.homestead.com/page9.html|publisher=Radium Watch Dial Pattern|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> [[Tritium]] was used as a replacement, since the radiation it produces has such low energy that it cannot penetrate a watch glass. However, tritium is expensive\u2014it has to be made in a [[nuclear reactor]]\u2014and it has a [[half-life]] of only about 12 years so the paint remains luminous for only a few years. Nowadays, tritium is used in specialized watches, e.g., for military purposes (See [[Tritium illumination]]). For other purposes, luminous paint is sometimes used on analog displays, but no radioactive material is contained in it. This means that the display glows soon after being exposed to light and quickly fades.\n\nWatches that incorporate batteries often have the electric illumination of their displays. However, lights consume far more power than electronic watch movements. To conserve the battery, the light is activated only when the user presses a button. Usually, the light remains lit for a few seconds after the button is released, which allows the user to move the hand out of the way.\n\n[[File:Backlit LCD display.jpg|thumbnail|Views of a [[liquid crystal display]], both with [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] backlight switched on (top) and switched off (bottom)]]\n[[File:Casio LCD Watch F-E10.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail| Digital LCD wristwatch Casio type F-E10 with electroluminescent backlighting.]]\nIn some early digital watches, [[LED]] displays were used, which could be read as easily in darkness as in daylight. The user had to press a button to light up the LEDs, which meant that the watch could not be read without the button being pressed, even in full daylight.\n\nIn some types of watches, small [[incandescent]] lamps or LEDs illuminate the display, which is not intrinsically luminous. These tend to produce very non-uniform illumination. Incandescent lamps are very wasteful of electricity.\n\nOther watches use [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] material to produce uniform illumination of the background of the display, against which the hands or digits can be seen.\n\n== Speech synthesis ==\n[[Speech synthesis|Talking]] watches are available, intended for the [[Visual impairment|blind or visually impaired]]. They speak the time out loud at the press of a button. This has the disadvantage of disturbing others nearby or at least alerting the non-[[deaf]] that the wearer is checking the time. Tactile watches are preferred to avoid this awkwardness, but talking watches are preferred for those who are not confident in their ability to read a tactile watch reliably.\n\n==Handedness==\nWristwatches with analog displays generally have a small knob, called the crown, that can be used to adjust the time and, in mechanical watches, wind the spring. Almost always, the crown is located on the right-hand side of the watch so it can be worn of the left wrist for a right-handed individual. This makes it inconvenient to use if the watch is being worn on the right wrist. Some manufacturers offer \"left-hand drive\", aka \"destro\", configured watches which move the crown to the left side<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wornandwound.com/a-guide-to-destro-watches-from-sinn-muhle-citizen-and-more/|title=A Guide to \"Destro\": Watches from Sinn, M\u00fchle, Citizen, and More - Worn & Wound|date=10 May 2016|website=Wornandwound.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> making wearing the watch easier for left-handed individuals.\n\nA rarer configuration is the bullhead watch.  Bullhead watches are generally, but not exclusively, [[chronograph]]s.  The configuration moves the crown and chronograph pushers to the top of the watch.  Bullheads are commonly wristwatch chronographs that are intended to be used as stopwatches off the wrist. Examples are the Citizen Bullhead Change Timer<ref>CITIZEN \"BULLHEAD\" CHALLENGE TIMER</ref> and the Omega Seamaster Bullhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hands-on-with-the-omega-seamaster-bullhead-live-pics-pricing|title=Hands-On: With The Omega Seamaster Bullhead (Live Pics + Pricing)|website=Hodinkee.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nDigital watches generally have push-buttons that can be used to make adjustments. These are usually equally easy to use on either wrist.\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Rolex-Submariner.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Rolex]] Submariner, an officially certified chronometer]]\n[[File:Breguet MG 2573.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[Breguet (watch)|Breguet]] squelette watch 2933 with [[tourbillon]]]]\n[[File:Patek-Philippe MG 2583.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Perpetual calendar and moonphase wristwatch by [[Patek Philippe]]]]\nCustomarily, watches provide the [[time of day]], giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second. Many also provide the current date, and some (called \"complete calendar\" or \"triple date\" watches) display the day of the week and the month as well. However, many watches also provide a great deal of information beyond the basics of time and date. Some watches include [[alarm]]s. Other elaborate and more expensive watches, both pocket and wrist models, also incorporate [[Striking clock|striking mechanisms]] or [[Repeater (horology)|repeater]] functions, so that the wearer could learn the time by the sound emanating from the watch. This announcement or striking feature is an essential characteristic of true clocks and distinguishes such watches from ordinary [[Clock|timepieces]]. This feature is available on most digital watches.\n\nA ''complicated watch'' has one or more functions beyond the basic function of displaying the time and the date; such a functionality is called a [[Complication (horology)|complication]]. Two popular complications are the '''[[chronograph]]''' complication, which is the ability of the watch movement to function as a [[stopwatch]], and the '''moonphase''' complication, which is a display of the [[lunar phase]]. Other more expensive complications include [[Tourbillon]], [[Perpetual calendar]], [[Minute repeater]], and [[Equation of time]]. A truly complicated watch has many of these complications at once (see [[Calibre 89]] from [[Patek Philippe]] for instance). Some watches can both indicate the [[Qibla compass|direction of Mecca]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Muslim watches |url=http://www.watchismo.com/search.aspx?find=muslim |publisher=Watchismo |accessdate=14 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928004218/http://www.watchismo.com/search.aspx?find=muslim |archivedate=28 September 2015 }}</ref> and have alarms that can be set for all daily prayer requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Islamic Watch & Clock|url=http://www.alfajr.com|publisher=ALFAJR|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> Among watch enthusiasts, complicated watches are especially collectible. Some watches include a second 12-hour or 24-hour display for [[UTC]] or [[GMT]].\n\nThe similar-sounding terms '''chronograph''' and '''chronometer''' are often confused, although they mean altogether different things. A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer, often a [[stopwatch]] complication (as explained above), while a [[chronometer watch]] is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a chronometer is a high quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the [[COSC]] (Contr\u00f4le Officiel Suisse des Chronom\u00e8tres). The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a chronometer, both, or neither.\n\n[[File:Datalink USB Dress Edition.JPG|thumb|upright|Timex Datalink USB Dress edition from 2003 with a dot matrix display; the ''Invasion'' video game is on the screen]]\n\nMany computerized wristwatches have been developed, but none have had long-term sales success, because they have awkward [[user interface]]s due to the tiny screens and buttons, and short battery life. As miniaturized electronics became cheaper, watches have been developed containing [[calculator watch|calculators]], [[tonometer]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[altimeter]]s, a [[compass]] using both hands to show the N/S direction, [[video game]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[keydrive]]s, [[GPS watch|GPS receivers]] and [[cellular phone]]s. A few [[Astronomical clock#Watches|astronomical watches]] show [[phase of the Moon]] and other celestial phenomena. In the early 1980s [[Seiko]] marketed a watch with a television in it. Such watches have also had the reputation as unsightly and thus mainly [[geek]] toys. Several companies have however attempted to develop a [[computer]] contained in a wristwatch (see also [[wearable computer]]).\n\nElectronic sports watches, combining timekeeping with GPS and/or [[Activity tracker|activity tracking]], address the general [[Physical fitness|fitness]] market and have the potential for commercial success ([[Garmin forerunner]], Garmin Vivofit, Epson,<ref name=\"Epson\" /> announced model of [[Swatch]] Touch series<ref>Hug, Daniel : ''Swatch lanciert 2015 eine intelligente Uhr.''

These watches are sometimes called [[diving watches]] when they are suitable for [[scuba diving]] or [[saturation diving]]. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] issued a standard for water resistant watches which also prohibits the term \"[[waterproof]]\" to be used with watches, which many countries have adopted.\n\nWater resistance is achieved by the [[gasket]]s which forms a watertight seal, used in conjunction with a sealant applied on the case to help keep water out. The material of the case must also be tested in order to pass as water resistant.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europastar.com/europastar/watch_tech/waterresistance.jsp|title=Watch Industry Questions and Answers: Water-Resistance|work=Europa Star|publisher=VNU eMedia Inc|accessdate=17 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nNone of the tests defined by [[ISO 2281]] for the Water Resistant mark are suitable to qualify a watch for scuba diving. Such watches are designed for everyday life and must be water resistant during exercises such as swimming. They can be worn in different temperature and pressure conditions but are under no circumstances designed for scuba diving.\n\nThe standards for diving watches are regulated by the [[ISO 6425]] international standard. The watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water) pressure, thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water. The testing of the water resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every watch has to be fully tested. Besides water resistance standards to a minimum of 100-metre depth rating ISO 6425 also provides eight minimum requirements for mechanical diver's watches for scuba diving (quartz and digital watches have slightly differing readability requirements). For diver's watches for mixed-gas saturation diving two additional requirements have to be met.\n\nWatches are classified by their degree of water resistance, which roughly translates to the following (1 metre = 3.281 feet):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jwnz.co.nz/page/watches.aspx|title=Watches|website=Jwnz.co.nz|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Main Article [[ISO 6425#Water resistance classification|ISO 6425]]\n|-\n! nowrap=\"nowrap\" |Water-resistance rating || Suitability || Remarks\n|-\n| Water Resistant or 30&nbsp;m || Suitable for everyday use.

Therefore, a 5 bar watch is equivalent to a 40-metre watch. Some watches are rated in [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] (atm), which are roughly equivalent to bar.\n\n=== Navigation ===\n{{Main|Cardinal direction#Watch dial}}\nThere is a traditional method by which an [[analog watch]] can be used to locate north and south. The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour [[clock face]] takes twelve hours to complete one rotation. In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate south. For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north. During [[daylight saving time]], the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12. This method is accurate enough to be used only at fairly high latitudes.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Technology}}\n\n{{clear}}\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[24-hour analog dial]]\n* [[American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute]]\n* [[Clock]]\n* [[Coin watch]]\n* [[Smartwatch]]\n* [[List of watch manufacturers]]\n*[[List of most expensive watches sold at auction]]\n* [[Marine chronometer]]\n* [[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]\n* [[Tachymeter (watch)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Beckett, Edmund]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17576 ''A Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks, Watches and Bells''], 1903, from [[Project Gutenberg]]\n* Berner, G.A., [http://www.fhs.ch/berner/?l=en ''Illustrated Professional Dictionary of Horology''], [[Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry]] FH 1961\u20132012\n* Daniels, George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWq8c0xvGxsC&printsec=frontcover ''Watchmaking''], London: Philip Wilson Publishers, 1981 (reprinted 15 June 2011)\n* De Carle, Donald, (Illustrations by E.

Improvements in manufacturing such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by [[Robert Hooke]] allowed some increase in the volume of watch production, although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well into the 19th century.\n\nA major cause of error in balance wheel timepieces, caused by changes in [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the [[balance spring]] from temperature changes, was solved by the bimetallic [[Balance wheel|temperature compensated balance wheel]] invented in 1765 by [[Pierre Le Roy]] and improved by [[Thomas Earnshaw]].

[[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an armed watch. The oldest surviving wristwatch (then described as a bracelet watch) is one made in 1806 and given to [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]].<ref name=Bruton183>{{cite book |last=Bruton |first=Eric |date=2000 |title=The History of Clocks & Watches |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |page=183 |isbn=0316853550}}</ref> From the beginning, wristwatches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket watches up until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Evolu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=The Evolution of the Wristwatch|access-date=8 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208200615/http://vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|archive-date=8 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the 19th century, when the importance of synchronizing maneuvers during war, without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signaling, was increasingly recognized. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a \"Watch Wristlet\" design in 1893, but they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> During the [[First Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents became paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin & Webb]] began production of their successful \"campaign watch\" for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at Sudan in 1898]] and accelerated production for the [[Second Boer War]] a few years later.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> In continental Europe, [[Girard-Perregaux]] and other Swiss watchmakers began supplying German naval officers with wristwatches in about 1880.<ref name=Bruton183 />\n\nEarly models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap but, by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company Dimier Fr\u00e8res & Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. [[Hans Wilsdorf]] moved to London in 1905 and set up his own business, Wilsdorf & Davis, with his brother-in-law Alfred Davis, providing quality timepieces at affordable prices; the company later became [[Rolex]].<ref>Rolex Jubilee Vade Mecum published by the Rolex Watch Company in 1946.</ref> Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|first=John E.|last=Brozek|publisher=International Watch Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch and opened up a mass market in the postwar era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the war, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. The [[War Office]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Paul |year=2004 |title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight |publisher=Hyperion Press |isbn=0-7868-8571-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/wingsofmadnessal0000hoff }}</ref> By the end of the war, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on: the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that \"the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire.\" By 1930, the ratio of a wrist to pocket watches was 50 to 1. The first successful [[self-winding watch|self-winding]] system was invented by [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923.\n\n====Quartz====\nThe commercial introduction of the [[quartz watch]] in 1969 in the form of the Omega [[Omega Electroquartz|Beta 21]] and the Seiko [[Astron (wristwatch)|Astron]] was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at perhaps 5 or 6 beats per second, they used a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]] [[resonator]] which vibrated at 8,192&nbsp;Hz, driven by a battery-powered [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator circuit]]. Since the 1980s, more quartz watches than mechanical ones have been marketed.\n\n====Hamilton Electric====\nHamilton Electric were the pioneers of the first electric watch <ref>https://wornandwound.com/hamilton-electric-the-race-to-create-the-worlds-first-battery-powered-watch/ Worlds first battery powered watch </ref> unlike the Quartz and the Bulova Accutron this was the first movement to use a battery as a source to oscillate the balance wheel. Hamilton released two models of the Electric: the first released was the Hamilton 500 on 3 January 1957, which was produced into 1959. This model had problems with the contact wires misaligning and the watch returned to Hamilton for alignment. The Hamilton 505 was an improvement on the 500 and was more reliable: the contact wires were removed and a non-adjustable contact on the balance assembly delivered the power to the balance wheel.\n\n== Movement ==\n[[File:Watch Mechanical Quartz Comparison.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of movements move the hands differently as shown in this 2-second exposure.

The movement is fitted with a cylinder escapement.]]\n\nA [[movement (clockwork)|movement]] of a watch is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date, month and day). Movements may be entirely mechanical, entirely electronic (potentially with no moving parts), or they might be a blend of both. Most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have electronic movements, with mechanical hands on the [[watch face]] indicating the time.\n\n=== Mechanical ===\n{{Main|Mechanical watch}}\nCompared to electronic movements, mechanical watches are less accurate, often with errors of seconds per day, and they are sensitive to position, temperature<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/temperature|title= Temperature | work = Advice on Your Timepiece |publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> and magnetism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/magnetism|title=Magnetism| work=Advice on Your Timepiece|publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> They are also costly to produce, require regular maintenance and adjustments, and are more prone to failures. Nevertheless, the craftsmanship of mechanical watches still attracts interest from part of the watch-buying public, especially among the watch collectors. [[Skeleton watch]]es are designed to leave the mechanism visible for aesthetic purposes.\n\nA mechanical movement uses an [[escapement]] mechanism to control and limit the unwinding and winding parts of a spring, converting what would otherwise be a simple unwinding into a controlled and periodic energy release. A mechanical movement also uses a [[balance wheel]] together with the [[balance spring]] (also known as a hairspring) to control the motion of the gear system of the watch in a manner analogous to the [[pendulum]] of a [[pendulum clock]]. The [[tourbillon]], an optional part for mechanical movements, is a rotating frame for the escapement, which is used to cancel out or reduce the effects of [[gravity|gravitational]] bias to the timekeeping. Due to the complexity of designing a tourbillon, they are very expensive, and only found in prestigious watches.\n\nThe [[pin-lever escapement]] (called the Roskopf movement after its inventor, [[Georges Frederic Roskopf]]), which is a cheaper version of the fully levered movement, was manufactured in huge quantities by many Swiss manufacturers as well as by [[Timex Group USA|Timex]], until it was replaced by quartz movements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |title=The original pin-pallet |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205103752/http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |title=The Roskopf Watch |publisher=Musketeer.ch |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150312/http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watkinsr.id.au/buffat.html|title=Buffat The Roskopf watch|website=Watkinsr.id.au|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTuning-fork watches use a type of electromechanical movement. Introduced by [[Bulova]] in 1960, they use a tuning fork with a precise frequency (most often 360 [[hertz]]) to drive a mechanical watch. The task of converting electronically pulsed fork vibration into rotary movements is done via two tiny jeweled fingers, called pawls. [[Electric watch#Types of electric watches|Tuning-fork watches]] were rendered obsolete when electronic quartz watches were developed. [[Quartz watch]]es were cheaper to produce besides being more accurate.\n\n{{Main|Mainspring}}\nTraditional mechanical watch movements use a spiral spring called a [[mainspring]] as a power source. In ''manual watches'' the spring must be rewound periodically by the user by turning the watch crown. Antique [[pocketwatch]]es were wound by inserting a separate key into a hole in the back of the watch and turning it. Most modern watches are designed to run 40&nbsp; hours on a winding and thus must be wound daily, but some run for several days and a few have 192-hour mainsprings and are wound weekly.\n\n==== Automatic watches ====\n{{Main|Automatic watch}}\n[[File:Jaeger-Lecoultre-p1000838.jpg|thumb|[[Automatic watch]]: An eccentric weight, called a rotor, swings with the movement of the wearer's body and winds the spring]]\n[[File:Seiko 5 Automatic 21 Jewels.png|thumb|upright|Seiko 5 Automatic Watch 21 Jewels]]\n\nA ''self-winding'' or ''automatic'' watch is one that rewinds the mainspring of a mechanical movement by the natural motions of the wearer's body. The first self-winding mechanism was invented for pocket watches in 1770 by Abraham-Louis Perrelet,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ | title=Watchmaking in Europe and China: Watches & Wonders | work=[[Richemont]] | publisher=Worldtempus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011232012/http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ |archivedate=11 October 2012}}</ref> but the first \"[[self-winding watch|self-winding]]\", or \"automatic\", wristwatch was the invention of a British watch repairer named [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923. This type of watch winds itself without requiring any special action by the wearer. It uses an eccentric weight, called a winding rotor, which rotates with the movement of the wearer's wrist. The back-and-forth motion of the winding rotor couples to a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] to wind the mainspring automatically. Self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer's wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound.\n\nIn April 2014 the Swatch Group launched the ''sistem51'' wristwatch. It has a purely mechanical movement consisting of only 51 parts, including a novel self-winding mechanism with a transparent oscillating weight. So far, it is the only mechanical movement manufactured entirely on a fully automated assembly line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/featured/exclusive-an-inside-view-of-the-eta-high-tech-swatch-sistem51-production-in-boncourt-in-the-swiss-jura/|title=EXCLUSIVE: An inside view of the ETA high-tech Swatch Sistem51 production in Boncourt in the Swiss Jura \u2013 Watch-Insider.com|date=3 December 2014|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> The low parts count and the automated assembly make it an inexpensive mechanical Swiss watch, which can be considered a successor to ''Roskopf'' movements, although of higher quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/news/swatch-sistem51-swiss-watchmaking-revolution|title=Swatch Sistem51 a Swiss-made watchmaking revolution|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Electronic ===\n{{See also|Electric watch|Quartz clock}}\n[[File:Csem-beta1.jpg|thumb|upright|First quartz wristwatch BETA 1 developed by CEH, Switzerland, 1967]]\nElectronic movements, also known as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a [[quartz]] [[crystal]] which is made to vibrate by the [[piezoelectric effect]]. A varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so, in combination with some electronic components, it functions as an [[quartz oscillator|oscillator]]. It [[resonance|resonates]] at a specific highly stable frequency, which is used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism. Most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to provide a traditional analog display of the time, a feature most consumers still prefer.\n\nIn 1959 [[Seiko]] placed an order with Epson (a daughter company of Seiko and the 'brain' behind the quartz revolution) to start developing a quartz wristwatch. The project was codenamed 59A. By the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Seiko had a working prototype of a portable quartz watch which was used as the time measurements throughout the event.\n\nThe first prototypes of an electronic quartz wristwatch (not just ''portable'' quartz watches as the Seiko timekeeping devices at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964) were made by the CEH research laboratory in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. From 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192&nbsp; Hz quartz oscillator, a thermo-compensation module, and an in-house-made, dedicated integrated circuit (unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later Seiko Astron wristwatch). As a result, the BETA 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the International Chronometric Competition held at the Observatory of Neuch\u00e2tel in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Pioneering_Work_on_the_Quartz_Electronic_Wristwatch,_1962-1967 |title=Milestones:Pioneering Work on the Quartz Electronic Wristwatch, 1962\u20131967 |publisher=Ieeeghn.org |date= |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> In 1970, 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch, including the [[Omega Electroquartz]] as well as [[Patek Philippe]], [[Rolex Oysterquartz]] and Piaget.\n\n[[File:Seiko 35A.jpg|thumb|Quartz Movement of the Seiko Astron, 1969 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2010-006)]]\n\nThe first quartz watch to enter production was the [[Seiko]] [[Astron (wristwatch)|35 SQ Astron]], which hit the shelves on 25 December 1969, swiftly followed by the Swiss Beta 21, and then a year later the prototype of one of the world's most accurate wristwatches to date: the [[Omega Marine Chronometer]].

This ended\u2014in less than a decade\u2014almost 100 years of dominance by the mechanical wristwatch legacy. Modern quartz movements are produced in very large quantities, and even the cheapest wristwatches typically have quartz movements. Whereas mechanical movements can typically be off by several seconds a day, an inexpensive quartz movement in a child's wristwatch may still be accurate to within half a second per day\u2014ten times more accurate than a mechanical movement.<ref>Quartz mechanisms usually have a resonant frequency of 32768&nbsp; Hz, chosen for ease of use (being 2<sup>15</sup>). Using a simple 15 stage divide-by-two circuit, this is turned into a 1 pulse per second signal responsible for the watch's timekeeping.</ref>\n\nAfter a consolidation of the mechanical watch industry in Switzerland during the 1970s, mass production of quartz wristwatches took off under the leadership of the [[Swatch Group]] of companies, a Swiss conglomerate with vertical control of the production of Swiss watches and related products. For quartz wristwatches, subsidiaries of Swatch manufacture [[Watch battery|watch batteries]] (Renata), oscillators ([[Oscilloquartz]], now Micro Crystal AG) and integrated circuits (Ebauches Electronic SA, renamed [[EM Microelectronic-Marin]]). The launch of the new SWATCH brand in 1983 was marked by bold new styling, design, and marketing. Today, the Swatch Group maintains its position as the world's largest watch company.\n\n[[Seiko]]'s efforts to combine the quartz and mechanical movements bore fruit after 20 years of research, leading to the introduction of the [[Seiko]] [[Spring Drive]], first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in September 2005. The Spring Drive keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery, using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring, without the need for a balance wheel either.\n\nIn 2010, Miyota ([[Citizen Watch]]) of [[Japan]] introduced a newly developed movement that uses a 3-pronged quartz crystal that was exclusively produced for [[Bulova]] to be used in the Precisionist or Accutron II line, a new type of quartz watch with ultra-high frequency (262.144&nbsp;kHz) which is claimed to be accurate to +/\u2212 10 seconds a year and has a smooth sweeping second hand rather than one that jumps each second.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/03/23/bulova-introduces-the-most-accurate-watch-in-the-world-the-precisionist/ |title=Bulova introduces the most accurate watch in the world, the Precisionist |publisher=Crunch gear |date = 23 March 2010 |accessdate= 8 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nRadio time signal watches are a type of electronic quartz watch which synchronizes ([[time transfer]]s) its time with an external [[Time signal#Radio time signals|time source]] such as in [[atomic clock]]s, time signals from [[GPS]] navigation satellites, the German [[DCF77]] signal in Europe, [[WWVB]] in the US, and others. Movements of this type may\u2014among others\u2014synchronize the time of day and the date, the [[leap year|leap-year]] status and the state of [[daylight saving time]] (on or off). However, other than the radio receiver, these watches are normal quartz watches in all other aspects.\n\nElectronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity. Usually, the electricity is provided by a replaceable [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding. The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the [[Hamilton Watch Company]] of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].\n\nWatch batteries (strictly speaking cells, as a battery is composed of multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose. They are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more). In most cases, replacing the battery requires a trip to a watch-repair shop or watch dealer; this is especially true for watches that are water-resistant, as special tools and procedures are required for the watch to remain water-resistant after battery replacement. Silver-oxide and lithium batteries are popular today; mercury batteries, formerly quite common, are no longer used, for environmental reasons. Cheap batteries may be alkaline, of the same size as silver-oxide cells but providing shorter life. Rechargeable batteries are used in some [[solar-powered watch]]es.\n\nSome electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer. For instance, Seiko's [[Automatic quartz|kinetic-powered quartz watches]] use the motion of the wearer's arm: turning a rotating weight which causes a tiny [[Electrical generator|generator]] to supply power to charge a rechargeable battery that runs the watch. The concept is similar to that of self-winding spring movements, except that electrical power is generated instead of mechanical spring tension.\n\n[[Solar powered watch]]es are powered by light. A [[photovoltaic cell]] on the face ([[dial (measurement)|dial]]) of the watch converts light to electricity, which is used to charge a [[rechargeable battery]] or [[capacitor]]. The movement of the watch draws its power from the rechargeable battery or capacitor. As long as the watch is regularly exposed to fairly strong light (such as sunlight), it never needs a battery replacement. Some models need only a few minutes of sunlight to provide weeks of energy (as in the Citizen [[Eco-Drive]]). Some of the early solar watches of the 1970s had innovative and unique designs to accommodate the array of solar cells needed to power them (Synchronar, Nepro, Sicura and some models by Cristalonic, Alba, Seiko, and Citizen). As the decades progressed and the efficiency of the solar cells increased while the power requirements of the movement and display decreased, solar watches began to be designed to look like other conventional watches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soluhr.com/|title=History of the Solar Wristwatch|work=Soluhr.com|accessdate=17 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812141728/http://www.soluhr.com/|archive-date=12 August 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA rarely used power source is the temperature difference between the wearer's arm and the surrounding environment (as applied in the [[Citizen Watch Co., Ltd|Citizen]] [[Eco-Drive]] Thermo).\n\n== Display ==\n=== Analog ===\n[[File:Poljot-Aviator-3133.jpg|thumb|[[Poljot]] [[chronograph]]]]\n[[File:Casio AE12.jpg|alt=Casio AE12|thumb|Casio AE12 LCA (liquid-crystal-analog) watch]]\nTraditionally, watches have displayed the time in analog form, with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand. Many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute. Watches powered by quartz usually have a second hand that snaps every second to the next marker. Watches powered by a mechanical movement appears to have a gliding second hand, although it is actually not gliding; the hand merely moves in smaller steps, typically 1/5 of a second, corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance wheel. In some escapements (for example the ''duplex'' escapement), the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance wheel, typically 1/2-second in those watches, or even every four beats (two periods, 1 second), in the ''double duplex'' escapement. A truly gliding second hand is achieved with the ''tri-synchro regulator'' of [[Spring Drive]] watches. All of the hands are normally mechanical, physically rotating on the dial, although a few watches have been produced with \"hands\" that are simulated by a [[liquid crystal display|liquid-crystal display]].\n\nAnalog display of the time is nearly universal in watches sold as jewelry or collectibles, and in these watches, the range of different styles of hands, numbers, and other aspects of the analog dial is very broad. In watches sold for timekeeping, analog display remains very popular, as many people find it easier to read than digital display; but in timekeeping watches the emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading of the time under all conditions (clearly marked digits, easily visible hands, large watch faces, etc.). They are specifically designed for the left wrist with the stem (the knob used for changing the time) on the right side of the watch; this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist. This is the case if one is right-handed and the watch is worn on the left wrist (as is traditionally done). If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.\n\nAnalog watches, as well as clocks, are often marketed showing a display time of approximately 1:50 or 10:10. This creates a visually pleasing smile-like face on the upper half of the watch, in addition to enclosing the manufacturer's name. Digital displays often show a time of 12:08, where the increase in the number of active segments or pixels gives a positive feeling.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/28/business/media/28adco.html|title=Why Time Stands Still for Watchmakers|work=New York Times|accessdate=28 November 2008|date=28 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Ten Ten Tenet|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/market/clockhands.asp|work=Snopes.com|publisher=Barbara and David P.

This was only sold for a few years, as production problems and returned (faulty) product forced the company to cease production.\n\nMost watches with LED displays required that the user press a button to see the time displayed for a few seconds because LEDs used so much power that they could not be kept operating continuously. Usually, the LED display color would be red. Watches with LED displays were popular for a few years, but soon the LED displays were superseded by [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs), which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use, with the display always visible and no need to push a button before seeing the time. Only in darkness would a button need to be pressed to light the display with a tiny light bulb, later illuminating LEDs.<ref>{{US Patent|4096550}}: W. Boller, M. Donati, J. Fingerle, P.

In 1985, Casio produced the CFX-400 scientific calculator watch. In 1987 Casio produced a watch that could dial telephone numbers and Citizen revealed one that would react to voice. In 1995 Timex released a watch which allowed the wearer to download and store data from a computer to their wrist. Some watches, such as the [[Timex Datalink#Timex Datalink USB|Timex Datalink USB]], feature [[dot matrix]] displays. Since their apex during the late 1980s to mid-1990s high technology fad, digital watches have mostly become simpler, less expensive timepieces with little variety between models.\n\n<gallery widths=\"270px\" heights=\"270px\">\nFile:Jumphour.jpg|[[Cort\u00e9bert (watch manufacturer)|''Cort\u00e9bert'']] digital mechanical pocket watch (1890s)\nFile:Cortjump1.jpg|''Cort\u00e9bert'' digital mechanical wristwatch (1920s)\nFile:PulsarLED.jpg|A silver Pulsar [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] watch from 1976.\nFile:Timex T5E901 Ironman Triathlon 30 Lap FLIX.jpg|A [[Timex Group|Timex]] digital watch with an always-on display of the time and date\n</gallery>\n\n=== Illuminated ===\n{{more citations needed|subsection|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Tritium-watch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An illuminated watch face, using tritium]]\nMany watches have displays that are illuminated, so they can be used in darkness. Various methods have been used to achieve this.\n\nMechanical watches often have [[luminous paint]] on their hands and hour marks. In the mid-20th century, radioactive material was often incorporated in the paint, so it would continue to glow without any exposure to light. [[Radium]] was often used but produced small amounts of radiation outside the watch that might have been hazardous.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan's Vintage Watches|url=http://alanwatch.homestead.com/page9.html|publisher=Radium Watch Dial Pattern|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> [[Tritium]] was used as a replacement, since the radiation it produces has such low energy that it cannot penetrate a watch glass. However, tritium is expensive\u2014it has to be made in a [[nuclear reactor]]\u2014and it has a [[half-life]] of only about 12 years so the paint remains luminous for only a few years. Nowadays, tritium is used in specialized watches, e.g., for military purposes (See [[Tritium illumination]]). For other purposes, luminous paint is sometimes used on analog displays, but no radioactive material is contained in it. This means that the display glows soon after being exposed to light and quickly fades.\n\nWatches that incorporate batteries often have the electric illumination of their displays. However, lights consume far more power than electronic watch movements. To conserve the battery, the light is activated only when the user presses a button. Usually, the light remains lit for a few seconds after the button is released, which allows the user to move the hand out of the way.\n\n[[File:Backlit LCD display.jpg|thumbnail|Views of a [[liquid crystal display]], both with [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] backlight switched on (top) and switched off (bottom)]]\n[[File:Casio LCD Watch F-E10.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail| Digital LCD wristwatch Casio type F-E10 with electroluminescent backlighting.]]\nIn some early digital watches, [[LED]] displays were used, which could be read as easily in darkness as in daylight. The user had to press a button to light up the LEDs, which meant that the watch could not be read without the button being pressed, even in full daylight.\n\nIn some types of watches, small [[incandescent]] lamps or LEDs illuminate the display, which is not intrinsically luminous. These tend to produce very non-uniform illumination. Incandescent lamps are very wasteful of electricity.\n\nOther watches use [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] material to produce uniform illumination of the background of the display, against which the hands or digits can be seen.\n\n== Speech synthesis ==\n[[Speech synthesis|Talking]] watches are available, intended for the [[Visual impairment|blind or visually impaired]]. They speak the time out loud at the press of a button. This has the disadvantage of disturbing others nearby or at least alerting the non-[[deaf]] that the wearer is checking the time. Tactile watches are preferred to avoid this awkwardness, but talking watches are preferred for those who are not confident in their ability to read a tactile watch reliably.\n\n==Handedness==\nWristwatches with analog displays generally have a small knob, called the crown, that can be used to adjust the time and, in mechanical watches, wind the spring. Almost always, the crown is located on the right-hand side of the watch so it can be worn of the left wrist for a right-handed individual. This makes it inconvenient to use if the watch is being worn on the right wrist. Some manufacturers offer \"left-hand drive\", aka \"destro\", configured watches which move the crown to the left side<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wornandwound.com/a-guide-to-destro-watches-from-sinn-muhle-citizen-and-more/|title=A Guide to \"Destro\": Watches from Sinn, M\u00fchle, Citizen, and More - Worn & Wound|date=10 May 2016|website=Wornandwound.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> making wearing the watch easier for left-handed individuals.\n\nA rarer configuration is the bullhead watch.  Bullhead watches are generally, but not exclusively, [[chronograph]]s.  The configuration moves the crown and chronograph pushers to the top of the watch.  Bullheads are commonly wristwatch chronographs that are intended to be used as stopwatches off the wrist. Examples are the Citizen Bullhead Change Timer<ref>CITIZEN \"BULLHEAD\" CHALLENGE TIMER</ref> and the Omega Seamaster Bullhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hands-on-with-the-omega-seamaster-bullhead-live-pics-pricing|title=Hands-On: With The Omega Seamaster Bullhead (Live Pics + Pricing)|website=Hodinkee.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nDigital watches generally have push-buttons that can be used to make adjustments. These are usually equally easy to use on either wrist.\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Rolex-Submariner.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Rolex]] Submariner, an officially certified chronometer]]\n[[File:Breguet MG 2573.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[Breguet (watch)|Breguet]] squelette watch 2933 with [[tourbillon]]]]\n[[File:Patek-Philippe MG 2583.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Perpetual calendar and moonphase wristwatch by [[Patek Philippe]]]]\nCustomarily, watches provide the [[time of day]], giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second. Many also provide the current date, and some (called \"complete calendar\" or \"triple date\" watches) display the day of the week and the month as well. However, many watches also provide a great deal of information beyond the basics of time and date. Some watches include [[alarm]]s. Other elaborate and more expensive watches, both pocket and wrist models, also incorporate [[Striking clock|striking mechanisms]] or [[Repeater (horology)|repeater]] functions, so that the wearer could learn the time by the sound emanating from the watch. This announcement or striking feature is an essential characteristic of true clocks and distinguishes such watches from ordinary [[Clock|timepieces]]. This feature is available on most digital watches.\n\nA ''complicated watch'' has one or more functions beyond the basic function of displaying the time and the date; such a functionality is called a [[Complication (horology)|complication]]. Two popular complications are the '''[[chronograph]]''' complication, which is the ability of the watch movement to function as a [[stopwatch]], and the '''moonphase''' complication, which is a display of the [[lunar phase]]. Other more expensive complications include [[Tourbillon]], [[Perpetual calendar]], [[Minute repeater]], and [[Equation of time]]. A truly complicated watch has many of these complications at once (see [[Calibre 89]] from [[Patek Philippe]] for instance). Some watches can both indicate the [[Qibla compass|direction of Mecca]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Muslim watches |url=http://www.watchismo.com/search.aspx?find=muslim |publisher=Watchismo |accessdate=14 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928004218/http://www.watchismo.com/search.aspx?find=muslim |archivedate=28 September 2015 }}</ref> and have alarms that can be set for all daily prayer requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Islamic Watch & Clock|url=http://www.alfajr.com|publisher=ALFAJR|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> Among watch enthusiasts, complicated watches are especially collectible. Some watches include a second 12-hour or 24-hour display for [[UTC]] or [[GMT]].\n\nThe similar-sounding terms '''chronograph''' and '''chronometer''' are often confused, although they mean altogether different things. A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer, often a [[stopwatch]] complication (as explained above), while a [[chronometer watch]] is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a chronometer is a high quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the [[COSC]] (Contr\u00f4le Officiel Suisse des Chronom\u00e8tres). The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a chronometer, both, or neither.\n\n[[File:Datalink USB Dress Edition.JPG|thumb|upright|Timex Datalink USB Dress edition from 2003 with a dot matrix display; the ''Invasion'' video game is on the screen]]\n\nMany computerized wristwatches have been developed, but none have had long-term sales success, because they have awkward [[user interface]]s due to the tiny screens and buttons, and short battery life. As miniaturized electronics became cheaper, watches have been developed containing [[calculator watch|calculators]], [[tonometer]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[altimeter]]s, a [[compass]] using both hands to show the N/S direction, [[video game]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[keydrive]]s, [[GPS watch|GPS receivers]] and [[cellular phone]]s. A few [[Astronomical clock#Watches|astronomical watches]] show [[phase of the Moon]] and other celestial phenomena. In the early 1980s [[Seiko]] marketed a watch with a television in it. Such watches have also had the reputation as unsightly and thus mainly [[geek]] toys. Several companies have however attempted to develop a [[computer]] contained in a wristwatch (see also [[wearable computer]]).\n\nElectronic sports watches, combining timekeeping with GPS and/or [[Activity tracker|activity tracking]], address the general [[Physical fitness|fitness]] market and have the potential for commercial success ([[Garmin forerunner]], Garmin Vivofit, Epson,<ref name=\"Epson\" /> announced model of [[Swatch]] Touch series<ref>Hug, Daniel : ''Swatch lanciert 2015 eine intelligente Uhr.''

Their digital equivalents use [[synthesised speech]] to speak the time on command.\n\n=== Fashion ===\nWristwatches and antique pocket watches are often appreciated as [[jewelry]] or as [[collectible]] works of [[art]] rather than just as timepieces.<ref name=NYT012113>{{cite news|title=Buying Back a Forgotten Chinese Heritage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/fashion/21iht-acaw-pocket21.html|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 January 2013|author=Nazanin Lankarani|quote=We try to explain why it makes sense to spend $500,000 on a watch.}}</ref> This has created several different markets for wristwatches, ranging from very inexpensive but accurate watches (intended for no other purpose than telling the correct time) to extremely expensive watches that serve mainly as personal adornment or as examples of high achievement in miniaturization and precision mechanical engineering.\n\nTraditionally, dress watches appropriate for [[informal attire|informal]] (business), [[semi-formal]], and [[formal wear|formal]] attire are [[gold]], thin, simple, and plain, but increasingly rugged, [[Complication (horology)|complicated]], or sports watches are considered by some to be acceptable for such attire. Some dress watches have a [[cabochon]] on the crown or [[facet]]ed [[gemstone]]s on the face, [[bezel setting|bezel]], or bracelet. Some are made entirely of faceted [[sapphire]] ([[corundum]]).\n\nMany fashions and [[department store]]s offer a variety of less-expensive, trendy, \"[[costume jewelry|costume]]\" watches (usually for women), many of which are similar in quality to basic quartz timepieces but which feature bolder designs. In the 1980s, the Swiss [[Swatch]] company hired graphic designers to redesign a new annual collection of non-repairable watches.\n\nTrade in [[counterfeit watch]]es, which mimic expensive brand-name watches, constitutes an estimated {{USD|1 billion}} market per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.havocscope.com/counterfeit-watches-market-value/|title=Havocscope Counterfeit Watches Market Value: $1 billion}}</ref>\n\n=== Space ===\n[[File:OMEGA-Speedmaster-Professional-Front.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Omega Speedmaster]], selected by [[NASA]] for use on space missions in the 1960s.]]\n\nThe [[Weightlessness|zero-gravity]] environment and other extreme conditions encountered by [[astronaut]]s in [[Outer space|space]] require the use of specially tested watches.\n\nThe first ever watch to be sent into space was a Russian \"[[Pobeda (watch)|Pobeda]]\" watch from the [[Petrodvorets Watch Factory]]. It was sent on a single orbit flight on the spaceship [[Korabl-Sputnik 4]] on 9 March 1961. The watch had been attached without authorisation to the wrist of Chernuchka, a dog that successfully did exactly the same trip as Yuri Gagarin, with exactly the same rocket and equipment, just a month before Gagarin's flight.<ref>{{cite book |title=Animals in Space: From Research Rockets to the Space Shuttle |edition=illustrated |first1=Colin |last1=Burgess |first2=Chris |last2=Dubbs |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-387-49678-8 |page=213 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSdHVIpsrKkC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=xSdHVIpsrKkC&pg=PA213 Extract of page 213]</ref>\n\nOn 12 April 1961, [[Yuri Gagarin]] wore a Shturmanskie (a transliteration of ''\u0428\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435'' which actually means \"navigator's\") wristwatch during his historic first flight into space.

These watches are sometimes called [[diving watches]] when they are suitable for [[scuba diving]] or [[saturation diving]]. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] issued a standard for water resistant watches which also prohibits the term \"[[waterproof]]\" to be used with watches, which many countries have adopted.\n\nWater resistance is achieved by the [[gasket]]s which forms a watertight seal, used in conjunction with a sealant applied on the case to help keep water out. The material of the case must also be tested in order to pass as water resistant.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europastar.com/europastar/watch_tech/waterresistance.jsp|title=Watch Industry Questions and Answers: Water-Resistance|work=Europa Star|publisher=VNU eMedia Inc|accessdate=17 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nNone of the tests defined by [[ISO 2281]] for the Water Resistant mark are suitable to qualify a watch for scuba diving. Such watches are designed for everyday life and must be water resistant during exercises such as swimming. They can be worn in different temperature and pressure conditions but are under no circumstances designed for scuba diving.\n\nThe standards for diving watches are regulated by the [[ISO 6425]] international standard. The watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water) pressure, thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water. The testing of the water resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every watch has to be fully tested. Besides water resistance standards to a minimum of 100-metre depth rating ISO 6425 also provides eight minimum requirements for mechanical diver's watches for scuba diving (quartz and digital watches have slightly differing readability requirements). For diver's watches for mixed-gas saturation diving two additional requirements have to be met.\n\nWatches are classified by their degree of water resistance, which roughly translates to the following (1 metre = 3.281 feet):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jwnz.co.nz/page/watches.aspx|title=Watches|website=Jwnz.co.nz|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Main Article [[ISO 6425#Water resistance classification|ISO 6425]]\n|-\n! nowrap=\"nowrap\" |Water-resistance rating || Suitability || Remarks\n|-\n| Water Resistant or 30&nbsp;m || Suitable for everyday use.

Therefore, a 5 bar watch is equivalent to a 40-metre watch. Some watches are rated in [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] (atm), which are roughly equivalent to bar.\n\n=== Navigation ===\n{{Main|Cardinal direction#Watch dial}}\nThere is a traditional method by which an [[analog watch]] can be used to locate north and south. The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour [[clock face]] takes twelve hours to complete one rotation. In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate south. For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north. During [[daylight saving time]], the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12. This method is accurate enough to be used only at fairly high latitudes.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Technology}}\n\n{{clear}}\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[24-hour analog dial]]\n* [[American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute]]\n* [[Clock]]\n* [[Coin watch]]\n* [[Smartwatch]]\n* [[List of watch manufacturers]]\n*[[List of most expensive watches sold at auction]]\n* [[Marine chronometer]]\n* [[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]\n* [[Tachymeter (watch)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Beckett, Edmund]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17576 ''A Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks, Watches and Bells''], 1903, from [[Project Gutenberg]]\n* Berner, G.A., [http://www.fhs.ch/berner/?l=en ''Illustrated Professional Dictionary of Horology''], [[Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry]] FH 1961\u20132012\n* Daniels, George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWq8c0xvGxsC&printsec=frontcover ''Watchmaking''], London: Philip Wilson Publishers, 1981 (reprinted 15 June 2011)\n* De Carle, Donald, (Illustrations by E.

In particular, [[6LoWPAN]] defines a binding for the [[IPv6]] version of the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) over WPANs, and is itself used by upper layers like [[Thread (network protocol)|Thread]]. \n\n==Overview==\n\nIEEE standard 802.15.4 intends to offer the fundamental lower network layers of a type of wireless personal area network (WPAN) which focuses on low-cost, low-speed ubiquitous communication between devices.  It can be contrasted with other approaches, such as [[Wi-Fi]], which offer more bandwidth and require more power. The emphasis is on very low cost communication of nearby devices with little to no underlying infrastructure, intending to exploit this to lower power consumption even more.\n\nThe basic framework conceives a 10-meter communications range with a [[transfer rate]] of 250 kbit/s. Tradeoffs are possible to favor more radically [[Embedded system|embedded devices]] with even lower power requirements, through the definition of not one, but several physical layers. Lower transfer rates of 20 and 40 kbit/s were initially defined, with the 100 kbit/s rate being added in the current revision.\n\nEven lower rates can be considered with the resulting effect on power consumption. As already mentioned, the main identifying feature of IEEE 802.15.4 among WPANs is the importance of achieving extremely low manufacturing and operation costs and technological simplicity, without sacrificing flexibility or generality.\n\nImportant features include [[Real-time computing|real-time]] suitability by reservation of Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS), collision avoidance through [[CSMA/CA]] and integrated support for secure communications. Devices also include power management functions such as link quality and energy detection.  The standard does have provisions for supporting time and rate sensitive applications because of its ability to operate in pure CSMA/CA or [[Time-division multiple access|TDMA]] access modes. The TDMA mode of operation is supported via the GTS feature of the standard.<ref>A. Mishra, C. Na and D. Rosenburgh, \"On Scheduling Guaranteed Time Slots for Time Sensitive Transactions in IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,\" MILCOM 2007 - IEEE Military Communications Conference, Orlando, FL, USA, 2007, pp. 1-7. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4455149/</ref>\n\nIEEE 802.15.4-conformant devices may use one of three possible [[Frequency allocation|frequency band]]s for operation (868/915/2450&nbsp;MHz).\n\n==Protocol architecture==\n[[Image:IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack.svg|thumb|upright=1.2 |IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack]] Devices are conceived to interact with each other over a conceptually simple [[wireless network]]. The definition of the network layers is based on the [[OSI model]]; although only the lower layers are defined in the standard, interaction with upper layers is intended, possibly using an [[IEEE 802.2]] [[logical link control]] sublayer accessing the MAC through a convergence sublayer. Implementations may rely on external devices or be purely embedded, self-functioning devices.\n\n=== The physical layer ===\nThe physical layer is the initial layer in the OSI reference model used worldwide.\nThe ''physical layer'' (PHY) ultimately provides the data transmission service, as well as the interface to the ''physical layer management entity'', which offers access to every layer management function and maintains a database of information on related personal area networks. Thus, the PHY manages the physical [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[transceiver]] and performs channel selection and energy and signal management functions. It operates on one of three possible unlicensed frequency bands:\n* 868.0\u2013868.6&nbsp;MHz: Europe, allows one communication channel (2003, 2006, 2011<ref>[https://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.15.4-2011.pdf IEEE Std 802.15.4-2011 8.1.2.2]</ref>) <!-- Note that the standard does specify three different PHYs for the only available channel in the 868 MHz band. There is still only one channel in the sense that the three PHYs will interfere with each other; channel hopping for example will be impossible.  -->\n* 902\u2013928&nbsp;MHz: North America, up to ten channels (2003), extended to thirty (2006)\n* 2400\u20132483.5&nbsp;MHz: worldwide use, up to sixteen channels (2003, 2006)\nThe original 2003 version of the standard specifies two physical layers based on ''[[direct sequence spread spectrum]]'' (DSSS) techniques: one working in the 868/915&nbsp;MHz bands with transfer rates of 20 and 40 kbit/s, and one in the 2450&nbsp;MHz band with a rate of 250 kbit/s.\n\nThe 2006 revision improves the maximum data rates of the 868/915&nbsp;MHz bands, bringing them up to support 100 and 250 kbit/s as well. Moreover, it goes on to define four physical layers depending on the [[modulation]] method used. Three of them preserve the DSSS approach: in the 868/915&nbsp;MHz bands, using either binary or [[Phase shift keying#Offset QPSK (OQPSK)|offset quadrature phase shift keying]] (the second of which is optional); in the 2450&nbsp;MHz band, using the latter. An alternative, optional 868/915&nbsp;MHz layer is defined using a combination of binary keying and [[Amplitude-shift keying|amplitude shift keying]] (thus based on parallel, not sequential spread spectrum, [[PSSS]]). Dynamic switching between supported 868/915&nbsp;MHz PHYs is possible.\n\nBeyond these three bands, the IEEE 802.15.4c study group considered the newly opened 314\u2013316&nbsp;MHz, 430\u2013434&nbsp;MHz, and 779\u2013787&nbsp;MHz bands in China, while the IEEE 802.15 Task Group 4d defined an amendment to 802.15.4-2006 to support the new 950\u2013956&nbsp;MHz band in Japan. First standard amendments by these groups were released in April 2009.\n\nIn August 2007, [[IEEE 802.15.4a]] was released expanding the four PHYs available in the earlier 2006 version to six, including one PHY using Direct Sequence [[ultra-wideband]] (UWB) and another using [[Chirp Spread Spectrum|chirp spread spectrum]] (CSS).  The UWB PHY is allocated frequencies in three ranges: below 1&nbsp;GHz, between 3 and 5&nbsp;GHz, and between 6 and 10&nbsp;GHz. The CSS PHY is allocated spectrum in the 2450&nbsp;MHz ISM band.<ref>IEEE Computer Society, (August 31, 2007). IEEE Standard 802.15.4a-2007</ref>\n\nIn April, 2009 IEEE 802.15.4c and IEEE 802.15.4d were released expanding the available PHYs with several additional PHYs: one for 780&nbsp;MHz band using [[Phase-shift keying#Offset QPSK (OQPSK)|O-QPSK]] or MPSK,<ref>IEEE Computer Society, (April 17, 2009). IEEE Standard 802.15.4c-2009</ref> another for 950&nbsp;MHz using [[Gaussian frequency-shift keying|GFSK]] or [[Phase-shift keying#Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)|BPSK]].<ref>IEEE Computer Society, (April 17, 2009). IEEE Standard 802.15.4d-2009</ref>\n\nIEEE 802.15.4e was chartered to define a MAC amendment to the existing standard 802.15.4-2006 which adopts channel hopping strategy to improve support for the industrial markets, increases robustness against external interference and persistent multi-path fading. On February 6, 2012 the IEEE Standards Association Board approved the IEEE 802.15.4e which concluded all Task Group 4e efforts.\n\n=== The MAC layer ===\n\nThe [[medium access control]] (MAC) enables the transmission of MAC frames through the use of the physical channel. Besides the data service, it offers a management interface and itself manages access to the physical channel and network [[Beacon frame|beaconing]]. It also controls frame validation, guarantees [[Time-division multiplexing|time slots]] and handles node associations. Finally, it offers hook points for secure services.\n\nNote that the IEEE 802.15 standard does ''not'' use 802.1D or 802.1Q, i.e., it does not exchange standard [[Ethernet frame]]s.  The physical frame-format is specified in IEEE802.15.4-2011 in section 5.2.  It is tailored to the fact that most IEEE 802.15.4 PHYs only support frames of up to 127 bytes (adaptation layer protocols such as 6LoWPAN provide fragmentation schemes to support larger network layer packets).\n\n=== Higher layers ===\n\nNo higher-level layers and interoperability sublayers are defined in the standard. Other specifications - such as [[ZigBee specification|ZigBee]], SNAP, and [[6LoWPAN]]/[[Thread (network protocol)|Thread]] - build on this standard. [[RIOT (operating system)|RIOT]], [[OpenWSN]], [[TinyOS]],  [[Unison RTOS]], [[DSPnano RTOS]], [[nanoQplus]], [[Contiki]] and [[Zephyr (operating system)|Zephyr]] operating systems also use a few items of IEEE 802.15.4 hardware and software.\n\n==Network model==\n\n=== Node types ===\nThe standard defines two types of network node.\n\nThe first one is the '''full-function device''' (FFD). It can serve as the coordinator of a personal area network just as it may function as a common node. It implements a general model of communication which allows it to talk to any other device: it may also relay messages, in which case it is dubbed a coordinator (PAN coordinator when it is in charge of the whole network).\n\nOn the other hand, there are '''reduced-function devices''' (RFD). These are meant to be extremely simple devices with very modest resource and communication requirements; due to this, they can only communicate with FFDs and can never act as coordinators.\n\n=== Topologies ===\n[[Image:IEEE 802.15.4 Star P2P.svg|thumb|IEEE 802.15.4 star and peer-to-peer]]\n[[Image:IEEE 802.15.4 cluster tree.png|thumb|upright=1.3 |IEEE 802.15.4 cluster tree]]\n\nNetworks can be built as either [[peer-to-peer]] or [[Star network|star]] networks. However, every network needs at least one FFD to work as the coordinator of the network. Networks are thus formed by groups of devices separated by suitable distances. Each device has a unique 64-bit identifier, and if some conditions are met, short 16-bit identifiers can be used within a restricted environment. Namely, within each PAN domain, communications will probably use short identifiers.\n\n'''Peer-to-peer (or point-to-point)''' networks can form arbitrary patterns of connections, and their extension is only limited by the distance between each pair of nodes. They are meant to serve as the basis for [[ad hoc network]]s capable of performing self-management and organization. Since the standard does not define a network layer, [[routing]] is not directly supported, but such an additional layer can add support for [[Multi-hop routing|multihop]] communications. Further topological restrictions may be added; the standard mentions the [[cluster tree]] as a structure which exploits the fact that an RFD may only be associated with one FFD at a time to form a network where RFDs are exclusively leaves of a tree, and most of the nodes are FFDs. The structure can be extended as a generic [[mesh network]] whose nodes are cluster tree networks with a local coordinator for each cluster, in addition to the global coordinator.\n\nA more structured '''star''' pattern is also supported, where the coordinator of the network will necessarily be the central node. Such a network can originate when an FFD decides to create its own PAN and declare itself its coordinator, after choosing a unique PAN identifier. After that, other devices can join the network, which is fully independent from all other star networks.\n\n==Data transport architecture==\n\n[[Data frame|Frames]] are the basic unit of data transport, of which there are four fundamental types (data, acknowledgment, beacon and MAC command frames), which provide a reasonable tradeoff between simplicity and robustness. Additionally, a superframe structure, defined by the coordinator, may be used, in which case two beacons act as its limits and provide synchronization to other devices as well as configuration information. A [[superframe]] consists of sixteen equal-length slots, which can be further divided into an active part and an inactive part, during which the coordinator may enter power saving mode, not needing to control its network.\n\nWithin superframes [[Contention (telecommunications)|contention]] occurs between their limits, and is resolved by [[CSMA/CA]]. Every transmission must end before the arrival of the second beacon. As mentioned before, applications with well-defined bandwidth needs can use up to seven domains of one or more [[contention (telecommunications)|contention]]less guaranteed time slots, trailing at the end of the superframe. The first part of the superframe must be sufficient to give service to the network structure and its devices. Superframes are typically utilized within the context of low-latency devices, whose associations must be kept even if inactive for long periods of time.\n\nData transfers to the coordinator require a beacon synchronization phase, if applicable, followed by [[CSMA/CA]] transmission (by means of slots if superframes are in use); [[Acknowledgement (data networks)|acknowledgment]] is optional. Data transfers from the coordinator usually follow device requests: if beacons are in use, these are used to signal requests; the coordinator acknowledges the request and then sends the data in packets which are acknowledged by the device. The same is done when superframes are not in use, only in this case there are no beacons to keep track of pending messages.\n\nPoint-to-point networks may either use unslotted [[CSMA/CA]] or synchronization mechanisms; in this case, communication between any two devices is possible, whereas in \"structured\" modes one of the devices must be the network coordinator.\n\nIn general, all implemented procedures follow a typical request-confirm/indication-response classification.\n\n==Reliability and security==\n\nThe physical medium is accessed through a [[CSMA/CA]] protocol. Networks which are not using beaconing mechanisms utilize an unslotted variation which is based on the listening of the medium, leveraged by a [[Exponential backoff|random exponential backoff]] algorithm; acknowledgments do not adhere to this discipline. Common data transmission utilizes unallocated slots when beaconing is in use; again, confirmations do not follow the same process.\n\nConfirmation messages may be optional under certain circumstances, in which case a success assumption is made. Whatever the case, if a device is unable to process a frame at a given time, it simply does not confirm its reception: [[Timeout (telecommunication)|timeout-based retransmission]] can be performed a number of times, following after that a decision of whether to abort or keep trying.\n\nBecause the predicted environment of these devices demands maximization of battery life, the protocols tend to favor the methods which lead to it, implementing periodic checks for pending messages, the frequency of which depends on application needs.\n\nRegarding secure communications, the MAC sublayer offers facilities which can be harnessed by upper layers to achieve the desired level of security. Higher-layer processes may specify keys to perform [[Symmetric key|symmetric cryptography]] to protect the payload and restrict it to a group of devices or just a point-to-point link; these groups of devices can be specified in [[access control list]]s. Furthermore, MAC computes ''freshness checks'' between successive receptions to ensure that presumably old frames, or data which is no longer considered valid, does not transcend to higher layers.\n\nIn addition to this secure mode, there is another, insecure MAC mode, which allows access control lists<ref name=\"Zigbee\" /> merely as a means to decide on the acceptance of frames according to their (presumed) source.\n\n==See also==\n* [[ANT (network)|ANT]]\n* [[Bluetooth]]\n* [[DASH7]]\n* [[EnOcean]]\n* [[INSTEON]]\n* [[NeuRFon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ieee802.org/15/pub/TG4.html 802.15.4 Task Group]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/802.15.html Get IEEE 802.15]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/project/802_15_4z.html IEEE standard 802.15.4z]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.15.4v-2017.html IEEE standard 802.15.4v-2017]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.15.4u-2016.html IEEE standard 802.15.4u-2016]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.15.4t-2017.html IEEE standard 802.15.4t-2017]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4q-2016.html IEEE standard 802.15.4q-2016]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4p-2014.html IEEE standard 802.15.4p-2014]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4n-2016.html IEEE standard 802.15.4n-2016]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4m-2014.html IEEE standard 802.15.4m-2014]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4k-2013.html IEEE standard 802.15.4k-2013]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4j-2013.html IEEE standard 802.15.4j-2013]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4g-2012.html IEEE standard 802.15.4g-2012]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4f-2012.html IEEE standard 802.15.4f-2012]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4e-2012.html IEEE standard 802.15.4e-2012]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4d-2009.html IEEE standard 802.15.4d-2009]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4c-2009.html IEEE standard 802.15.4c-2009]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4a-2007.html IEEE standard 802.15.4a-2007]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/802_15_4-2015.html IEEE standard 802.15.4-2015]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/802_15_4-2011.html IEEE standard 802.15.4-2011]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/802_15_4-2006.html IEEE standard 802.15.4-2006]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/802_15_4-2003.html IEEE standard 802.15.4-2003]\n\n{{IEEE standards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ieee 802.15.4-2006}}\n[[Category:IEEE 802]]\n[[Category:Wireless networking standards]]\n", "text_old": "{{primary sources|date=November 2018}}\n'''IEEE 802.15.4''' is a technical standard which defines the operation of [[Personal area network|low-rate wireless personal area network]]s (LR-WPANs).

Lower transfer rates of 20 and 40 kbit/s were initially defined, with the 100 kbit/s rate being added in the current revision.\n\nEven lower rates can be considered with the resulting effect on power consumption. As already mentioned, the main identifying feature of IEEE 802.15.4 among WPANs is the importance of achieving extremely low manufacturing and operation costs and technological simplicity, without sacrificing flexibility or generality.\n\nImportant features include [[Real-time computing|real-time]] suitability by reservation of Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS), collision avoidance through [[CSMA/CA]] and integrated support for secure communications. Devices also include power management functions such as link quality and energy detection.  The standard does have provisions for supporting time and rate sensitive applications because of its ability to operate in pure CSMA/CA or [[Time-division multiple access|TDMA]] access modes. The TDMA mode of operation is supported via the GTS feature of the standard.<ref>A. Mishra, C. Na and D. Rosenburgh, \"On Scheduling Guaranteed Time Slots for Time Sensitive Transactions in IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,\" MILCOM 2007 - IEEE Military Communications Conference, Orlando, FL, USA, 2007, pp. 1-7. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4455149/</ref>\n\nIEEE 802.15.4-conformant devices may use one of three possible [[Frequency allocation|frequency band]]s for operation (868/915/2450&nbsp;MHz).\n\n==Protocol architecture==\n[[Image:IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack.svg|thumb|upright=1.2 |IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack]] Devices are conceived to interact with each other over a conceptually simple [[wireless network]]. The definition of the network layers is based on the [[OSI model]]; although only the lower layers are defined in the standard, interaction with upper layers is intended, possibly using an [[IEEE 802.2]] [[logical link control]] sublayer accessing the MAC through a convergence sublayer. Implementations may rely on external devices or be purely embedded, self-functioning devices.\n\n=== The physical layer ===\nThe physical layer is the initial layer in the OSI reference model used worldwide.\nThe ''physical layer'' (PHY) ultimately provides the data transmission service, as well as the interface to the ''physical layer management entity'', which offers access to every layer management function and maintains a database of information on related personal area networks. Thus, the PHY manages the physical [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[transceiver]] and performs channel selection and energy and signal management functions. It operates on one of three possible unlicensed frequency bands:\n* 868.0\u2013868.6&nbsp;MHz: Europe, allows one communication channel (2003, 2006, 2011<ref>[https://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.15.4-2011.pdf IEEE Std 802.15.4-2011 8.1.2.2]</ref>) <!-- Note that the standard does specify three different PHYs for the only available channel in the 868 MHz band. There is still only one channel in the sense that the three PHYs will interfere with each other; channel hopping for example will be impossible.  -->\n* 902\u2013928&nbsp;MHz: North America, up to ten channels (2003), extended to thirty (2006)\n* 2400\u20132483.5&nbsp;MHz: worldwide use, up to sixteen channels (2003, 2006)\nThe original 2003 version of the standard specifies two physical layers based on ''[[direct sequence spread spectrum]]'' (DSSS) techniques: one working in the 868/915&nbsp;MHz bands with transfer rates of 20 and 40 kbit/s, and one in the 2450&nbsp;MHz band with a rate of 250 kbit/s.\n\nThe 2006 revision improves the maximum data rates of the 868/915&nbsp;MHz bands, bringing them up to support 100 and 250 kbit/s as well. Moreover, it goes on to define four physical layers depending on the [[modulation]] method used. Three of them preserve the DSSS approach: in the 868/915&nbsp;MHz bands, using either binary or [[Phase shift keying#Offset QPSK (OQPSK)|offset quadrature phase shift keying]] (the second of which is optional); in the 2450&nbsp;MHz band, using the latter. An alternative, optional 868/915&nbsp;MHz layer is defined using a combination of binary keying and [[Amplitude-shift keying|amplitude shift keying]] (thus based on parallel, not sequential spread spectrum, [[PSSS]]). Dynamic switching between supported 868/915&nbsp;MHz PHYs is possible.\n\nBeyond these three bands, the IEEE 802.15.4c study group considered the newly opened 314\u2013316&nbsp;MHz, 430\u2013434&nbsp;MHz, and 779\u2013787&nbsp;MHz bands in China, while the IEEE 802.15 Task Group 4d defined an amendment to 802.15.4-2006 to support the new 950\u2013956&nbsp;MHz band in Japan. First standard amendments by these groups were released in April 2009.\n\nIn August 2007, [[IEEE 802.15.4a]] was released expanding the four PHYs available in the earlier 2006 version to six, including one PHY using Direct Sequence [[ultra-wideband]] (UWB) and another using [[Chirp Spread Spectrum|chirp spread spectrum]] (CSS).  The UWB PHY is allocated frequencies in three ranges: below 1&nbsp;GHz, between 3 and 5&nbsp;GHz, and between 6 and 10&nbsp;GHz. The CSS PHY is allocated spectrum in the 2450&nbsp;MHz ISM band.<ref>IEEE Computer Society, (August 31, 2007). IEEE Standard 802.15.4a-2007</ref>\n\nIn April, 2009 IEEE 802.15.4c and IEEE 802.15.4d were released expanding the available PHYs with several additional PHYs: one for 780&nbsp;MHz band using [[Phase-shift keying#Offset QPSK (OQPSK)|O-QPSK]] or MPSK,<ref>IEEE Computer Society, (April 17, 2009). IEEE Standard 802.15.4c-2009</ref> another for 950&nbsp;MHz using [[Gaussian frequency-shift keying|GFSK]] or [[Phase-shift keying#Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)|BPSK]].<ref>IEEE Computer Society, (April 17, 2009). IEEE Standard 802.15.4d-2009</ref>\n\nIEEE 802.15.4e was chartered to define a MAC amendment to the existing standard 802.15.4-2006 which adopts channel hopping strategy to improve support for the industrial markets, increases robustness against external interference and persistent multi-path fading. On February 6, 2012 the IEEE Standards Association Board approved the IEEE 802.15.4e which concluded all Task Group 4e efforts.\n\n=== The MAC layer ===\n\nThe [[medium access control]] (MAC) enables the transmission of MAC frames through the use of the physical channel. Besides the data service, it offers a management interface and itself manages access to the physical channel and network [[Beacon frame|beaconing]]. It also controls frame validation, guarantees [[Time-division multiplexing|time slots]] and handles node associations. Finally, it offers hook points for secure services.\n\nNote that the IEEE 802.15 standard does ''not'' use 802.1D or 802.1Q, i.e., it does not exchange standard [[Ethernet frame]]s.  The physical frame-format is specified in IEEE802.15.4-2011 in section 5.2.  It is tailored to the fact that most IEEE 802.15.4 PHYs only support frames of up to 127 bytes (adaptation layer protocols such as 6LoWPAN provide fragmentation schemes to support larger network layer packets).\n\n=== Higher layers ===\n\nNo higher-level layers and interoperability sublayers are defined in the standard. Other specifications - such as [[ZigBee specification|ZigBee]], SNAP, and [[6LoWPAN]]/[[Thread (network protocol)|Thread]] - build on this standard. [[RIOT (operating system)|RIOT]], [[OpenWSN]], [[TinyOS]],  [[Unison RTOS]], [[DSPnano RTOS]], [[nanoQplus]], [[Contiki]] and [[Zephyr (operating system)|Zephyr]] operating systems also use a few items of IEEE 802.15.4 hardware and software.\n\n==Network model==\n\n=== Node types ===\nThe standard defines two types of network node.\n\nThe first one is the '''full-function device''' (FFD). It can serve as the coordinator of a personal area network just as it may function as a common node. It implements a general model of communication which allows it to talk to any other device: it may also relay messages, in which case it is dubbed a coordinator (PAN coordinator when it is in charge of the whole network).\n\nOn the other hand, there are '''reduced-function devices''' (RFD). These are meant to be extremely simple devices with very modest resource and communication requirements; due to this, they can only communicate with FFDs and can never act as coordinators.\n\n=== Topologies ===\n[[Image:IEEE 802.15.4 Star P2P.svg|thumb|IEEE 802.15.4 star and peer-to-peer]]\n[[Image:IEEE 802.15.4 cluster tree.png|thumb|upright=1.3 |IEEE 802.15.4 cluster tree]]\n\nNetworks can be built as either [[peer-to-peer]] or [[Star network|star]] networks. However, every network needs at least one FFD to work as the coordinator of the network. Networks are thus formed by groups of devices separated by suitable distances. Each device has a unique 64-bit identifier, and if some conditions are met, short 16-bit identifiers can be used within a restricted environment. Namely, within each PAN domain, communications will probably use short identifiers.\n\n'''Peer-to-peer (or point-to-point)''' networks can form arbitrary patterns of connections, and their extension is only limited by the distance between each pair of nodes. They are meant to serve as the basis for [[ad hoc network]]s capable of performing self-management and organization. Since the standard does not define a network layer, [[routing]] is not directly supported, but such an additional layer can add support for [[Multi-hop routing|multihop]] communications. Further topological restrictions may be added; the standard mentions the [[cluster tree]] as a structure which exploits the fact that an RFD may only be associated with one FFD at a time to form a network where RFDs are exclusively leaves of a tree, and most of the nodes are FFDs. The structure can be extended as a generic [[mesh network]] whose nodes are cluster tree networks with a local coordinator for each cluster, in addition to the global coordinator.\n\nA more structured '''star''' pattern is also supported, where the coordinator of the network will necessarily be the central node. Such a network can originate when an FFD decides to create its own PAN and declare itself its coordinator, after choosing a unique PAN identifier. After that, other devices can join the network, which is fully independent from all other star networks.\n\n==Data transport architecture==\n\n[[Data frame|Frames]] are the basic unit of data transport, of which there are four fundamental types (data, acknowledgment, beacon and MAC command frames), which provide a reasonable tradeoff between simplicity and robustness. Additionally, a superframe structure, defined by the coordinator, may be used, in which case two beacons act as its limits and provide synchronization to other devices as well as configuration information. A [[superframe]] consists of sixteen equal-length slots, which can be further divided into an active part and an inactive part, during which the coordinator may enter power saving mode, not needing to control its network.\n\nWithin superframes [[Contention (telecommunications)|contention]] occurs between their limits, and is resolved by [[CSMA/CA]]. Every transmission must end before the arrival of the second beacon. As mentioned before, applications with well-defined bandwidth needs can use up to seven domains of one or more [[contention (telecommunications)|contention]]less guaranteed time slots, trailing at the end of the superframe. The first part of the superframe must be sufficient to give service to the network structure and its devices. Superframes are typically utilized within the context of low-latency devices, whose associations must be kept even if inactive for long periods of time.\n\nData transfers to the coordinator require a beacon synchronization phase, if applicable, followed by [[CSMA/CA]] transmission (by means of slots if superframes are in use); [[Acknowledgement (data networks)|acknowledgment]] is optional. Data transfers from the coordinator usually follow device requests: if beacons are in use, these are used to signal requests; the coordinator acknowledges the request and then sends the data in packets which are acknowledged by the device. The same is done when superframes are not in use, only in this case there are no beacons to keep track of pending messages.\n\nPoint-to-point networks may either use unslotted [[CSMA/CA]] or synchronization mechanisms; in this case, communication between any two devices is possible, whereas in \"structured\" modes one of the devices must be the network coordinator.\n\nIn general, all implemented procedures follow a typical request-confirm/indication-response classification.\n\n==Reliability and security==\n\nThe physical medium is accessed through a [[CSMA/CA]] protocol. Networks which are not using beaconing mechanisms utilize an unslotted variation which is based on the listening of the medium, leveraged by a [[Exponential backoff|random exponential backoff]] algorithm; acknowledgments do not adhere to this discipline. Common data transmission utilizes unallocated slots when beaconing is in use; again, confirmations do not follow the same process.\n\nConfirmation messages may be optional under certain circumstances, in which case a success assumption is made. Whatever the case, if a device is unable to process a frame at a given time, it simply does not confirm its reception: [[Timeout (telecommunication)|timeout-based retransmission]] can be performed a number of times, following after that a decision of whether to abort or keep trying.\n\nBecause the predicted environment of these devices demands maximization of battery life, the protocols tend to favor the methods which lead to it, implementing periodic checks for pending messages, the frequency of which depends on application needs.\n\nRegarding secure communications, the MAC sublayer offers facilities which can be harnessed by upper layers to achieve the desired level of security. Higher-layer processes may specify keys to perform [[Symmetric key|symmetric cryptography]] to protect the payload and restrict it to a group of devices or just a point-to-point link; these groups of devices can be specified in [[access control list]]s. Furthermore, MAC computes ''freshness checks'' between successive receptions to ensure that presumably old frames, or data which is no longer considered valid, does not transcend to higher layers.\n\nIn addition to this secure mode, there is another, insecure MAC mode, which allows access control lists<ref name=\"Zigbee\" /> merely as a means to decide on the acceptance of frames according to their (presumed) source.\n\n==See also==\n* [[ANT (network)|ANT]]\n* [[Bluetooth]]\n* [[DASH7]]\n* [[EnOcean]]\n* [[INSTEON]]\n* [[NeuRFon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ieee802.org/15/pub/TG4.html 802.15.4 Task Group]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/802.15.html Get IEEE 802.15]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.15.4v-2017.html IEEE standard 802.15.4v-2017]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.15.4u-2016.html IEEE standard 802.15.4u-2016]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.15.4t-2017.html IEEE standard 802.15.4t-2017]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4q-2016.html IEEE standard 802.15.4q-2016]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4p-2014.html IEEE standard 802.15.4p-2014]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4n-2016.html IEEE standard 802.15.4n-2016]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4m-2014.html IEEE standard 802.15.4m-2014]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4k-2013.html IEEE standard 802.15.4k-2013]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4j-2013.html IEEE standard 802.15.4j-2013]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4g-2012.html IEEE standard 802.15.4g-2012]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4f-2012.html IEEE standard 802.15.4f-2012]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4e-2012.html IEEE standard 802.15.4e-2012]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4d-2009.html IEEE standard 802.15.4d-2009]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4c-2009.html IEEE standard 802.15.4c-2009]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4a-2007.html IEEE standard 802.15.4a-2007]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/802_15_4-2015.html IEEE standard 802.15.4-2015]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/802_15_4-2011.html IEEE standard 802.15.4-2011]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/802_15_4-2006.html IEEE standard 802.15.4-2006]\n* [https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/802_15_4-2003.html IEEE standard 802.15.4-2003]\n\n{{IEEE standards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ieee 802.15.4-2006}}\n[[Category:IEEE 802]]\n[[Category:Wireless networking standards]]\n", "name_user": "Lympu", "label": "safe", "comment": "added a link to 802.15.4z Task Group and Draft specification", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4"}

In this historic monument formerly it executed who violated the old laws. It is located on a base of three steps, it is a cylindrical roll with approximately 3.5 meters high, led by four holes, one for each side.\n*Plaza Mayor (Main square), It is the central element of the town, there include the following buildings:\n\n- On one side is the Town Hall, 16th century [[Renaissance]] building, this is attributed to the Italian architect Andrea Roddi.\n\n- The old Granary, built in 15th-16th centuries, next to Town Hall and today is a Medical Center.\n\n- Stands the Torre del Reloj (Clock Tower), vestige of the medieval headquarters building of the primitive Town Hall, of three floors.\n\n- Also here is the Posada Mass\u00f3, Renaissance style, which is one of the best examples of typical Castilian inn, that occupied for years both travelers and outsiders who came to work or to stay in the town. The building and its wooden deck are of the 16th century. Also has portals in brick and keystone marked with hollow rectangular frame.\n\n- In the same square, in front of the Town Hall, is the Villa Enriqueta, a [[Neo-Mud\u00e9jar]] palatial house of 19th century. The building, which according to the inscription on the facade dates from 1899 and is named as Villa Enriqueta, was commissioned by Jes\u00fas Casanova for use as his private residence. And if at first it was a palace, then it became a military hospital during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and is now owned by several families whose homes are situated around a central courtyard. Factory made in brick of two colors placed mostly decoratively creating cruciform, floral motifs, etc., decorating the crenellated shot on the cover of lower volume of the building, the arches of the five balconies on the first floor and of the ten wickets paired in the second. Also of brick, the volume that tops the building, rectangular as a covered hipped tower, seems to be a kind of gallery or covered corridor whose walls are pierced by windows arches and under midpoint arches.\n\n- In the square also is a 20th-century [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] Barracks House.\n*Bas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n, built in 15th century with the stones of the [[Moorish]] castle stood here and that remains only some towers of the wall around it and looking the near river. What see today is a reconstruction of it made in the 16th century, with the stones of the walls of the former castle, but lower than that of the primitive castle. The bell tower of the church is topped by a pinnacle. In its normal access to it, see the primitive cour d'honneur of the castle in access by the compass of the basilica. The main entrance of the basilica is a big [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] portal of 17th-18th centuries. Inside the Basilica presents a wide 16th century main nave, with rib vaults and a 17th-century [[Baroque]] altarpiece of presiding over the high altar, presided over by a replica carving of the Assumption, the original image of this virgin possibly was of 17th century and was burned during the Spanish Civil War. The basilica has an 18th-century [[Rococo]] chapel, that of the Virgin of the Rosary, of Greek cross, of highly decorated dome and reredos, and beautiful murals on the sides. In the main nave has a 17th-century pulpit. It also has a 16th-century christ sculpture Cristo de las Llagas. Also it highlights a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cover of a small chapel, and a 16th-century reredos that can see on one side of the nave with St. Martin of Tours and the Coronation of the Virgin. The basilica has its museum Museo de la Sacrist\u00eda.\n*Iglesia del Carmen, some years after the visit of Teresa of \u00c1vila, the Discalced Carmelites Friars who were in [[La Roda]] came over here and founded a convent that now only remains this church. The building is a single nave with a Latin cross and semicircular dome. In one of the chapels (not been able to locate) was buried the anchorite Catherine of Cardona. The building built in 1587 is likely to be by some disciple of Juan G\u00f3mez de Mora or Friar Alberto de la Madre de Dios, simple facade with belfry in a side and simple interior of its main nave, with a dome, and whose high altar is a simple reredos, in whose center is the virgin Virgen de las Nieves patron of the town's Catholics, a 14th-century Gothic image sitting on an armless chair with a knob on the right hand and holding on her left to her Child. The church has an 18th-century pulpit.\n*Convento de las Carmelitas, It was founded by St. [[Teresa of \u00c1vila]] in 1580. It consists of church, convent and cloister.

In this historic monument formerly it executed who violated the old laws. It is located on a base of three steps, it is a cylindrical roll with approximately 3.5 meters high, led by four holes, one for each side.\n*Plaza Mayor (Main square), It is the central element of the town, there include the following buildings:\n\n- On one side is the Town Hall, 16th century [[Renaissance]] building, this is attributed to the Italian architect Andrea Roddi.\n\n- The old Granary, built in 15th-16th centuries, next to Town Hall and today is a Medical Center.\n\n- Stands the Torre del Reloj (Clock Tower), vestige of the medieval headquarters building of the primitive Town Hall, of three floors.\n\n- Also here is the Posada Mass\u00f3, Renaissance style, which is one of the best examples of typical Castilian inn, that occupied for years both travelers and outsiders who came to work or to stay in the town. The building and its wooden deck are of the 16th century. Also has portals in brick and keystone marked with hollow rectangular frame.\n\n- In the same square, in front of the Town Hall, is the Villa Enriqueta, a [[Neo-Mud\u00e9jar]] palatial house of 19th century. The building, which according to the inscription on the facade dates from 1899 and is named as Villa Enriqueta, was commissioned by Jes\u00fas Casanova for use as his private residence. And if at first it was a palace, then it became a military hospital during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and is now owned by several families whose homes are situated around a central courtyard. Factory made in brick of two colors placed mostly decoratively creating cruciform, floral motifs, etc., decorating the crenellated shot on the cover of lower volume of the building, the arches of the five balconies on the first floor and of the ten wickets paired in the second. Also of brick, the volume that tops the building, rectangular as a covered hipped tower, seems to be a kind of gallery or covered corridor whose walls are pierced by windows arches and under midpoint arches.\n\n- In the square also is a 20th-century [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] Barracks House.\n*Bas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n, built in 15th century with the stones of the [[Moorish]] castle stood here and that remains only some towers of the wall around it and looking the near river. What see today is a reconstruction of it made in the 16th century, with the stones of the walls of the former castle, but lower than that of the primitive castle. The bell tower of the church is topped by a pinnacle. In its normal access to it, see the primitive cour d'honneur of the castle in access by the compass of the basilica. The main entrance of the basilica is a big [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] portal of 17th-18th centuries. Inside the Basilica presents a wide 16th century main nave, with rib vaults and a 17th-century [[Baroque]] altarpiece of presiding over the high altar, presided over by a replica carving of the Assumption, the original image of this virgin possibly was of 17th century and was burned during the Spanish Civil War. The basilica has an 18th-century [[Rococo]] chapel, that of the Virgin of the Rosary, of Greek cross, of highly decorated dome and reredos, and beautiful murals on the sides. In the main nave has a 17th-century pulpit. It also has a 16th-century christ sculpture Cristo de las Llagas. Also it highlights a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cover of a small chapel, and a 16th-century reredos that can see on one side of the nave with St. Martin of Tours and the Coronation of the Virgin. The basilica has its museum Museo de la Sacrist\u00eda.\n*Iglesia del Carmen, some years after the visit of Teresa of \u00c1vila, the Discalced Carmelites Friars who were in [[La Roda]] came over here and founded a convent that now only remains this church. The building is a single nave with a Latin cross and semicircular dome. In one of the chapels (not been able to locate) was buried the anchorite Catherine of Cardona. The building built in 1587 is likely to be by some disciple of Juan G\u00f3mez de Mora or Friar Alberto de la Madre de Dios, simple facade with belfry in a side and simple interior of its main nave, with a dome, and whose high altar is a simple reredos, in whose center is the virgin Virgen de las Nieves patron of the town's Catholics, a 14th-century Gothic image sitting on an armless chair with a knob on the right hand and holding on her left to her Child. The church has an 18th-century pulpit.\n*Convento de las Carmelitas, It was founded by St. [[Teresa of \u00c1vila]] in 1580. It consists of church, convent and cloister. It is an isolated building that is a whole town block and surrounded by walls. Inside are 17th century paintings of the reredos and a [[Mud\u00e9jar]] wooden roof that covers the presbytery forming a star with 32 points.

His later efforts were directed chiefly against the [[Jesuit]]s; indeed he was in general a vigorous opponent of [[Roman Catholic]]ism.\n\nEverywhere, in America and Britain, he attracted great crowds to hear and see him, and he was often persecuted as well as admired. Because the churches were closed to him, Lorenzo Dow preached in town halls, farmers' barns, and even in open fields. He would preach anyplace where he could assemble a crowd. He preached to Methodists, Baptists, Quakers, Catholics, and atheists alike. He liked to appear unexpectedly at public events, announcing in a loud voice that exactly one year from today, Lorenzo Dow would preach on this spot. He never disappointed his audiences; he always appeared exactly 365 days later at the appointed place, usually met by huge crowds.\n\nDow's public speaking mannerisms were like nothing ever seen before among the typically conservative church goers of the time. He shouted, he screamed, he cried, he begged, he flattered, he insulted, he challenged people and their beliefs. He told stories and made jokes. It is recorded that Lorenzo Dow often preached before open-air assemblies of 10,000 people or more and held the audiences spellbound.\n\n== Traveling preacher ==\n[[File:Peggy Dow, aged 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Peggy Dow, aged 35]]\nDow's fame spread, and so did his travels. He traveled on foot and occasionally on horseback (when someone would donate a horse) sometimes accompanied by his wife, Peggy Dow throughout what was then the United States. His journeys took him to Canada, England and Ireland, and once to the West Indies. He was usually well-received although there were exceptions. A fierce [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], Dow's sermons were often unpopular in the southern United States, and he frequently was threatened with personal violence. He sometimes was forcibly ejected from towns, pelted with stones, eggs, and rotten vegetables as it happened in Jacksonborough, Georgia around 1820.<ref>[http://georgiamysteries.blogspot.com/2008/04/jacksonborough-curse.html?m=1], ''Touring the Backroads of North and South Georgia''</ref> That never stopped him; he simply walked to the next town and gave the same sermon again.\n\nLorenzo Dow was personally unkempt. He did not practice personal hygiene and his long hair and beard were described as \"never having met a comb.\" He usually owned one set of clothes: those that were on his back. When those clothes became so badly worn and full of holes that they were no longer capable of covering him, some person in the audience usually would donate a replacement. The donated clothes often were not the correct size for his skinny body. When he traveled, he carried no luggage other than a box of Bibles to be given away. Throughout most of his life, what little money he ever collected was either given away to the poor or used to purchase Bibles. In his later years, he did accumulate a bit of money from the sales of his autobiography and religious writings. His singularities of manner and of dress excited prejudices against him, and counteracted the effect of his eloquence. Nevertheless, he is said to have preached to more persons than any man of his time.<ref>{{cite Appletons'|title=DOW, Lorenzo |volume=2 |year=1888 |page=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6coAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA218}}</ref>\n\nHe died in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown,]] in 1834 after illness being cared about by his friend George Haller, and had asked before passing away to use his old greatcoat as his winding sheet.

It is recorded that Lorenzo Dow often preached before open-air assemblies of 10,000 people or more and held the audiences spellbound.\n\n== Traveling preacher ==\n[[File:Peggy Dow, aged 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Peggy Dow, aged 35]]\nDow's fame spread, and so did his travels. He traveled on foot and occasionally on horseback (when someone would donate a horse) sometimes accompanied by his wife, Peggy Dow throughout what was then the United States. His journeys took him to Canada, England and Ireland, and once to the West Indies. He was usually well-received although there were exceptions. A fierce [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], Dow's sermons were often unpopular in the southern United States, and he frequently was threatened with personal violence. He sometimes was forcibly ejected from towns, pelted with stones, eggs, and rotten vegetables as it happened in Jacksonborough, Georgia around 1820.<ref>[http://georgiamysteries.blogspot.com/2008/04/jacksonborough-curse.html?m=1], ''Touring the Backroads of North and South Georgia''</ref> That never stopped him; he simply walked to the next town and gave the same sermon again.\n\nLorenzo Dow was personally unkempt. He did not practice personal hygiene and his long hair and beard were described as \"never having met a comb.\" He usually owned one set of clothes: those that were on his back. When those clothes became so badly worn and full of holes that they were no longer capable of covering him, some person in the audience usually would donate a replacement. The donated clothes often were not the correct size for his skinny body. When he traveled, he carried no luggage other than a box of Bibles to be given away. Throughout most of his life, what little money he ever collected was either given away to the poor or used to purchase Bibles. In his later years, he did accumulate a bit of money from the sales of his autobiography and religious writings. His singularities of manner and of dress excited prejudices against him, and counteracted the effect of his eloquence. Nevertheless, he is said to have preached to more persons than any man of his time.<ref>{{cite Appletons'|title=DOW, Lorenzo |volume=2 |year=1888 |page=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6coAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA218}}</ref>\n\nHe died in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown,]] in 1834 after illness being cared about by his friend George Haller, and had asked before passing away to use his old greatcoat as his winding sheet.

Set in the pre-[[British Invasion]] 1960s, the series tells the story of Nick Foley, a self-made millionaire who adopts six orphan girls. Each episode included musical scenes of hit songs from the era performed by the girls integrated into the plot (with the lyrics modified to provide commentary on the storyline).\n\n==Plot==\nNick Foley ([[Joseph Bologna]]), the millionaire owner of Foley's Frozen Foods, is a streetwise [[New Jersey]]-born businessman with a [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] lifestyle. In the [[television film|TV movie]] [[Television pilot|pilot]] which launched the series, Foley attempts to develop a family man image by bringing a group of six orphaned girls, who were featured in a newspaper story, saying that they refused to be separated from each other to live in the mansion in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]] where he lives with his [[butler]], John Clapper ([[Douglas Seale]]). Foley does this to seal a business deal and does not intend to keep the girls permanently, but Foley's plans change as he grows attached to the girls, and he ends up adopting them permanently.\n\nThe adjustment is huge on both sides, as the girls acquire a new father with no parenting experience.  Having spent the past few years in a rundown [[orphanage]], the girls suddenly find themselves in a life of luxury (hence the series' title). The series follows the trials and tribulations of the girls and a man who has previously never loved anyone but himself, and often struggles to cope with his new family.\n\nIn the pilot for the series, Foley takes in a group of six girls; however, Foley only adopted five of them for the remainder of the series' run: Rose, 17; Diane, 16;  Marva, 15; Patti, 14; and Mickey, 8. The sixth girl, Nina, appears only in the pilot (after the pilot was produced, it was decided that six children was too many for the series cast, so Nina was written out of the series as having been reunited with her birth mother).\n\nThe series differed from regular comedy-dramas in that the girls would frequently burst into song to help explain their feelings or move along the plot. Each episode therefore contained at least two musical scenes with covers of popular songs from the early 1960's with the lyrics changed to provide commentary on the storyline of the episode.\n\n==Reception==\nPromoted with the tagline, \"If you liked ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', you'll like ''Rags to Riches''\", ratings for the series were not strong enough for its Friday night time slot, and NBC canceled the show part way through its second season.<ref>{{cite news|title=''Rags'': Moderately Rich; NBC Rips Off ''Annie'', Hits Easy Street|last=Shales|first= Tom |date=1987-03-09|newspaper=The Washington Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McNeil|first=Alex|title=Total Television: The Comprehensive Guide to Programming from 1948 to the Present|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1996|isbn=0-14-024916-8|page=683}}</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n[[Mark Mueller]] wrote new comedic lyrics for existing hit songs from the '50s and early '60s that were featured in most episodes of both seasons of the show. He also wrote the lyrics to the show's theme song. Many of the songs used were not around yet during the time frame when the series takes place; 1961-63.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n! Actor !!

In the [[television film|TV movie]] [[Television pilot|pilot]] which launched the series, Foley attempts to develop a family man image by bringing a group of six orphaned girls, who were featured in a newspaper story, saying that they refused to be separated from each other to live in the mansion in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]] where he lives with his [[butler]], John Clapper ([[Douglas Seale]]). Foley does this to seal a business deal and does not intend to keep the girls permanently, but Foley's plans change as he grows attached to the girls, and he ends up adopting them permanently.\n\nThe adjustment is huge on both sides, as the girls acquire a new father with no parenting experience.  Having spent the past few years in a rundown [[orphanage]], the girls suddenly find themselves in a life of luxury (hence the series' title). The series follows the trials and tribulations of the girls and a man who has previously never loved anyone but himself, and often struggles to cope with his new family.\n\nIn the pilot for the series, Foley takes in a group of six girls; however, Foley only adopted five of them for the remainder of the series' run: Rose, 17; Diane, 16;  Marva, 15; Patti, 14; and Mickey, 8. The sixth girl, Nina, appears only in the pilot (after the pilot was produced, it was decided that six children was too many for the series cast, so Nina was written out of the series as having been reunited with her birth mother).\n\nThe series differed from regular comedy-dramas in that the girls would frequently burst into song to help explain their feelings or move along the plot. Each episode therefore contained at least two musical scenes with covers of popular songs from the early 1960's with the lyrics changed to provide commentary on the storyline of the episode.\n\n==Reception==\nPromoted with the tagline, \"If you liked ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', you'll like ''Rags to Riches''\", ratings for the series were not strong enough for its Friday night time slot, and NBC canceled the show part way through its second season.<ref>{{cite news|title=''Rags'': Moderately Rich; NBC Rips Off ''Annie'', Hits Easy Street|last=Shales|first= Tom |date=1987-03-09|newspaper=The Washington Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McNeil|first=Alex|title=Total Television: The Comprehensive Guide to Programming from 1948 to the Present|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1996|isbn=0-14-024916-8|page=683}}</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n[[Mark Mueller]] wrote new comedic lyrics for existing hit songs from the '50s and early '60s that were featured in most episodes of both seasons of the show. He also wrote the lyrics to the show's theme song. Many of the songs used were not around yet during the time frame when the series takes place; 1961-63.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n! Actor !!

Characterized by authorities in the 19th century as a [[slum]], it was the home of refugees from the European [[Revolutions of 1848]], the [[Irish Potato Famine]], the [[Underground Railroad]], and then refugees from Russia and Eastern Europe. It was the centre of the city's [[Jew]]ish community from the late 19th century until the 1920s when the Jewish community moved west to [[Spadina Avenue]] and [[Kensington Market]] and was also, until the late 1950s, the home of the city's original [[Chinatown, Toronto#First Chinatown|Chinatown]], of many of the city's original [[Black Canadians|Black]] residents centred on the [[British Methodist Episcopal Church]], at 94 Chestnut Street, and of the city's Italian community until it moved west along College Street to [[Little Italy, Toronto|Little Italy]].

At the throwing mark the arm is snapped forward by arching the back and shoulders, releasing the bowl underhand before stepping over the mark.\n\nIn the Southern or [[County Cork]] style, as the thrower runs to the mark the arm and bowl are lifted up and back, then whirled downward into an underhand throw, releasing the bowl before stepping over the mark.\n\nWherever the bowl stops (not where it leaves the road surface), a [[chalk]] mark is made at the nearest point on the road and the next throw is taken from behind that mark.\n\nOver tight curves, or corners where two roads meet, the bowl may be thrown through the air (lofted). The loft must strike the road or pass over it. If the loft fails to reach the road, it counts as one shot, and the next throw must be taken again from the same mark.\n\n==History==\nFintan Lane, in his book ''Long Bullets: A History of Road Bowling in Ireland'', traces the sport to the 17th century and suggests that it was once far more widespread than it is today.<ref name=\"lane2005\"/> Until the 19th century, the game was also played in Scotland, the north of England and in North America.<ref name=\"lane2005\"/>  In the past, players were given twenty shots (a score) each, the winner determined by who went the greatest distance.

At the throwing mark the arm is snapped forward by arching the back and shoulders, releasing the bowl underhand before stepping over the mark.\n\nIn the Southern or [[County Cork]] style, as the thrower runs to the mark the arm and bowl are lifted up and back, then whirled downward into an underhand throw, releasing the bowl before stepping over the mark.\n\nWherever the bowl stops (not where it leaves the road surface), a [[chalk]] mark is made at the nearest point on the road and the next throw is taken from behind that mark.\n\nOver tight curves, or corners where two roads meet, the bowl may be thrown through the air (lofted). The loft must strike the road or pass over it. If the loft fails to reach the road, it counts as one shot, and the next throw must be taken again from the same mark.\n\n==History==\nFintan Lane, in his book ''Long Bullets: A History of Road Bowling in Ireland'', traces the sport to the 17th century and suggests that it was once far more widespread than it is today.<ref name=\"lane2005\"/> Until the 19th century, the game was also played in Scotland, the north of England and in North America.<ref name=\"lane2005\"/>  In the past, players were given twenty shots (a score) each, the winner determined by who went the greatest distance. Though the modern game is a fixed distance in fewest shots, the expression \"score\" for a match survives.
