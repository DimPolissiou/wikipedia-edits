The revue caught the attention of [[Granada Television]], who, keen to replicate the success of the BBC's ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'', hired Fry, Laurie and Thompson to star alongside [[Ben Elton]] in ''[[There's Nothing to Worry About!]]''. A second series, retitled ''[[Alfresco (TV series)|Alfresco]]'', was broadcast in 1983, and a third in 1984; it established Fry and Laurie's reputation as a comedy double act. In 1983, the BBC offered Fry, Laurie and Thompson their own show, which became ''[[The Crystal Cube]]'', a mixture of science fiction and [[mockumentary]] that was cancelled after the first episode. Undeterred, Fry and Laurie appeared in an episode of ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' in 1984, and Fry also appeared in Ben Elton's 1985 ''[[Happy Families (1985 TV series)|Happy Families]]'' series.
